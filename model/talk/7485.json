And when the time came to pay the ultimate sacrifice entailed in the Atonement, Christ shrank not to partake of the bitter cup but submitted completely to His Father\u2019s will.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/a-broken-heart-and-a-contrite-spirit.p18\" class=\"\">The Savior\u2019s perfect submission to the Eternal Father is the very essence of a broken heart and a contrite spirit. Christ\u2019s example teaches us that a broken heart is an eternal attribute of godliness. When our hearts are broken, we are completely open to the Spirit of God and recognize our dependence on Him for all that we have and all that we are. The sacrifice so entailed is a sacrifice of pride in all its forms. Like malleable clay in the hands of a skilled potter, the brokenhearted can be molded and shaped in the hands of the Master.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/a-broken-heart-and-a-contrite-spirit.p19\" class=\"\">A broken heart and a contrite spirit are also preconditions to repentance.

This comes when our desire to be cleansed from sin is so consuming that our hearts ache with sorrow and we yearn to feel at peace with our Father in Heaven. Those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit are willing to do anything and everything that God asks of them, without resistance or resentment. We cease doing things our way and learn to do them God\u2019s way instead. In such a condition of submissiveness, the Atonement can take effect and true repentance can occur. The penitent will then experience the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost, which will fill them with peace of conscience and the joy of reconciliation with God. In a wondrous union of divine attributes, the same God who teaches us to walk with a broken heart invites us to rejoice and to be of good cheer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/a-broken-heart-and-a-contrite-spirit.p23\" class=\"\">When we have received a forgiveness of sins, a broken heart serves as a divine shield against temptation.
