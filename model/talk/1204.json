Moyle, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1962, pp. 90-93<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nBrethren, it is good to be here. When we are in the Church, and members of it, we belong to\nthe body of Christ, and there is no need for us to go outside of it for anything in the world. I\nthink that is just what President Brown has said in more forceful language.\n<\/p><p>\n\"We have no need to dabble in the things of the world; we have no need to join other\norganizations, that are antagonistic to or out of harmony with this Church . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"We will serve the Lord! Let the dying world go to its grave if it will. Let the wicked that are\nbeing bound in bundles go to the burning if they will not repent, but as for us, we, with all\nwe are and with all we have, should be in this Church in body and in spirit in every capacity,\nand there should be no need and no desire on our part to go outside of the strait and narrow\nway, the only way which leads to the presence of the Eternal Father and to the gift of eternal\nlife . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"We have no need of anything else. In the troubles that are coming&mdash;for the world is\nmenaced now with troubles and strife and division which will bring misery and sorrow and\ndestruction to many souls&mdash;let our place be in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints, in the order of the Holy Priesthood, and we have no need to join other orders to take\naway part of our time, part of our influence, and part of our means and to hinder us from\ndevoting ourselves entirely to the work of the Lord . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"Oh, my brethren and sisters, why waste your time, your talents, your means, your influence\nin following something that will perish and pass away, when you could devote yourselves to a\nthing that will stand forever? For this Church and kingdom, to which you belong, will abide\nand continue in time, in eternity, while endless ages roll along, and you with it will become\nmightier and more powerful, while the things of this world will pass away and perish, and\nwill not abide in nor after the resurrection, saith the Lord our God.\" (Pres. Charles W.\nPenrose, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, June 1919, pp. 36-37.)\n<\/p><p>\nIn the payment of our tithes and our offerings we have an opportunity to show better than in\nany other way our devotion to God, our desire to help in the building of his Church and\nkingdom here upon this earth and to thus testify most emphatically to the truth. We will\nbecome mightier and more powerful in our own right in direct proportion to the service and\ncontribution we make to strengthen the Church. I further bear witness to the fact that we\nconsider the things of this world of no lasting concern, for we know that they will pass away\nand perish, and as President Penrose says, \"will not abide in nor after the resurrection.\" The\nSavior said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where\nthieves break through and steal: \n<\/p><p>\n\"But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust\ndoth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35166\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35166)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35166)\">Matt. 6:19-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the record we have of Christ's Sermon on the Mount, we, no doubt, come closer to finding\nthe actual teachings of Christ expressed as accurately, if not more accurately, than in any\nother place in the whole Bible. \"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35167\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35167)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35167)\">Matt. 6:21<\/a><\/span>)\nshould be inscribed on our banner as we march forward as an army to call the\nworld to repentance and to teach them faith in God and in his son Jesus Christ and obedience\nto the principles of light and knowledge and understanding restored to the earth through the\nProphet Joseph Smith in these latter days.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior said: \"Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and\nshall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall\ndo and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35160\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35160)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35160)\">Matt. 5:19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land. And again it\nis said that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from the\npresence of the Lord\" (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"9019\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9019)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9019)\">Alma 9:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo the extent that it is my prerogative so to do, I charge all who hold the priesthood in the\nChurch not only to pay their tithing but also to be diligent in preaching the law of tithing to\nthe membership of the Church. We cannot teach effectively that which we do not live, or\nputting it in other words, our example is far more powerful than our precept.\n<\/p><p>\nIn 1961 there were added to the Church 88,802 converts baptized in the stakes and foreign\nmissions. This unprecedented growth demands an unprecedented expenditure in the year 1962.\nWe are under obligation to the Lord to make the full program of the Church available to all\nthese converts as near as possible, that they might be fully fellowshipped in the Church. How\ncould the Lord demonstrate to us his desire to have us do our part more forcibly or more\neffectively than to turn the hearts of the children of men in the world to the eternal truths of\nthe gospel promulgated by our great missionary force of upwards of 11,000 missionaries,\nscattered in sixty-four missions in the world?\n<\/p><p>\nYou will remember two years ago we suggested at our Saturday night priesthood meeting that\nwe might well double the 6,000 full-time missionaries whom we then had in the mission field.\nWe want to commend you brethren on having almost fully satisfied this request. We express\nto you brethren throughout the Church your right and prerogative to be happy as we are\nhappy, with the results which you have accomplished in your wards and stakes and missions\nand branches throughout the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a definite tendency in the Church to increase the tithes as missionary activity is\nincreased. These are complementary responsibilities. It is axiomatic that the more we do for\nthe Church the greater is our desire and our capacity and capability. The time when it was\nnecessary to explain the whys and wherefores of tithing, if it ever existed, is long since past.\nThere is planted in the heart of every convert to the Church and to everyone born in the\nChurch into homes where the gospel is lived and taught, a knowledge of the place that the\npayment of tithes should take in our lives.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us go forward and demonstrate to the Lord our ability to take care of as many converts\nyear by year as are touched by his Spirit and thus spiritually converted to the truths of the\ngospel.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the 119th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, as you know, the Lord tells us that the\npurpose of tithing is \"For the building of mine house, and for the laying of the foundation of\nZion and for the priesthood, and for the debts of the Presidency of my Church\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14211\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14211)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14211)\">D&amp;C 119:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI want to take this opportunity of stating to the priesthood of the Church that this is exactly\nthe use to which the entire tithes of the Church are put. There is no tithepayer upon the earth\nthat need be seriously concerned with what happens to his tithing. The tithes of the Church\nare distributed for the building of houses of worship, for the building and\nmaintenance of temples, for the maintenance of missions, wards, and stakes, genealogical work,\nschools, institutes and seminaries, hospitals, care of the needy, the expense and maintenance of\nthe presiding quorums of the priesthood, the housing of the general boards of the auxiliary\norganizations, and in every other way laying the foundation of Zion. Be it said to the credit of\nthe auxiliary organizations they pretty well take care of all of their own expenses. Those of us\nwho are charged with the responsibility of distributing the tithes and income of the Church\npay our own tithes to the Lord in full, as well as make our contributions to fast offerings,\nbuilding funds, and support missionary work and the auxiliary organizations, etc., financially\nas well as otherwise, and do so with continually increased enthusiasm and satisfaction.\n<\/p><p>\nWe know that there are some errors and some mistakes. Where we administer the Lord's\nwork and seek to bring about his purposes on the earth, I can guarantee to the membership of\nthe Church, that there is never a conscious error or mistake made. I cannot conceive of greater\nsecurity than to have these matters pass through the hands of the committee on the disposition\nof the tithes, consisting of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presiding\nBishopric. The Lord has conferred upon these quorums of the priesthood, the Quorum of The\nFirst Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Quorum of the Presiding Bishopric to\ndistribute the tithes and income of the Church, and this they do unanimously, and the Lord\nadds, \". . . and by mine own voice . . . Verily, thus saith the Lord, the time is now come, that\nit shall be disposed of by a council, composed of the First Presidency of my Church, and of\nthe bishop and his council, and by my high council; and by mine own voice unto them, saith\nthe Lord. Even so.

In the course of the reformation by Hezekiah, the people\nmanifested their repentance by an immediate payment of tithes; and so liberally did they give\nthat a great surplus accumulated, observing which, Hezekiah inquired as to the source of such\nplenty: 'And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the\npeople began to bring the offerings into the house of the Lord, we have had enough to eat,\nand have left plenty: for the Lord hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great\nstore' (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2941\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2941)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2941)\">2 Chr. 31:10<\/a><\/span>).\nNehemiah took care to regulate the procedure in tithe-paying\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41068\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41068)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41068)\">Neh. 10:37-38<\/a><\/span>); and both Amos\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10422\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10422)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10422)\">Amos 4:4<\/a><\/span>) and\nMalachi admonished the people because of their neglect of this duty. Through the prophet last\nnamed, the Lord charged the people with having robbed him; but promised them blessings\nbeyond their capacity to receive if they would return to their allegiance: 'Will a man rob\nGod? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and\nofferings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. Bring\nye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now\nherewith, said the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you\nout a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it'\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32772\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32772)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32772)\">Mal. 3:8-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"In the present dispensation the law of tithing has been given a place of great importance, and\nparticular blessings have been promised for its faithful observance. This day has been called\nby the Lord a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people; for he that is tithed\nshall not be burned (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14145\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14145)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14145)\">D&amp;C 64:23<\/a><\/span>).\nIn a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, July 8, 1838, the\nLord has explicitly set forth His requirement of the people in this matter.\" (<i>Articles of Faith<\/i>,\nchapter 24, pp. 436-437.)\n<\/p><p>\nElder Talmage brings to our attention that once upon a time the main concern of the house of\nIsrael was to have plenty in store to eat. It is stimulating and inspiring to think back on the\ntremendous change in the lives of the membership of the Church as the Lord\nhas blessed us and raised us up from the former days of dire poverty and distress, when every\nservice the Saints rendered was a tremendous sacrifice compared with the prosperity and the\nfree time we now enjoy to spend as we see fit. I am sure it can be truthfully said that it\nentails no serious case of sacrifice for us to do and accomplish all that the Lord would have\nus do today.\n<\/p><p>\nWe all know that the Lord has in very deed \"opened up the windows of heaven and poured\nout a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive everything the Lord would have\nit do\" (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32773\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32773)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32773)\">Mal. 3:10<\/a><\/span>).\nThe priesthood of the Church must do its part so that even in the\ndays of prosperity we may humble ourselves in our service to the Lord and our fellow men.\nThis is the only insurance we have against permitting our riches to canker our souls, and to\nhave it said of us, \"The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14130\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14130)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14130)\">D&amp;C 56:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI commend to the priesthood of the Church the reading of the 56th\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14129\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14129)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14129)\">D&amp;C 56:1-20<\/a><\/span>) and 104th sections\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14200\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14200)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14200)\">D&amp;C 104:1-86<\/a><\/span>) of the\nDoctrine and Covenants. Therein we find the greatest insurance policy known to man. Our\npayment of the premium on this policy works no hardship upon any of us. With its payment\nour eternal salvation and exaltation is all but assured.\n<\/p><p>\nFor fear I didn't say it as emphatically as I desired to in the beginning, I want to say that\nevery day, every week, every month, every year increase the enthusiasm of these brethren\nwho are charged with the responsibility to pay their own tithing, and constantly to increase\ntheir contributions to the Church because of the consciousness they have of the direction\nwhich comes from God in performing this most sacred trust.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us, my brethren, that we might go forth from this conference tonight and bring into\nthe storehouse of the Lord the means by which this Church can grow and develop and serve\nall of the righteous people of the world who are touched by the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, the\npower of the Holy Ghost, and submit themselves to baptism by immersion for the remission\nof sins, and by the laying upon of hands to receive the Holy Ghost, I pray in the name of\nJesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
