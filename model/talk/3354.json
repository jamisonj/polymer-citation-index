This I have always been pleased to do when possible, and so I have united in the holy bonds of matrimony many couples\u2014some civil marriages for this life only before I became a General Authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and some marriages in the temple of God for time and for all eternity.

All young people should consider very carefully and prayerfully the kind of mate they would like to have for eternity and for the father or mother of their children. Parents have a responsibility to teach their children the importance of keeping themselves clean and pure, with high moral standards, so they will be worthy of the kind of men and women with whom they want to associate and marry.

They should never retire at night with any differences between them. As they kneel together in prayer and ask the Lord to bless them and help them overcome their difficulties, the sweet spirit of forgiveness will come into their hearts, and they will forgive one another as they ask the Lord to forgive them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/celestial-marriages-and-eternal-families.p42\" class=\"\">Fourth, and very important, I remind them to continue to love one another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/celestial-marriages-and-eternal-families.p43\" class=\"\">I tell them too that marriage is not a fifty-fifty proposition.

They must keep private matters confidential, and I advise them to solve their own problems without interference from family or friends.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/celestial-marriages-and-eternal-families.p44\" class=\"\">Sometimes young people do not have the patience to wait for material comforts and luxuries which they may not be able to afford. Wanting too much too soon can be a hardship on both husband and wife, and financial burdens brought on by careless management are often a source of contention. It is far more important to build an atmosphere of love and harmony and spirituality in the home than to concentrate on material possessions which can be accumulated in time as financial ability permits.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/celestial-marriages-and-eternal-families.p45\" class=\"\">Into this happy home and pleasant atmosphere will eventually come the children for which the marriage was consummated, and who will add immeasurably to the joy and fulfillment which God the Father intended when he instructed Adam and Eve to multiply and replenish the earth [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"23942\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23942)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23942)\">Gen. 1:28<\/a><\/span>].
