What followed Joseph Smith\u2019s prayer in the spring of 1820 irrevocably illuminated our view of God, ourselves, others, life, even the universe! A young boy in a small grove of trees began receiving answers to mankind\u2019s oldest and largest questions! But young Joseph certainly did not go into the Sacred Grove seeking the restoration of the holy priesthood and the holy endowment, the sealing power, and all the keys thereof. He did not even know of their existence! He merely wanted to know which of several churches to join. His prayer was for personal and tactical guidance. The response, however, was of global and eternal significance!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/my-servant-joseph.p6\" class=\"\">Would Joseph have gone into the grove, brethren, if he had known beforehand the unceasing persecution which would soon engulf him and finally cause his martyrdom?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/my-servant-joseph.p7\" class=\"\">Courage is one of Joseph Smith\u2019s special qualities. Without it, he would have shrunk from carrying out his remarkable role. At about age seven, he had a gravely infected leg. Amputation seemed inevitable. He refused alcoholic anesthetics when his leg bones were surgically and painfully treated in a new technique. By the way, that thoughtful little boy asked his mother to leave the room so she wouldn\u2019t have to witness his suffering.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/my-servant-joseph.p8\" class=\"\">For Joseph\u2019s ailment, the best medical help available in America was surprisingly just a few miles away: Dr. Nathan Smith, founder of Dartmouth\u2019s medical school and the experienced pioneer of this advanced technique (see Le Roy S. Wirthlin, \u201cJoseph Smith\u2019s Boyhood Operation: An 1813 Surgical Success,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Brigham Young University Studies, <\/span> vol. 21, Spring 1981, no. 2, pp. 131\u201354; see also <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign, <\/span>Mar. 1978, pp. 59\u201360.) He led the team who saved Joseph\u2019s leg, including for the grueling march of Zion\u2019s Camp.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/my-servant-joseph.p9\" class=\"\">Joseph often displayed courage, as one beneficiary later reported: \u201cSickness and fright had robbed me of strength. Joseph had to decide w[he]ther to leave me to be captured by the mob or endanger himself by rendering aid. Choosing the latter course, he lifted me upon his own broad shoulders and bore me with occasional rests through the swamp and darkness. Several hours later we emerged upon the lonely road and soon reached safety. Joseph\u2019s \u2026 strength permitted him to \u2026 [save] my life.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">New Era, <\/span>Dec. 1973, p. 19.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/my-servant-joseph.p10\" class=\"\">Joseph\u2019s courage was matched by his willingness to be tutored. The Restoration, which occurred \u201cin process of time,\u201d so required. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"39822\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39822)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39822)\">Moses 7:21<\/a><\/span>.) After a glorious visitation, there would be laborious implementation. For instance, the bestowal of the golden plates, history\u2019s most stunning \u201cfind\u201d in the field of religion, was followed by painstaking translation. The keys of the holy apostleship were dramatically restored, but well before the sifting march of Zion\u2019s Camp and the subsequent calling of the Twelve. Elijah\u2019s very significant visit came well before either the people or temples were prepared to enjoy the restored sealing power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/my-servant-joseph.p11\" class=\"\">Yes, Joseph received remarkable manifestations, along with constant vexations. True, for instance, there were periodic arrivals of heavenly messengers, but these were punctuated by the periodic arrivals of earthly mobs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/my-servant-joseph.p12\" class=\"\">While Joseph was befriended by heavenly notables, he was also betrayed by some of his earthly friends. Receiving keys and gifts was real, but so was the painful loss of six of the eleven children born to him and Emma. Granted, Joseph had revealed to him glimpses of far horizons\u2014the first and third estates. But these periodic glories occurred amid Joseph\u2019s arduous, daily life in the second estate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/my-servant-joseph.p13\" class=\"\">Consecrated Joseph gave so much, yet often so little was returned. President Brigham Young lamented, \u201cThere was confidence due from his brethren to Joseph which he did not receive. In his death they learned a profitable lesson, and afterwards felt that if he could only be restored to them how obedient they would be to his counsels.\u201d (In <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses, <\/span>10:222.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/my-servant-joseph.p14\" class=\"\">I recall reading years ago that, during severe apostasy in Kirtland, Joseph shook someone\u2019s hand for what seemed to be a long time. Discerningly, the Prophet then said he was glad to know that individual was his friend because he had so few of them in those days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/my-servant-joseph.p15\" class=\"\">Joseph was a seer.

Depending upon his sequence of translation, scholars estimate Joseph in 1829 was translating at a rapid daily equivalent of from eight to thirteen of today\u2019s printed pages. (See John W. Welch and Tim Rathbone, \u201cThe Translation of the Book of Mormon: Basic Historical Information,\u201d Preliminary Report, F.A.R.M.S., Provo, Utah, 1986, pp. 38\u201339.)

Holland has calculated!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/my-servant-joseph.p18\" class=\"\">Joseph, the revelator. He also became an articulator. President Young said the Prophet Joseph had the \u201chappy faculty\u201d of communicating things \u201coften in a single sentence throwing \u2026 light into the gloom of [the] ages \u2026 in one blending flood of heavenly intelligence.\u201d (Brigham Young, in <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses, <\/span>9:310.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/my-servant-joseph.p19\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith lit up life\u2019s landscape, brethren, so that we can see \u201cthings as they really are, and \u2026 really will be.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25969\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25969)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25969)\">Jacob 4:13<\/a><\/span>.)

Hence, Christianity did not begin with Jesus\u2019 mortal Messiahship in the meridian of time in Jerusalem! The diffusion which followed Adam naturally resulted in some similarities in various religions. Therefore, as President Joseph F.
