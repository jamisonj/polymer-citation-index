Early one morning, the gauchos brought forty horses into a corral to select their mounts for the day. Gauchos are like cowboys in the United States. Each gaucho went into the corral and whistled softly like this [whistling]. This established their presence. When the horses heard the soft whistling, they lined up quickly near the fence, facing the gauchos. The horses held their heads high, kept their eyes constantly on their masters, and kept their ears forward in an alert, receptive stance. They gave complete attention and appeared to be anxious to serve. They quickly organized themselves into a line as if for a full military dress inspection or review. The gauchos stepped back out of the way and whistled again. The horses circled quickly to the other side of the corral and lined up facing the gauchos. They looked as if a drill sergeant had called them to attention. Each gaucho chose his mount for the day\u2019s work and walked up to the horse he had selected.

I loved to play football in high school and at the university. I wanted to be a good athlete. I especially remember one game. Our university team faced the University of Colorado in a contest for the conference championship. We were well coached and really well prepared.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/live-in-obedience.p27\" class=\"\">The star of the Colorado team was Byron \u201cWhizzer\u201d White, an all-American who was a tremendous athlete. He was a fast, versatile, and powerful quarterback. His athletic prowess was legendary. His scholastic abilities were equally impressive. He later became a Rhodes scholar and retired recently as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/live-in-obedience.p28\" class=\"\">Our wise coach was Ike Armstrong. His warnings before the game included two simple instructions: one, do not kick off or punt the ball to Whizzer White, and two, never let him get past the line of scrimmage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/live-in-obedience.p29\" class=\"\">We followed his instructions and held Colorado scoreless throughout the first half. Early in the second half, however, Whizzer White kicked a field goal. We answered with a touchdown and kicked the extra point. We were ahead seven to three at the end of the third quarter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/live-in-obedience.p30\" class=\"\">On the second play of the fourth quarter, we punted. The ball sailed deep into the corner of the field, near their end zone. Whizzer White plucked the tumbling ball out of the air at his fifteen-yard line and dropped back to his five-yard line to evade the first of our tacklers. Then with the speed, strength, and agility that had built his reputation, he started upfield and sidestepped every player of our team. I managed only to touch him with my little finger. He ran the entire length of the field for a touchdown\u2014thrilling for Colorado, but disappointing for us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/live-in-obedience.p31\" class=\"\">Later in the fourth quarter, Whizzer dashed around his own right end and beyond the line of scrimmage and ran fifty-seven yards for another touchdown.

Failure to obey our coach\u2019s two pregame warnings for just two plays\u2014two brief lapses in an otherwise outstanding effort\u2014cost us the game and the conference championship.
