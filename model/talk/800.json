Hunter, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1955, pp. 64-68<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brethren and sisters: I humbly pray that I shall be guided by the Spirit of the Lord in\nthe brief remarks that I make this afternoon.\n<\/p><p>\nI hold here in my hand what I consider to be three of the most valuable treasures in the\nworld.  From a monetary standpoint, they are beyond price. If all of the people in the world\nwould make complete application of what these three treasures contain, utilizing them to the\nfullest, I believe their contents would do more good for the human family than do all the\narmies in the world, all the kings that sit on thrones, all the governments that rule, or any\nother things that we might attain in this world.  I am holding in my hand the Latter-day\nSaints' triple combination of holy scriptures&mdash;the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and\nCovenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. They contain the word of God as revealed in the\nlatter days from heaven through the Prophet Joseph Smith, for the salvation and exaltation of\nall the members of the human family who will receive their divine teachings and render\nobedience.\n<\/p><p>\nMembers of the Church of Jesus Christ accept one more book as scripture&mdash;the Holy Bible&mdash;and\nhence they regard it as authoritative and binding on their lives.  I shall not speak of that\nscripture today but confine my remarks to the scriptures given to the world by the power of\nthe Lord through his Prophet Joseph Smith.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first of these three scriptures of the Latter-day Saints, as it appears in the triple\ncombination, is the Book of Mormon.  This volume contains the gospel of Jesus Christ as the\nancient Americans received and understood it.\n<\/p><p>\nThe most vital purpose that the writers had in mind in preparing the Book of Mormon was\nthat it should serve as a new witness for Christ, especially a new witness for Christ to the\nJews and Gentiles in the latter days\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3577\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3577)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3577)\">2 Ne. 26:12<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37964\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37964)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37964)\">Morm. 5:9-14<\/a><\/span>).\nIt was written to verify\nthe Messiahship of the Only Begotten as proclaimed in the Old and New Testaments.\n<\/p><p>\nTowards the close of his life, Nephi, the first writer on the Nephite records, handed the plates\nto his brother Jacob and instructed Jacob to record carefully\n<\/p><p>\n. . . preaching which was sacred, or revelation which was great, or prophesying . . . and\ntouch upon them as much as it were possible, for Christ's sake . . .\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25833\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25833)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25833)\">Jacob 1:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so the Nephite records were written and preserved to come forth in the latter days to\nbear witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, the Mediator between the\nheavens and the earth, the Only Begotten of the Eternal Father in the flesh, and the Redeemer\nof the human family.  A careful reading of the Book of Mormon convinces one that not only\nJacob but also all the prophets who succeeded him carefully followed Nephi's injunction. \nThroughout the entire book witness is born almost continuously to the divine mission of the\nLamb of God, the Anointed One of Israel.\n<\/p><p>\nIn fact, Moroni, the last prophet of the Nephite race, in his preface to the Book of Mormon,\npointed out that the record had been written primarily for the purpose of\n<\/p><p>\n. . . the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God,\nmanifesting himself unto all nations . . .\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43126\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43126)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43126)\">BM Title Page<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI think that both the Jaredite and Nephite prophets did an excellent work in giving us much\nevidence of the divinity and mission of Jesus Christ; thus making the Book of Mormon indeed\na new witness.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Book of Mormon contains a number of teachings which help to explain, amplify, and\nclarify doctrine found in the Bible; for example, according to the Sermon on the Mount as\nrecorded in the Gospel of Matthew, while Jesus was talking to the entire multitude of people\nhe instructed: \n<\/p><p>\nTherefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye\nshall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34690\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34690)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34690)\">Matt. 6:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBrilliant scholars&mdash;and I think many of them faithful men, perhaps believing that Christ was\nthe greatest of all teachers, proclaiming at all times eternal truth&mdash;saw in the Master's\nforegoing statement what appeared to be an economic fallacy.  They observed that if people\nin general throughout the world took no heed of what they should eat or wear or drink, they\nwould soon be hungry, thirsty, and unclothed; and so those scholars wrote numerous\nexplanations in their efforts to interpret what the Master may have meant.\n<\/p><p>\nBut the Book of Mormon in one brief statement gives, I believe, more clarification to that\nproblem than is found in all the explanations given by the scholars.  According to that record,\nJesus appeared to the Nephites following his resurrection and gave a sermon similar to the\none known in the New Testament as the Sermon on the Mount.  Jesus was talking to the\nmultitude, and then the Nephite record states: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he looked upon the\ntwelve whom he had chosen, and said unto them: . . . Therefore I say unto you, take\nno thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink: nor yet for your\nbody, what ye shall put on\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5552\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5552)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5552)\">3 Ne. 13:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThus by turning from the multitude and giving his instruction to only twelve men, Jesus\nreduced the problem of those who would be provided for by the Lord to only twelve servants\nof God.  Certainly the laborers in the Lord's vineyard are worthy of their hire.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Book of Mormon contains some of the most marvelous doctrinal teachings found in any\nscripture or in any other writings in the world.  The ancient American prophets explained the\ngospel doctrines as clearly and as beautifully as any prophets have ever explained the gospel. \nI rejoice in the superb vision beheld by Nephi in which he viewed the history of the world\ndown to the present time.  I marvel as I read the teachings of King Benjamin.  Perhaps no\nother teacher except the Master has given a more beautiful, humble sermon.  I thrill every\ntime I contemplate the marvelous teachings of Alma and Amulek on death, resurrection,\nimmortality, judgment day, and the atonement of Jesus Christ.  I take delight in meditating on\nMormon's strong denunciation of the doctrine and practice of infant baptism, realizing that\nnowhere is this doctrine more forcefully condemned.  And of course the greatest of all the\nteachings found in the Book of Mormon are those found in the Third Nephi. Herein is\nrecorded the marvelous and beautiful story of the appearances of the resurrected Lord to the\ninhabitants of ancient America, proclaiming his victory over death and offering eternal life\nunto all those who would accept and obey his gospel. The book delineates in an astounding\nmanner the Master teaching the inhabitants of this land the same gospel plan of salvation\nwhich he had taught while in mortality among the Jews.  For example, read chapter\ntwenty-seven of Third Nephi (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5557\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5557)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5557)\">3 Ne. 27:13-22<\/a><\/span>).\nHerein Christ gave a definition of the gospel of Jesus Christ\nwhich, I think, is unsurpassed anywhere in religious literature.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are numerous individual statements on various subjects in the Book of Mormon which I\nchoose to call diamond-like statements, and which I think are unsurpassed in other scriptures\nand in world literature; for example, the oft-repeated, sincere, simple, but beautiful expression\nof faith given by Nephi is superb.  To quote: \n<\/p><p>\nI will go and do the things which the Lord hath commandeth, for I know that the Lord giveth\nno commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they\nmay accomplish the thing which he commandeth them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1528\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1528)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1528)\">1 Ne. 3:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI believe that possibly the greatest statement recorded on the purpose of man or purpose of\nlife was given in two short lines by father Lehi wherein he said: \"Adam fell that men might\nbe; and men are, that they might have joy\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3572\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3572)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3572)\">2 Ne. 2:25<\/a><\/span>).\nIt is my conviction that the joy\nof which Lehi spoke is a joy that would come today and remain tomorrow, next week, next\nyear, a hundred years, a thousand years, yes&mdash;joy eternally.  A thorough study of the Book\nof Mormon and its companion scriptures which I hold in my hand assures us that the only\nway to attain that joy is to render obedience to all of God's commandments continuously. \nThe more completely our lives conform to the teachings of the Master, the greater shall be\nour joy.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Doctrine and Covenants, the second volume of these latter-day scriptures which I hold in\nmy hand, is filled with revelation from heaven, given primarily through the instrumentality of\nthe Prophet Joseph Smith for the salvation of all the members of the human family who will\nreceive and obey. These revelations were also given for the building of the kingdom of God\nor the Church of Jesus Christ here upon the earth in the latter days preparatory for the coming\nof the Savior to usher in the millennial reign.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Doctrine and Covenants, in my opinion, like the Book of Mormon, contains many of the\ngreatest teachings found in any book in the world; for example, I know of no revelation given\nthrough the holy prophets in any age of world's history regarding post-mortal life and the\nfinal status of the human family which surpasses section seventy-six of the Doctrine and\nCovenants, known as The Vision, or the three degrees of glory.  This stupendous revelation\nwas given to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon.  They were permitted to look into\nthe celestial degree of glory, behold conditions there, and record what they saw while \"yet in\nthe Spirit\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13382\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13382)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13382)\">D&amp;C 76:80,113<\/a><\/span>).\nThen they were shown in vision the terrestrial glory and\nlikewise the telestial glory.  A short vision of perdition was also shown unto them. The\nconditions requisite for entrance into any of these worlds were made known unto them.\n<\/p><p>\nIn addition to the great revelation on the three degrees of glory, the Doctrine and Covenants\ncontains many more revelations regarding post-mortal life. For example, section eighty-eight\nexpands our knowledge of the three degrees of glory\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13390\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13390)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13390)\">D&amp;C 88:18-39<\/a><\/span>).\nAlso, there is a marvelous statement\nfound in section 131.  To quote: \n<\/p><p>\nIn the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees; \n<\/p><p>\nAnd in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood\n[meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]; \n<\/p><p>\nAnd if he does not, he cannot obtain it.\n<\/p><p>\nHe may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an\nincrease (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13424\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13424)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13424)\">D&amp;C 131:1-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the greatest revelations in any scripture is the one on celestial marriage, found in\nsection 132 of the Doctrine and Covenants.  This marvelous revelation deals with the\ncrowning principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ, setting forth the condition on which one may\ngain eternal life or exaltation in the presence of God.  This revelation informs us that man\ncannot be exalted without woman, nor the woman without man.  It makes clear the doctrine\nthat those who prove faithful in all things which the Lord hath commanded, go to the house\nof the Lord and enter into the covenant of marriage according to God's plan, and continue\nfaithful all the days of their lives, shall rise in the resurrection and\n<\/p><p>\n. . . shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and\nglory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness\nand a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.\n<\/p><p>\nThen shall they be gods . . . (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13429\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13429)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13429)\">D&amp;C 132:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThus section 132 gives us an understanding of how to obtain the highest blessing that our\nEternal Father has in store for those who love him and keep his commandments. \nFurthermore, the revelations which I have referred to briefly give us more definite information\non the post-mortal life of man and the ultimate goals to be attained than can be found in any\nother scriptures in the world.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Doctrine and Covenants, like the Book of Mormon, also contains diamond-like statements\nwhich are superb; for example, the one on law is remarkable.  To quote: \n<\/p><p>\nThere is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world,\nupon which all blessings are predicated&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nAnd when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which\nit is predicated (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13422\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13422)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13422)\">D&amp;C 130:20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnother diamond-like statement is: \"The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light\nand truth\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13397\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13397)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13397)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn addition to the great revelations referred to, the Doctrine and Covenants contains the\nwonderful instructions known as the Word of Wisdom, several revelations on missionary\nwork, instruction on priesthood, and numerous other pertinent revelations which I cannot\nname in the short time allotted to me.\n<\/p><p>\nThe third great treasure which I hold in my hand is the Pearl of Great Price, a pearl indeed. \nIt is composed of two revelations given to Moses and re-revealed to Joseph Smith; the book\nof Abraham, written by the great patriarch and translated by the Prophet Joseph; the\ntwenty-fourth chapter of Matthew; some of the early visions beheld by the Prophet; some of\nhis teachings; and the Articles of Faith.  They are compacted in approximately sixty pages,\nbut every page is dynamic and powerful.  It is a wonderful book.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Pearl of Great Price also contains revelations on certain subjects superior to any other\nscriptures or writings on those subjects found in the world; for example, Abraham's vision of\npre-mortal life in which he learned of the eternal nature of things; of the grand council in\nheaven; and of the plan of salvation as presented there constitutes one of the greatest of God's\nrevelations to his holy prophets.  And the knowledge obtained by Moses in his vision of\nLucifer and the part he played at the grand council, added to Abraham's vision, gives us the\nmost complete understanding found in any literature regarding man's pre-mortal life and\nGod's purposes for the good of man.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Pearl of Great Price also helps to clarify some of the difficult passages in the other\nscriptures; for example, when Jesus Christ was living in mortality, the New Testament writers\nreport that time and time again he referred to himself as the Son of Man. Many modern\nscholars in their commentaries have endeavored to explain what the Master may have meant\nby this appellation.  These scholars have almost universally maintained that Jesus in referring\nto himself as the Son of Man meant that he was a mortal man.  They maintain that Christ was\nmaking no claims of his divinity in referring to himself as Son of Man, but that he was\nmerely pointing out his mortality.  The Pearl of Great Price, however, clarifies this point\nbeautifully.  Speaking of God the Eternal Father, this record tells us that\n<\/p><p>\n. . . in the language of Adam, Man of Holiness is his name, and the name of his Only\nBegotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus Christ, a righteous Judge, who shall come in\nthe meridian of time (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39074\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39074)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39074)\">Moses 6:57<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThus we see that Jesus of Nazareth was not pointing out his mortal manhood but that he was\ndeclaring his divinity, his Godhood, his Messiahship, his powers as a Savior, his position as\nthe Only Begotten of the Father, each time that he called himself the Son of Man.  He was\nreferring to himself as the \"Son of the Man of Holiness, even the Only Begotten Son of the\nEternal Father.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Pearl of Great Price also contains some diamond-like statements, as do the other\nlatter-day scriptures.  As an example, I shall quote: \"For behold, this is my work and my\nglory&mdash;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39070\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39070)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39070)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNever in my life have I read in any scripture or in any other writing a statement which\ndefines the work of God (meaning the Father and the Son) more completely, more\nthoroughly, and more accurately, in one short statement, than does that one.  Jesus Christ\ncame into the world, being sent here by the Father to die, to be resurrected, and to break the\nbands of death.  He did rise from the grave, and he did put into operation, so to speak, a\nuniversal law of resurrection so that every man, woman, and child who ever lives upon this\nearth will rise from the grave and thereby receive immortality.  The wicked as well as the\nrighteous shall be resurrected and, through the grace of Christ and by the authorization of the\nFather, receive immortality. Thus God's work is to give immortality to the human family.\n<\/p><p>\nShortly after Adam and Eve were cast from the Garden of Eden, Jesus Christ, the Savior of\nthe world, began his work to give man eternal life by revealing the gospel plan of salvation to\nFather Adam. In the Meridian of Time Christ came to the world to show us how to live. The\nrevelation of the gospel has continued to come from heaven throughout the various gospel\ndispensations and climaxed in our dispensation, coming to the world through the Prophet\nJoseph Smith in the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. All the sons and daughters of God\nwho live fully in accordance with this gospel plan will receive eternal life, thereby helping to\ncomplete the work and the glory of God.\n<\/p><p>\nIn conclusion, I desire to speak briefly to the members of Church of Jesus Christ.  If we as\nmembers will give heed to the teachings of the Savior, rendering obedience to all of his\ncommandments, if we will walk along the path which these latter-day scriptures point out, all\nof the blessings promised in these scriptures will be ours.  Some day we shall come back into\nthe presence of the Father and the Son and receive eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nMy brothers and sisters, I have merely given a brief analysis of these three great treasures. \nLet me admonish that we all study the scriptures&mdash;that we study them day and night, and that\nwe keep their teachings in our minds continuously.  The Savior said: \"Search the scriptures;\nfor in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27638\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27638)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27638)\">John 5:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe holy scriptures have been my closest companion throughout my life. I love them and read\nthem continually. I think I have gone through the Book of Mormon forty-five times. Every\ntime I read it I find new thoughts.  I believe with all my heart, as I said in the beginning of\nmy talk, that these three latter-day scriptures, together with the Bible, constitute some of the\ngreatest treasures that we possess.  If we will permit them to do so, they will serve as our\nguides to bring us back unto God. May our Heavenly Father bless us that we may fully utilize\neffectively in our lives these great treasures, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
