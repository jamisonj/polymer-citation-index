Many Latter-day Saints had their lives changed by that conflict. In the military theater of operations, we had over 140 Latter-day Saint groups providing leadership, worship, and fellowship for members of the armed forces. At home, families were separated and in stress. We pay tribute to the Church leaders and members who shouldered extra burdens in looking after the families of our service people. They are still doing so.

Week after week, in the leading councils of the Church, in Church meetings everywhere, in our homes, and in public and private gatherings, we prayed for the well-being of those in uniform. We also prayed that the war would be short and that the numbers of dead and wounded would be as small as possible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/honour-thy-father-and-thy-mother.p5\" class=\"\">Our prayers were answered, and in this national period of thanksgiving designated by presidential proclamation, we join millions of religious people everywhere in prayers of thanks to a merciful Father in Heaven.

I saw this in Asia. But the care of aged parents is still a strongly felt obligation among most Americans. Six out of ten older persons questioned in a recent national survey had weekly personal visits with their children, and three-fourths of them talked on the telephone with their children at least weekly. Two-thirds of those surveyed expect to take care of their elderly parents. (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News,<\/span> 7 May 1990, p.

It was a unique Utah Mormon institution. It began in 1875, when Charles R. Savage, the pioneer photographer, persuaded Presiding Bishop Edward Hunter to declare a day for honoring what we now call senior citizens. The first Old Folks Day transported guests by rail to an outing at Saltair, west of Salt Lake City. A monument honoring that celebration and its founder stands on the southeast corner of Temple Square.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/honour-thy-father-and-thy-mother.p32\" class=\"\">The annual Old Folks Day celebrations were held in nearly every community in Utah. Travel, refreshments, and entertainment were given to all citizens seventy years of age and older. Although this holiday was conducted by the leaders and members of this Church, it was stipulated that \u201cthere are none to be excluded because of their religion, and the oldest guest present is the special guest of the occasion whether they be white or black or whatever the complexion of their religious belief.\u201d (Quoted in Joseph Heinerman, \u201cThe Old Folks Day: A Unique Utah Tradition,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Utah Historical Quarterly,<\/span> 53 [Spring 1985]:158.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/honour-thy-father-and-thy-mother.p33\" class=\"\">The committee directing these celebrations was dissolved in 1970, and the responsibility for honoring those who had come to be called senior citizens was passed to the stake presidents of the Church. Since that time we have had further increases in the number of senior citizens in our midst, but perhaps not significant increases in the amount of honor accorded them. Fortunately, the advances in medical science that have produced increased longevity have also increased our senior citizens\u2019 effective participation in church, community, business, and social events. But the need for honor, especially for our fathers and our mothers, is undiminished.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/honour-thy-father-and-thy-mother.p34\" class=\"\">The fifth commandment is often referred to as the first commandment with a promise: \u201cHonour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22998\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22998)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22998)\">Ex. 20:12<\/a><\/span>.)

There I met June\u2019s maternal grandmother, Adelaide White Call. Then a widow about eighty-five years of age, Grandma Call was a survivor of what older people called \u201cthe exodus.\u201d She had been among those valiant Latter-day Saints expelled from northern Mexico in 1912. Now her sons and daughters were living throughout the United States. In her later years, they helped her locate in Utah County, near June\u2019s parents.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/honour-thy-father-and-thy-mother.p37\" class=\"\">During my visits, I saw the gentleness and love and concern with which the Call children and their companions looked after this older parent. They visited her frequently. My wife\u2019s mother looked in on her every day and often had her in their home. They made her part of every occasion in which she desired to participate, and they gave her every consideration and respect. They cared for her every need when she was ill. Surely, I said to myself, these Call children honor their mother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/honour-thy-father-and-thy-mother.p38\" class=\"\">It has been about forty years since I saw that honor given. Now I see its effects. I see June and her brother and sisters honoring their mother as they saw their mother honoring her own mother. Fortunately, True Dixon is blessed with good health and vigor and has no present need for the kind of care her mother required. Still, her children are attentive. There are frequent visits and phone calls and invitations that include her in all the family activities she desires. I believe her days will be longer upon the land because of the attentiveness and companionship of her children, who learned the way to honor a parent by seeing how their own mother honored hers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/honour-thy-father-and-thy-mother.p39\" class=\"\">I am grateful for this example and for this principle, especially when I anticipate the effect of having our daughters and sons observe how their mother honors her mother.

A worthy example repeats itself from generation to generation. Truly, righteousness is a beacon and a worthy act is its own reward.
