If we understood the full meaning we would have less divorce and its attendant unhappiness. Couples would plan for a happy marriage relationship based on divine instruction. If couples understood from the beginning of their romance that their marriage relationship could be blessed with promises and conditions extending into the eternities, divorce would not even be a considered alternative when difficulties arise.

Usually, young couples date for a few months or for a year or two, enjoying romance and getting acquainted, and then get married. Once married, they soon learn that romance must blend with spiritual beliefs, in-law relationships, money issues, and serious discussions involving ethics, children, and the running of a home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/marriage-and-divorce.p25\" class=\"\">Too many people are inadequately prepared for this lofty responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/marriage-and-divorce.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cPeople go to college for years to prepare for a vocation or profession \u2026 not [nearly] as \u2026 rewarding [or as important] as marriage.\u201d (See Lowell S.

He sat and listened silently, and when we ran out of conversation he said, simply, \u2018Well, my wife and I, we had problems, too, and we learned how to solve them.\u2019 That is all \u2026 he said. But you know there was something that happened as a result of that young bishop\u2019s statement.
