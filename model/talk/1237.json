That is what you brethren of the priesthood,\nassembled in these vast congregations tonight, have in mind, because you are servants of the\nMost High, and he has given you the responsibility of perfecting the Saints, of working in the\nministry, for edifying the Saints of God, and the object is the perfecting of the individual.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many who are working tonight in positions who are sometimes discouraged. They\nmay be in a bishopric, some may be in the presidencies of stakes, some may be in the\npresidencies of quorums, some deacons who feel, \"Well, I am not doing anything.\" Teachers\nwho are asked to go ward teaching sometimes feel they are incompetent, inadequate to teach.\nThe plans that have been outlined today for you will be an aid no matter what position you\nmay be holding, and you who feel inadequate, particularly the young boys who hold the\noffice of teacher, when you go into the home of a man of the priesthood, and you feel\ninadequate to do your duty, remember this, given by a nonmember of the Church, but it\ncontains encouragement: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Who does his task from day to day<br \/>\n     And meets whatever comes his way,<br \/>\n     Believing God has willed it so,<br \/>\n     Has found real greatness here below.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Who guards his post, no matter where,<br \/>\n     Believing God must need him there,<br \/>\n     Although but lowly toil it be,<br \/>\n     Has risen to nobility.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For great and low there's but one test: <br \/>\n     'Tis that each man shall do his best.<br \/>\n     Who works with all the strength he can<br \/>\n     Shall never die in debt to man.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;                    (Edgar A. Guest)\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless the priesthood of the Church of Jesus Christ throughout the whole world. They are\ncalled to serve; to serve the members of the Church, and to serve the world by preaching the\neverlasting gospel. May the Lord guide us, inspire us, never leave us alone, I pray, in the\nname of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
