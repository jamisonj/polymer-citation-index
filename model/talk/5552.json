It\u2019s a special privilege to welcome these men and to bid farewell for a time to those who will be leaving us. We\u2019re grateful for the valiant service these men have rendered.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p4\" class=\"\">President Hunter, I love you and sustain you with all my heart and soul, as do all the Seventy.

Hunter in 1967 when I reported to his office to be set apart for a new calling. We discussed my new assignment for a moment; then he surprised me by saying something like, \u201cBrother Pinegar, we don\u2019t need anyone to serve in that calling. Do you know what we need?\u201d I sat there not knowing how to respond. I was wondering if I was mistaken about my call. In his pleasant way, he said if we were to stop the next one hundred members of the Church who passed in front of the Church Administration Building, almost all of them would be able and willing to serve in that same calling. \u201cWhat we need,\u201d he said, \u201cis home teachers. That is the great need in the Church today.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p6\" class=\"\">Then with a smile he said, \u201cAll right, Brother Pinegar, I\u2019ll set you apart anyway.\u201d As he placed his hands on my head, I was uncertain what Elder Hunter would say. I thought he might set me apart as a home teacher. In a kind, reassuring manner he gave me a blessing that I would be able to fulfill my calling. I promised myself that I would be a better home teacher.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p7\" class=\"\">President Hunter\u2019s reference to home teachers that day is in harmony with his focus now on the simple messages of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The great work of the Lord is primarily accomplished through small, kind acts that exemplify the basic teachings of His gospel. Obedience in doing the simple things has always been the means of obtaining the blessings of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p8\" class=\"\">Remember the story of Naaman, a captain for the king of Syria\u2014\u201ca great man with his master \u2026 because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria: \u2026 a mighty man in valour, but \u2026 a leper\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3231\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3231)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3231)\">2 Kgs. 5:1<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p9\" class=\"\">At the direction of his king, Naaman went to Elisha the prophet to be healed of his dreaded affliction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cSo Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cBut Naaman was wroth \u2026 and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd his servants came near \u2026 and said, \u2026 if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cThen went [Naaman] down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3232\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3232)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3232)\">2 Kgs. 5:9\u201311, 13\u201314<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p15\" class=\"\">Are we not sometimes like Naaman, looking for big or important things to do and bypassing simple things which could change our lives and heal us of our afflictions?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p16\" class=\"\">At a Brigham Young University fireside, President Hunter said, \u201cIf you feel that \u2026 what you do this year or in the years to come does not make you very famous, take heart.

Let us not think that because some of the things named this afternoon may seem small and trivial, that they are unimportant. Life, after all, is made up of little things. Our life, our being, physically, is made up here of little heart beats. Let that little heart stop beating, and life in this world ceases.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cThe great sun is a mighty force in the universe, but we receive the blessings of his rays because they come to us as little beams, which, taken in the aggregate, fill the whole world with sunlight. The dark night is made pleasant by the glimmer of what seem to be little stars; and so the true Christian life is made up of little Christ-like acts performed this hour, this minute, in the home, in the quorum, in the organization, in the town, wherever our life and acts may be cast\u201d (in Conference Report, Oct. 1914, pp. 87\u201388).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p22\" class=\"\">Focusing our attention on teaching and living the simple messages of the Savior in our homes will strengthen our families, perfect the society in which we live, and improve ourselves. It will enable us to successfully combat the erosion of the family, which President Hunter has said is the greatest challenge in the world today. <span class=\"emphasis\">Our first line of defense in a world of spiritual and moral decay is and will continue to be the family.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p23\" class=\"\">Christlike qualities instilled early in one\u2019s life establish values that lead us to make correct choices and actions. It has been said, \u201cChildren are like wet cement; whatever falls on them makes an impression\u201d (Haim G. Ginott).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p24\" class=\"\">As a teenage boy, I began working for a contractor pouring concrete foundations for homes. I learned that concrete was made of a mixture of very simple elements which of themselves were not stable enough for a foundation. But mixed together in proper sequence and proportions, tiny grains of sand, small pebbles, water, and cement powder form a unique substance of unusual strength and durability. For a few hours after the concrete is mixed, it can be poured into any desired form. At first, before it is completely hardened, even a tiny bird hopping across its soft surface will leave an imprint. Later, however, it becomes so firm an elephant could walk over it without leaving any tracks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p25\" class=\"\">Just as a few simple elements combined in a proper way form a sturdy foundation for a house, so do the simple teachings of the gospel bond together to make a strong foundation for our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p26\" class=\"\">In contrast, we must be aware that there are small things that can destroy rather than build or strengthen us. Tiny grains of salt sprinkled on concrete can actually cause it to break up and crumble if they are not removed. Similarly, small steps taken in the wrong direction, ignored or uncorrected, will weaken and destroy our lives. Big problems grow out of thinking that little things don\u2019t matter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p27\" class=\"\">Like Naaman, we have been counseled by our prophets to do simple things which do matter. We have received simple instructions which we can all follow to strengthen our families, to heal our spiritual afflictions, and to become followers of Jesus Christ in thought and action. Parents have been counseled to set aside one night each week to teach fundamental gospel principles to their children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p28\" class=\"\">The First Presidency has stated:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cNo Church organization can supplant the parents in discharging this obligation.

The Savior himself taught, \u201cPray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6348\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6348)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6348)\">3 Ne. 18:21<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-simple-things.p33\" class=\"\">Praying together, seeking to know the will of our Father in Heaven, and desiring strength to do His will draws Him near to us. This practice unifies family members in a common direction and purpose. How simple the Lord has made it for us! All we have to do is sincerely ask in faith in his name, and He will hear and answer our prayers. Yet, if the prophet bid us do some great thing for such blessings, would we do it?
