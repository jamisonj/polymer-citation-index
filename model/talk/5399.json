Satan\u2019s most strenuous opposition is directed at whatever is most important to the Father\u2019s plan.

It also echoes a familiar distinction in the law. Some acts, like murder, are crimes because they are inherently wrong. Other acts, like operating without a license, are crimes only because they are legally prohibited. Under these distinctions, the act that produced the Fall was not a sin\u2014inherently wrong\u2014but a transgression\u2014wrong because it was formally prohibited. These words are not always used to denote something different, but this distinction seems meaningful in the circumstances of the Fall.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-great-plan-of-happiness.p20\" class=\"\">Modern revelation shows that our first parents understood the necessity of the Fall.

President Spencer W. Kimball taught that \u201cin the context of lawful marriage, the intimacy of sexual relations is right and divinely approved.

When married couples postpone childbearing until after they have satisfied their material goals, the mere passage of time assures that they seriously reduce their potential to participate in furthering our Heavenly Father\u2019s plan for all of his spirit children. Faithful Latter-day Saints cannot afford to look upon children as an interference with what the world calls \u201cself-fulfillment.\u201d Our covenants with God and the ultimate purpose of life are tied up in those little ones who reach for our time, our love, and our sacrifices.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-great-plan-of-happiness.p37\" class=\"\">How many children should a couple have? All they can care for! Of course, to care for children means more than simply giving them life. Children must be loved, nurtured, taught, fed, clothed, housed, and well started in their capacities to be good parents themselves. Exercising faith in God\u2019s promises to bless them when they are keeping his commandments, many LDS parents have large families. Others seek but are not blessed with children or with the number of children they desire. In a matter as intimate as this, we should not judge one another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-great-plan-of-happiness.p38\" class=\"\">President Gordon B. Hinckley gave this inspired counsel to an audience of young Latter-day Saints:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-great-plan-of-happiness.p39\" class=\"\">\u201cI like to think of the positive side of the equation, of the meaning and sanctity of life, of the purpose of this estate in our eternal journey, of the need for the experiences of mortal life under the great plan of God our Father, of the joy that is to be found only where there are children in the home, of the blessings that come of good posterity. When I think of these values and see them taught and observed, then I am willing to leave the question of numbers to the man and the woman and the Lord\u201d (\u201cIf I Were You, What Would I Do?\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Brigham Young University 1983\u201384 Fireside and Devotional Speeches,<\/span> Provo, Utah: University Publications, 1984, p. 11).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-great-plan-of-happiness.p40\" class=\"\">Some who are listening to this message are probably saying, \u201cBut what about me?\u201d We know that many worthy and wonderful Latter-day Saints currently lack the ideal opportunities and essential requirements for their progress. Singleness, childlessness, death, and divorce frustrate ideals and postpone the fulfillment of promised blessings. In addition, some women who desire to be full-time mothers and homemakers have been literally compelled to enter the full-time work force. But these frustrations are only temporary. The Lord has promised that in the eternities no blessing will be denied his sons and daughters who keep the commandments, are true to their covenants, and desire what is right.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-great-plan-of-happiness.p41\" class=\"\">Many of the most important deprivations of mortality will be set right in the Millennium, which is the time for fulfilling all that is incomplete in the great plan of happiness for all of our Father\u2019s worthy children. We know that will be true of temple ordinances. I believe it will also be true of family relationships and experiences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-great-plan-of-happiness.p42\" class=\"\">I pray that we will not let the challenges and temporary diversions of mortality cause us to forget our covenants and lose sight of our eternal destiny. We who know God\u2019s plan for his children, we who have covenanted to participate, have a clear responsibility. We must desire to do what is right, and we must do all that we can in our own circumstances in mortality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-great-plan-of-happiness.p43\" class=\"\">In all of this, we should remember King Benjamin\u2019s caution to \u201csee that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40878\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40878)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40878)\">Mosiah 4:27<\/a><\/span>).
