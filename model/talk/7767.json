The path was lined with beautiful green trees and sweet-scented flowers. We could hear birds singing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p7\" class=\"\">I asked my blue-eyed, cheerful, and innocent granddaughter how she was preparing for baptism.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p8\" class=\"\">She answered with a question: \u201cGrandpa, what is sin?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p9\" class=\"\">I silently prayed for inspiration and tried to respond as simply as I could: \u201cSin is the intentional disobedience to God\u2019s commandments. It makes Heavenly Father sad, and its results are suffering and sadness.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p10\" class=\"\">Clearly concerned, she asked me, \u201cAnd how does it get us?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p11\" class=\"\">The question first reveals purity, but it also reveals a concern for how to avoid involvement with sin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p12\" class=\"\">For her to understand more clearly, I used the natural elements we had around us as an illustration. Continuing down our path, we found by the side of a barbed-wire fence a stone post of considerable size; it was a heavy structure with flowers, bushes, and little trees growing around it. Over time these plants would become bigger than the post itself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p13\" class=\"\">I remembered that a little farther down the path, we would find another post that had already been taken over little by little, almost unnoticed, by the vegetation that grew around it. I imagine that a post would not perceive that, despite its strength, it could be encompassed and destroyed by fragile plants. The post would have thought, \u201cNo problem. I am strong and big, and this small plant will do me no harm.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p14\" class=\"\">So as a nearby tree grows bigger, the post does not notice at first; then the post starts enjoying the shade the tree provides. But the tree continues to grow, and it encircles the post with two branches that at first seem fragile but that in time intertwine and surround the post.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p15\" class=\"\">Still the post does not realize what is happening.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p16\" class=\"\">Soon, in our walk, we found the proverbial post. It had been plucked out from the ground. My little granddaughter looked impressed and asked me, \u201cGrandpa, is this the tree of sin?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p17\" class=\"\">I then explained to her that it was only a symbol, or an example, of how sin gets us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p18\" class=\"\">I don\u2019t know what the effect of our conversation will be on her, but it made me think of the many faces of sin and of how it sneaks into our lives if we allow it to.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p19\" class=\"\">We must be alert because small choices can bring great consequences, just as going to bed early and waking up early have great consequences. <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120989\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120989)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120989)\">Doctrine and Covenants 88:124<\/a><\/span> teaches us, \u201cArise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.\u201d Those who go to bed early wake up rested, with the body and mind invigorated and blessed by the Lord because of obedience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p20\" class=\"\">What may appear to be of little importance, such as going to bed late, not praying for a day, skipping fasting, or breaking the Sabbath\u2014such little slips\u2014will make us lose sensitivity little by little, allowing us to do worse things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p21\" class=\"\">When I was a teenager, my curfew was 10:00 p.m. Today, that is the time some go out in order to have fun. Yet we know that it is at night that some of the worst things happen. It is during the dark hours that some youth go to places with inappropriate environments, where music and lyrics do not allow them to have the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Then, under these circumstances, they become easy prey to sin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p22\" class=\"\">Often, becoming prey to sin starts with someone choosing friends whose standards are not consistent with the gospel; and in order to be popular or to be accepted by peers, the person then compromises gospel principles and laws, going down a path that will bring only pain and sadness to this person and to his or her loved ones.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p23\" class=\"\">We must be alert not to let sin grow around us. Forms of sin are everywhere\u2014even, for example, in a computer or cell phone. These technologies are useful and can bring great benefits to us. But their inappropriate use\u2014such as involvement in time-wasting games, programs that would drive you to carnal pleasure, or much worse things such as pornography\u2014is destructive. Pornography destroys character and makes its user sink in the quicksand of filth, out of which the person can escape only with much help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/avoiding-the-trap-of-sin.p24\" class=\"\">This terrible monster causes pain and suffering both to the user and to his or her innocent children, spouse, father, and mother.
