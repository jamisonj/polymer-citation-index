In turn, a wife and a mother can do much\u2014and in time of need, most things\u2014usually considered the responsibility of the man, without jeopardizing their distinct roles. Even so, leaders, and especially parents, should recognize that there is a distinct masculine nature and a distinct feminine nature essential to the foundation of the home and the family.

Be very careful to sustain and support rather than supplant the home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/the-relief-society.p39\" class=\"\">At those times when parents feel smothered and just cannot do it all, they must make wise and inspired judgments as to how much out-of-home activity of all kinds is best for their own family.
