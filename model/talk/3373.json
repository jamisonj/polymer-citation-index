It helps us to measure our growth.

With it we were given the Book of Mormon, which is an amazing volume of ancient American prophetic writing. More than a million copies are published each year as we take it worldwide.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p8\" class=\"\">Our missionary system has increased from about a dozen men in 1830 to an army of nearly thirty thousand today. Our membership doubles every fifteen years. Our four million will soon be eight million. Our stakes and missions now exceed thirteen hundred in number in about eighty different nations. We have twelve thousand local congregations in forty-six languages.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p9\" class=\"\">We operate hundreds of seminaries and institutes for the daily study of the gospel. We also have some elementary schools and colleges. Our great Brigham Young University is recognized in many lands for its superior accomplishments. Knowing that the glory of both God and man is intelligence, we advocate good education.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p10\" class=\"\">We have a welfare program which is the envy of nations. We make an earnest effort to care for our own with no expense to taxpayers. For this purpose we have hundreds of projects which not only provide the necessities of life for the needy among us, but employment also, including jobs for the handicapped.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p11\" class=\"\">Our temple work moves forward magnificently. We are building additional temples in various parts of the world as we take the ordinances of salvation to more and more people. The service rendered in those holy structures exceeds anything ever known in the past.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p12\" class=\"\">We take humble pride in the rapid growth, the marvelous accomplishments, and the stability of our people. \u201cBy their fruits ye shall know them,\u201d the Savior taught (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36692\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36692)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36692)\">Matt. 7:20<\/a><\/span>). Our fruits bear testimony of our devotion to Almighty God, of our firm commitment to carry on his modern ministry, and of the validity of the message which we bear.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p13\" class=\"\">And what is our message?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p14\" class=\"\">First and foremost, it is that God <span class=\"emphasis\">does<\/span> live, that he is our Eternal Father and our Creator. All human beings are his offspring. Knowing this, we accept the commandment of the Savior to perfect ourselves so that we may be like him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p15\" class=\"\">Next we affirm that Jesus of Nazareth is indeed the Christ\u2014he who was born in Bethlehem on the first Christmas; he who answered the questions of the doctors in the temple when but twelve years old; he who was baptized of John; he who walked the plains of Palestine preaching his gospel, healing many who were sick, and raising some of the dead; he who was persecuted by the religious cults of the day, was condemned to the cross, but who conquered death and the grave in a glorious resurrection on the third day afterward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p16\" class=\"\">He <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> the Savior of mankind! He <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> the Redeemer of all flesh! He <span class=\"emphasis\">did<\/span> arise from the grave. He <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> risen, as the angel said, in physical, corporeal reality. And he lives today! Our modern prophets have seen him face to face and have talked with him. We know that he lives and by his resurrection he will also give to each of us a victory over death, for we too shall be resurrected\u2014physically and literally. We too shall live again. That is our testimony on this Easter day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p17\" class=\"\">We testify also that Christ has spoken again in our day, that he has raised up new prophets and through them has reestablished his Church on earth as it was originally when he called Peter, James, and John, Thomas, Judas, and others into the ministry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p18\" class=\"\">The divine gospel was lost over the centuries, human philosophies displaced revealed doctrine, and the holy priesthood was taken away. But now it is all restored! We testify that it <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> restored! Revelation again comes from heaven. Prophets once more walk among us, and the truth is offered freely to all who will listen. God\u2019s modern dispensation now shines as a brilliant ensign to the nations, just as the prophets foretold.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p19\" class=\"\">But as it shines, opposition grows. As truth is spread abroad, deceit and dishonesty arise to oppose it. As virtue is taught by the servants of God, unchastity increases among the ungodly. Indeed, as the Prophet Lehi said, \u201cThere is an opposition in all things\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4016\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4016)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4016)\">2 Ne. 2:11<\/a><\/span>); and as truth manifests itself, the adversary seeks to strike it down.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p20\" class=\"\">In a very real sense it is a war\u2014a hot war\u2014a war between right and wrong, between the powers of heaven and the forces of Lucifer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p21\" class=\"\">The scriptures warn that the devil will make war with the Saints of God, but he never can and he never will overcome them.

We work together in partnership with him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p25\" class=\"\">But how many of us realize how serious this conflict is? Do we measure its effect upon our own family circles? Do we understand what the devil is trying to do to us? Do we recognize his evil emissaries for what they are when they openly assail us or when they seek deceitfully to seduce us quietly?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p26\" class=\"\">Seduction is his greatest weapon. Do we realize that? I repeat: seduction is the greatest weapon of the devil. It is alluring; it falsely appears to be advantageous and desirable. He would have us think that bitter is sweet, that black is white, that sin is acceptable, that virtue is obsolete, archaic, and prudish.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p27\" class=\"\">Because he revels in filth, he would tell us that to be clean is some naive concept of our grandmother\u2019s age which does not apply in this enlightened day. He says that evil is good and that standards have been relaxed. \u201cGo your way,\u201d he says; \u201cfear no consequences; do your own thing; have fun; express your basest desires if you wish, and let yourselves go!\u201d That is his philosophy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p28\" class=\"\">Do we recognize it when it is flung at us by our angry foes or when it comes with a soft voice and a disarming smile? Do we truly recognize evil when we see it? Do we really know right from wrong? If we do not, then let us hasten to learn from our Church leaders. They will tell us quickly and plainly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p29\" class=\"\">If we <span class=\"emphasis\">do<\/span> know what is right, have we the courage to stand up for it, to defend virtue, to declare the validity of our faith, to oppose false teachings, and to fight the unpopular battle? Have we the moral stamina to confront any and all opportunities and thus preserve truth, uphold cleanliness, and defend the cause of God?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p30\" class=\"\">The time has come when we must take a far more firm and positive stand than ever before. We must identify illicit sex, pornography, filthy speech, and the use of liquor, tobacco, marijuana, and worse drugs as enemies of God and enemies to ourselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p31\" class=\"\">We must see in all of them the fiery darts of the devil.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p32\" class=\"\">We must bolster our spiritual fortifications, raise the shield which God has given us, and wield the sword of righteousness and faith as all God\u2019s servants should.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/where-do-we-stand.p33\" class=\"\">We must ask ourselves anew the potent question: Who\u2019s on the Lord\u2019s side?
