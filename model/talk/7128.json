Hinckley\u2019s closing remarks at the end of this marvelous general conference, I fervently hope that each of us will feel how blessed we are to have received from prophets and apostles of the Lord the collective wisdom and exhortation that, if heeded and followed, will help us steer our course ever closer to our Savior. We ought to be particularly grateful to live in a time when our Church leaders, though many are advanced in years, continue to receive the revelation and inspiration that moves the kingdom forward from day to day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/appreciating-the-counsel-of-those-who-are-bowed-in-years.p5\" class=\"\">As a young man, I was given a very strong written admonition to prove myself a faithful and obedient son so that as I grew older and whenever I needed counsel and advice, I should go to my parents, though they be \u201cbowed in years,\u201d to receive from them wisdom, comfort, and guidance. My father passed away over 20 years ago, having been a great and exemplary source of wisdom for me all the days of my life, and we just laid my 101-year-old mother to rest beside her eternal companion last Monday. In her 100th year, she affirmed her lifelong testimony in these words: \u201cThe gospel is a way of life; it is part of the plan to help us avoid bitterness. More than ever, I believe that this life is good but that the next life is better\u201d (\u201cGrowing Old Graciously: Lessons from a Centenarian,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Religious Educator<\/span> 5, no. 1 [2004]: 11).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/appreciating-the-counsel-of-those-who-are-bowed-in-years.p6\" class=\"\">My mother often told me that she prayed for me and for our family every day. As she came closer and closer to the veil, her prayers were especially fervent and meaningful to me.

He has needed the wisdom and experience of age, the inspired direction from those with long years of proven faithfulness to His gospel\u201d (\u201cTo the Elderly in the Church,\u201d 4).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/appreciating-the-counsel-of-those-who-are-bowed-in-years.p8\" class=\"\">These thoughts have caused me to reflect on the great sermons, blessings, testimonies, and admonitions that prophets and apostles throughout the ages have left, especially as they felt themselves waxing old or preparing to go down to the dust.
