Always the prophets of God have condemned whoredoms. Yet these eternal commands have frequently been ignored, opposed, or mocked by powerful traditions in many lands. This is especially visible today, when the movies, magazines, and Internet communications of one nation are instantly shared with many others. Sexual relations out of wedlock are tolerated or advocated by many. So is the rapidly expanding culture of pornography. All who have belonged to these cultures of sin must repent and change if they are to become the people of God, for He has warned that \u201cno unclean thing can enter into his kingdom\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5441\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5441)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5441)\">3 Ne. 27:19<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/repentance-and-change.p28\" class=\"\">Weekly attendance at church is another example of a commandment contrary to popular traditions.

This requires more than passive attendance.

Long-standing addictions or habits are not easily broken, but God\u2019s command is clear, and the promised blessings more than compensate for the challenges of change.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/repentance-and-change.p30\" class=\"\">Another example is honesty. Some cultures allow lying, stealing, and other dishonest practices. But dishonesty in any form\u2014whether to appease, to save face, or to get gain\u2014is in direct conflict with gospel commandments and culture. God is a God of truth, and God does not change. We are the ones who must change. And that will be a big change for all whose traditions accustom them to thinking that they can lie a little, cheat a little, or engage in deceit whenever it brings personal advantage and is not likely to be detected.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/repentance-and-change.p31\" class=\"\">A less serious worldly tradition that conflicts with gospel culture is the idea of upward or downward movement in positions. In the world, we refer to the up or down of promotions or reductions. But there is no up or down in Church positions. We just move around. A bishop released by proper authority and called to teach in Primary does not move down. He moves forward as he accepts his release with gratitude and fulfills the duties of a new calling\u2014even one far less visible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/repentance-and-change.p32\" class=\"\">I saw a memorable example of this a few months ago in the Philippines. I visited a ward in the Pasig stake, near Manila.

Now I saw him serving humbly and gratefully in his ward bishopric, second counselor to a man much younger and much less experienced.

But some gifts have promoted a culture of dependency, reducing their recipients\u2019 need for earthly food or shelter but impoverishing them in their eternal need for individual growth. The growth required by the gospel plan only occurs in a culture of individual effort and responsibility. It cannot occur in a culture of dependency. Whatever causes us to be dependent on someone else for decisions or resources we could provide for ourselves weakens us spiritually and retards our growth toward what the gospel plan intends us to be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/repentance-and-change.p42\" class=\"\">The gospel raises people out of poverty and dependency, but only when gospel culture, including the faithful payment of tithing even by the very poor, prevails over the traditions and cultures of dependency. That is the lesson to be learned from the children of Israel, who came out of hundreds of years of slavery in Egypt and followed a prophet into their own land and became a mighty people. That lesson can also be learned from the Mormon pioneers, who never used their persecutions or poverty as an excuse but went forward in faith, knowing that God would bless them when they kept His commandments, which He did.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/repentance-and-change.p43\" class=\"\">The changes we must make to become part of the gospel culture require prolonged and sometimes painful effort, and our differences must be visible. As the \u201csalt of the earth,\u201d we are also the \u201clight of the world,\u201d and our light must not be hidden (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"33735\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33735)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33735)\">Matt. 5:13\u201316<\/a><\/span>).

That is why those who have made the covenant to change have a sacred duty to love and help one another. That encouragement must be extended to every soul who struggles to come out of the culture of the world and into the culture of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Apostle John concluded, \u201cLet us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1014\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1014)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1014)\">1 Jn. 3:18<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/repentance-and-change.p44\" class=\"\">No one shows love for their fellowmen more impressively than the noble men and women of this Church who leave comfortable homes and surroundings to serve as couple missionaries.

And repentance means more than giving up our sins.
