He who has good memories is\nrichly blessed. As I have contemplated my message today, there is one phrase that keeps\nreturning: \"The tie that binds.\" Many poems and articles have been written about the tie that\nbinds. I should like to suggest that the tie that really binds is the gospel of Jesus Christ; the\nway of life it offers mankind, the peace it assures to all who will obey its teachings, the hope\nand promises for eternal happiness are just exactly what the world needs to bind up its\nwar-weary, confused, tired body&mdash;the tie that binds.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Important anniversary<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMay I reminisce? This is an important anniversary today. It was 17 years ago on this very day\nthat a prophet bestowed upon me the greatest honor that could come into the life of any man.\nSitting across from me in his home on South Temple, taking my hands in his, he seemed to\nlook clear through me as he said, \"Brother Longden, we want you to be one of the Assistants\nto the Quorum of the Twelve.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHow the blessings have been poured out upon us, not only since then, but all of our lives!\nThe windows of heaven have truly been opened unto us.\n<\/p><p>\nThe privilege of visiting in stakes, wards, branches, of visiting the sick, listening to those who\nseek counsel for their problems, performing marriages for time and eternity, setting apart\nmissionaries, and the glorious experience of touring missions&mdash;all combine to bring rich\nmemories.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Tour of South Pacific<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSome years ago, I was assigned to tour the South Pacific missions, including Australia and\nNew Zealand. Since then, because of jet transportation, the world has become smaller, but at\nthat time a visitor from Church headquarters was not as regular a thing as it now is. Even so,\nin every country, there were many fine Saints who were living the gospel, who, because of\ntheir obedience to its principles, had improved themselves financially, socially, intellectually,\nmorally, and most important, spiritually. Wherever we went, there was a bond of\nunderstanding, regardless of language, customs, or the color of skin.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Visit to Tonga<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a brand new stake in the South Pacific, Nuku'alofa [Tonga] Stake, which I should\nlike to congratulate and welcome into the fold of stakes. That Tongan stake now joins her\nsister, Apia [Samoa] Stake, in two relatively remote places of the world. The first time in\nTonga, we were on a very tight schedule, so that when we arrived at the beautiful assembly\nroom at the Liahona College, where we were to hold our first meetings, the Saints were\nalready assembled and waiting, all dressed in pure white. They had removed the benches and\nwere sitting on the floor on home-woven mats&mdash;this to make more room. As I recall, there\nwere over 1,200 assembled there. We were hurrying down the outside of the building to go in\nand saw them stand as one&mdash;1,200 as one&mdash;and immediately there were bell-like tones of\ngladness and joy ringing out, \"We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet.\" They were crying. We\ncried tears of joy, understanding tears. We joined in singing&mdash;we in English, they in\nTongan&mdash;\"We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet.\" Immediately, through an interpreter, I explained I\nwas not a prophet but knew they were singing to our Prophet David O. McKay, and I would\ntake their message back to him as soon as I returned home.\n<\/p><p>\nThe next day, we saw the handiwork of the sisters in Relief Society that was being assembled\nfor their annual bazaar. This was Relief Society&mdash;not in Salt Lake City, not in California,\nArizona, or New York, but Relief Society in Tonga, teaching the same lessons, carrying the\nsame program. Under the MIA, there were athletic events, dance and music festivals\nparticipated in by Tongan folk. Returning to Tonga, while we were there, were 69 Saints who\nhad been to the New Zealand Temple for their endowments&mdash;a tie that binds forever. I shall\nnever forget the spirit of these great humble folk, many of whom sold their earthly\npossessions in order to gain eternal possessions&mdash;husbands and wives with children united as\nfamilies for eternity.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The work in Perth, Australia<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOur first visit to Perth, Australia, was at the Christmas season. Perth does not seem so far\naway today as it did when John Glenn orbited the earth in his space ship. It was Christmas\nEve in Perth when, with the mission president, we went to the railroad station to bid good-bye\nto some Saints who were leaving to go to the New Zealand Temple to receive the same\nblessings the Tongan Saints had sacrificed to receive. We, who sometimes make so much of\nChristmas in a financial way, were brought up a little short when we asked the parents of five\nlittle children, \"What about Father Christmas?\" (The children were young enough to expect a\nvisit from Father Christmas.) The young mother bent down and picked up a small package\nand said, \"It is enough. Think of the blessings we will have when we get to the temple.\"\n<\/p><p>\nLater that night, after meeting with the missionaries, seven M Men and Gleaners caroled for\nus at the chapel. It was comforting to know that wherever we went in the world, we could\nhave had the same experience.\n<\/p><p>\nThen there were two branches in Perth. Today, Perth is another of our brand new stakes.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Other mission experiences<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnother experience: How many of us have heard our Primary children sing \"I Am a Child of\nGod\"? I think you may not have really heard it until you are met on the pier on the little\nisland of Rarotonga by 32 beautiful Rarotongan children, with brown eyes dancing, truly\nsinging with their hearts, \"I Am a Child of God.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnother of my assignments has been to help promote the work in the intermountain and\nIndian missions. What a revealing experience it is to get to know our Lamanite brethren&mdash;how\nthey are growing in wisdom, experience, and spirituality.\n<\/p><p>\nI have seen many fine Indian men honoring the priesthood and holding positions of leadership\nin branches and districts, who, months before, were yielding to the temptations of Satan. I\nhave seen these marvelous transitions come into the lives of many. Today they live in better\nhomes and receive better educations.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Assignment to British Isles<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn the past two months, it has been my good fortune to be assigned to work with Elder\nSpencer W. Kimball in the British Isles, where we have seven great missions. In Ireland, we\nsaw 50 Irish boys and girls participate in a dance and music festival. They were so happy. It\nwas their first. Next year it will be bigger and better, because the young members are\nbeginning to feel the coalescing spirit of membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints. That night we met a fine young Chinese man who had flown back at his\nown expense from another country to take part in the festival so as not to disappoint the\nleaders. He had been working in Ireland and had been transferred by his company, but he had\nthe spirit of a true Latter-day Saint. Shall the youth of Zion falter?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Influence on families<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn each of the missions, there were strong testimonies borne by mature members who\nappreciated the light of the gospel in their lives. I have actually stood by the baptismal font\nand watched entire families being baptized the same evening and then confirmed members of\nthe Church by authorized servants of the Lord. By the power of the Holy Ghost, they are\nbeginning to feel the tie that binds.\n<\/p><p>\nAgain in each of the missions, there was a goodly number of missionaries who, tearfully,\nthankfully, reported in testimony meeting that inactive parents were now active and either\nlooking forward to or going to the temple; or, if one was not a member, he or she was\nstudying with stake missionaries. Some were waiting to be baptized by returning missionary\nsons, and then whole families were being brought into activity because of having a worthy\nmissionary son or daughter.\n<\/p><p>\nAt a youth conference testimony meeting, a lovely young British mother told of her children\ngoing to the brand new church built in the neighborhood. When she discovered it was the\nMormon Primary they were attending, she forbade them to go again. However, as it\nsometimes happens, they did go again and again, and she could see no real harm. One\nevening as she went up to tuck them in, she overheard her young son's prayer, \"Please help\nme to teach my mum the gospel.\" Heavenly Father heard that prayer. Today there is a whole\nnew family feeling the tie.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Obedience the tie that binds<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAs we flew over the house tops from country to country, a passage of scripture kept recurring\nto me, that of God speaking to Moses: \n<\/p><p>\n\"All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do . . . that he\nmight make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that\nproceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21274\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21274)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21274)\">Deut. 8:1,3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe same doctrine was taught by the Savior in the meridian of time: \n<\/p><p>\n\"It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31733\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31733)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31733)\">Luke 4:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis word of God is contained in the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ as it has been\nrestored to the earth in this day. It is going forth at this very moment in many tongues to\nmany peoples. Obedience to the word of God is the tie that will bind people, cities,\ncommunities, states, and nations together. It will tie up the wounds of an ailing world and\nbring peace on earth.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless each of us to make this so. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
