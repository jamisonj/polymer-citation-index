The President of the Church, as a prophet, is God\u2019s representative on earth and is appointed to lead his church. This has been true in the past as recorded in the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Book of Mormon, and in this, the last dispensation of the fulness of times with the restoration of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/hear-the-prophets-voice-and-obey.p60\" class=\"\">He who holds all the priesthood keys authorizing those saving blessings is the living prophet. The Lord has declared \u201cthere is never but one on the earth at a time on whom this power and the keys of this priesthood are conferred\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20435\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20435)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20435)\">D&amp;C 132:7<\/a><\/span>).

He was prepared and foreordained before the foundation of the world. For over a half century, he has been taught and tutored by Apostles and prophets with whom he has served. He is wise. He is caring. He speaks for the Lord. His is the voice to which we should now respond. Our spiritual safety lies in turning to the clear voice of our living prophet. If we listen to his voice and obey his counsel, we will be able to live as Christ would have us live and endure to the end so that one day we, along with our families, will return back into the presence of our Heavenly Father and our Savior Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/hear-the-prophets-voice-and-obey.p62\" class=\"\">I humbly add my testimony to the testimonies of all who have sustained the prophet this day in this solemn assembly in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
