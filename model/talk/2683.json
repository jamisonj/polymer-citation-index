As President Kimball addressed the Stockholm Area Conference he pointed out the great need of home teaching and family home evenings to help neutralize the ills of the world. He said: \u201cThe spirit of the times is worldliness. Hoodlumism is common. Supposedly good youth from recognized good families express their revolt in destructive acts. Many defy and resist the law-enforcing officers. Respect for authority, secular, religious, and political, seems to be at a low ebb. Immorality, drug addiction, and general moral and spiritual deterioration seem to be increasing, and the world is in turmoil. But in our time the Lord has offered his ageless program in new dress and it gives promise to return the world to sane living, to true family life, family interdependence. It is to return the father to his rightful place at the head of the family, to bring mother home from social life and employment, the children away from unlimited fun and frolic. The home teaching program with its crowning activity, the family home evening will neutralize the ill effects only if people will apply the remedy.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Jan. 1975, pp. 3\u20134.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/family-home-evening.p4\" class=\"\">In the October conference of 1964 President David O. McKay reintroduced a family home evening program designed to assist parents in teaching the gospel in the home. Since that time this important program has been emphasized by the Church. Monday evening has been set aside by the entire Church for holding family home evening. A beautiful manual is prepared each year by an expert staff of writers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/family-home-evening.p5\" class=\"\">Over 907,000 copies of the Family Home Evening Manual are now printed each year\u2014about 830,000 in English and 77,000 in seventeen other languages. They are distributed to forty-eight countries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/family-home-evening.p6\" class=\"\">In the Family Home Evening Manual of 1973\u201374 the First Presidency said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/family-home-evening.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cMay we remind you of just how important the family unit is in the overall plan of our Father in heaven. In fact, the Church organization exists to assist the family and its members in reaching exaltation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/family-home-evening.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cThe primary function of a Latter-day Saint home is to ensure that every family member works to create the climate and condition in which all can grow toward perfection. For the parents, this requires a dedication of time and energy far beyond the mere providing of their children\u2019s physical needs. For the children, this means controlling the natural tendency toward selfishness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/family-home-evening.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cParents and children must be willing to put family responsibilities first in order to achieve family exaltation.\u201d (p. 4.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/family-home-evening.p10\" class=\"\">Our family home evening program has received national attention. Many individuals and groups and organizations out of the Church have written for information on the program and requested the manual.

The late Mr. Louis Cassels of the United Press International wrote the following after visiting a family home evening:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/family-home-evening.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cA child gets his most important religious instruction at home. It is very difficult for Sunday School or any other agency of the church to communicate Christian faith to boys and girls who haven\u2019t been exposed to it through family life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/family-home-evening.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cAll denominations agree on this.

He told a group of Mormon leaders recently that \u2018the most important of the Lord\u2019s work will be that which we do within our own homes.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/family-home-evening.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cPresident Lee says family home evenings not only are an invaluable opportunity for religious instruction. They also serve to unite families, to bridge generation gaps, and to maintain communication between parents and children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/family-home-evening.p21\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018When the home functions properly, much has been done to prevent problems from happening,\u2019 the Mormon president told UPI. \u2018So much that we do, both in the world and the church, is done to compensate for failures in the home. We have found the Family Home Evening to be a great assistance to parents in fostering meaningful and close family relationships which help the home serve as a sanctuary from evil influences and as a source of strength to each family member.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/family-home-evening.p22\" class=\"\">Numerous mayors of cities and governors of states have recognized the virtue in family solidarity and know of the soundness the family home evening program is bringing about.
