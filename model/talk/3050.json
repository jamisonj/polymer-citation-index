I want to thank you for your responses. Many have done much to beautify their homes and their yards. Many others have followed the counsel to have their own gardens wherever it is possible so that we do not lose contact with the soil and so that we can have the security of being able to provide at least some of our food and necessities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-true-way-of-life-and-salvation.p5\" class=\"\">Grow all the food that you possibly can on your own property, if water is available; berry bushes, grapevines, and fruit trees are most desirable.

I feel the same sense of urgency about temple work for the dead as I do about the missionary work for the living, since they are basically one and the same. I have told my brethren of the General Authorities that this work for the dead is constantly on my mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-true-way-of-life-and-salvation.p7\" class=\"\">The First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve recently gave careful consideration as to how we can lengthen our stride in this tremendously important responsibility.

The title of it is \u201cCan You Have a Happier Family Life?\u201d It describes four qualities many parents miss in their family lives, and it offers a way to measure your family by these qualities and suggests a general plan for a happier family life and reports a specific example of a plan of action.

Before you try to get rid of it, you\u2019d better find out why all civilizations in history have clung to it.\u2019 I think your church\u2019s emphasis on it has been truly extraordinary.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-true-way-of-life-and-salvation.p16\" class=\"\">The gospel has been a family affair. By committing ourselves to having the regular and inspirational family home evening and by carefully planning the content of that evening, we are sending a signal to our children which they will remember forevermore. When thus we give our children of our own time, we are giving of our presence, a gift that is always noticed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-true-way-of-life-and-salvation.p17\" class=\"\">The <span class=\"emphasis\">Home Evening Manual<\/span> is replete with good suggestions, but it should never replace inspired parental development with regard to what should be done in a particular evening to meet particular needs. If we will feed our families from the gospel garden at home, then what they get from Church meetings can be a rich supplement, but not their only diet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-true-way-of-life-and-salvation.p18\" class=\"\">The home is the seedbed of Saints.

We love the women of our Church. We love them as deeply as our own wives, our mothers, our grandmothers, our sisters, and our friends. Someday, when the whole story of this and previous dispensations is told, it will be filled with courageous stories of our women, of their wisdom and their devotion, their courage, for one senses that perhaps, just as women were the first at the sepulchre of the Lord Jesus Christ after his resurrection, our righteous women have so often been instinctively sensitive to things of eternal consequence. We recognize, as one man has wisely said, that while we speak of the impact of one\u2019s mother\u2019s tongue with a lasting effect upon us, it is our mother\u2019s love which touches us everlastingly and so deeply.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-true-way-of-life-and-salvation.p29\" class=\"\">We worry, therefore, conversely over these trends which would reduce the mother\u2019s love in our world. God has placed women at the very headwaters of the human stream. So much of what our men and our institutions seek to do downstream in the lives of erring individuals is done to compensate for early failures. Likewise, so much of life\u2019s later rejoicing is a reflection of a woman\u2019s work well done at the headwaters of the home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-true-way-of-life-and-salvation.p30\" class=\"\">It was Goethe who said, \u201cThe Eternal Feminine draws us on.\u201d (Johann W. von Goethe, <span class=\"emphasis\">Faust.<\/span>)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-true-way-of-life-and-salvation.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cA good woman,\u201d as the scriptures tell us, \u201cis the glory of the man.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"648\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 648)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(648)\">1 Cor. 11:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-true-way-of-life-and-salvation.p32\" class=\"\">The scriptures remind us that \u201cWomen have claim on their husbands for their maintenance, until their husbands are taken.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17070\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17070)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17070)\">D&amp;C 83:2<\/a><\/span>.)
