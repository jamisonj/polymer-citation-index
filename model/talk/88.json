As I\nhave sat through these sessions, considering the personnel of the General Authorities, I have\nbeen greatly impressed with the wealth of background and secular training that they bring to\nthis work, men who, before their calling, were bankers, business men, farmers, laborers,\nengineers, chemists, dentists, attorneys-at-law, schoolteachers. All of them with varying\nsecular background, yet all of them unitedly bound together with one thing&mdash;a tremendous\ntestimony of the truth of Mormonism! Every one of us was moved with the testimonies of\nBrother Kimball and Brother Benson yesterday.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been impressed with how many times the necessity for loving one another has been\nmentioned in these sessions.\n<\/p><p>\nThou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy\nmind. This is the first and great commandment.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33852\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33852)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33852)\">Matt. 22:37-39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nDIVINE GUIDANCE NECESSARY IN CIVIL GOVERNMENT\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a certain disposition among a good many people, and some of our own faith are not\nentirely free from it, to criticize any pulpit utterance which dwells on major\ncurrent issues. There are those among us who suspect insidious political intent, if, from the\npulpit, even so much as mention of government is made, but religion is of no value\nWhatsoever if it deals only in platitudinous generalities.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are the children of God, literally. That being the case, God's word should be uppermost in\nour minds in trying to bring about worth-while government. Until we as a people in\nparticular, and the sons and daughters of God in general, realize that our civil governments\nwill be failures so long as they are not based upon divine guidance, so long will we continue\nto have strife, conflict, and bloodshed.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE KINGDOM OF GOD BASED UPON LOVE\n<\/p><p>\nWe are facing a time when, unless men repent and accept in very deed the Gospel of Christ,\nwe shall see revolution in our own country. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy\nheart and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. . . . Thou shalt love thy neighbor as\nthyself. Upon these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33856\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33856)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33856)\">Matt. 22:37-40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nUntil we can be big enough, individually, to love our neighbors, and together love each other,\nwe shall fail. That has some pretty practical and definite applications. It means, for one thing,\nthat men who call themselves employers and men who call themselves laborers must get\ntogether and work together and love one another, literally. So long as we have on the one\nhand employers who are motivated only by profit, and who, for their profit, are willing to\nexploit labor at any cost, and so long as on the other side of the fence we have men who call\nthemselves laborers, and who band themselves together, and make unjust demands at any cost,\nso long as we have groups like these fighting each other, we have no hope for establishing the\nkingdom of God upon the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nClass hatred is growing, even within the confines of our own country. While many were\ninclined, a while ago, to laugh at the \"zoot suit\" riots, they were but symptoms of basic social\ndisease. We must learn to love one another. Successful government will be impossible without\nit.\n<\/p><p>\nThis body of Priesthood, together with all others holding the Priesthood, has a tremendous\nresponsibility in persuading men to work together. The magnificent material accomplishment\nof fifty million cans of food, that President Clark has told us about, is of less importance in\nmy estimation than the brotherhood, the increased love for one another, that has resulted from\npeople getting together and working shoulder to shoulder.\n<\/p><p>\nPRIESTHOOD GIVEN BECAUSE OF WORTHINESS\n<\/p><p>\nNot long ago in one of our council meetings, President Clark called attention to the fact that\nthere had just been called to the office of the Patriarch in a certain stake a man who was a\njanitor. President Clark pointed out that there was an evidence of the strength of\nMormonism&mdash;a job that is looked upon by the world as a lowly job, and yet among the\nLatter-day Saints a man so employed, because of his righteousness and his integrity, could\nreceive the patriarchal Priesthood, and even the men and women who enjoyed the cleanliness\nof the building which he cared for would go to him in reverence and respect\nfor their patriarchal blessings.\n<\/p><p>\nJUST CRITICISM HELPFUL\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we can love one another, we will be well on our way to the solution of our problems.\nIt is well for us not to be led astray by words. Calling a government democratic, does not\nmake it so, any more than calling a man a villain makes him a scoundrel. We need vision. It\nis so easy to denounce without judgment.\n<\/p><p>\nThe other day one of our young men, in most vitriolic language, was denouncing the\nbureaucracy of our present government, and someone asked him, to his great embarrassment,\nwhat a bureaucrat was, and he did not have the slightest idea, but in his home he had heard\nbureaucrats denounced. Now, that sort of uncritical denunciation is foolish.\n<\/p><p>\nIt behooves us, as men holding the Priesthood, to examine governmental procedures and if\nthose procedures result in the general good, if those procedures are compatible with the\nGospel, the Lord's word, it is our business to foster them, and if necessary fight for them, just\nas it is our business to examine governmental procedures, and where we find them out of\nharmony with the Lord's word, to fight against them, no matter what high-sounding names\nthose procedures may be given.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, let us not be discouraged because we are what is called a minority. What is a\nminority? The Latin has a motto, <i>multum in parvo<\/i>: \"Much in small space.\" In the field of\nbiochemistry it has been proved that one part of adrenalin&mdash;one of the endocrine secretions&mdash;in\n100,000 parts of water, will cause certain live tissue to react. In statistical terms that one part\nin 100,000 is a minority.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus of Nazareth, in terms of the census, was a pitiful, almost a ridiculous, minority; but\nJesus the Christ, the Son of God, is the greatest power we know, before whom ultimately\nevery knee shall bow (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41220\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41220)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41220)\">Philip. 2:10<\/a><\/span>).\nLet us not be discouraged by the specious argument that we are of\nrelatively little moment because we are a minority.\n<\/p><p>\nPOWER IN THE PRIESTHOOD\n<\/p><p>\nWe have the Priesthood of Almighty God, and if we are righteous and magnify it, and\nexercise it, there is no limit to what we can accomplish in the way of good, no matter how\ngreat are the mere numbers arrayed against us.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that we may magnify the Priesthood, that we may have vision, that we may not be led\nastray by mere names, that we shall be able intelligently to examine governmental procedures,\nand that bringing our judgment to the matter of government, we shall have wisdom and\nunusual discernment in selecting men for office who will stand for government that is\ncompatible with the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nI have not heard of it, but I hope that in some of our international conferences the men who\nare our leaders are big enough to get down on their knees and ask for divine guidance. I have\nnot heard that it was done at Casablanca; I have not heard that it was done at Washington; I\nhave not heard that it was done in Quebec. It may have been. I hope it was.\nBut when we can have men who realize that the solution to our problems must be in terms of\nthe word of the Lord, then shall we have just government; then can we fight a just battle.\n<\/p><p>\nWe can exercise great influence. This little numerical minority must be the leaven which\nleavens the lump of the world. It is our responsibility. Where much is given, much is\nexpected. God grant that we can live up to our responsibility, I pray, in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
