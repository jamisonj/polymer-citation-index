If music were the language of angels, I have heard angels speak this morning.\n<\/p><p>\nAbout one hundred forty years ago, an early American historian directed a youth Joseph\nSmith, to a hidden deposit of golden plates upon which was engraved a history of the early\ninhabitants of the Americas. The engravings, subsequently translated by Joseph Smith by the\ngift and power of God, comprise the Book of Mormon. The historian was Moroni&mdash;a\nresurrected prophet.\n<\/p><p>\nIn an interview with a prospective young missionary, I quite routinely asked: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Do you believe Joseph Smith was a prophet of God?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"I know Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"What is your feeling about the Book of Mormon?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"I know the Book of Mormon is true,\" he replied.\n<\/p><p>\nHis quick emphatic reply prompted me to say, \"How can you be so positive about it?\"\n<\/p><p>\nHis response again was emphatic, impressive, and brief. Three short words conveyed it:\n\"<i>I've read it<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThere are undoubtedly many of you members of the Church listening to me at this moment\nwho could similarly testify to the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon because <i>you've read it.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nOne scholarly man told me that he could not bring himself to read the Book of Mormon\nbecause of the fantastic story concerning its origin.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Let me see those golden plates&mdash;seeing is believing&mdash;\" he said.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Perhaps,\" I admitted, hastening to explain that Joseph Smith returned them to the Angel\nMoroni who had told him that a sealed part or section of the plates would be translated at a\nfuture time when the world was better prepared to receive its message.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well,\" he smiled as he answered facetiously, \"when Moroni returns them for translation, give\nme a ring. I'd like to ask him a few questions.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI suppose there are critics and skeptics whose attitudes toward the Book of Mormon are\nreflected in this man's philosophy&mdash;\"seeing is believing.\" I suppose, too, that some of our\nyoung missionaries have wished that Moroni had left the plates with Joseph Smith so that he\ncould have deposited them in some public place, a museum perhaps, where investigators might\ncome to see for themselves and thus be convinced, since seeing is believing.\n<\/p><p>\nI wonder! And my wondering inclines me to doubt&mdash;even question the idea that&mdash;\"seeing is\nbelieving\"&mdash;particularly in its application to the golden plates.\n<\/p><p>\nWere any of our early missionaries or others ever able to support \"seeing is believing\" with\nevidence that the people who saw the papyri scrolls with the Egyptian mummies readily\naccepted Joseph Smith's translation of one of the scrolls as divinely inspired? The book of\nAbraham in the Pearl of Great Price constitutes this translation. Those mummies and scrolls\nwere exhibited over a period of two years, throughout towns and cities east of the\nAppalachian Mountains. For another nine years they were in Joseph Smith's possession, and\nafter his death they reportedly reposed in museums, first, in St. Louis and later in Chicago,\nwhere they were supposedly destroyed in the great fire of 1871. Thousands of people must\nhave seen them. No one, so far as I am able to determine, ever questioned their genuineness,\nbut how many, because they felt \"seeing is believing,\" accepted Joseph Smith's translation as\nthe handiwork of God and petitioned for membership in his (God's) Church? Very, very\nfew&mdash;I'm sure. What reason have we then to suspect that seeing the Book of Mormon plates\nwould be different? Were they available for inspection people seeing them may admit that\ngolden plates exist, and that there are engravings upon them&mdash;which scholars cannot\ntranslate, but would that knowledge silence the attacks of skeptics who surely\nwould impute them to be spurious? Would it abate the endless disputations about their origin,\nthe angel, and the translation by the gift and power of God? Again, I wonder. The more I\nponder the suggestion that \"seeing is believing\" the more convinced I am that the Lord's way\nwas best&mdash;he kept the plates. He said to his prophet Isaiah: \"For my thoughts are not your\nthoughts, neither are your ways my ways . . . For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so\nare my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25210\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25210)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25210)\">Isa. 55:8-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYes, the Lord's way was best.\n<\/p><p>\n(1) His way&mdash;keeping the plates&mdash;safely preserves them against the time when the world is\nready for a translation of the part thereof which is sealed. Joseph Smith was not permitted to\ntranslate this sealed part because the hearts of the people were not susceptible to the divine\ntruth contained therein. Concerning it, the historian-prophet Moroni wrote: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . there never were greater things made manifest than those which . . . the Lord hath\ncommanded me to write them . . . And he commanded me that I should seal them up; and he\nalso hath commanded that I should seal up the interpretation thereof . . . until the day that\nthey [the Gentiles] shall repent of their iniquity, and become clean before the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22216\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22216)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22216)\">Ether 4:4-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn fancy let's assume that the plates had been deposited with the mummies and the Egyptian\nscrolls in the Chicago museum. Both would then have been destroyed by fire. Joseph Smith\nnever did find time to translate the second scroll which he said contained the writings of\nJoseph, grandson of Abraham. Its contents are seemingly lost to the world. So, without the\nLord's intervention, \"the greater things made manifest\" in the sealed portion of the gold plates\nmay have been similarly lost to the world. Surely God's \"ways are higher than your ways and\nmy thoughts than your thoughts.\" I am grateful that the Lord kept the plates. Sometime, I\nhope to read the \"greater things\" sealed therein.\n<\/p><p>\n(2) His way&mdash;keeping the plates&mdash;complied with and satisfied his own divine law of\nwitnesses which is \"In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3040\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3040)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3040)\">2 Cor. 13:1<\/a><\/span>). He gave this law to Moses for the children of Israel\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21235\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21235)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21235)\">Deut. 17:6<\/a><\/span>). He\ntaught this law to his disciples when he walked with them on earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35059\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35059)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35059)\">Matt. 18:15-16<\/a><\/span>); he\ninspired his servant Paul to teach this law to the Corinthians\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3041\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3041)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3041)\">2 Cor. 13:1<\/a><\/span>); and he literally\nconformed to this law in this last dispensation by supplying twelve witnesses of the golden\nplates, Joseph Smith and eleven others.\n<\/p><p>\n(3) His way&mdash;keeping the plates&mdash;satisfies adequately the civil laws of the land with respect\nto witnesses. Twelve witnesses in any civil court comprise a jury whose verdict should\ncompletely satisfy the demands of civil law. The jury's verdict was:\n\"<i>The plates exist<\/i>&mdash;<i>we saw them<\/i>.\" This evidence is incontrovertible.\n<\/p><p>\nListen for a moment to the witnesses:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and\npeople, unto whom this work shall come: That we . . . have seen the plates . . ., and we also\nknow that they have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared\nit unto us . . . And we also testify that we have seen the engravings which are upon the\nplates . . . And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God . . . brought and\nlaid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon . . .\" So\nspoke three of them (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43107\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43107)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43107)\">BM Three Wit.<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nEight others spoke as follows: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall\ncome: That Joseph Smith, Jun., . . . has shown unto us the plates . . . which have the\nappearance of gold . . . and we also saw the engravings thereon . . . And this we bear record\nwith words of soberness, that . . . we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said\nSmith has got the plates of which we have spoken\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43119\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43119)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43119)\">BM Eight Wit.<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI have deleted from these testimonies, in the interest of brevity, many interesting\nstatements which every investigator of the work should read. They may be found on one of\nthe preface pages of the Book of Mormon.\n<\/p><p>\nNone of the witnesses ever denied his testimony. Each to his last breath and some with their\nlast breath declared in substance, \"I saw the plates&mdash;the work is true.\" Two\nof the twelve witnesses sealed their testimonies with their blood; five were excommunicated\nfrom the Church; two others withdrew from the Church; but despite disaffection toward the\nChurch, enmity toward the Prophet, adversity, and persecution, not one of them ever denied\nhis testimony.\n<\/p><p>\n(4) His way&mdash;keeping the plates&mdash;left to the world, in lieu of the plates, which man could\nnot read, a true translation thereof which man can read, because it is now translated into\ntwenty-four languages. It is the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith translated it by the gift and\npower of God.\n<\/p><p>\nThe intrinsic value of the plates is not their gold content, but is their message content. The\nLord left that message to the world.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is said, \"The proof of the pudding is in the eating.\" So is the proof of the Book of Mormon\nin the reading. The young missionary who said, \"I know the Book of Mormon is true because\nI've read it,\" is not unlike thousands of you who are listening to me, who, too, can testify that\nyou know it is true because you've read it.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd when you read it, you discovered a key which unlocked for you a source of evidence\nwhich proved beyond the shadow of a doubt the divine source of its origin.\n<\/p><p>\nThis key was your reward for reading the book, from cover to cover, for only those who\npursue their reading to the closing pages will find it. This is the key: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the\nEternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with\nsincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you,\nby the power of the Holy Ghost\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38282\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38282)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38282)\">Moro. 10:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis promise is not unlike a promise made by our Lord and Master nineteen hundred years\nago when he stood upon a mount in Galilee and spoke: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Ask and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto\nyou\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35025\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35025)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35025)\">Matt. 7:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnother time he said: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men\nliberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26138\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26138)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26138)\">James 1:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph Smith, the youth, did \"ask,\" and he did \"seek\" and he did \"knock\" and there was\n\"opened unto\" him&mdash;golden plates&mdash;delivered by one Moroni, an early American\nhistorian-prophet; which Joseph translated by the gift and power of God. And now by this\nsame power or by the power of the Holy Ghost, he (God) has specifically promised all who\nwill read the book \"with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ,\" to \"manifest\nthe truth of it unto you.\"\n<\/p><p>\n(5) God's way&mdash;keeping the plates&mdash;provided a precious key&mdash;a divine key which if used\nas many of you have used it, will unlock the door to: \n<\/p><p>\n&mdash;Knowledge that the \"Book of Mormon is true.\" So said the young missionary. I add my\nwitness.\n<\/p><p>\n&mdash;Knowledge that the Bible contains the word of God&mdash;the Book of Mormon is its witness.\n<\/p><p>\n&mdash;Knowledge that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.\n<\/p><p>\n&mdash;Knowledge that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God&mdash;the Book of Mormon is his\nwitness.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, that he was visited by one Moroni an early\nAmerican historian-prophet who directed him to a hidden deposit of golden plates. The\nengravings thereon he [Joseph Smith], translated by the gift and power of God and thus\nproduced the Book of Mormon.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is my humble testimony. I bear it gladly, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
