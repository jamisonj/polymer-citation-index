I think more properly for us, the gospel is the <span class=\"emphasis\">way<\/span> to salvation, and surely there is no other way. Mortals will get there through the gospel of Jesus Christ, or they will not receive salvation, meaning eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel.p4\" class=\"\">The word <span class=\"emphasis\">gospel<\/span> means literally \u201cglad tidings\u201d or \u201cgood news.\u201d If you were to receive the news that a long-lost relative of whom you had never heard had died and left you a million dollars, that quite possibly could be considered good news, but it would not be the gospel. The gospel is, then, a particular kind of good news. It is the good news about Jesus Christ and his atoning sacrifice for our sins and the original transgression that took place in the Garden of Eden.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel.p5\" class=\"\">If we were to search for the best definition of what is contained in the gospel of Jesus Christ, we could hardly do better than look to the Lord Jesus Christ\u2019s definition of what his gospel is. We read from 3 Nephi 27, beginning with verse 13, \u201cBehold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you\u2014that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6011\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6011)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6011)\">3 Ne. 27:13<\/a><\/span>] I presume we\u2014you and I\u2014also came into this world to do the will of the Father because our Father sent us, too.

But he went.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel.p11\" class=\"\">Jesus was lifted up upon the cross so that he might draw all men unto him. The question could be asked, How could being lifted up upon the cross possibly draw all men unto him? Many men have been crucified without drawing all men to them. Well, it is necessary to understand who he was and what he was doing upon the earth. He was the sinless Son of God who had been sent to the earth to pay the price for sin (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"749\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 749)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(749)\">1 Cor. 6:20<\/a><\/span>), both the original transgression in the Garden of Eden, and individual sins. The transgression in the Garden of Eden brought death into the world\u2014both temporal death, the separation of the spirit from the body, and spiritual death, the separation of the spirit from the presence of God. In atoning for the original transgression he would bring to pass the resurrection, the rejoining of the spirits and bodies of all mankind. By paying the price for individual sins, he would open the door to eternal life for all to return to live in the presence of God, thereby eliminating spiritual death. Neither of these acts could man do for himself. Only Jesus could provide the way and the means to save fallen man. He did it because he loved mankind. Said he: \u201cGreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29261\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29261)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29261)\">John 15:13<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel.p12\" class=\"\">When we understand this, it is easy to love our Redeemer. His sacrifice demonstrates infinite love for us; it begets infinite love in us for him who gave his life as a ransom for all. \u201cThere was no other good enough to pay the price of sin.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 194.) As he was lifted up (crucified) by men, wherein he made the resurrection a reality, so shall all men, whether they be good or bad, be lifted up, or resurrected, by the Father. Resurrection is a free gift from Jesus Christ. There needs to be nothing done to receive it except to be born on the earth. However, those who are filthy, in the resurrection will be filthy still; and those who are righteous will be righteous still. In the words of the Master, the resurrection takes place so we can be judged. From this statement it appears that the Judgment requires the spirit and the body inseparably connected in order to receive a fulness of joy, meaning exaltation\u2014or damnation. And what will be the basis of the Judgment? It will be according to the deeds done in the flesh\u2014not what we did before we were born or what we do after we die, but what we do while we are here in mortality. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"9448\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9448)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9448)\">Alma 5:15<\/a><\/span>.) We were all born; we will all die. So the word of the Lord is: \u201cThis life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cYe cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9474\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9474)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9474)\">Alma 34:32, 34<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel.p14\" class=\"\">It appears that we do not change when we die, which means that if we are addicted to drugs, bad habits, and evil desires when we go out of this life, those influences will probably follow us. Therefore, repentance and forgiveness, which come under the heading of fearing God and keeping his commandments, are our whole duty here in mortality. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"21445\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21445)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21445)\">Eccl. 12:13<\/a><\/span>.) Mortality is, in reality, a very, very short period. It is literally a snap of the fingers compared to an eternity. It is so short that we can do it. We can prevail. Why, you can stand your foot in a vise for a while if you know it\u2019s going to be released soon. It is when you can see no relief in sight that it becomes unbearable. Yes, earthly probation is short compared to eternity, but so very much is riding on how we handle the trials and temptations of the flesh. It is, as the Lord said in essence to the Prophet Joseph: thine afflictions will be but for a small moment, then if thou endureth it well thy God shall stand by thee forever and ever.

The works the Master refers to here, I believe, are the works that he inspires us to do by his Holy Spirit. Paul, speaking of those who through the gospel have covenanted to do the will of Jesus, said, \u201cFor it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41309\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41309)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41309)\">Philip. 2:13<\/a><\/span>.)

Then the Master tells us how we can make his atoning sacrifice effective in our lives and get credit for his works of righteousness. \u201cAnd it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end\u201d\u2014and I would add in repentance, including obedience and forgiving others\u2014\u201cbehold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6014\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6014)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6014)\">3 Ne. 27:16<\/a><\/span>.)

All too often, the justice of God seems to be relegated to the back burner, while the mercy of God seems to get the lion\u2019s share of attention. I presume this is true because we are all hoping for mercy and trying to avoid justice if at all possible. But it is a fact that God is just, and mercy cannot rob justice. Justice will have her due! It is also a fact that mercy, while it cannot rob justice, can satisfy the demands of justice in one instance and one instance only. That is beautifully stated by Amulek in the Book of Mormon:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd behold, this is the whole meaning of the law [of Moses], every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd thus mercy can <span class=\"emphasis\">satisfy<\/span> the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the <span class=\"emphasis\">demands<\/span> of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9472\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9472)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9472)\">Alma 34:14\u201316<\/a><\/span>; italics added.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel.p21\" class=\"\">Then, while mercy cannot rob justice, mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, but only in the instance where we exercise faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel.p22\" class=\"\">The Master told the Nephites:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd this is the word which he [the Father] hath given unto the children of men.
