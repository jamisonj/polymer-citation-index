As they started to town, the father rode the donkey.

In addition to our wisdom, we add the help of the Holy Ghost through our prayers of faith, asking for spiritual guidance and strength.

They gave me permission to share their story with you in the hope that it might help someone who has to make a similar decision in his or her life. About three to four years ago, Joe was an alcoholic. Linda, while she did not drink, was co-dependent emotionally on the behavior of an alcoholic husband. She was nearing a nervous breakdown. She had made the decision to save herself and the children from the manipulative behavior of a husband suffering from alcoholism. So she left home, taking the children, except for a fourteen-year-old son.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/making-righteous-choices-at-the-crossroads-of-life.p27\" class=\"\">Joe related to me the depression and despair he felt the night Linda left him. Somewhere in the middle of the night, about 2:00 or 3:00 <span class=\"small\">A.M.<\/span>, Joe awoke. He reached out in prayer to his Heavenly Father and prayed until dawn. It was his Gethsemane. He cried out to the Lord and asked for help with his affliction and expressed love for his caring wife, who had confronted him with his abusive behavior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/making-righteous-choices-at-the-crossroads-of-life.p28\" class=\"\">When Joe arose in the early morning light, he made a commitment not to take another drink of alcohol.

His testimony as he talks with others in Alcoholics Anonymous is that God lives and answers prayers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/making-righteous-choices-at-the-crossroads-of-life.p29\" class=\"\">There is another story about a little boy named Josh who was having terrible nightmares that were frightening him.

He then asked his Heavenly Father to have the nightmares stop and send him a confirmation through his feelings during the prayer. He said no more.
