I know that you would have appreciated hearing from him. I know likewise that I am a poor substitute. It has been wonderful that he and President Romney have been able to be with us. Just to see them has lifted the hearts of many, many people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/let-us-go-forward.p4\" class=\"\">While we were at lunch, we sat with a man who is now a grandfather who said that his little four-year-old grandson came to him the other day and said, \u201cGrandpa, why do the hummingbirds hum?\u201d Grandpa said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Why?\u201d The little boy said, \u201cBecause they don\u2019t know the words.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/let-us-go-forward.p5\" class=\"\">It is unlikely that we will remember very many of the words that we\u2019ve heard during the meetings of this conference. But I hope that we shall be able to \u201chum\u201d the spirit of this conference and that we shall carry with us a great feeling of uplift because of our participation together. It has been a glorious time. The Spirit of the Lord has been with us. We have every reason to be grateful. We have been refreshed in our testimonies and strengthened in our faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/let-us-go-forward.p6\" class=\"\">We have heard sound counsel from the Brethren who have spoken to us. Having heard it, I hope we will read it when the proceedings of the conference are published, and again savor to our benefit that which has been said.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/let-us-go-forward.p7\" class=\"\">They have testified of our Eternal Father and of his Beloved Son, and they have done so by the power of the Holy Ghost. By that same power they have spoken of the Prophet Joseph and that which came of his faith and industry and calling as a servant of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/let-us-go-forward.p8\" class=\"\">They have counseled us concerning our families, our lives, our affairs.

We have had mentioned in this conference some of our critics. They mock that which is most holy to us. They jest over and hold up to ridicule that which has come by revelation from the Almighty. Any man who tries to find humor at the expense of that which is sacred to another is deeply flawed in character. Shame on those who stoop to such actions in the name of fun and on those who witness and laugh. Simple courtesy would dictate a decent respect for that which is sacred to neighbors and associates in one\u2019s society.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/let-us-go-forward.p10\" class=\"\">The Lord himself has said, \u201cRemember that that which cometh from above is sacred, and must be spoken with care, and by constraint of the Spirit.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17986\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17986)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17986)\">D&amp;C 63:64<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/let-us-go-forward.p11\" class=\"\">As has been indicated, there are a few who have taken it upon themselves as their mission to belittle and demean and destroy the faith of the weak, with a badly flawed argument that we are not Christians.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/let-us-go-forward.p12\" class=\"\">To all of these we have a twofold answer, quietly spoken.

Through the very means used by those who have opposed the work of God, He has brought out good for Zion. Yet, it is written, and I believe it is true, that although it must needs be that offenses come, woe unto them by whom they come; but they are in the hands of the Lord as we are. We bring no railing accusation against them. We are willing to leave them in the hands of the Almighty to deal with them as seemeth Him good. Our business is to work righteousness in the earth, to seek for the development of a knowledge of God\u2019s will and of God\u2019s ways, and of His great and glorious truths which He has revealed through the instrumentality of Joseph the Prophet, not only for the salvation of the living but for the redemption and salvation of the dead.\u201d (in Conference Report, Apr. 1908, pp. 2\u20133.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/let-us-go-forward.p21\" class=\"\">And so we let the matter rest there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/let-us-go-forward.p22\" class=\"\">Now let those of us who have traveled to the conference return to our homes with resolution in our hearts, and those of us who have participated in the conference by means of satellite transmission, television, and radio resolve also that we shall try a little harder to live the standards of the gospel, of which we have heard these days; that we shall lower our voices of criticism and negativism; that we will look for good in the world; that as employees we will be honest with our employers in giving of our time and of our talents; that we shall cultivate within our hearts a love one for another, both within and without the Church; that as husbands and wives we shall be true to one another in every respect; that every husband and holder of the priesthood will treat his companion and children with love and deference; that we will cultivate in our homes family prayer, making it the habit of our daily lives; that we will deal honestly with all men and walk humbly and obediently with God our Eternal Father.
