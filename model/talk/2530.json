The destiny we desire is an inheritance in the celestial mansions prepared by our Savior for the faithful of God\u2019s children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p8\" class=\"\">We are not born into this world with fixed habits.

Good habits are developed in the workshop of our daily lives. It is not in the great moments of test and trial that character is built. That is only when it is displayed. The habits that direct our lives and form our character are fashioned in the often uneventful, commonplace routine of life. They are acquired by practice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p11\" class=\"\">Solomon the wise taught, \u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41523\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41523)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41523)\">Prov. 22:6<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p12\" class=\"\">The good habits of a child\u2019s early training form the foundation for his future and sustain him in his later life. Parents, remember the Lord by revelation has given assurance that little children are incapable of committing sin, that they are alive in Christ, and that the devil has no power over them until they reach the age of accountability. The first eight years of a child\u2019s life are golden years the Lord has given parents to teach and train their children to form good habits and develop noble characters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p13\" class=\"\">This instruction was given by Brigham Young: \u201cI say to our young men, be faithful, for you do not know what is before you, and abstain from \u2026 bad habits.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 11:118.) This admonition can apply to both youth and adults.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p14\" class=\"\">We do not always know what lies ahead, but there is strength and safety in righteous conduct.

It is by such behavior that we harvest the real substance and value of life. The way we live outweighs any words we may profess to follow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p16\" class=\"\">Mahatma Gandhi said, \u201cMan\u2019s destined purpose is to conquer all habits, to overcome the evil in him and to restore good to its rightful place.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p17\" class=\"\">The ways of life acceptable to the people of the world are not always acceptable to God.

When first yielding to sin, one\u2019s resistance, self-control, and character are weakened and further transgressions usually result. With violation of spiritual laws and rejection of spiritual qualities, our powers of resistance are reduced. Eventually we seem to lose complete control of our ability to resist evil. Imagine the great misery suffered by a person who has practiced a vice for so long that he curses it, yet at the same time holds on to it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p24\" class=\"\">Our great challenge is to learn how to control ourselves. We must learn for ourselves and act for ourselves, being careful not to follow those who are not divinely led. We have a responsibility to thwart the work of the evil one\u2014not to aid or perpetuate his cause by yielding to his enticements to sin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p25\" class=\"\">Habits are subject to change and improvement, for the Lord has said, \u201cFor the power is in them [meaning people], wherein they are agents unto themselves.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16300\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16300)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16300)\">D&amp;C 58:28<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p26\" class=\"\">One cannot truthfully say he is confirmed in his bad habits, sins, or weaknesses to the point that they cannot be thrown off and repented of.

Self-mastery, self-control, and self-discipline are required strengths that enable us to set aside temptations to do wrong. It is a wonderful feeling to conquer wrong practices and to be free and unencumbered from their detrimental effects, both physically and spiritually. When we have conquered our bad habits and replaced them with good ones, living as we should, obedient and faithful, then we are on our way to the presence of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p37\" class=\"\">We should become so involved in acquiring good quality traits and participating in character-building activities that there is no time to engage in anything worthless or harmful.

With good habits we prepare ourselves for excellence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p39\" class=\"\">We need to ask ourselves, \u201cAre my usual thoughts and present actions worthy of eternal life?

We are instructed to make our home an abode of righteousness and honor. Honor is almost an old-fashioned word in today\u2019s world. It encompasses duty, responsibility, and respect for the eternal values. It also suggests a firm holding to codes of right behavior and the guidance of a high sense of stewardship.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p41\" class=\"\">Let us dare to be different from the ways of the world when its ways are not the ways of God. In a world troubled with selfish greed, dishonesty, and dishonor, let us set ourselves on a higher path, striving to develop and strengthen the qualities of unselfish service with wholehearted effort, dependability, honesty, morality, and every other good attribute that would lead us to integrity of character. We begin, then, with our thoughts and end with our eternal destiny. Our destiny is determined by our character, and our character is the sum and expression of our habits. Character is won by hard work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p42\" class=\"\">Ernest L. Wilkinson, speaking to the students of Brigham Young University, said: \u201cCharacter \u2026 is not something to be obtained by ease and indolence or being socially agreeable.

We grow by mastering tasks which others consider impossible.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p43\" class=\"\">Yes, the character required to attain eternal life must be formed in this life with good habits supplying the building material. When the qualities that are desirable in individuals become universal in the people of a nation, that nation also will have character. Goodness either in a person or in a nation is not simply the absence of wrongdoing. It is a love of and practice of all things that are true, honest, lovely, and of good report.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p44\" class=\"\">Let us set high goals for ourselves and work to achieve those goals by making God the center of our lives. He is the fountainhead of all truth, justice, and peace. Let us remember that God\u2019s laws are eternal. They do not change. There is no moral or spiritual code that grants permissiveness of conduct nor condones selection of evil or bad habits as a way to joyful living. Man may assume the right to revise the ways of God, but the Lord remains the same yesterday, today, and forever. God\u2019s standards and truths for his people will ever point the true way of life for all of his children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/good-habits-develop-good-character.p45\" class=\"\">Maintaining good personal habits which are pleasing to our Heavenly Father will strengthen our character, increase our influence for good, improve our example, bless our loved ones and friends, enrich our lives, and enable us to accomplish those things that yield true personal satisfaction and build peace and happiness in our hearts.
