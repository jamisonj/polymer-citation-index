Perhaps their most challenging realization, however, was not the hardship and danger they would endure but the fact that they would now be distanced from God, separated from Him with whom they had walked and talked, who had given them face-to-face counsel. After this conscious choice, as the record of creation says, \u201cthey saw him not; for they were shut out from his presence.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-02211_000_012\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117722\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117722)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117722)\">Moses 5:4<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Amidst all else that must have troubled them, surely this must have troubled them the most.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/the-ministry-of-angels.p6\" class=\"\">But God knew the challenges they would face, and He certainly knew how lonely and troubled they would sometimes feel. So He watched over His mortal family constantly, heard their prayers always, and sent prophets (and later apostles) to teach, counsel, and guide them.

When in Lehi\u2019s dream he found himself in a frightening place, \u201ca dark and dreary waste,\u201d as he described it, he was met by an angel, \u201ca man \u2026 dressed in a white robe; \u2026 he spake unto me,\u201d Lehi said, \u201cand bade me follow him.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-02211_000_012\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117396\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117396)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117396)\">1\u00a0Nephi 8:7, 5\u20136<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Lehi did follow him to safety and ultimately to the path of salvation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/the-ministry-of-angels.p10\" class=\"\">In the course of life all of us spend time in \u201cdark and dreary\u201d places, wildernesses, circumstances of sorrow or fear or discouragement.

These translate into individual and family concerns not only about homes in which to live and food available to eat but also about the ultimate safety and well-being of our children and the latter-day prophecies about our planet. More serious than these\u2014and sometimes related to them\u2014are matters of ethical, moral, and spiritual decay seen in populations large and small, at home and abroad. But I testify that angels are <span class=\"emphasis\">still<\/span> sent to help <span class=\"emphasis\">us,<\/span> even as they were sent to help Adam and Eve, to help the prophets, and indeed to help the Savior of the world Himself.

But when we speak of those who are instruments in the hand of God, we are reminded that not all angels are from the other side of the veil. Some of them we walk with and talk with\u2014here, now, every day. Some of them reside in our own neighborhoods. Some of them gave birth to us, and in my case, one of them consented to marry me. Indeed heaven never seems closer than when we see the love of God manifested in the kindness and devotion of people so good and so pure that <span class=\"emphasis\">angelic<\/span> is the only word that comes to mind. Elder James Dunn, from this pulpit just moments ago, used that word in his invocation to describe this Primary choir\u2014and why not? With the spirit, faces, and voices of those children in our mind and before our eyes, may I share with you an account by my friend and BYU colleague, the late Clyn\u00a0D. Barrus. I do so with the permission of his wife, Marilyn, and their family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/the-ministry-of-angels.p17\" class=\"\">Referring to his childhood on a large Idaho farm, Brother Barrus spoke of his nightly assignment to round up the cows at milking time. Because the cows pastured in a field bordered by the occasionally treacherous Teton River, the strict rule in the Barrus household was that during the spring flood season the children were <span class=\"emphasis\">never<\/span> to go after any cows who ventured across the river. They were always to return home and seek mature help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/the-ministry-of-angels.p18\" class=\"\">One Saturday just after his seventh birthday, Brother Barrus\u2019s parents promised the family a night at the movies if the chores were done on time. But when young Clyn arrived at the pasture, the cows he sought had crossed the river, even though it was running at high flood stage. Knowing his rare night at the movies was in jeopardy, he decided to go after the cows himself, even though he had been warned many times never to do so.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/the-ministry-of-angels.p19\" class=\"\">As the seven-year-old urged his old horse, Banner, down into the cold, swift stream, the horse\u2019s head barely cleared the water. An adult sitting on the horse would have been safe, but at Brother Barrus\u2019s tender age, the current completely covered him except when the horse lunged forward several times, bringing Clyn\u2019s head above water just enough to gasp for air.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/the-ministry-of-angels.p20\" class=\"\">Here I turn to Brother Barrus\u2019s own words:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/the-ministry-of-angels.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen Banner finally climbed the other bank, I realized that my life had been in grave danger and that I had done a terrible thing\u2014I had knowingly disobeyed my father. I felt that I could redeem myself only by bringing the cows home safely. Maybe then my father would forgive me. But it was already dusk, and I didn\u2019t know for sure where I was. Despair overwhelmed me. I was wet and cold, lost and afraid.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/the-ministry-of-angels.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cI climbed down from old Banner, fell to the ground by his feet, and began to cry.

Forgive me!\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/the-ministry-of-angels.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cI prayed for a long time. When I finally looked up, I saw through my tears a figure dressed in white walking toward me. In the dark, I felt certain it must be an angel sent in answer to my prayers. I did not move or make a sound as the figure approached, so overwhelmed was I by what I saw. Would the Lord really send an angel to me, who had been so disobedient?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/the-ministry-of-angels.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cThen a familiar voice said, \u2018Son, I\u2019ve been looking for you.\u2019 In the darkness I recognized the voice of my father and ran to his outstretched arms.
