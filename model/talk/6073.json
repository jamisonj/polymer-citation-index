It is three years now since you sustained me as President of the Church. May I say a few words of a personal nature? From the bottom of my heart I thank you for your love and support, for your prayers and faith. I am no longer a young man filled with energy and vitality. I am an old man trying to catch up with Brother Haight! I\u2019m given to meditation and prayer. I would enjoy sitting in a rocker, swallowing prescriptions, listening to soft music, and contemplating the things of the universe. But such activity offers no challenge and makes no contribution.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p5\" class=\"\">I wish to be up and doing. I wish to face each day with resolution and purpose. I wish to use every waking hour to give encouragement, to bless those whose burdens are heavy, to build faith and strength of testimony. Through the great kindness of a generous friend, I have been permitted to travel over the earth during these three years, visiting among our people in scores of nations. They have gathered by the thousands and tens of thousands. In one place there were more than 200 buses which brought them to the stadium.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p6\" class=\"\">I have been among the affluent but more so among the poor\u2014the poor of the earth and the poor of the Church. Some of their eyes are of a slightly different tilt than mine and their skin of a different color, but all of this disappears and becomes meaningless when I am among them. They all become our Father\u2019s sons and daughters, children with a divine birthright. We speak various languages, but we all understand the common tongue of brotherhood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p7\" class=\"\">It is wearisome to travel far to reach them. But it is difficult to leave them after being with them. Every place we go is only for a brief visit, a meeting scheduled to fit with other meetings. I wish we could stay longer. At the conclusion of the meeting we spontaneously sing \u201cGod Be with You Till We Meet Again\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 152). Handkerchiefs come out to dry tears and then are waved in affectionate farewell. Most recently we held 11 large meetings in different cities in Mexico in just seven days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p8\" class=\"\">It is the presence of wonderful people which stimulates the adrenaline.

I do spend a good deal of time there. But I feel a greater mission, a higher responsibility to be out among the people. These thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions now, all have one thing in common. They have an individual and personal testimony that this is the work of the Almighty, our Heavenly Father; that Jesus, the Lord, who died on the cross of Calvary and was resurrected, lives, a distinct and real and individual personality; that this is their work, restored in this last, wonderful dispensation of time; that the ancient priesthood has been restored with all of its keys and powers; that the Book of Mormon has spoken from the dust in testimony of the Redeemer of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p10\" class=\"\">This thing which we call testimony is the great strength of the Church. It is the wellspring of faith and activity. It is difficult to explain. It is difficult to quantify. It is an elusive and mysterious thing, and yet it is as real and powerful as any force on the earth. The Lord described it when He spoke to Nicodemus and said, \u201cThe wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29902\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29902)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29902)\">John 3:8<\/a><\/span>). This thing which we call testimony is difficult to define, but its fruits are plainly evident. It is the Holy Spirit testifying through us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p11\" class=\"\">Personal testimony is the factor which turns people around in their living as they come into this Church. This is the element which motivates the membership to forsake all in the service of the Lord. This is the quiet, encouraging voice which sustains without pause those who walk in faith down to the last days of their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p12\" class=\"\">It is a mysterious and wonderful thing, a gift from God to man. It overrides wealth or poverty when one is called to serve. This testimony which is carried in the hearts of our people motivates to an impelling duty. It is found in young and old. It is found in the seminary student, in the missionary, in the bishop and the stake president, in the mission president, in the Relief Society sister, in every General Authority. It is heard from those who hold no office other than membership. It is of the very essence of this work. It is what is moving the work of the Lord forward across the world. It impels to action. It demands that we do what we are asked to do. It brings with it the assurance that life is purposeful, that some things are of far greater importance than others, that we are on an eternal journey, that we are answerable unto God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p13\" class=\"\">Emily Dickinson captured an element of it when she wrote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I never saw a moor,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I never saw the sea;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Yet know I how the heather looks,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And what a wave must be.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I never spoke with God,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Nor visited in heaven;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Yet certain am I of the spot<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">As if the chart were given.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p22\" class=\"\">(\u201cChartless,\u201d in <span class=\"emphasis\">A Treasury of the Familiar,<\/span> ed.

It pushes every convert toward security in the faith. This is the thing which caused our forebears to leave England and the lands of Europe, to cross the seas with harrowing experiences, to walk what seemed endlessly beside plodding oxen or frail handcarts in the direction of these mountains of the West. They struggled, they worked, they died by the thousands on that fateful journey. That spirit of testimony has come down to us, who are the inheritors of their precious faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p24\" class=\"\">Wherever the Church is organized its power is felt. We stand on our feet and say that we know. We say it until it almost appears to be monotonous. We say it because we do not know what else to say. The simple fact is that we <span class=\"emphasis\">do<\/span> know that God lives, that Jesus <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> the Christ, and that this is their cause and their kingdom. The words are simple, the expression comes from the heart. It is at work wherever the Church is organized, wherever there are missionaries teaching the gospel, wherever there are members sharing their faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p25\" class=\"\">It is something that cannot be refuted. Opponents may quote scripture and argue doctrine endlessly. They can be clever and persuasive. But when one says, \u201cI know,\u201d there can be no further argument. There may not be acceptance, but who can refute or deny the quiet voice of the inner soul speaking with personal conviction?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p26\" class=\"\">Let me tell you a story that I heard recently in Mexico. In Torre\u00f3n I was driven about in the fine automobile that belonged to the man of whom I speak. His name is David Casta\u00f1eda.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p27\" class=\"\">Thirty years ago he, his wife, Tomasa, and their children lived on a dry little run-down ranch near Torre\u00f3n. They owned 30 chickens, 2 pigs, and 1 thin horse. The chickens provided a few eggs to sustain them and the means whereby to earn an occasional peso. They walked in poverty. Then the missionaries called on them. Sister Casta\u00f1eda said, \u201cThe elders took the blinders from our eyes and brought light into our lives. We knew nothing of Jesus Christ. We knew nothing of God until they came.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p28\" class=\"\">She had two years of schooling, her husband none. The elders taught them, and they were eventually baptized. They moved into the little town of Bermejillo. They were fortuitously led into the junk business, buying wrecked automobiles. This led to association with insurance companies and others. They gradually built a prosperous business in which the father and his five sons worked. With simple faith they paid their tithing. They put their trust in the Lord. They lived the gospel. They served wherever called to do so. Four of their sons and three of their daughters filled missions. The youngest son is presently serving in Oaxaca. They have now built a very substantial business and have been prospered therein. They have been taunted by their critics. Their answer is a testimony of the power of the Lord in their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/testimony.p29\" class=\"\">Some 200 of their family and friends have joined the Church due to their influence.
