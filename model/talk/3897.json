Kimball at the Regional Representatives Seminar of April 3, 1975, said, \u201cI believe in goals, but I believe that the individual should set his own. Goals should always be made to a point that will make us reach and strain.

The question is, \u201cFor what reasons?\u201d Is it because of good feelings and promised rewards, or is it because of fear of not living the commandments? The best motivation is toward the positive. Total commitment to correct gospel principles brings joy, satisfaction, and the abundant life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/the-word-is-commitment.p23\" class=\"\">Dale Carnegie once said, \u201cIf you are not in the process of becoming the person you want to be, you are automatically engaged in becoming the person you don\u2019t want to be.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/the-word-is-commitment.p24\" class=\"\">However, we must realize not all problems of life can be solved at once. A commitment to solve our daily needs and the reaching of immediate lesser goals will bring meaningful successes. Realize that God will judge you by the way you make use of all your possibilities. It is wise and proper to want to make the most of every opportunity, but don\u2019t quit or weep because of failure or disappointments. Break down big commitments into smaller ones that you can handle. Then self-esteem will grow and commitment toward goals of greater magnitude will become possible. The journey of success is long and is dotted with a series of commitments to worthy goals. A person does not become committed to worthwhile goals just by making the declaration or decision. It must be daily progression toward established purposes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/the-word-is-commitment.p25\" class=\"\">When one is wholly committed, added strengths and talents become evident. Assistance comes from unexpected sources. Who of us has not accepted some assignment with fear and trepidation, feeling totally inadequate to take on such a responsibility? But with concern and obedience we move forward\u2014working hard and praying often. As the task is completed, to our surprise, we have been successful. We humbly realize that our own abilities have been added upon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/the-word-is-commitment.p26\" class=\"\">Goethe wrote, \u201cWhat you can do, or dream you can, begin it.

They delight in discovering and sharing human flaws and frailties among our leaders past and present rather than acknowledging and benefiting from the truths they taught.
