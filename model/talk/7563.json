The first was how the Church members came to the assistance of those in need. The second was how appreciative they were to the firefighters. One homeowner described what he saw the firefighters do. He pointed out that the Santa Ana winds blow from the warm desert toward the ocean. Once a fire starts, these hot desert winds carry the flames at a speed of up to 60 or 70 miles (97\u2013113 km) per hour. The homeowner described his gratitude and admiration as he watched the firefighters standing with their hoses behind a cleared area, facing a wall of fire up to 10 feet (3\u00a0m) high descending upon them at this enormous speed. These brave men and women were able to rescue both people and homes while in constant personal danger.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/give-heed-unto-the-prophets-words.p8\" class=\"\">From time to time, as individuals and as a church, we go through periods of crisis and danger. Some arise quickly like a fire. Others are subtle and go almost undetected before they are upon us. Some require heroic action, but most are less spectacular. The way we respond is crucial. My purpose this evening is to reemphasize to priesthood holders the importance of heeding the words of the prophets. This is one sure way to respond to physical and spiritual dangers of all kinds. Some illustrations may be helpful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/give-heed-unto-the-prophets-words.p9\" class=\"\">Many of you have participated in treks to experience and appreciate the dramatic rescue of the Willie and Martin handcart companies.

They had been overtaken by winter storms on the high plains of Wyoming. Some had died and many others were on the verge of death.

All the rescuers battled deep snow and freezing temperatures during much of the rescue of the handcart companies. At great personal sacrifice, David and his associates helped carry many of the pioneers across the freezing, ice-filled Sweetwater.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-02205_000_019\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Chad\u00a0M.

I wanted to prove my devotion to the Lord through some dramatic act. However, in a visit with my grandfather, he explained that when President Brigham Young sent his father, David, and the other young men on their rescue mission, President Young instructed them to do everything they possibly could to save the handcart companies, even at the peril of their own lives.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-02205_000_019\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Marva Jeanne Kimball Pedersen, <span class=\"emphasis\">Crozier Kimball: His Life and Work<\/span> (1995), 6\u20137.]<\/span><\/sup> Their acts of bravery were specifically to \u201cfollow the prophet Brigham Young\u201d and by so doing express their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. My grandfather told me that consistent, faithful dedication to the counsel of a prophet is the real lesson I should learn from my great-grandfather\u2019s service. As heroic as it was for David and his associates to help rescue the pioneers, it is also valiant today to follow the counsel of our prophet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/give-heed-unto-the-prophets-words.p13\" class=\"\">An often-told account from the Old Testament illustrates this principle. Naaman, a prominent leader in Syria, was afflicted with leprosy. He became aware that the prophet Elisha in Israel might be able to heal him. Elisha sent word by a messenger that Naaman should wash himself in the river Jordan seven times. Initially, Naaman was upset with this counsel. However, his servants said, \u201cIf the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it?\u201d Then Naaman followed the counsel of the prophet Elisha, and he was made clean.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-02205_000_019\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51578\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51578)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51578)\">2\u00a0Kings 5:1\u201314<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/give-heed-unto-the-prophets-words.p14\" class=\"\">Like Naaman, you young priesthood holders might aspire to \u201cdo some great thing\u201d or participate in something dramatic like the handcart rescue. However, your resolve should be to follow the counsel of the prophet. The First Presidency has reaffirmed its commitment to increasing the worthiness of young people who are recommended for missionary service. Keeping yourselves free from the sins of the world and meeting the high standards for missionary service should be one goal. Preparing yourselves to proclaim the gospel and rescue some of Heavenly Father\u2019s children spiritually would be both significant and heroic.
