He had been in the\nlast war for four years and when he learned they were considering his recall, he sent the\nboard a telegram in which he said: \"I desire to remind you that I spent four years in the last\nwar, and I just want you to know I do not want to crowd in ahead of anyone else who wants\nthe experience.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful for a great many things this morning.  I am always grateful to be on these\ngrounds and in this building, for daily association with them has never\ndimmed their beauty and their memories for me.  I am grateful for the lovely flowers which\nfestoon this stand, for many of us learned to love them and what they represent in the islands\nof the sea; and I am particularly grateful for the blessing of aloha or love which motivated the\ngood people who sent them.\n<\/p><p>\nI am especially grateful this morning, for freedom.  As a serviceman who had opportunity in\nan armed conflict to help defend this nation, as a young American, and as a Latter-day Saint,\nI am as grateful for freedom as my intelligence and capacity to understand it allow me to be.\n<\/p><p>\nBut as I look at you and consider myself, I think of another kind of freedom which is even\nmore important than that which we here enjoy to assemble and to teach and to worship. This\nfreedom has no relationship to prison walls, or to any other aspect of physical restraint or\ndeprivation.  It may, in fact, be employed by one immured in deepest dungeon, penniless and\nstarving and in ill health.  On the other hand, it may be absent from one who is not physically\nrestrained, who has an abundance of wealth, health, prominence, I think of the freedom taught\nby Jesus to certain of the descendants of Abraham many centuries ago. Having taught them of\nhis Father, he gave them another great lesson, in these words, many having believed on him: \n<\/p><p>\nIf ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; \n<\/p><p>\nAnd ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\n<\/p><p>\nThey answered him, [angrily, you see, because they were already free, were they not?] We be\nAbraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made\nfree?\n<\/p><p>\nJesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant\nof sin.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the son abideth ever.\n<\/p><p>\nIf the son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27594\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27594)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27594)\">John 8:31-36<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a freedom different from and superior to even that which we enjoy today, to meet, to\nteach, and to worship.  What is it?  Is it, as some suppose, the right to do as we please?  Do\nwe find this freedom in indulgence, in unrighteousness, in sin?  Do we find it in giving loose\nrein to passion, to emotions, to appetites, to the unrighteous thought or act?\n<\/p><p>\nThis freedom of which Jesus spoke does not company with unrighteousness nor is it the\nproduct of the evil act.  This freedom, this freedom which he taught as being most important\nto mankind, comes to those who in righteousness have faith in God, learn hid law, and seek\nto understand it, and who, obedient to it, and with responsibility, seek to do his will.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many among us, and throughout the world, young and old (though perhaps we too\noften confine the lesson to the young) who have the idea that freedom, the freedom of which\nwe speak, can be found in unlicensed liberty.  But this freedom which Jesus taught is not the\nfreedom of irresponsibility or unrighteousness, but the freedom which accompanies obedience.\n<\/p><p>\nIs that husband free, for instance, who with disloyalty to his wife and family and with lust in\nheart, entangles himself in alliances outside his own home?  Is that father free who, neglecting\nhis children, turns them away and does not love them and teach them?  Is that man free who\nhates his neighbor, and who will not forgive the trespasses his neighbor has committed against\nhim?\n<\/p><p>\nIs that wife and mother free who will not perform the duties of her home with joy in her\nheart, realizing this to be her great calling?  Is that woman free who gives her time to selfish\nsocial pursuits of doubtful worth instead of to her neighbor, her community, her Church, her\nGod, in honest service, when there is so much to do?\n<\/p><p>\nIs that boy free who trifles with good habits, who cheats a little in school, who will not\naccept sound counsel and loving parental advice, but who, making his own stubborn way (for\nhe is of the age when he thinks he knows better than they) chooses companions who are on\nthe wrong path, goes about his activities with them, perhaps even stealing\nfrom some others the most precious things they enjoy? Is the young girl free who thinks so\nlittle of herself that she allows herself to be handled as if she were worth nothing, or who\ntalks with evil tongue about her friends or acquaintances; who will not be counseled, who will\nnot be helpful or humble in the home?\n<\/p><p>\nThe obvious answer is that these people are not free.  True, they have the right to choose, but\nthey violate their agency in choosing that which denies them the very freedom which God\nwould have his children enjoy; for how is this freedom achieved?\n<\/p><p>\nLet me quote two or three verses of scripture.  In addition to the words of the Lord, telling us\nthat truth makes us free, he said again as recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants, the sacred\nbook of the restoration: \n<\/p><p>\nI, the Lord God, make you free, therefore ye are free indeed; and the law also maketh you\nfree (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13295\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13295)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13295)\">D&amp;C 98:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd He said to us, as John recorded it when he was among men: \n<\/p><p>\nNow ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.\n<\/p><p>\nAbide in me, and I in you . . .\n<\/p><p>\n. . . for without me ye can do nothing (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27610\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27610)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27610)\">John 15:3-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the Psalmist sang, \"And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41787\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41787)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41787)\">Ps. 119:45<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again, James: \n<\/p><p>\nBut whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a\nforgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26108\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26108)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26108)\">James 1:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd finally, and perhaps most importantly, out of the book of 2 Corinthians this simple\nstatement: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3025\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3025)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3025)\">2 Cor. 3:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMy humble testimony is that real freedom is not irresponsibility or license, but that real\nfreedom accompanies faith in God, the understanding of his word, and obedience to it. (And\neach of us, I believe, knows personally the difference between the freedom of faith and\nobedience, and the bondage of sin.)\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us to realize as we seek to learn the marvelous principles of the gospel that he who\nwill not in his heart forgive, he who will not be clean, he who will not seek to know the\ntruths of the Lord as they apply not only to the obedience which is a word, but also to the\nobedience which is a way of living, is not free.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us that we may have faith, that we may learn his word and live it, in order that we\nmay have his spirit with us, for \". . . where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3026\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3026)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3026)\">2 Cor. 3:17<\/a><\/span>). In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
