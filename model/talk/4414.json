Know his righteous desires for his family and help him to realize them. And I would urge you to do the little things, the small things that mean so much to a family. For example, know the names of all the family members. Be aware of birthdays, blessings, baptisms, and marriages. On occasion, write an appropriate note of commendation or make a phone call congratulating a member of the family on a special achievement or accomplishment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/to-the-home-teachers-of-the-church.p37\" class=\"\">With your home teaching companion, regularly review pages 8 and 9 of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Melchizedek Priesthood Handbook<\/span> for some excellent suggestions on how to be helpful to those you home teach.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/to-the-home-teachers-of-the-church.p38\" class=\"\">Above all, be a genuine friend to the individuals and families you teach.
