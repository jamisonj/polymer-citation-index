Cutbacks in industry, layoffs on a substantial scale, and the resultant dislocation of families become a serious challenge.

The worth of souls is indeed great in the sight of God. Ours is the precious privilege, armed with this knowledge, to make a difference in the lives of others.

But for practical purposes I like to define the Priesthood in terms of service and I frequently call it \u2018the perfect plan of service.\u2019 I do so because it seems to me that it is only through the utilization of the divine power conferred on men that they may ever hope to realize the full import and vitality of this endowment. It is an instrument of service \u2026 and the man who fails to use it is apt to lose it, for we are plainly told by revelation that he who neglects it \u2018shall not be counted worthy to stand.\u2019 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19709\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19709)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19709)\">D&amp;C 107:100<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cThe Priesthood is not static and a man\u2019s ordination \u2026 is not a static investiture.

Well do I remember that about this season, some years ago, members holding the Aaronic Priesthood would eagerly look forward to an annual outing commemorating the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood. By the busload the young men of our stake journeyed ninety miles north to the Clarkston Cemetery, where we viewed the grave of Martin Harris, one of the three witnesses of the Book of Mormon. While we surrounded the beautiful granite shaft which marks his grave, Elder Glen L. Rudd, then a high councilor, presented the background of the life of Martin Harris, read from the Book of Mormon his testimony, and then bore his own witness to the truth. The young men listened with rapt attention, touched the granite marker, and pondered the words they had heard and the feelings they had felt.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p26\" class=\"\">At a park in Logan, lunch was enjoyed. The group of young men then lay down on the lawn at the Logan Temple and gazed upward at its lofty spires. Beautiful white clouds hurried by the spires, moved along by a gentle breeze. The purpose of temples was taught. Covenants and promises became much more than words. The desire to be worthy to enter those temple doors entered those youthful hearts. Heaven was very close that day. Learning what we should learn was assured.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p27\" class=\"\">2. <span class=\"emphasis\">Do what we should do. <\/span>In a revelation on priesthood, given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, recorded as the 107th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, \u201clearning\u201d moves to \u201cdoing\u201d as we read, \u201cWherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19708\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19708)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19708)\">D&amp;C 107:99<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p28\" class=\"\">Each priesthood holder attending this session tonight has a calling to serve, to put forth his best efforts in the work assigned to him. No assignment is menial in the work of the Lord, for each has eternal consequences. President John Taylor warned us: \u201cIf you do not magnify your calling, God will hold you responsible for those whom you might have saved had you done your duty.\u201d And who of us can afford to be responsible for the delay of eternal life of a human soul? If great joy is the reward of saving one soul, then how terrible must be the remorse of those whose timid efforts have allowed a child of God to go unwarned or unaided so that he has to wait till a dependable servant of God comes along.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p29\" class=\"\">The old adage is ever true: \u201cDo your duty, that is best; leave unto the Lord the rest.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p30\" class=\"\">Most service given by priesthood holders is accomplished quietly and without fanfare.

Brother Fussek was born in Poland. He spoke the language. He loved the people. Sister Fussek was English and knew little of Poland and its people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p32\" class=\"\">Trusting in the Lord, they embarked on their assignment. The living conditions were primitive, the work lonely, their task immense. A mission had not at that time been established in Poland. The assignment given the Fusseks was to prepare the way, that a mission could be established, that other missionaries be called to serve, people taught, converts baptized, branches established, and chapels erected.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p33\" class=\"\">Did Elder and Sister Fussek despair because of the enormity of their assignment? Not for a moment. They knew their calling was from God, they prayed for His divine help, and they devoted themselves wholeheartedly to their work. They remained in Poland not two years, but five years. All of the foregoing objectives were realized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p34\" class=\"\">Elders Russell M. Nelson, Hans B. Ringger, and I, accompanied by Elder Fussek, met with Minister Adam Wopatka of the Polish government and we heard him say, \u201cYour church is welcome here. You may build your buildings, you may send your missionaries. You are welcome in Poland. This man,\u201d pointing to Juliusz Fussek, \u201chas served your church well.

He married and commenced his own business.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p48\" class=\"\">Forty years passed by. One day Brother Cannon came to my office and said he had been pruning his missionary slides. Among those slides he had kept since his mission were several which he could not specifically identify. Every time he had planned to discard those few slides, he had been impressed to keep them, although he was at a loss as to why. They were photographs taken by Brother Cannon during his mission when he served in Stettin, Germany, and were of a family\u2014a mother, a father, a small girl, a small boy. Brother Cannon knew their surname was Berndt but could remember nothing more about them. He indicated that he understood there was a Berndt who was a Regional Representative in Germany, and he thought, although the possibility was remote, that this Berndt might have some connection with the Berndts who had lived in Stettin and who were depicted in the photographs. Before disposing of the slides, he thought he would check with me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p49\" class=\"\">I told Brother Cannon I was leaving shortly for Berlin, where I anticipated that I would see Dieter Berndt, the Regional Representative, and that I would show the slides to him to see if there were any relationship and if he wanted them.

He sat next to me, and I told him I had some old slides of people named Berndt from Stettin. I handed them to him and asked if he could identify those shown in the photographs. As he looked at them carefully he began to weep. He said, \u201cOur family lived in Stettin during the war. My father was killed when an Allied bomb struck the plant where he worked. Not long afterward, the Russians invaded Poland and the area of Stettin. My mother took my sister and me and fled from the advancing enemy.
