We have been spiritually fed as we have listened to the counsel and testimonies of those who have participated in each session. I am certain I speak for all members everywhere when I express deep appreciation for the truths we have been taught. We could echo the words, found in the Book of Mormon, of those who heard the sermon of the great King Benjamin and \u201ccried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-09211_000_042\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"121010\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 121010)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(121010)\">Mosiah 5:2<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/till-we-meet-again.p5\" class=\"\">I hope that we will take the time to read the conference talks, which will be reprinted in the November issue of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona<\/span> magazines, for they are deserving of our careful study.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/till-we-meet-again.p6\" class=\"\">What a blessing it is that we have been able to meet here, in this magnificent Conference Center, in peace and comfort and safety. We have had unprecedented coverage of the conference, reaching across the continents and the oceans to people everywhere. Though we are far removed from many of you, we feel of your spirit and send our love and appreciation to you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/till-we-meet-again.p7\" class=\"\">To our Brethren who have been released at this conference, may I express the heartfelt gratitude of all of us for your many years of devoted service.

Eyring and President Dieter\u00a0F. Uchtdorf. They are truly men of wisdom and understanding, and their service is invaluable. I could not do all that I am called upon to do without their support and assistance. I love and admire my Brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and all in the Quorums of the Seventy and in the Presiding Bishopric. They serve selflessly and effectively. I similarly express my appreciation for the women and men who serve as general auxiliary officers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/till-we-meet-again.p10\" class=\"\">How blessed we are to have the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. It provides answers to questions concerning where we came from, why we are here, and where we will go when we pass from this life. It provides meaning and purpose and hope to our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/till-we-meet-again.p11\" class=\"\">We live in a troubled world, a world of many challenges. We are here on this earth to deal with our individual challenges to the best of our ability, to learn from them, and to overcome them. Endure to the end we must, for our goal is eternal life in the presence of our Father in Heaven. He loves us and wants nothing more than for us to succeed in this goal. He will help us and bless us as we call upon Him in our prayers, as we study His words, and as we obey His commandments. Therein is found safety; therein is found peace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/till-we-meet-again.p12\" class=\"\">May God bless you, my brothers and sisters.
