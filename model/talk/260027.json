I will therefore read to you a part of the 14th chapter of the Book of Revelation, from the Bible known as King James' translation. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n815\"> &#x201C;And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him a hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n816\"> &#x201C;And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n817\"> &#x201C;And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. <\/div> <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"260b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0260.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;260b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9268\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n818\"> &#x201C;These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.

Nearly every one of the Twelve whom Jesus chose, met with a tragic death in defense of the principles which they proclaimed. Some were dragged to death, some beheaded, one was crucified with his head downward, others were thrown into cauldrons of boiling oil and others to wild beasts; so that at the end of the second century after Christ, the Church of God in its purity no longer existed upon the face of the earth. It had been torn asunder; it had apostatized from the truth; they who were faithful had been put to death, and in their place sprang up a race of compromisers, who were willing to barter away to the world the principles of truth, being too weak and cowardly to stand and die for their convictions as their fellow laborers had done. They were willing to give up this principle, and concede that point, to amalgamate for the purpose of making them popular and palatable the doctrines of the pure Christian faith with the pagan ideas of ancient Rome. So that the temporal body of Christ, the Church, became corrupt, deformed by this departure from first principles. Apostles, Prophets, were done away with; spiritual gifts became extinct and were said to be no longer needed; Bishops were put into the  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"263a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0263.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;263a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9265\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>places of Apostles, and a multitude of new offices, unknown to the original church, were created. Finally two Bishops appeared, the Bishop of Rome and the Bishop of Constantinople, contending as to which was the greatest, and striving, in a Church professing to regard unity and brotherly love, to divide the dominions of the Christian world between them. More attention was paid to outward forms, to grand and imposing ceremonies, than to the simple beautiful principles of the Gospel, and, in course of time were fulfilled the words of Isaiah, who said that they would &#x201C;transgress the law, change the ordinances, and break the everlasting covenant.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"58462\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 58462)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(58462)\">Isa. 24:5<\/a><\/span> The result of this widespread departure, this apostasy from the primitive faith, was the withdrawal of the power of the Priesthood, typified by the &#x201C;manchild&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"79567\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 79567)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(79567)\">Rev. 12:5<\/a><\/span> of the Apocalypse, which was taken into the heavens to preserve it from the mouth of the Dragon which sought its life; there to remain until a more auspicious time should arrive for the establishment of the work of God, and the winding up of the great plan of human redemption. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n830\"> But one of these original Apostles was left.
