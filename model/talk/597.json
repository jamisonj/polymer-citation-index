McKay<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">David O. McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1952, pp. 7-12<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nEarly in June, while sitting with his Brethren of the Council of the Twelve in the regular\nweekly meeting, Elder A. E. Bowen was suddenly stricken. For several weeks he and his\nloved ones and his Brethren thought that he was very close to the brink. He has sufficiently\nrecovered to be able to move about in his room, but as previously announced, he is unable to\nbe present with us this morning.\n<\/p><p>\nHe is a great soul, a stalwart leader, a man who possesses a brilliant mind and true nobility of\nsoul. We extend to Brother Bowen this morning the love and confidence of the Church. If he\nis listening in, we wish him to know that we love him, admire him; he has our united faith\nand prayers for a complete recovery. We need him.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are sorry that Elder John A. Widtsoe is unable to be with us this morning. We hope that\nthe Lord will bless him sufficiently to join us later in the sessions of this conference.\n<\/p><p>\nWe noted in the prayer offered an appeal for the love of mankind, that we might love one\nanother, and through that love contribute to the establishment of peace. That was the great\nmessage heralded by the heavenly hosts at the birth of the Savior, when they declared, \"Glory\nto God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31305\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31305)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31305)\">Luke 2:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo proclaim that message to an indifferent world is the divine responsibility of the Church.\nWhat greater message could there be? What more commendable effort to supply the greatest\nneed could be put forth?\n<\/p><p>\nSomewhere I have read that in one of the important institutions of medicine and healing in\nthis country, there hangs this significant sign: \"Never say a discouraging word while in this\nsanitarium.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIf encouragement is good for the sick and ailing, it is also helpful to those who are normally\nhealthy. As encouragement affects individuals, so it is helpful to organizations, and this\nmorning as I stand before you I have nothing but a wish, a prayer, that we might say\nsomething encouraging to the members of the Church of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful this morning, as I bid you welcome to this, the one hundred and twenty-third\nsemi-annual conference, that I can give you an encouraging report of conditions in the Church\nas a whole, and that it is to the best of its ability and resources trying to discharge its\nobligations in preaching the Restored Gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nYou will be pleased to hear a few items, even though I must mention them but briefly, which\njustify my saying that the Church is moving steadily forward on its destined course.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are now 195 organized stakes in the Church, an increase of over one hundred percent in\nthe last twenty-five years. There are forty-three missions in the Church,\nincluding the new Central American Mission. Since we last met in general conference, there\nhave been approximately thirty-eight new wards and seventeen new branches organized,\nmaking a total number of wards and independent branches of 1736.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring 1952, up to September 30, there were eighty-four new chapels, dedicated. Before the\nend of the year there will be fifty-three more ready for dedication, making a total of 137\nchapels dedicated or ready for dedication. Besides this, there are 389 chapels in process of\nconstruction, fifty of which are in missions.\n<\/p><p>\nAt present, you will be pleased to know that there are, in European missions, Church-owned\nchapels as follows: British, thirty-nine (you former missionaries to Britain will be pleased to\nknow that); Danish, five; East German six; Finland, ten (after only five years of organization);\nFrench, three; Netherlands, eight; Norwegian, three; Swedish, fourteen; Swiss-Austrian, three;\nWest German, eight; making a total of ninety-nine places owned by the Church in the\nEuropean missions.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Liahona College in Tonga is now completed. The Church sent most of the materials for\nits erection. Local people did much of the work and did not charge a shilling for their labor.\nThe Church sent a supervisor, a plumbing supervisor, and an electrician.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Pesega School in Samoa is nearing completion. The Mesepa School on the island of\nTutuila in Samoa will soon be under construction. The money for it is already appropriated.\nWe contemplate building fifteen chapels in American and British Samoa in the near future.\n<\/p><p>\nPlans are now being drawn for the New Zealand College of the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints, which will replace the Maori College, which was destroyed by an\nearthquake in 1932.\n<\/p><p>\nMoney has been appropriated for construction of five chapels in New Zealand. One is now\nbeing completed in Auckland, one in Glenn Huon, Tasmania, where the members are cutting\ntheir own timber and doing a good deal of the work themselves.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church owns two acres in Rarotonga, and money is already appropriated for a new\nchapel on those islands. It was only recently that the mission was opened in Rarotonga, under\nNew Zealand, however.\n<\/p><p>\nA building is also under construction at Ipswich, Australia.\n<\/p><p>\nAll these buildings, with the Los Angeles Temple now under construction, the Relief Society\nbuilding, announced yesterday, mission expenses, ward and stake expenses, require the\nexpenditure of vast sums of money furnished by the tithes of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nTo your credit and blessing, be it said that the tithes of the people this year are 21.7 percent\nhigher than last year, and last year exceeded the year before.\n<\/p><p>\nFast offerings also show an even greater percent of increase.\n<\/p><p>\nMissionaries&mdash;September 30, 1952, there were in the foreign missionary fields, 3854\nmissionaries.\n<\/p><p>\nThere were 5525 in the stakes of Zion, making a total of 9379 missionaries.\n<\/p><p>\nThat number speaks volumes in praise of the young men and young women, and particularly\nof the fathers and mothers, in their interest in the great mission of the Church to proclaim the\nmessage of peace and good will to all peoples of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nIn addition to this, there were in the state of Utah, September 25, 1952, with a Church\npopulation of 488,863&mdash;9379 Latter-day Saint boys in the military service, or 1.9 percent of\nthe total Church population of the state, as compared with 1.3 percent of the total nonmember\npopulation of the state, or .6 of 1 percent more Latter-day Saint boys, as based upon our total\npopulation, than for non-members. These figures should assuage the rabidness of\nsome-prejudiced agitators who have falsely accused our young men of not discharging their\nshare of the responsibilities of the military activity of our government.\n<\/p><p>\nIn one agricultural town I know, with a population of fewer than 700, ten young men are in\nthe mission field, and forty-five in the Armed Forces of our country.\n<\/p><p>\nTo you loyal members whose unselfish labors have contributed to this favorable progress of\nthe Church, we can say, as in Hebrews, that God will not \". . . forget your work and labour\nof love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and\ndo minister\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24240\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24240)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24240)\">Heb. 6:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn keeping with this theme of encouragement, brief reference to some incidents connected\nwith our recent tour of the European missions may not be amiss.\n<\/p><p>\nOn May 29, 1952, accompanied by Sister McKay, our son David L. as secretary, and\nMildred, his wife, I left for an important mission to Europe. The details of that special\nmission pertaining to temples, I shall probably have to postpone until the general annual\nconference in April. Further than what has already been announced, I think we cannot further\ncomment this morning.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is marvelous how much closer in time modern transportation has brought the nations of the\nearth; for example, Sunday, June 1, at 6:30 in the evening, we left New York. Owing to\nunfavorable weather conditions the plane landed at Sydney, Newfoundland, instead of at\nGander, and did not leave for Glasgow until Monday, 1:30 a. m. After fifteen hours of actual\nflying time we were at Prestwich Airport, in Ayrshire, Scotland, and later that same evening,\nMonday, we participated in the dedication of the first chapel owned by the Church in\nScotland.\n<\/p><p>\nWednesday, the evening following, we dedicated another in Edinburgh, and there is a suitable\nplace in Aberdeen now ready for dedication. For these and other chapels in Great Britain\nmuch credit is due to Elder Stayner Richards, who, with his associates, has manifested\nwisdom and economy.\n<\/p><p>\nIf I followed my inclinations, I would pause here long enough to tell you of my feelings upon\nreturning to Scotland after twenty-nine years, my latest visit, and after fifty-four years since I\nlabored there as a young, unmarried missionary. What a flood of memories filled my soul as a\nMrs. O'Hara, living in the apartment, graciously showed Sister McKay, two elders, and me\nthe old 52 Holmhead St., headquarters of the Scottish Conference fifty-four years ago!\n<\/p><p>\nI should also like to tell you how humbly grateful, and with what a mellow heart later I stood\nwith Ray by my side in the little bedroom in Wales in which Jeannette Evans, my sainted\nmother, was born over a hundred years ago! But these are personal experiences, of little or no\ninterest to you members.\n<\/p><p>\nBeginning at the meetings in Scotland, we carried your love and greetings to the\napproximately 40,000 members of the Church in the ten missions in the nine European\ncountries. June 2 to July 4, they met us in Europe to receive your greetings. July 26, you met\nus here to receive their thanks. And, now, this morning, I express again to you in Zion the\nloving greetings of the Saints in Europe.\n<\/p><p>\nOne impression I received right at first and it became more and more pronounced as we came\nin contact with people in all walks of life, was a more tolerant attitude than I experienced a\nhalf century ago. It was a joy to mingle with intelligent people radiating a spirit of good will.\n<\/p><p>\nOne beneficial result of the tour was a keener realization on the part of members of the\nChurch that they are not detached entities but are in reality part of the Church as a whole.\nNearness in time contributed to this feeling; but more especially their meeting one of the\nSunday School general superintendency and a member of the general board of the Primary,\nhearing incidents, items of instructions that happened or were given, as it were, but a week\nbefore, awakened a sense of belonging that was satisfying and encouraging.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was truly a joy and inspiration to see the loyalty, feel the responsiveness of members of the\nChurch in every mission. There was no exception. To greet those eagerly expectant,\ngraciously warm-hearted people gave a joy almost inexpressible. We sensed to a small degree,\nat least, the truth of the saying: \"To love and to be loved is the greatest happiness of\nexistence.\" This was especially true so far as <i>our<\/i> love for those faithful people is concerned.\n<\/p><p>\nAt the opening of my remarks I said that at the Savior's birth, there were heralded the\nfundamental virtues that constitute the world's greatest need: first, believing in and glorifying\nour Father in heaven, and second, peace good will, instead of contention and strife.\n<\/p><p>\nHere let me emphasize that good will includes benevolence, a virtue that may be experienced\nby persons in all stations of life. It is \"confined to no rank, no degree of education or power;\nthe poor may be benevolent as well as the rich; the unlearned as well as the learned; the weak\nas well as the strong.\" Everyone may not be <i>beneficent<\/i> but all may be <i>benevolent<\/i>. Good will\nincludes kindness, a virtue everyone can show and one which everyone is pleased to receive.\n<\/p><p>\n\"So many gods, so many creeds,<br \/>\nSo many paths that wind and wind,<br \/>\nWhile just the art of being kind,<br \/>\nIs all the sad world needs.\"\n<\/p><p>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;              (Ella Wheeler Wilcox.)\n<\/p><p>\nI should be remiss, indeed downright unappreciative, if I did not take this occasion to refer\nappreciatively to the instances of good will manifested on this recent presidential tour of the\nEuropean missions.\n<\/p><p>\nOur Church knows full well what it means to be misjudged, scoffed at, and persecuted. It can\nappreciate, too, in full value, tolerance, a sense of justice and fair play.\n<\/p><p>\nThe mission presidencies, missionaries, members of the Church and their friends were most\ngracious in their greetings and manifestations of deference to the office of President.\nEverywhere their welcome was most generous. To all these we shall ever be grateful for the\ndistances they traveled, for the sacrifices they made, their wholehearted, radiant gladness&mdash;all\nof which contributed so much to the success of a very important mission.\n<\/p><p>\nI wish to refer especially to the good will shown by prominent businessmen, representatives\nof the press, hotel managers, government officials, and others whose interest and courtesy\nwere shown without reserve.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is unwise to attempt to mention a few because of possibly showing partiality, and failing to\nmention deserving persons, but I will name the Honorable Charles U. Bay, American\nAmbassador to Norway, who not only by proffered words, \"If there is anything I can do for\nyou, please let me know,\" but by direct action with the assistance of his undersecretary, Leon\nCowles, rendered invaluable service in securing rightful privileges for our missionaries in\nNorway. He said that was his first official act as ambassador. Other ambassadors and\nministers, including Hon. John M. Cabot to Finland and Hon. James C. Dunn to Paris, were\nequally considerate in proffering help and co-operation. Their courtesy was unbounded.\n<\/p><p>\nOthers who did not hesitate to inconvenience themselves to render favors were Colonel Tooler\nand General Wood of the American Army, through whose graciousness, at the intercession of\npresidents Stayner Richards and A. Hamer Reiser, special favors were granted to us visitors in\nattendance at the Queen's Garden Festival at Buckingham Palace.\n<\/p><p>\nI express appreciatively, also, the service rendered by the Consul General J. D. van\nKarnebeek, here in the United States, whom we happened to meet before we left, who\narranged for a most cordial visit to Her Majesty, Juliana, Queen of the Netherlands.\n<\/p><p>\nI wish to mention President Juho K. Paasikivi of Finland, a dignified,\nprincely gentleman, conference with whom, accompanied by President Henry A. Matis, I shall\nremember with satisfaction and pleasure. For exceptional courtesies shown by Mr. Sholz, the\nmanager of the Palace Hotel near The Hague, Holland; to passport officials at Berlin, who,\nfinding us without visas, gave special consideration and, out of courtesy, obtained the\nnecessary papers without delay, we mention with appreciation.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are mindful also of the outstanding consideration shown by eleven policemen who were at\nthe Mercedes Palast, at North Berlin, where an audience of 2600 persons crowded to\novercapacity that large theater. How their favorable attitude stood out in contrast with the\naction of police when some members of the Twelve and others who sit here in this audience\nthis morning were hunted and arrested a half century ago!\n<\/p><p>\nI wish to name appreciatively, also, Elder William Zimmer, and two real estate men, Mr.\nHans Jordi and Mr. Hermann Schulters, who assisted President Samuel E. Bringhurst in\nchoosing prospective temple sites in Switzerland.\n<\/p><p>\nFor his having built suitable houses in Berlin, I wish to commend President Walter Stover,\nwhose devotion to the German Saints, whose generosity and wisdom will ever be cherished by\nthe thousands whom he blessed. Included in this expression of appreciation are officials who\naided President James L. Barker and President Golden L. Woolf in their securing official\nrecognition of the Church in France.\n<\/p><p>\nAn outstanding feature of our visit in Germany was the attendance of American servicemen.\nIn the West German Mission they gathered as groups that compared favorably with our\ngroups of missionaries. And how proud we were of these choice young men and women, a\ncredit to their parents, to the Church, and to our nation! Whether they participated in concerts\nor attended to the details of conference, greeted strangers or looked after the welfare of Saints\nand investigators, their ability was manifest, their dignity commendable, their sincerity in their\nwork most outstanding.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, fellow workers, all these and a hundred other instances that I might name are evidences\nof friendship and good will that will contribute to the peaceful relationships that should exist\nbetween this country and the free countries of Europe.\n<\/p><p>\nI am sorry that I must now sound a note of discouragement, for I cannot refrain from\nreferring to the attitude of selfishness, distrust, and hatred manifest by the leaders of\ncommunism. How they hate America, and everything American!\n<\/p><p>\nThey are not only anti-American&mdash;they are anti-Christian! By every means\npossible&mdash;newspapers, billboards, documents, radio&mdash;they try to inculcate hatred in the hearts of the\nyouth.\n<\/p><p>\nBy the Iron Curtain they scheme to keep Western influence out of Russia and prevent\nRussians from becoming acquainted with the West. A distinguished sociologist once wrote,\nnote: \"Give us the young, and we will create a new mind and a new earth in a single\ngeneration.\" That is one aim and purpose of the Russian dictators.\n<\/p><p>\nLargely because of their nefarious schemes and false ideologies, civilization is facing a crisis.\nWe are in a period of uncertainty, of international tension. Not infrequently we see manifest\namong people a feeling of impending crisis in which is fear that the atom bomb might bring\nto a tragic end present-day civilization. Articles in the daily press and in magazines give\nunmistakable evidence of this condition. You can pick up any magazine or any daily paper\nand read such headings as: \"Our Democracy in Danger.\" \"Communism&mdash;a New Kind of\nThreat.\" \"Foundations of our Republic Threatened.\" \"The World Cannot Exist Half Slave and\nHalf Free.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThese are some I have taken at random.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Look at the map of the world,\" says one. \"The Iron Curtain of Soviet communist control has\ndescended over vast areas and over hundreds of millions of people in Eastern\nEurope and in Asia since the close of World War II. It is unspeakably tragic that this should\nbe the case, when it need not have been.\" Another: \"We Face a Spiritual War.\" Then, last:\n\"Red China's War Against God.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWell, brethren and sisters, let us not despair. A man's comfort in time of ease and peace, as\nwell as in time of stress and danger, will be found in the depths of the sincerity of his belief\nin an Eternal Being, his faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Commenting upon the need of\nsincerity, of faith, one writer once asked this vital question, and I give it to you: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Is Jesus to you only a legendary figure in history; a saint to be painted in the stained glass of\nchurch windows; a sort of sacred fairy not to be approached and hardly to be mentioned by\nname, or is he still what he was when he was in the flesh&mdash;a reality, a man of like passions\nwith ourselves, an elder brother, a guide, a counselor, a comforter, a great voice calling to us\nout of the past to live nobly, to die bravely, and keep up our courage to the last?\"\n<\/p><p>\nNotwithstanding the threatening conditions that exist in the world today, members of the\nChurch of Jesus Christ need not fear nor be perturbed, if they will but anchor their souls in\nunchanging truths revealed by our Father in heaven.\n<\/p><p>\nIf communists attempt to poison the minds of youth, as they are doing, against God the Father\nand his Beloved Son, if they pervert the principles of the gospel of peace and good will, if\nthey continue to sow the seeds of mistrust and hatred, we must more guardedly protect our\nyouth, more militantly instruct them in the principles of the Restored Gospel, implant in their\nhearts the truth that \". . . there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby\nwe must be saved\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7662\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7662)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7662)\">Acts 4:12<\/a><\/span>).\nLet them realize that without Christ the world is lost.\n<\/p><p>\nJames L. Gordon is right when he declares: \"A cathedral without windows, a face without\neyes, a field without flowers, an alphabet without vowels, a continent without rivers, a night\nwithout stars, and a sky without a sun&mdash;these would not be so sad as a world without a Bible\nor a soul without Christ.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe is the Son of \"God in the Highest\" as proclaimed by the heavenly hosts\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31304\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31304)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31304)\">Luke 2:14<\/a><\/span>),\nthe Prince of Peace, our Elder Brother, our Redeemer, our Savior.\n<\/p><p>\n\"His purposes fail not, neither are there any who can stay his hand.\n<\/p><p>\n\"From eternity to eternity he is the same, and his years never fail.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For thus saith the Lord&mdash;I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and\ndelight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and truth unto the end.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12992\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12992)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12992)\">D&amp;C 76:3-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless the Church. It is worldwide. Its influence should be felt by all nations. May his\nspirit influence men everywhere and incline their hearts toward good will and peace. May\ndivine guidance be given the priesthood, who hold the responsibility of declaring to an\nindifferent world the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, I pray in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
