There was a young nineteen-year-old admirer of Joseph Smith, Philemon Merrill, who had come with other loyal followers to rescue their prophet from the hands of sheriffs Reynolds and Wilson. While returning to Nauvoo, the company rested \u201cin a little grove of timber.\u201d One of the lawyers for the sheriff and the kidnappers boasted of his wrestling powers. He offered a wager that he could throw any man in Illinois. Stephen Markham, a bodyguard of Joseph\u2019s and a huge man, also an experienced wrestler, took up the challenge. The boaster threw Stephen, and a taunting shout went up from the Prophet\u2019s enemies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/my-son-and-yours-each-a-remarkable-one.p38\" class=\"\">As the taunts continued, Joseph Smith turned to young Philemon Merrill and said: \u201c\u2018Get up and throw that man.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/my-son-and-yours-each-a-remarkable-one.p39\" class=\"\">The boy was about to refuse, to excuse himself by saying he was not a wrestler, but the look in the Prophet\u2019s eye silenced his tongue. \u201cHe arose to his feet filled with the strength of a Samson.\u201d Philemon \u201clifted his arms\u201d and told the lawyer to take his choice of sides.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/my-son-and-yours-each-a-remarkable-one.p40\" class=\"\">\u201cThe man took the left side with his right hand under,\u201d which gave him a decided advantage. Philemon Merrill\u2019s friends protested, but young Philemon felt such confidence in the words of the Prophet that it made little difference to him what advantage his antagonist took.
