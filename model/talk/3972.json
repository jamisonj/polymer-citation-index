I thought, Wouldn\u2019t it be a great idea if we had a Mormon credit card? A card-carrying Mormon could be depended on to keep his word, to be honest with his employers, and to pay his bills as agreed. Then our professionals, tradesmen, and business people would perform without compromising their ethics for profit, each putting his signature on his work with pride; all of us striving for excellence in every way. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful to be a \u201cpeculiar\u201d people known for our honesty and the quality of our services? The Mormon standard of integrity should be the highest standard in all the world, for we are the covenant people of God.

The vital thing is this: A man who can somehow rationalize breaking the oath he gave before God and man when he repeated the marriage vows, is also a man who could, if he so desired, or when subjected to sufficient pressure, rationalize breaking the oath he took when he became a Commissioned Officer in the United States Marine Corps. A man who can betray his wife and children for lustful purposes is a man who could betray his country for his own ends.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/the-practice-of-truth.p24\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, we often perform below our ideals, but our aim must exceed our grasp if we would rise to a higher standard of integrity. We all have old habits to break and new ones to form. Surely it takes a long time to perfect character, and we probably won\u2019t achieve it totally in this life. But success must be measured by effort and small improvements until we eventually reach our goals. Norman Cousins described integrity as \u201cno luxury for the pious: it is the bread of life for the truly human \u2026 for the man who seeks not length of days, but quality of spirit.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/the-practice-of-truth.p25\" class=\"\">The love for truth and the practice of truth are best learned in the home.
