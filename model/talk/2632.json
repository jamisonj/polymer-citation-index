How may we gain a knowledge of past, present, and future? Knowledge of things past comes by careful study. Knowledge of things present comes from careful observation. Knowledge of things future comes from being aware of prophetic utterances. I should like to talk about truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/make-haste-to-obey.p4\" class=\"\">As I have flown over the beautiful land of South America, time and time again I have been impressed with the aerial view of the mighty Amazon River. Not only is this Amazon the greatest river in the world, but even many of its tributaries are great rivers in their own right and are navigable for many miles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/make-haste-to-obey.p5\" class=\"\">One interesting feature about these rivers is their different colors. The Madeira, for example, is called a white river because its waters carry fine clay particles along its course. The black color of the Rio Negro comes from decaying organic materials picked up in the forests through which it passes. Still other rivers flow over white sands and often appear emerald green or turquoise blue.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/make-haste-to-obey.p6\" class=\"\">Just as these rivers are colored by the substances picked up as they flow along, so the streams of our thoughts are colored by the material through which they are channeled. The scriptures indicate that as a man \u201cthinketh in his heart, so is he.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41531\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41531)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41531)\">Prov. 23:7<\/a><\/span>.) The material we read has a great effect on the nature of our thoughts. We therefore need to be concerned not only with avoiding unwholesome literature, but we must fill our minds with pure knowledge, and we must see that our children do the same.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/make-haste-to-obey.p7\" class=\"\">That is why we have been commanded to search the scriptures. The Prophet Joseph Smith challenged us to learn more about the Savior and his plan for us when he said, \u201cSearch the scriptures\u2014search the revelations \u2026 and ask your Heavenly Father, in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, to manifest the truth unto you, and if you do it with an eye single to His glory nothing doubting, He will answer you by the power of His Holy Spirit. You will then know for yourselves and \u2026 will not \u2026 be dependent on man for the knowledge of God; nor will there be any room for speculation. \u2026 For when men receive their instruction from Him that made them, they know how He will save them.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> pp. 11\u201312.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/make-haste-to-obey.p8\" class=\"\">Through our scripture study we will come to consider these great leaders of the scriptures as our personal friends, and their messages will take on new and added meaning.

Great prophets have abounded in the land during the course of history. Abraham was a seer, and he passed the blessings he received on to his posterity through the ages.
