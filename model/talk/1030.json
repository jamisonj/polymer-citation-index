I hope the good Spirit\nwill continue with us throughout this service.\n<\/p><p>\nI am very happy, and I was delighted to hear that President Hunter had been called to fill the\nvacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve. President Hunter has been for many years a leader in\nZion. He has been proved, and I say that a Church is very fortunate indeed that can call upon\nmen of his caliber to serve freely and pleasantly in the great position which he now occupies.\n<\/p><p>\nI was also very happy this morning for the vigor and the strength demonstrated by President\nClark in his sermon to us. The Lord has blessed him, and I am sure you join with me in\nexpressing gratitude for his recovery, that his leadership may continue amongst us.\n<\/p><p>\nYesterday, I was thrilled and greatly by that masterful sermon delivered by President McKay\non the character, the teachings, and the life of Jesus Christ, the Lord. I was also pleased with\nhis references to the Sermon on the Mount delivered by the Savior before a small group of\npeople gathered on the mountainside. That sermon has lived for centuries. It has survived the\nDark Ages. It has survived the Renaissance. It has survived modern speculations and the\nconflicts and the contention among nations.\n<\/p><p>\nThat sermon will live forever. There is nothing more fundamental in God's word than the\nsermon which the Savior gave and which is called the Sermon on the Mount.\n<\/p><p>\nA few years ago I attended a Sacrament meeting in the South London Branch in London. The\noccasion was a Christmas program. On that program appeared a Jewish musician. He played a\nselection on the cello. It was very good. The presiding officer tried to get him to play another\nselection, but he refused. He said, however, \"I will sing a solo, if that will be acceptable.\" He\nstepped forward, and he sang the song we all love, \"The Lord's Prayer,\" after which he took\nhis seat in the audience.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the meeting was over, he walked up to me and said, and these are his words, \"You will\nhave to get something more practical than the Sermon on the Mount if you expect to convert\nthe Jews.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI said to him, \"Have you ever read the Sermon on the Mount?\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe said, \"I must have read it.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"I hope you have,\" I suggested, \"before you criticize it.\" And then I said to him, \"You sang a\nwonderful song tonight, 'The Lord's Prayer.' Did it ever occur to you that that prayer was a\npart of the Sermon on the Mount?\" He did not seem to realize it.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Now,\" I said, \"Will you tell me one single teaching in that sermon which is not practical.\nName one thing in it that cannot be practiced and introduced into your daily life.\" He was\nsilent.\n<\/p><p>\nThen I began to repeat for him that wonderful prayer offered by Jesus as an example to his\ndisciples. \"'Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven'\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34941\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34941)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34941)\">Matt. 6:9-13<\/a><\/span>).\nIsn't that a practical aspiration to have?\" I said.\n<\/p><p>\nHe made no reply.\n<\/p><p>\nThen I repeated this: \"'Give us this day our daily bread.' Surely, that is practical to a man\nlike you.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he said, \"Oh it is very practical.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI continued, \"'And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.' We are having a lot of\ntrouble with debts these days, individual and national. Don't you think we\nought to pray about it once in a while?\" I asked.\n<\/p><p>\n\"It wouldn't be amiss,\" he replied.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then I gave him this statement: \"'. . . deliver us from evil.' Is that not a prayerful hope\nthat all of us should have? It refers to the evil that appears in our pathways, evil that\nfrustrates and stultifies us as we go forth in our daily affairs. 'Deliver us from evil,' is a plea\nfor strength to resist temptation.\n<\/p><p>\nI called his attention to two or three other statements in the sermon: \"Judge not, that ye be not\njudged.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it\nshall be measured to you again\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34948\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34948)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34948)\">Matt. 7:1-2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAt last he was impressed. He said, \"Oh, if you Christians would honor that last\ncommandment, 'As you measure out to others, it shall be measured back to you.'\"\n<\/p><p>\nI said, \"Not only the Christians, but the Jews as well.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen he began to explain if that commandment were believed today we would be living in a\ndifferent world. Fancy someone believing a teaching which declares, as we measure out to\nothers, it will be measured back to us. There would then be no dishonesty in the world. There\nwould be no persecution. There would be no war. There would be no bloodshed. There would\nbe no contentions in our civilized society because the world stands on one of the great laws\ntaught by the Lord Jesus.\n<\/p><p>\nI quoted again from the sermon: \n<\/p><p>\n\"'Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto\nyou' (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34950\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34950)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34950)\">Matt. 7:7<\/a><\/span>).\nCan't you see the practical thing in that teaching, my brother? If we desire something,\nsomething that is precious, something we need, certainly it will require effort on our part.\"\n<\/p><p>\nMy friend left me. He said, \"I will go home and read the Sermon on the Mount.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI asked, \"You have a New Testament?\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe said, \"I believe I have, but it must be covered with dust.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now it occurs to me that when Joseph Smith penned his thirteen Articles of Faith, he\nstated in the fourth one that the first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6743\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6743)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6743)\">A of F 1:4<\/a><\/span>).\nThere may be other kinds of faith, but the faith that will lead us on to eternal happiness and\nsalvation is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we be true to that sermon, and may we acquit ourselves in such a way that we may be\nworthy of an exaltation in God's kingdom, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
