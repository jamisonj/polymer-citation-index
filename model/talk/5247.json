Thus two great principles on which the gospel is centered, love and agency, are plainly taught. Each of us is here to learn to love and give and hearken to the Spirit and choose to do the will of the Father. God wants his offspring and heirs to become all that we can be, to qualify for our inheritance. But we must choose; we are the decision makers, and he will not relieve that responsibility. As early as the book of Deuteronomy, it is written:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/a-loving-communicating-god.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cI have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; \u2026 therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and \u2026 obey his voice.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21377\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21377)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21377)\">Deut. 30:15, 19\u201320<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/a-loving-communicating-god.p8\" class=\"\">Through the light of the Lord, truth in some measure has reached many avenues and elements and levels of life. It has been a great satisfaction to me to find so much that is so good in so many places and from so many sources. President Joseph F. Smith spoke of the united members of the Godhead as the \u201cfountain of truth\u201d and said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/a-loving-communicating-god.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cFrom this fountain all the ancient learned philosophers have received their inspiration and wisdom\u2014from it they have received all their knowledge. If we find truth in broken fragments through the ages, it may be set down as an incontrovertible fact that it originated at the fountain, and was given to philosophers, inventors, patriots, reformers, and prophets by the inspiration of God.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era,<\/span> June 1907, p. 629.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/a-loving-communicating-god.p10\" class=\"\">Earlier and subsequent leaders of the Church have similarly testified. In every field of activity in which I have been involved, I have had the privilege of association with people of character and quality who shared much of value with me. Consider this special example of the wisdom of a beloved Quaker teacher and writer, Rufus Jones, who said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/a-loving-communicating-god.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cVital religion cannot be maintained and preserved on the theory that God dealt with our human race only in the far past ages, and that the Bible is the only evidence we have that our God is a living, revealing, communicating God. If God ever spoke, He is still speaking. He is the great I Am, not the great He Was.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">A Flash of Eternity<\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/a-loving-communicating-god.p12\" class=\"\">This is a significant expression of fundamental truth. Our own understanding of that principle is that God communicates with his children, and that he has revealed, does now reveal, and will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to his kingdom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/a-loving-communicating-god.p13\" class=\"\">Jewish tradition helps us further appreciate the nature of our Heavenly Father in the tender practice of the Half Hallels offered at Passover in celebration of the historic exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt and their passing through the Red Sea. When they reached the sea, the pursuing Egyptian armies overtook them. Through Moses, God divided the waters, \u201cAnd the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23013\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23013)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23013)\">Ex. 14:22<\/a><\/span>.) The Egyptians went in after them. Then Moses stretched his hand again over the sea, and the waters returned. The Israelites were safe, and the Egyptian armies were drowning.

But the Almighty stopped them and said, \u201cHow can you sing hymns of praise and jubilation when so many of my children are drowning in the sea?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/a-loving-communicating-god.p14\" class=\"\">In remembrance of that event, Jewish people during the latter period of Passover include abridged or shortened psalms of praise, Half Hallels, as part of the celebration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/a-loving-communicating-god.p15\" class=\"\">Truly, light from the Source has shone through all the world.

They deal with the truth about God and Christ and the Holy Spirit\u2014the Godhead; about man himself; about mortal life and its meaning and purposes; and about eternity and its promises.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/a-loving-communicating-god.p17\" class=\"\">A significant example of this fuller light is in response to the expanding catalog of concerns that face mankind\u2014individuals, institutions, countries, civilization.

He then spoke of problems, some of which sound strangely familiar to a modern ear. This very hour in our troubled world, calamity and destruction, fear, starvation, and conflict beleaguer the earth; afflictions and adversities burden many lives. Books multiply dealing with personal and family and societal troubles. Often they seem to agree that the right question to ask is not why good people have trials, but how shall good people respond when they are tried? The scriptures help us to answer some important questions:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<ul class=\"bullet\"><li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Does God promise his children immunity from trouble and affliction?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Is tribulation evidence of his displeasure?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Did the prophets of old and Christ and his Apostles live without adversity?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Did he promise his followers that they would be spared trouble?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ul><p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/a-loving-communicating-god.p22\" class=\"\">Scripture responds.
