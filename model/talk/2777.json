When it was made known that an earth was to be organized, we were apparently very pleased with the announcement.

Satan would have removed a person\u2019s free agency and he proposed to redeem all mankind by force, for which he wanted the recognition, honor, and glory. The plan of Jesus would allow individuals to make a choice between what they considered to be right and what they felt would be wrong, and recommended that all honor and glory would be attributed to the Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-right-to-choose.p20\" class=\"\">One has aptly said: \u201cThere is no end to the good that can be accomplished when we are not concerned as to the one who will receive the credit.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-right-to-choose.p21\" class=\"\">As we journey through this earth life, we have many important and far-reaching decisions to make as individuals. We especially realize that young people must decide whom they will choose to be their friends and with whom they will associate. They must also determine what they will do to earn a livelihood. Young men and young women will hopefully fall in love, and they will have the privilege of choosing the ones whom they wish to marry. They will also determine if their marriage will be in the temple. That is the only place where they can be sealed for time and all eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-right-to-choose.p22\" class=\"\">Many more decisions must also be made, but a person is not alone in making these important decisions. Following his baptism, preparatory for entrance into the Church, hands are laid upon his head, and one bearing the holy priesthood confirms him a member of the Church and bestows upon him the gift of the Holy Ghost, often properly referred to as the Holy Spirit. If we live righteously, the Holy Spirit will be our companion and guide in making these important decisions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-right-to-choose.p23\" class=\"\">Through the medium of prayer we can receive a solution to our problems and know what decisions to make. Ofttimes as we pray we receive a strong impression that the answer to the matter we are considering is \u201cno.\u201d Then again, we can have the feeling that our answer is right and should be a positive \u201cyes.\u201d On the other hand, we may not obtain a clear \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer. In such instances the Lord has given us a formula that should be employed. One should ponder and study the problem out in his mind, make a decision, then ask the Lord if his decision is right. If it is right, he can receive a burning in his bosom and he will know and have the assurance that his decision is right; but if it is not right, there will be a stupor of thought that will cause one to forget the thing which is wrong.
