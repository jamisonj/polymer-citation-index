In September of 1968, the First Presidency reminded members of the Church of \u201ctheir obligations as members of the communities in which they live and as citizens of the nation.\u201d The First Presidency counseled members of the Church as follows:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cThe growing world-wide responsibilities of the Church make it inadvisable for the Church to seek to respond to all the various and complex issues involved in the mounting problems of the many cities and communities in which members live. But this complexity does not absolve members as individuals from filling their responsibilities as citizens in their own communities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cWe urge our members to do their civic duty and to assume their responsibilities as individual citizens in seeking solutions to the problems which beset our cities and communities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cWith our wide ranging mission, so far as mankind is concerned, Church members cannot ignore the many practical problems that require solution if our families are to live in an environment conducive to spirituality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cWhere solutions to these practical problems require cooperative action with those not of our faith, members should not be reticent in doing their part in joining and leading in those efforts where they can make an individual contribution to those causes which are consistent with the standards of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cIndividual Church members cannot, of course, represent or commit the Church, but should, nevertheless, be \u2018anxiously engaged\u2019 in good causes, using the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ as their constant guide.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p13\" class=\"\">The First Presidency and the Twelve wish to reaffirm this important statement of 1968. We believe this is the wise course to pursue, wherein Church members are urged to do their duties as citizens. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints cannot be committed, as an institution, except on those issues which are determined by the First Presidency and Twelve to be of such a nature that the Church should take an official position concerning them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p14\" class=\"\">We believe that to do otherwise would involve the Church, formally and officially, on a sufficient number of issues that the result would be to divert the Church from its basic mission of teaching the restored gospel of the Lord to the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p15\" class=\"\">We earnestly hope Church members will feel their individual responsibilities keenly and pursue them wisely.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p16\" class=\"\">We hope you Regional Representatives will counsel stake presidents and other local leaders in your respective areas to be careful about involving the Church as an institution in matters that are best pursued by Church members as individual citizens. We further hope you will help priesthood leaders and members to understand why the Church must decline many of their requests to involve the Church on a particular issue. The issue may be very deserving and the cause worthy, but for the reasons already indicated, appropriate involvement must come from Church members as individual citizens rather than from the Church as an institution.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>A New System of Conferences<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p18\" class=\"\">We meet together often in the Church in conferences to worship the Lord, to feast upon the word of Christ, and to be built up in faith and testimony. We hold ward, stake, area, and general conferences, among others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p19\" class=\"\">In recent years some of our most inspirational conferences have been the area conferences held outside the United States. We plan, beginning in 1979, to hold some area conferences in the United States. Through these area conferences more members of the Church will be able to meet and hear the General Authorities. Two members of the Council of the Twelve and others will attend each conference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p20\" class=\"\">To ease the burdens of time, travel, and money upon members of the Church, we have also decided, beginning in 1979, to hold only two stake conferences each year in each stake. One of these will be attended by one or more General Authorities and the other by the Regional Representative. This will leave more time for stake presidents and other local leaders to do more in perfecting the Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Simplification<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p22\" class=\"\">Brethren and sisters, we do not want \u201csimplification\u201d to become a slogan or an encouragement to laziness. What we desire is to have Church programs serve Church members, not the reverse. We also want priesthood leaders to take into account, prayerfully and carefully, the needs of their members and to focus on meeting those basic needs. The programs of the Church can be great resources to that end, especially if priesthood leaders will also review local circumstances which may suggest ways in which the flexibility that is being provided can best be applied. You cannot look to the general boards and general committees as the primary source of information in explaining what the Church expects of its members. We have now passed the day when these boards and committees are able to take the program directly to the local level.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p23\" class=\"\">The Church does not have several organizational lines running from headquarters leaders to their local counterparts. There is only one fundamental organizational channel, and that is the priesthood channel, which runs from the First Presidency and the Twelve through the Zone Advisers, Area Supervisors, Regional Representatives, stake presidents, and bishops. The headquarters organizations will support and help those in the priesthood line as much as possible, but we <span class=\"emphasis\">must <\/span>look to you brethren who <span class=\"emphasis\">are <\/span>that priesthood line to assume more responsibility than you ever have before. Our task is to be simple enough <span class=\"emphasis\">to serve our people at the level of their need. <\/span>That is the simplicity toward which we strive, even if that result demands work by some of us that does not seem so simple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p24\" class=\"\">Just as the bishop takes care that no more funds are expended from the ward budget than have been budgeted for each organization, so he should be the chief budget officer in monitoring local expenditures of the <span class=\"emphasis\">time <\/span>of Church members. In both cases, he must always keep the budget in balance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p25\" class=\"\">The measured flexibility we are giving you is to help you to use your time more effectively in serving the Saints. There is a difference between being \u201canxiously engaged\u201d and busy work, between moving forward with fundamentals and in pressing \u201cmeat\u201d upon members when \u201cmilk\u201d is what is needed first.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p26\" class=\"\">The mission of the Church to its members is to make available the principles, programs, and priesthood by which they can prepare themselves for exaltation. Our success, individually and as a Church, will largely be determined by how faithfully we focus on living the gospel in the home. Only as we see clearly the responsibilities of each individual and the role of families and homes can we properly understand that priesthood quorums and auxiliary organizations, even wards and stakes, exist primarily to help members live the gospel in the home. Then we can understand that people are more important than programs, and that Church programs should always support and never detract from gospel-centered family activities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p27\" class=\"\">Members should achieve personal and family preparedness, assisting and strengthening their own family members and others temporally and spiritually in the Lord\u2019s way. They should prepare for and obtain temple blessings for themselves and their kindred dead. They should share the gospel by example, by being a friend, bearing a testimony, serving missions, preparing sons for missions, and by supporting Church missionary efforts. Each member should develop talents, read good literature, be engaged in quality cultural pursuits, and become informed and participate appropriately in local and national civic affairs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p28\" class=\"\">You will observe that all of these functions can best be accomplished through a strong home environment. Quorum leaders should ask themselves, how can we help our quorum members magnify their most important priesthood calling, that of husband and father in their own family? How can we help each priesthood bearer lead out in an environment of love and understanding, honoring his wife and consulting with her in her companion leadership role? Together with bishops and stake presidents they should ask, how can we help parents study the scriptures with their children and reap full blessings from regular and purposeful family home evenings together?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p29\" class=\"\">Relief Society leaders and teachers should ask, how can we help the wife and mother understand the dignity and worth of her role in the divine process of motherhood? How can we help her make her home a place of love and learning, a place of refuge and refinement? How can we strengthen her to assume an added family leadership role when her husband is away from the home, or in those homes without a father?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p30\" class=\"\">Auxiliary leaders and teachers of youth should ask, how can I help these young people to love and obey their parents, honor them, and be supportive of their family responsibilities? How can we schedule meetings, practices, and activities to avoid disrupting home relationships and responsibilities, and to allow time for family activities?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p31\" class=\"\">Our commitment to home-centered gospel living should become the clear message of every priesthood and auxiliary program, reducing, where necessary, some of the optional activities that may detract from proper focus on the family and the home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p32\" class=\"\">We are mindful that many of our members live alone or with family members who do not share fully their commitment to gospel principles. We encourage them to join together in special home evening groups and to participate in local single adult activities to accomplish these same objectives, always striving to strengthen their family ties with parents, brothers and sisters, and other relatives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p33\" class=\"\">As local Church leaders cautiously conserve the time that families can spend together, we say to both parents and children, \u201cCome back home.\u201d Parents should spend less time in clubs, bowling alleys, banquets, and social gatherings, and more time with their children. Young men and women must balance their involvement in school and other social activities with supportive participation in family activities and appropriate time in the home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p34\" class=\"\">All should work together to make home a place where we love to be, a place of listening and learning, a place where each member can find mutual love, support, appreciation, and encouragement.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p35\" class=\"\">I repeat that our success, individually and as a Church, will largely be determined by how faithfully we focus on living the gospel in the home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Genealogy<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p37\" class=\"\">One of the important phases of gospel living is to involve ourselves in temple and genealogical effort. We know full well that the spirit world is filled with the spirits of men and women who are waiting for you and me to get busy in their behalf. It is a grave responsibility that the Lord has placed upon our shoulders, one that we cannot avoid and for which we may stand in jeopardy if we fail to accomplish it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p38\" class=\"\">We have asked the Genealogical Department to simplify genealogical procedures. They have responded and we have approved their recommendation after a careful review. Church members may now render second-mile service in genealogy through extracting names locally from microfilm records. This can do much to accelerate the full use of our temples and to hasten the work for the dead generally.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p39\" class=\"\">We endorse, therefore, this further opportunity for Church members to carry out their temple and genealogical responsibilities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Missionary<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p41\" class=\"\">We are deeply grateful to the numerous missionaries who have proselyted since the beginning of time. For some six thousand years, they have been proselyting. The missionaries today, with their peers, have proselyted the equivalent of nearly one-half million missionary years collectively. In those one-half million years of collective teaching, much has happened. Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden. Cain took the life of his brother, Abel. Noah carried his family through the flood. Civilization moved from the Mississippi River to Mount Ararat. Abraham taught the Egyptians astronomy. Moses led the children of Israel across the Red Sea. Lehi led his people to the promised land. Columbus discovered America. The American Revolutionary War brought freedom to this land. Joseph Smith, the Prophet, was instrumental in restoring the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p42\" class=\"\">The missionaries are now baptizing nearly 160,000 or 170,000 people per year. Many years ago they brought 100,000 Scandinavians, Britons, Germans, and others to Zion in 286 sailing vessels. They crossed the ocean to the Mississippi River, and great numbers of them came up the river to St. Joseph, then continued west by wagon and later by train. The Church has measured phenomenal growth\u2014from six members to four million. Since the actual cost of supporting a missionary is approximately $1,872 each, per year, they are now with their services collectively contributing perhaps $50,000,000 per year, plus other incidental costs of doing missionary work. We are proud of their service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p43\" class=\"\">Nearly 4,000 local boys from other nations than the United States are answering the call of missionary duty.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p44\" class=\"\">We should constantly strive to develop a deep and broad knowledge from which the Lord may inspire us to speak, for he makes clear to us through the Prophet Joseph Smith just what our responsibility is with reference to preaching the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p45\" class=\"\">The Lord says, \u201cSeek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16984\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16984)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16984)\">D&amp;C 11:21<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p46\" class=\"\">So we are preparing to learn it in their own language.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p47\" class=\"\">The great majority of the missionaries who speak the languages now have been required to learn them through hard study.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p48\" class=\"\">\u201cFor it shall come to pass in that day, that every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power, by the administration of the Comforter, shed forth upon them for the revelation of Jesus Christ.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17089\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17089)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17089)\">D&amp;C 90:11<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p49\" class=\"\">\u201cFor verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p50\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people; \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p51\" class=\"\">\u201cBut that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16965\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16965)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16965)\">D&amp;C 1:2, 14, 20<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p52\" class=\"\">Let us note that the kings and rulers and potentates and VIPs are not exempt from listening to this gospel, and we take the gospel to them and make special efforts for them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/living-the-gospel-in-the-home.p53\" class=\"\">\u201cAwake, O kings of the earth!
