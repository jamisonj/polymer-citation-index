They needed to demonstrate courage, physical prowess, or mastery of the necessary skills. The goal was to prove their competence as protectors of women and children; this was always their primary social role. Today, however, with women moving ahead in an advanced economy, provider husbands and fathers are now optional, and the character qualities men had needed to play their role\u2014fortitude, stoicism, courage, fidelity\u2014are obsolete and even a little embarrassing.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10411_000_021\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Kay\u00a0S.

They seem to think of life as a competition between male and female\u2014that one must dominate the other, and now it\u2019s the women\u2019s turn. Some argue that a career is everything and marriage and children should be entirely optional\u2014therefore, why do we need men?<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-10411_000_021\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cWhen you ask young people today what will make them adults, almost no one mentions marriage. They are far more likely to see issues around work\u2014completing education, financial independence, a full-time job\u2014as the signs that they have arrived. Work, career, independence: these are the primary sources of identity today\u201d (Hymowitz, <span class=\"emphasis\">Manning Up,<\/span> 45). The pressure on women to adopt this antimarriage ethic is especially intense. A <span class=\"emphasis\">Times<\/span> of London contributor wrote: \u201cNo one, not my family or my teachers, ever said, \u2018Oh yes, and by the way you might want to be a wife and mother too.\u2019 They were so determined we would follow a new, egalitarian, modern path that the historic ambitions of generations of women\u2014to get married and raise a family\u2014were intentionally airbrushed from their vision of our future\u201d (Eleanor Mills, \u201cLearning to Be Left on the Shelf,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Sunday Times,<\/span> Apr. 18, 2010, www.thetimes.co.uk; in Hymowitz, <span class=\"emphasis\">Manning Up,<\/span> 72). Another writer in her 40s quoted some responses to an article she wrote about her regrets over not marrying: \u201cI am totally appalled by your need for a man,\u201d \u201cGet some self-esteem!\u201d \u201cYou have taken codependency to a whole new low,\u201d and \u201cIf my daughter grows up to want a man half as much as you do, I will know that I\u2019ve done something wrong in raising her\u201d (Lori Gottlieb, <span class=\"emphasis\">Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough<\/span> [2010], 55). The good news is that most people, including educated young adults, aren\u2019t buying the antimarriage, antifamily message. \u201cAccording to a study by a University of Pennsylvania economist, in the United States in 2008, 86 percent of college-educated white women were married by age 40, compared with 88 percent of those with less than a four-year degree. The numbers for white, college-educated men are similar: 84 percent of them were married by 40 in 2008. The conventional wisdom, not borne out by research, by the way, may have it that marriage is a raw deal for women. But college-educated white women don\u2019t seem to believe it. They are the most likely of any group to think that \u2018married people are generally happier than unmarried people.\u2019 \u2026 The large majority\u201470 percent\u2014of first-year college students think raising a family is \u2018essential\u2019 or \u2018very important\u2019 to their futures\u201d (Hymowitz, <span class=\"emphasis\">Manning Up,<\/span> 173\u201374).]<\/span><\/sup> In too many Hollywood films, TV and cable shows, and even commercials, men are portrayed as incompetent, immature, or self-absorbed.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), boys are 30 percent more likely than girls to drop out of both high school and college. \u2026 It is predicted that women will earn 60 percent of bachelor\u2019s, 63 percent of master\u2019s and 54 percent of doctorate degrees by 2016.

Melchizedek Priesthood quorums and the Relief Society can help parents prepare missionaries who know the Book of Mormon and who will go into the field fully committed.

An Aaronic Priesthood quorum in the Rio Grande (Spanish) Ward in Albuquerque, New Mexico, counseled together about whom they could bring back and then as a group went to visit each of them.

They are far more likely to see issues around work\u2014completing education, financial independence, a full-time job\u2014as the signs that they have arrived. Work, career, independence: these are the primary sources of identity today\u201d (Hymowitz, <span class=\"emphasis\">Manning Up,<\/span> 45). The pressure on women to adopt this antimarriage ethic is especially intense. A <span class=\"emphasis\">Times<\/span> of London contributor wrote: \u201cNo one, not my family or my teachers, ever said, \u2018Oh yes, and by the way you might want to be a wife and mother too.\u2019 They were so determined we would follow a new, egalitarian, modern path that the historic ambitions of generations of women\u2014to get married and raise a family\u2014were intentionally airbrushed from their vision of our future\u201d (Eleanor Mills, \u201cLearning to Be Left on the Shelf,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Sunday Times,<\/span> Apr. 18, 2010, www.thetimes.co.uk; in Hymowitz, <span class=\"emphasis\">Manning Up,<\/span> 72). Another writer in her 40s quoted some responses to an article she wrote about her regrets over not marrying: \u201cI am totally appalled by your need for a man,\u201d \u201cGet some self-esteem!\u201d \u201cYou have taken codependency to a whole new low,\u201d and \u201cIf my daughter grows up to want a man half as much as you do, I will know that I\u2019ve done something wrong in raising her\u201d (Lori Gottlieb, <span class=\"emphasis\">Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough<\/span> [2010], 55).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The good news is that most people, including educated young adults, aren\u2019t buying the antimarriage, antifamily message. \u201cAccording to a study by a University of Pennsylvania economist, in the United States in 2008, 86 percent of college-educated white women were married by age 40, compared with 88 percent of those with less than a four-year degree. The numbers for white, college-educated men are similar: 84 percent of them were married by 40 in 2008. The conventional wisdom, not borne out by research, by the way, may have it that marriage is a raw deal for women. But college-educated white women don\u2019t seem to believe it. They are the most likely of any group to think that \u2018married people are generally happier than unmarried people.\u2019 \u2026 The large majority\u201470 percent\u2014of first-year college students think raising a family is \u2018essential\u2019 or \u2018very important\u2019 to their futures\u201d (Hymowitz, <span class=\"emphasis\">Manning Up,<\/span> 173\u201374).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10411_000_021\"><a name=\"-10411_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote3-10411_000_021\">3.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Philip\u00a0G.
