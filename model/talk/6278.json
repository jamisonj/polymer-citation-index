It is this gift, the gift of agency, about which I wish to speak.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p5\" class=\"\">Agency is the power to think, choose, and act for ourselves. It comes with endless opportunities, accompanied by responsibility and consequences. It is a blessing and a burden. Using this gift of agency wisely is critical today because never in the world\u2019s history have God\u2019s children been so blessed or so blatantly confronted with so many choices.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p6\" class=\"\">Life was simpler years ago in my hometown on the Canadian prairie. Our phone number was one digit\u20143. We had one black-and-white movie that came from the larger town of Cardston every Thursday night. Mail came Monday, Wednesday, and Friday\u2014unless it snowed hard.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p7\" class=\"\">There was one main road. Three miles west was our farm, and 20 miles east on that same road was the Cardston Alberta Temple. There weren\u2019t many other roads to choose or places to go.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p8\" class=\"\">Today there are infinite telephone numbers, movies of all kinds and colors, E-mail at our fingertips 24 hours a day, and many roads that relentlessly call for our judgment. Our environment is flooded with choices. But our purpose for being here on earth has never changed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p9\" class=\"\">The Lord told Abraham that He sent us to earth to see if we would do what He asked us to do (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"7446\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7446)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7446)\">Abr. 3:25<\/a><\/span>). Choice becomes inescapable. The world\u2019s two opposing forces seek our commitment. On the one hand, there is the reality of Satan, and on the other, the more powerful love of the Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p10\" class=\"\">Lehi teaches us that if there was no opposition, there would be no righteousness nor wickedness, neither good nor bad. We can\u2019t act for ourselves if there is no choice (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"4735\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4735)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4735)\">2 Ne. 2:11, 16<\/a><\/span>). To become a committed follower of Christ, we must have the option to reject Him. So Satan is permitted to exercise his power, and yielding our will to God can sometimes become difficult. Yet it is in this exercise of acting for ourselves that we grow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p11\" class=\"\">C. S. Lewis said: \u201cOnly those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is. \u2026 You find out the strength of a wind by trying to walk against it, not by lying down. A man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later.\u201d Lewis goes on, \u201cChrist, because He was the only man who never yielded to temptation, is also the only man who knows to the full what temptation means\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Mere Christianity<\/span> [1960], 109\u201310).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p12\" class=\"\">I remember asking my parents if I could do certain things. Their response never varied: \u201cYou have been taught. You know how we feel about that, but you will have to decide for yourself.\u201d Yet deciding for oneself dictates consequences, which are not always what we want. We want the freedom without consequences. And so, too often, we try to stand neutral, undecided, and uncommitted. It is in this atmosphere that we become vulnerable to the influence of Satan.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p13\" class=\"\">King Ahab and his people in northern Israel tell us about neutrality and indecision. The Lord\u2019s hand was stayed because the people would not decide whom to worship\u2014Jehovah or Baal. Baal is another name for Satan. The Lord sent Elijah the prophet with this clear message: \u201cHow long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.\u201d The scriptures say, \u201cThe people answered him not a word\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1331\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1331)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1331)\">1 Kgs. 18:21<\/a><\/span>). They didn\u2019t want the responsibility of making a commitment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p14\" class=\"\">You remember the story: Elijah challenged them to a test to see who is God. They would each pray to their god to see which would burn up the offering on the altar. When the priests called mightily to their idol, they were left unheard and unsupported.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p15\" class=\"\">In stark contrast, one lone prophet of the true and living God was not only heard, he was magnified in his efforts. When Elijah petitioned his God, the fire of the Lord came down and consumed everything\u2014the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, the dust\u2014and it licked up the water in the trench. Following this exhibition, the people said, \u201cThe Lord, he is the God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1332\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1332)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1332)\">1 Kgs. 18:39<\/a><\/span>), and then the scriptures say the priests of Baal were killed. There were no unbelievers still alive in northern Israel that day! Choices would not be a dilemma if good were rewarded as quickly and spectacularly as was Elijah or if wrongdoing meant immediate death. But it is not that simple when our work is to increase our faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p16\" class=\"\">Our faith and commitment are tested when the world offers tempting and enticing alternatives that can turn our faces from the Lord\u2019s kingdom. Some would like to live in that eternal city and still keep a \u201csummer home\u201d in Babylon. If we are not consciously and deliberately choosing the kingdom of God, we will in fact be moving backwards as the kingdom of God moves forward \u201cboldly, nobly, and independent\u201d (Joseph Smith, \u201cThe Wentworth Letter,\u201d in <span class=\"emphasis\">Encyclopedia of Mormonism,<\/span> ed. Daniel H. Ludlow, 5 vols. [1992], 4:1754). Choosing which way we face will determine our blessings or our burdens. The Lord invites us to cast our burdens on Him, and He will sustain us (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"42118\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42118)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42118)\">Ps. 55:22<\/a><\/span>), while Mormon warns, \u201cThe devil will not support his children\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10358\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10358)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10358)\">Alma 30:60<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p17\" class=\"\">A young man I love with all my heart said to me: \u201cNo one can tell me what to do.

Where, then, will his strength come?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p18\" class=\"\">Brother James E. Talmage says of Jesus: He \u201cwas all that a boy should be, for His development was unretarded by the dragging weight of sin; He loved and obeyed the truth and therefore was free\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Jesus the Christ<\/span> [1979], 112).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p19\" class=\"\">Making right choices frees us and blesses us, even in choosing what may appear trivial in our lives. A friend thought the Lord was too involved in his life. He said, \u201cI can\u2019t take all those absolutes in the Church that tell me I must do this, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d My friend did not see that those absolutes are evidence of our Father\u2019s vigilant care.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p20\" class=\"\">Isn\u2019t it incredible? There are six billion people on this planet, and Heavenly Father cares what I watch for entertainment, and He cares what I eat and drink. He cares how I dress and how I earn and spend my money. He cares what I do and don\u2019t do. Heavenly Father cares about my happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p21\" class=\"\">Our Father\u2019s caring comes in so many ways, and we have only to listen and live for it. Someone said, \u201cIf [we] have not chosen the Kingdom of God [first], it will make in the end no difference what [we] have chosen instead\u201d (William Law, 18th-century clergyman).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/agency-a-blessing-and-a-burden.p22\" class=\"\">Because our purpose here on earth has not changed, nor will it ever, our Father steadily and regularly supplies additional gifts to make our world safe and strengthen our wise use of agency.

Think about sacred covenants we have made, the scriptures, priesthood and patriarchal blessings. Think about the ultimate gift of the Atonement and its reminder in the sacrament that blankets us with love and hope and grace.
