I think of the time the beautiful temple here on this block was erected, over a hundred years ago. When the foundation was being laid, we are told that it was sixteen feet wide, and at one time President Brigham Young came and saw the workmen throwing in chipped granite. He made them take it out and put in those great granite blocks with this explanation: \u201cWe are building this temple to stand through the millennium.\u201d Isn\u2019t that a good thought? Each one of us ought to want to build our lives and help our families to build their lives so that we can stand through the millennium.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/laying-a-foundation-for-the-millennium.p8\" class=\"\">As we listened to Brother Romney in this morning\u2019s session, outlining the promises of the prophets and the Savior himself regarding his coming, who is there among us who wouldn\u2019t want to be walking in a way that would assure us that, when the trump of God shall sound and the dead shall come forth, we, with our loved ones, can be numbered among them and share in his presence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/laying-a-foundation-for-the-millennium.p9\" class=\"\">I think of the words of the apostle John, who was banished upon the Isle of Patmos and was shown by an angel everything from the war in heaven, when Satan was cast out, to the final winding-up scene.

And death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to his works.

My wife has said time and time again that she knew the angels brought that spirit to her because she felt their presence, and yet we laid her away in the grave. If we had to feel that that was the end, we would have given anything in this world to have her back again. And then we come to this great knowledge that we have in the restoration of the gospel, that she will be ours in the eternal world and we will have the joy of seeing her grow up without sin, unto salvation. Sometimes I have thought that probably some of these choice spirits did not need the experience here in mortality like other children, and that is why the Lord has seen fit to call them home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/laying-a-foundation-for-the-millennium.p35\" class=\"\">We had four daughters before we had a son.

It takes the sting away from death to know that we are going to meet those who are so dear and sacred to us. Thank God for this knowledge!

No wonder President McKay so often said that no success in life can compensate for failure in the home.
