Increasingly more people are finding that making wise decisions is becoming more and more difficult because of the ultra-interconnected world in which we live. Constantly forced into our consciousness is an incessant barrage of counsel, advice, and promotions. It is done by a bewildering array of media, Internet, and other means. On a given subject we can receive multiple strongly delivered, carefully crafted messages with solutions. But often two of the solutions can be diametrically opposed. No wonder some are confused and are not sure how to make the right decisions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/truth-the-foundation-of-correct-decisions.p6\" class=\"\">To further complicate matters, others try to persuade us that our decisions must be socially acceptable and politically correct. Some pondering of that approach will reveal how wrong it is. Since social and political structures differ widely over the world and can dramatically change with time, the folly of using that method to make choices is apparent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/truth-the-foundation-of-correct-decisions.p7\" class=\"\">There are two ways to find truth\u2014both useful, provided we follow the laws upon which they are predicated. The first is the scientific method. It can require analysis of data to confirm a theory or, alternatively, establish a valid principle through experimentation. The scientific method is a valuable way of seeking truth. However, it has two limitations. First, we never can be sure we have identified absolute truth, though we often draw nearer and nearer to it. Second, sometimes, no matter how earnestly we apply the method, we can get the wrong answer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/truth-the-foundation-of-correct-decisions.p8\" class=\"\">The best way of finding truth is simply to go to the origin of all truth and ask or respond to inspiration.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-00611_000_033\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51307\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51307)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51307)\">Jacob 4:8<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> For success, two ingredients are essential: first, unwavering faith in the source of all truth; second, a willingness to keep God\u2019s commandments to keep open spiritual communication with Him. Elder Robert D. Hales has just spoken to us about that personal revelation and how to obtain it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Scientific Approach<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-00611_000_033\">2<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[For further information see <span class=\"emphasis\">McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Physics<\/span> (2005); Philip Morrison and others, <span class=\"emphasis\">Powers of Ten<\/span> (1982); www.particleadventure.org; and www.atlasoftheuniverse.com.]<\/span><\/sup><\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/truth-the-foundation-of-correct-decisions.p10\" class=\"\">What have we learned from the scientific approach to discovering truth? An example will illustrate. Try as I might, I am not able, even in the smallest degree, to comprehend the extent, depth, and stunning grandeur of what our holy Heavenly Father, Elohim, has permitted to be revealed by the scientific method. If we were capable of moving outward into space, we would first see our earth as did the astronauts. Farther out, we would have a grandstand view of the sun and its orbiting planets. They would appear as a small circle of objects within an enormous panorama of glittering stars. Were we to continue the outward journey, we would have a celestial view of our Milky Way spiral, with over 100 billion stars rotating in a circular path, their orbits controlled by gravity around a concentrated central region. Beyond that, we could look toward a group of galaxies called the Virgo Cluster, which some feel includes our Milky Way, estimated to be about 50 million light years away. Beyond that, we\u2019d encounter galaxies 10 billion light years away that the Hubble telescope has photographed. The dizzying enormity of that distance is suggested by noting that light travels 700 million miles an hour. Even from this extraordinary perspective there would not be the slightest evidence of approaching any limit to God the Father\u2019s creations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/truth-the-foundation-of-correct-decisions.p11\" class=\"\">As awe inspiring as this incredible view of the heavens would present, there is another consideration equally capable of confirming the unfathomable capacities of our Father in Heaven. Were we to move in the opposite direction to explore the structure of matter, we could get a close-up view of a double helix molecule of DNA. That is the extraordinary, self-duplicating molecular structure that controls the makeup of our physical body. Further exploration would bring us to the level of an atom, composed of the protons, neutrons, and electrons we\u2019ve heard about.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/truth-the-foundation-of-correct-decisions.p12\" class=\"\">Were we to penetrate further into the mysteries of the most fundamental makeup of creation, we would come to the limit of our current understanding. In the last 70 years much has been learned about the structure of matter. A Standard Model of Fundamental Particles and Interactions has been developed. It is based on experimentation that has established the existence of fundamental particles designated as quarks and others called leptons. This model explains the patterns of nuclear binding and decay of matter, but it does not yet provide a successful explanation for the forces of gravity. Also, some feel that even more powerful tools than those used to acquire our current understanding of matter might reveal additional fundamental particles. So there are yet more of Father in Heaven\u2019s creations to be understood by the scientific method.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/truth-the-foundation-of-correct-decisions.p13\" class=\"\">We can see the scientific method has brought about an extraordinary expansion of our understanding as the Lord has inspired gifted men who may not understand who created these things nor for what purpose. Many of these may not even recognize such inspiration or give credit to God for the origin of their contributions. I was comforted recently as President Henry B. Eyring shared an experience that his gifted father had in a meeting with other outstanding scientists. He asked them if their research indicated the existence of a superior organizing intelligence. They all confirmed their conviction that such an intelligence exists.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/truth-the-foundation-of-correct-decisions.p14\" class=\"\">Limited as it is, our understanding of our Father\u2019s creations indicates that it is mostly vacant space. Even those things we consider as solid, firm, tangible, when viewed at enormous magnification in the heavens or in minute matter, are mostly vacant space that God, our Father, perfectly controls and uses for His exalted purposes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Revealed Truth Approach<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/truth-the-foundation-of-correct-decisions.p16\" class=\"\">What have we learned about truth through revelation?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/truth-the-foundation-of-correct-decisions.p17\" class=\"\">Centuries ago, God the Father permitted some of His prophets to view His vast creations perfectly, through the eye of the Holy Spirit.
