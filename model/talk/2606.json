I should like to base my remarks upon a divine truth that is found in the book of Proverbs. It reads as follows: \u201cFor the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41529\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41529)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41529)\">Prov. 6:23<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-laws-of-god-are-blessings.p4\" class=\"\">A commandment <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> a lamp to show us the right course, and indeed the law defines that course that we are to follow. Some people look upon laws in general as impediments to them\u2014obstacles\u2014and there are good people in every segment of life who believe that the laws of God, even the great Ten Commandments, are intended only for certain people\u2014for those whom they describe as being extremely religious or for the less fortunate. They believe that while it is essential to observe the laws of the land, it matters little or none if one observes the laws of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-laws-of-god-are-blessings.p5\" class=\"\">Some people feel that the laws of God inhibit freedom; and that they who are not religiously inclined are automatically exempt from the laws and commandments of the Lord; and that if one minds his own business and lives his own life, so to speak, he has sufficient religion for his own welfare; and that salvation and joy everlasting will somehow be forthcoming, even though they do not observe the laws and commandments of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-laws-of-god-are-blessings.p6\" class=\"\">Surely these are shortsighted views.

The laws of God are not given to us to burden us or to handicap us. They are not impositions. They are the statutes through which, if observed, the purpose of life and existence is to be realized.

You know the laws, and President Kimball explained them so well this morning. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the perfect law of liberty, according to the apostle James.

God is its author. He set forth the conditions. He is its fountainhead. The gospel is a great system of laws, which laws are simply eternal principles by which our Father in heaven desires to save mankind, his sons and his daughters, not only to save them, but also to share with them all that the Father has\u2014associations with those we love, honor, power, glory, dominions, even exaltation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-laws-of-god-are-blessings.p21\" class=\"\">But while he gives us commandments, he also gives us the freedom and the liberty to reject them if we choose, as Brother Stapley has already explained to us. As he spoke to Adam and Eve in the Garden he told them that they could eat of every tree of the Garden. This they were free to do. However, he gave a commandment that they should not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil or certain blessings would be lost or denied them. They could eat the fruit if they desired, and if they insisted, but they must remember that he forbade it. They were at liberty to break the commandment; their liberty was not restricted; but if they did eat of the tree, they would have to pay the penalty.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-laws-of-god-are-blessings.p22\" class=\"\">As it was with Adam and Eve, so it is with us.
