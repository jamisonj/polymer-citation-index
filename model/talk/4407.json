Some came on the ground, in cars or buses or trains. Others came by airplane. But whatever the means, we have all arrived at a common destination.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-book-of-mormons-witness-of-jesus-christ.p4\" class=\"\">There is something else that we all had in common on this journey\u2014something that we all needed in order to arrive here safely. Those of us who came by plane were reminded of it very carefully by the airline staff. Upon boarding we were pleasantly greeted with \u201cWelcome aboard.\u201d Then carefully prepared instructions were given: \u201cIn case of a loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will automatically appear. Place your own mask over your nose and mouth first, then help others who require assistance, such as children.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-book-of-mormons-witness-of-jesus-christ.p5\" class=\"\">The oxygen in air is of vital importance. Our physical bodies are completely dependent upon the continuous supply of this most precious commodity. The lack of it for even minutes or seconds can do severe damage to our minds and bodies. Prolonged lack of air can end our mortal lives. But only those of us who traveled by airplane had to be reminded about it, because air, under normal circumstances, is all about us. All we have to do is allow it to flow into our lungs and feed the necessary oxygen to vital parts of our bodies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-book-of-mormons-witness-of-jesus-christ.p6\" class=\"\">Yet even with the ample supply of this life-prolonging substance, after three score and ten years, or some other measure of time, our mortal body ceases to function. What is there that transcends this mortality? What is taken to the other side? In the Book of Mormon Amulek teaches us:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-book-of-mormons-witness-of-jesus-christ.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cThat same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9612\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9612)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9612)\">Alma 34:34<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-book-of-mormons-witness-of-jesus-christ.p8\" class=\"\">What is to the spirit as air is to the body?

The most important spiritual nutrients are knowledge of God and knowledge of his Son. We know the Father by knowing the Son. What is the best source on the face of the earth to learn about the Son? It is in studying another testament of him, commonly known as the Book of Mormon, and then having the Holy Ghost bear witness to you that it is true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-book-of-mormons-witness-of-jesus-christ.p11\" class=\"\">Many testimonies have been and will be borne in this conference to truths from the Book of Mormon, Another Testament of Jesus Christ. We are blessed with the prophets\u2019 utterances in the Old Testament of Jesus Christ as they foresaw his coming. We are doubly blessed with the New Testament, wherein he appeared in the flesh and many knew him. We are triply blessed with another testament of him. My wife, Helen, and I have read the Book of Mormon several times in the past few months. We have asked ourselves, \u201cIf this is another testament of Jesus Christ, how does it perform this task?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-book-of-mormons-witness-of-jesus-christ.p12\" class=\"\">We determined to note every reference to the Savior as we prayerfully prepared ourselves for another excursion through this special witness.
