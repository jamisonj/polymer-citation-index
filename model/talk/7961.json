When I was about 11 years old, my father fell under increased scrutiny as a political dissenter, and my parents felt that the only safe choice for our family would be to flee to West Germany. It was decided that the safest plan was to leave at different times and follow different routes to the West, leaving all our belongings behind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/your-wonderful-journey-home.p9\" class=\"\">Since my father was at greatest risk, he took the quickest journey, through Berlin. My older brothers headed north, and each found his own way west. My sister\u2014who would have been the age of many of you here today\u2014together with Helga Fassmann, her teacher in Young Women, and some others took a train that passed briefly through West Germany. They paid a porter to unlock one of the doors for them, and after the train crossed the West German border, they jumped from the moving train to freedom. How I admired my sister for her courage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/your-wonderful-journey-home.p10\" class=\"\">I was the youngest child, and my mother decided that she and I would walk across a mountain range separating the two countries. I remember that she packed a lunch as if we were going for a hike or a picnic in the mountains.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/your-wonderful-journey-home.p11\" class=\"\">We took a train as far as we could and then walked for long hours, getting ever closer to the West German border. The borders were tightly controlled, but we had a map and knew of a time and a place where it might be safe to cross. I could sense my mother\u2019s anxiety. She observed the area intensely to see if we were being followed. With each step, her legs and knees seemed to become weaker. I helped carry her heavy bag filled with food, vital documents, and family photos as we climbed up one last, long hill. Surely, she thought, we had passed the border by now. When she finally felt safe, we sat down and started to eat our picnic lunch. For the first time that day, I\u2019m sure, she breathed more easily.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/your-wonderful-journey-home.p12\" class=\"\">It was only then that we noticed the border sign. It was still far ahead of us! We were having our picnic on the wrong side of the border. We were still in East Germany!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/your-wonderful-journey-home.p13\" class=\"\">Border guards could show up any moment!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/your-wonderful-journey-home.p14\" class=\"\">My mother frantically packed up our lunch, and we hurried up the hillside as quickly as we could. This time we didn\u2019t dare stop until we knew with certainty that we had reached the other side of the border.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/your-wonderful-journey-home.p15\" class=\"\">Even though each member of our family had taken very different routes and experienced very different hardships along the way, eventually all of us made it to safety.

I can now look back on my life and recognize a number of such \u201cjourneys\u201d I have taken over time. Not all of them involved crossing mountain ranges or political boundaries; some had more to do with overcoming trials or growing in spirituality. But they were all journeys. I believe that every life is a collection of individual \u201cjourney stories.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/your-wonderful-journey-home.p18\" class=\"\">I am sure you are aware that every cultural tradition is rich with journey stories. For instance, you may be familiar with the journey of Dorothy and her dog, Toto, in <span class=\"emphasis\">The Wizard of Oz.<\/span> Dorothy and Toto are swept up in a tornado and deposited in the Land of Oz. There, Dorothy finds that distinctive, yellow-brick road that marks the path for a journey that eventually leads her home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/your-wonderful-journey-home.p19\" class=\"\">Then there is Charles Dickens\u2019s Ebenezer Scrooge, whose journey takes him not from place to place but from time to time. It\u2019s a journey right within his own heart that helped him to understand why he became the way he was and to see what would happen to him if he continued on his path of selfishness and ingratitude.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10705_000_048\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See Charles Dickens, <span class=\"emphasis\">A Christmas Carol.<\/span>]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/your-wonderful-journey-home.p20\" class=\"\">One of the great classical novels of Chinese literature is <span class=\"emphasis\">Journey to the West.<\/span> Written in the 16th century, it tells beautifully the adventure story and pilgrimage of a monk who, with the help of four friendly characters, journeys toward spiritual enlightenment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/your-wonderful-journey-home.p21\" class=\"\">And of course there is Bilbo Baggins, the small, unassuming hobbit who would have very much preferred to stay home and eat his soup.

Their successes and failures can help us find our own way through life. The video we saw a few minutes ago also tells a beautiful journey story.
