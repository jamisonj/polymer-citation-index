The Savior taught that He was the Bread of Life, the source of eternal nourishment. Speaking of the mortal nourishment the world offered, including the manna Jehovah had sent to feed the children of Israel in the wilderness, Jesus taught that those who relied on this bread were now dead (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122725\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122725)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122725)\">John 6:49<\/a><\/span>). In contrast, the nourishment He offered was \u201cthe living bread which came down from heaven,\u201d and, Jesus taught, \u201cif any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122726\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122726)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122726)\">John 6:51<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/teachings-of-jesus.p48\" class=\"\">Some of His disciples said this was \u201can hard saying,\u201d and from that time many of His followers \u201cwent back, and walked no more with him\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122727\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122727)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122727)\">John 6:60, 66<\/a><\/span>).

Even today some who profess Christianity are more attracted to the things of the world\u2014the things that sustain life on earth but give no nourishment toward eternal life. For some, His \u201chard saying\u201d is still a reason not to follow Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>The Atonement<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/teachings-of-jesus.p50\" class=\"\">The culmination of our Savior\u2019s mortal ministry was His Resurrection and His Atonement for the sins of the world. John the Baptist prophesied this when he said, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122729\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122729)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122729)\">John 1:29<\/a><\/span>).

At the Last Supper, Jesus explained, according to the account in Matthew, that the wine He had blessed was \u201cmy blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122731\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122731)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122731)\">Matthew 26:28<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/teachings-of-jesus.p51\" class=\"\">Appearing to the Nephites, the risen Lord invited them to come forward to feel the wound in His side and the prints of the nails in His hands and His feet. He did this, He explained, \u201cthat ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122732\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122732)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122732)\">3\u00a0Nephi 11:14<\/a><\/span>).
