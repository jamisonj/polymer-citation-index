I felt a desire to be more like him, a valiant servant of God. So one night I prayed for a test to prove my courage. I can remember it vividly. In the evening I knelt in my bedroom with a faith that seemed almost to fill my heart to bursting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p7\" class=\"\">Within a day or two my prayer was answered. The hardest trial of my life surprised and humbled me. It provided me a twofold lesson. First, I had clear proof that God heard and answered my prayer of faith. But second, I began a tutorial that still goes on to learn about why I felt with such confidence that night that a great blessing could come from adversity to more than compensate for any cost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p8\" class=\"\">The adversity that hit me in that faraway day now seems tiny compared to what has come since\u2014to me and to those I love. Many of you are now passing through physical, mental, and emotional trials that could cause you to cry out as did one great and faithful servant of God I knew well. His nurse heard him exclaim from his bed of pain, \u201cWhen I have tried all my life to be good, why has this happened to me?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p9\" class=\"\">You know how the Lord answered that question for the Prophet Joseph Smith in his prison cell:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cThe Son of Man hath descended below them all.

You may have seen the need for that foundation, as I have, at the bedside of someone ready to give up the fight to endure to the end. If the foundation of faith is not embedded in our hearts, the power to endure will crumble.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p22\" class=\"\">My purpose today is to describe what I know of how we can lay that unshakable foundation. I do it with great humility for two reasons. First, what I say could discourage some who are struggling in the midst of great adversity and feel their foundation of faith is crumbling. And second, I know that ever-greater tests lie before me before the end of life. Therefore, the prescription I offer you has yet to be proven in my own life through enduring to the end.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p23\" class=\"\">As a young man I worked with a contractor building footings and foundations for new houses. In the summer heat it was hard work to prepare the ground for the form into which we poured the cement for the footing. There were no machines. We used a pick and a shovel. Building lasting foundations for buildings was hard work in those days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p24\" class=\"\">It also required patience. After we poured the footing, we waited for it to cure. Much as we wanted to keep the jobs moving, we also waited after the pour of the foundation before we took away the forms.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p25\" class=\"\">And even more impressive to a novice builder was what seemed to be a tedious and time-consuming process to put metal bars carefully inside the forms to give the finished foundation strength.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p26\" class=\"\">In a similar way, the ground must be carefully prepared for our foundation of faith to withstand the storms that will come into every life. That solid basis for a foundation of faith is personal integrity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p27\" class=\"\">Our choosing the right consistently whenever the choice is placed before us creates the solid ground under our faith. It can begin in childhood since every soul is born with the free gift of the Spirit of Christ. With that Spirit we can know when we have done what is right before God and when we have done wrong in His sight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p28\" class=\"\">Those choices, hundreds in most days, prepare the solid ground on which our edifice of faith is built. The metal framework around which the substance of our faith is poured is the gospel of Jesus Christ, with all its covenants, ordinances, and principles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p29\" class=\"\">One of the keys to an enduring faith is to judge correctly the curing time required. That is why I was unwise to pray so soon in my life for higher mountains to climb and greater tests.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p30\" class=\"\">That curing does not come automatically through the passage of time, but it does take time. Getting older does not do it alone. It is serving God and others persistently with full heart and soul that turns testimony of truth into unbreakable spiritual strength.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p31\" class=\"\">Now, I wish to encourage those who are in the midst of hard trials, who feel their faith may be fading under the onslaught of troubles. Trouble itself can be your way to strengthen and finally gain unshakable faith. Moroni, the son of Mormon in the Book of Mormon, told us how that blessing could come to pass. He teaches the simple and sweet truth that acting on even a twig of faith allows God to grow it:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p33\" class=\"\">\u201cFor it was by faith that Christ showed himself unto our fathers, after he had risen from the dead; and he showed not himself unto them until after they had faith in him; wherefore, it must needs be that some had faith in him, for he showed himself not unto the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p34\" class=\"\">\u201cBut because of the faith of men he has shown himself unto the world, and glorified the name of the Father, and prepared a way that thereby others might be partakers of the heavenly gift, that they might hope for those things which they have not seen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p35\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, ye may also have hope, and be partakers of the gift, if ye will but have faith.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-10405_000_010\">7<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122855\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122855)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122855)\">Ether 12:6\u20139<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p36\" class=\"\">That particle of faith most precious and which you should protect and use to whatever extent you can is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

I was blessed to have known others of you who are listening now when you were younger, vibrant, gifted beyond most of those around you, yet you chose to do what the Savior would have done. Out of your abundance you found ways to help and care for those you might have ignored or looked down upon from your place in life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p43\" class=\"\">When hard trials come, the faith to endure them well will be there, built as you may now notice but may have not at the time that you acted on the pure love of Christ, serving and forgiving others as the Savior would have done. You built a foundation of faith from loving as the Savior loved and serving for Him. Your faith in Him led to acts of charity that will bring you hope.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p44\" class=\"\">It is never too late to strengthen the foundation of faith. There is always time. With faith in the Savior, you can repent and plead for forgiveness. There is someone you can forgive. There is someone you can thank. There is someone you can serve and lift. You can do it wherever you are and however alone and deserted you may feel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p45\" class=\"\">I cannot promise an end to your adversity in this life. I cannot assure you that your trials will seem to you to be only for a moment.

Knowing those reasons may not give much comfort, but it can give you a feeling of patience. Those reasons come from this one fact: in Their perfect love for you, Heavenly Father and the Savior want you fitted to be with Them to live in families forever. Only those washed perfectly clean through the Atonement of Jesus Christ can be there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/mountains-to-climb.p47\" class=\"\">My mother fought cancer for nearly 10 years.

In all conditions, we can choose the right with the guidance of the Spirit. We have the gospel of Jesus Christ to shape and guide our lives if we choose it. And with prophets revealing to us our place in the plan of salvation, we can live with perfect hope and a feeling of peace. We never need to feel that we are alone or unloved in the Lord\u2019s service because we never are. We can feel the love of God.
