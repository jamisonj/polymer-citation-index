For over forty years I have studied and taught the principles of the Church welfare program. I love its principles and know they constitute the capstone to a Christian life. I appreciate what has been said by those who have just spoken to us this morning. They have demonstrated the effect living welfare principles has on us individually and collectively.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/living-welfare-principles.p5\" class=\"\">In 1936 President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., said, \u201cThe real long-term objective of the welfare plan is the building of character in the members of the Church, givers and receivers, rescuing all that is finest down deep inside of them and bringing to flower and fruitage the latent richness of the spirit, which after all is the mission and purpose and reason for being of this church.\u201d (Special Meeting of Stake Presidencies, 2 Oct. 1936.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/living-welfare-principles.p6\" class=\"\">Most of us have experienced the joy of observing someone who has been in need of help receive that help and, consequently, become self-sustaining. Many of us have become witnesses to the truth that the poor can be exalted when they are administered to in the Lord\u2019s way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/living-welfare-principles.p7\" class=\"\">Today, however, I would like to direct my comments to the effect living welfare principles has on the giver, as opposed to the receiver. Repeating president Clark\u2019s statement of 1936, \u201cThe real long-term objective of the welfare plan is the building of character in the members of the Church, givers and receivers.\u201d The Lord doesn\u2019t really need us to take care of the poor. He could take care of them without our help if it were his purpose to do so. \u201cI, the Lord,\u201d he said, \u201cstretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/living-welfare-principles.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd it is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17670\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17670)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17670)\">D&amp;C 104:14\u201315<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/living-welfare-principles.p9\" class=\"\">It would be a simple thing for the Lord to reveal to President Kimball where the deposits of oil and precious ores are.

No, the Lord doesn\u2019t really need us to take care of the poor, but <span class=\"emphasis\">we<\/span> need this experience; for it is only through our learning how to take care of each other that we develop within us the Christlike love and disposition necessary to qualify us to return to his presence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/living-welfare-principles.p10\" class=\"\">That one cannot be a true disciple of Christ without significant giving is dramatically emphasized in the revelation received by the Prophet Joseph Smith in Kirtland, on June 7, 1831. In this revelation, the Lord directed twenty-eight of the elders to travel two by two from Kirtland to Jackson County, Missouri. They were to go by different routes, preaching the gospel as they went. You will recall that they were destitute in those days and had to travel through primitive country. Joseph Smith and his immediate companions \u201cjourneyed by wagon and stage and occasionally by canal boat to Cincinnati, Ohio,\u201d then to Louisville, Kentucky, and on to St. Louis by steamer. \u201cFrom this city on the Mississippi, the Prophet of God walked across the entire state of Missouri to Independence, Jackson County, a distance of nearly three hundred miles as traveled.\u201d (George Q. Cannon, <span class=\"emphasis\">Life of Joseph Smith the Prophet,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1958, p. 117.) I call these facts to your attention that you may have in mind the background against which the Lord said to these men as they started, \u201cRemember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted, for he that doeth not these things, the same is not my disciple.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17603\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17603)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17603)\">D&amp;C 52:40<\/a><\/span>.)

Mormon, speaking to those who give for the wrong reasons, said, \u201cFor if he offereth a gift, or prayeth unto God, except he shall do it with real intent it profiteth him nothing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/living-welfare-principles.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cFor behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/living-welfare-principles.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cFor behold, if a man being evil giveth a gift, he doeth it grudgingly; wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he had retained the gift; wherefore he is counted evil before God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38451\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38451)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38451)\">Moro. 7:6\u20138<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/living-welfare-principles.p16\" class=\"\">Only by voluntarily giving, out of an abundant love for his neighbor, can one develop that charity characterized by Mormon as the \u201cpure love of Christ.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38457\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38457)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38457)\">Moro. 7:47<\/a><\/span>.) In Mosiah we read: \u201cAnd \u2026 Alma commanded that the people of the church should impart of their substance, every one according to that which he had; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly; and of him that had but little, but little should be required; and to him that had not should be given.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/living-welfare-principles.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd thus they should impart of their substance <span class=\"emphasis\">of their own free will and good desires towards God.<\/span>\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40489\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40489)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40489)\">Mosiah 18:27\u201328<\/a><\/span>; italics added.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/living-welfare-principles.p18\" class=\"\">Some may ask, \u201cHow do I obtain these righteous feelings in giving?

As you lose yourself in this service, the Lord will touch and soften your heart and gradually bring you to the feelings with which he blessed the people in King Benjamin\u2019s time, which prompted them to say, \u201cYea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40485\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40485)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40485)\">Mosiah 5:2<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/living-welfare-principles.p19\" class=\"\">This charity in its perfection is demonstrated by the Lord in everything that he does. The Lord revealed to Moses the numerous worlds which have been created and said, \u201cFor behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power.

Hence, we see the complete unselfishness of our Father in Heaven. His whole work and glory is to bring eternal life and happiness to his children. Should not our whole purpose in this life, therefore, be made up of righteous service one to another? If not, how can we ever hope to be as he is? As we individually become filled with the \u201cpure love of Christ\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38458\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38458)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38458)\">Moro. 7:47<\/a><\/span>), we collectively evolve into a church which is \u201cpure in heart\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17662\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17662)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17662)\">D&amp;C 97:21<\/a><\/span>).
