One of the powerful stories in the Book of Mormon teaches us of the influence that parents can have in the lives of their young sons. This is the account of 2,060 young men who volunteered to defend the liberty of their country. They were led into battle by Helaman, yet \u201cthere was not one soul of them who did perish; yea, and neither was there one soul among them who had not received many wounds\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10327\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10327)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10327)\">Alma 57:25<\/a><\/span>). Why? Because \u201cthey did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness.\u201d Then Helaman explains the reason behind this great miracle: \u201cI did remember the words which they said unto me that their mothers had taught them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10326\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10326)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10326)\">Alma 57:21<\/a><\/span>).

When you teach them that there is a just God and that He wants every able and worthy young man to serve a mission, your sons will have the faith to answer the Lord\u2019s call.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/as-for-me-and-my-house-we-will-serve-the-lord.p15\" class=\"\">Bishops, as part of your stewardship you have a tremendous responsibility to prepare your young men to serve full-time missions. Begin early. Help them understand Alma\u2019s experiment. Plant the seed to serve a mission in their hearts. Then have them ask the Lord if it is a good seed. Then, if you help them nourish that seed, it will grow into the miracle of having that young man serve a mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/as-for-me-and-my-house-we-will-serve-the-lord.p16\" class=\"\">I will always be grateful that Sister Richards, bishops, and priesthood leaders taught our sons and prepared them to serve missions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/as-for-me-and-my-house-we-will-serve-the-lord.p17\" class=\"\">How can we achieve a significant increase in the number of young men serving full-time missions?

The doctrine that will change the behavior of our young men regarding missions is understanding the worth of a single soul. Jesus Christ paid the supreme sacrifice in providing the infinite Atonement, which provides the only way for us to return and live with our Heavenly Father. When parents, bishops, and our young men understand this true doctrine, our young men will be prepared and have a desire to serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/as-for-me-and-my-house-we-will-serve-the-lord.p20\" class=\"\">May I quote from Elder Joe J.

It is a blessing and a privilege. \u2026 Remember, \u2026 the Lord and his prophets are counting on you\u201d (\u201cThe Savior Is Counting on You,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1996, 41).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/as-for-me-and-my-house-we-will-serve-the-lord.p21\" class=\"\">There is not anything a young man can do that will be any more important than serving a full-time mission.
