The prosecution presented three witnesses, each of whom saw the man commit the crime. The defense then presented three witnesses, none of whom had seen its commission. The simple jury was confused. Based on the number of witnesses, the evidence seemed to the jury equally divided. The man was acquitted. It was irrelevant, of course, that untold millions had never seen the crime. There needed to be only one witness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/knowing-that-we-know.p6\" class=\"\">In the genius of the gospel plan, there ultimately only has to be one witness, but that witness must be you. The testimony of others may initiate and nourish the desire for faith and testimony, but eventually every individual must find out for himself. None can permanently endure on borrowed light.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/knowing-that-we-know.p7\" class=\"\">The restored gospel is not truer today than when a solitary boy walked out of the Sacred Grove in 1820. Truth has never been dependent on the number who embrace it. When Joseph left the grove, there was only one man on earth who knew the truth about God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. It is necessary, however, that each find out for himself and carry that burning testimony into the next life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/knowing-that-we-know.p8\" class=\"\">When the 23-year-old Heber J. Grant was installed as president of the Tooele Stake, he told the Saints he believed the gospel was true. President Joseph F. Smith, a counselor in the First Presidency, inquired, \u201cHeber, you said you believe the gospel with all your heart, \u2026 but you did not bear your testimony that you know it is true. Don\u2019t you know absolutely that this gospel is true?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/knowing-that-we-know.p9\" class=\"\">Heber answered, \u201cI do not.\u201d Joseph F. Smith then turned to John Taylor, the President of the Church, and said, \u201cI am in favor of undoing this afternoon what we did this morning. I do not think any man should preside over a stake who has not a perfect and abiding knowledge of the divinity of this work.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/knowing-that-we-know.p10\" class=\"\">President Taylor replied, \u201cJoseph, Joseph, Joseph, [Heber] knows it just as well as you do.

One day, with a handful of our missionaries, I spoke with an esteemed representative of another Christian faith. This gentle soul spoke of his own religion\u2019s history and doctrine, eventually repeating the familiar words: \u201cBy grace ye are saved. Every man and woman must exercise faith in Christ in order to become a saved being.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/knowing-that-we-know.p14\" class=\"\">Among those present was a new missionary. He was altogether unfamiliar with other religions. He had to ask the question, \u201cBut, sir, what happens to the little baby who dies before he is old enough to understand and exercise faith in Christ?\u201d The learned man bowed his head, looked at the floor, and said, \u201cThere ought to be an exception. There ought to be a loophole. There ought to be a way, but there isn\u2019t.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/knowing-that-we-know.p15\" class=\"\">The missionary looked at me and, with tears in his eyes, said, \u201cGoodness, President, we do have the truth, don\u2019t we!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/knowing-that-we-know.p16\" class=\"\">The moment of testimony realization\u2014when you know that you know\u2014is sweet and sublime. That testimony, if nurtured, will rest upon you as a mantle. When we see light, we are engulfed by it. Lights of understanding turn on within.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/knowing-that-we-know.p17\" class=\"\">I once conversed with a fine young man who was not of our faith, although he had attended most of our worship services for more than a year. I asked why he had not joined the Church. He replied, \u201cBecause I do not know whether it is true. I think it may well be true, but I cannot stand and testify, as you do, \u2018I actually know it is true.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/knowing-that-we-know.p18\" class=\"\">I inquired, \u201cHave you read the Book of Mormon?\u201d He answered that he had read in the book.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/knowing-that-we-know.p19\" class=\"\">I asked whether he had prayed about the book. He answered, \u201cI have mentioned it in my prayers.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/knowing-that-we-know.p20\" class=\"\">I told my friend that as long as he casually read and prayed, he never would find out, worlds without end. But when he set aside a period for fasting and pleading, the truth would be burned into his heart, and he would know that he knew. He said nothing more to me but told his wife the next morning that he would be fasting. The following Saturday he was baptized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/knowing-that-we-know.p21\" class=\"\">If you want to know that you know that you know, a price must be paid.

When Brigham Young left the waters of baptism, he said: \u201cThe spirit of the Lord was upon me, and I felt as though my bones would consume within me unless I spoke to the people. \u2026 The first discourse I ever delivered I occupied over an hour.

Our posterity must know that we know, because we oft tell them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/knowing-that-we-know.p26\" class=\"\">Early Church leaders paid a great price to establish this dispensation.
