Moyle, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1956, pp. 59-63<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI, like Elder Stapley, have had in mind calling to your attention at least, a part of the great\nservice that President David O. McKay has rendered the Church and his Maker during the last\nfifty years, and particularly that service been rendered during the last twenty years since the\nestablishment of the great Church welfare program came about.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Lord speaks through his servants, as he did in 1936, there is no room left for any\ndoubt in the minds of true Latter-day Saints.  We believe in the words of Amos which have\nbeen quoted here before today, that\n<\/p><p>\nSurely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the\nprophets (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10403\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10403)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10403)\">Amos 3:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn this respect we reaffirm our Ninth Article of Faith: \n<\/p><p>\nWe believe all that God has revealed, all that he does now reveal, and we believe that\nhe will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6710\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6710)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6710)\">A of F 1:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a story that has oft been told by President McKay, particularly during the early days\nof the welfare program, that I should like to repeat.  It is the story of an engineer who pulled\nhis train into a station one dark and stormy night, and while the engineer was going\ncalmly about oiling his engine, getting ready for the next run, a timid\npassenger from the coach came up to him and asked him if he were not afraid of going out\ninto the dark. Without looking up the engineer said, \"I'm not pulling my train out into the\ndark tonight.\" \"Oh, I beg your pardon, I thought you were going to be our engineer,\" said the\nman. \"I am, but I won't be in the dark tonight.\" He said, \"Why, I should think you would be\nvery nervous with the lives of all these men and women on this train depending upon you.\"\nFor an answer the engineer pointed up to the headlight that threw an intense white light\nseveral hundred yards ahead on the track and said, \"When I pull out of this station tonight I\nam going to run just to the edge of that light, and when I get there, that light will be extended\nseveral hundred yards ahead, and I shall run to the end of that light and so on throughout the\nnight.  I'll be running in the light all the way.\" And the man replied, \"Thanks for the lesson,\nfaithful engineer.\"\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay continued: \"I can say this to you: The first circle of light we have seen is\nOctober 1st, 1936, when by that date we shall see to it that we have sufficient food, fuel,\nclothing, etc., to see every needy family through this coming winter, and by the time we get\nto October 1st, the light will have extended sufficiently far to permit us to see the next move\nwe should make.  I can promise you one thing, that we'll be running in the light all the way\nthrough this dark night.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNo more prophetic utterances, I am sure, could have been made at that time. And it is my\nprivilege today to bear testimony to the fact that that prophetic statement has been fulfilled,\nand that ever since then we have been running in the light, and the story, of course, is not yet\ntold but will yet reveal a great work of inspiration and of progress.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we sing, \"We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet\" it has a meaning to Latter-day\nSaints; it has a meaning to welfare workers throughout the Church.  Our presence here today\nindicates how happy and how grateful we are to live in a day and age when a prophet of God\nis in our midst.  We know that we are not left alone to our own judgment or the devices of\nmen.\n<\/p><p>\nThose who have been helped by the program during the last twenty years are naturally\ngrateful for the program of the Church, for the generosity of the Saints, and for the inspiration\nof the brethren who preside over them, but the interesting fact is that those who have been\ncalled to labor and to give and to sacrifice and to carry out this great work, are also extremely\ngrateful. They are grateful for the opportunity that they have had to serve their fellow men. \nThey know the truthfulness of the words that \"it is more blessed to give than to receive\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7790\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7790)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7790)\">Acts 20:35<\/a><\/span>).\nThey have cause every day of their lives to thank the Lord for the privilege which has been\ntheirs of carrying on this inspired work.  As a matter of fact, this is the spirit of welfare work. \nIt has insured its success from the beginning, and it will continue with us to carry on in the\nfuture.\n<\/p><p>\nI know of nothing more faith-promoting in the Church than to be associated with the welfare\nprogram and to participate in its activities.  Back of it all has been the faithfulness and the\ndevotion of the people of the Church. I do not want to deal in superlatives today, but I am\nsure that no credit would be too great for the membership of the Church who have met every\nemergency and have provided for every need which has made itself known since this great\nprogram was initiated. The people have not failed.  They are not failing now. Their efforts are\nkeeping pace with the needs of their brethren.  Both have necessarily expanded as our\nproblems have arisen.\n<\/p><p>\nWhereas twenty years ago we only had 115 stakes, we now have 227. Not alone has there\nbeen an increase in numbers, but our society has become more complex.  I mean by that, of\ncourse, the society in which we live. So far as the Church is concerned, our society should be\nkept as simple as ever. Now in the world there are many limitations imposed upon our\nfreedom of action, individually and collectively, many restraints upon us in government and\nindustry, and in all our activities of life we are circumscribed, of necessity.  Many of these\ninfluences are insidious in their nature, some of which we are not aware of\nuntil we are struck with the full force and effect thereof, and often then we are left helpless if\nwe stand alone.\n<\/p><p>\nI have long since been satisfied in my own mind that the commencement of our intensive\ncollective effort to meet these problems was timed of the Lord. Had it not been for the\ninspiration of the Almighty, President Grant and his Counselors would not have foreseen as\nthey did the future requirements to meet the changing conditions in the world in which we\nlive.  Their prophetic foresight made it possible for the people to anticipate and prepare for\nthe future. They also gave us the plan under which we have operated.  Up to this time, April\n1936, most of our welfare cases were handled by the bishop, individually.  He stood, as it\nwere, alone out in the world, with his own resources pretty much, and the result was that he\nwas not capable, standing alone, of meeting these intricate problems as they arose in our new\nsociety.  With the advent of the program designed to meet our present complex problems, all\nthe bishops of the Church were united in a way that each might share with the other, and all\nprofit by the experiences gained throughout the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nBut this change in the program from the individual bishop to the welfare program did not in\nany wise change the principle or the practice upon which our care for the poor was based.  It\nstill remains the work of the individual bishop to take care of his own.  Thus we continue to\ncarry out in the welfare program the mandate of the Lord given to us in the establishment of\nhis Church and kingdom here in these latter days, just as it was imposed upon the people of\nprior dispensations.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat happened in the primitive church?  The same practice of taking care of the poor and the\nneedy, no doubt in a greater degree of perfection than now, for we are told: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . all that believed were together, and had all things common;<br \/>\nAnd sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had\nneed (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7770\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7770)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7770)\">Acts 2:44-45<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither\nsaid any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they\nhad all things common.<br \/>\nNeither was there any among them that lacked\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7781\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7781)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7781)\">Acts 4:32,34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYou know, King Benjamin, in speaking of those who would not assist the poor, would not\nsuccor the needy, said,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he\nrepenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the\nkingdom of God (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40278\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40278)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40278)\">Mosiah 4:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Amulek, speaking on the same subject, said: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do\ndeny the faith\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8971\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8971)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8971)\">Alma 34:28<\/a><\/span>),\nwhen we do not take care of the poor and the needy.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd in the opening of this dispensation, the Lord said unto us through his Prophet, Joseph\nSmith: \n<\/p><p>\nBehold, I say unto you, that ye must visit the poor and the needy and administer to\ntheir relief (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13457\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13457)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13457)\">D&amp;C 44:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd remember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted, for he\nthat doeth not these things, the same is not my disciple\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13468\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13468)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13468)\">D&amp;C 52:40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI know of no more eloquent characterization of the welfare program than that made by\nPresident McKay on October 2, 1936, after we had had six months' experience in this work: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I do not know of any activity,\" the President said, \"with which we have been associated\nwhich promises more fruitful results in temporal and spiritual achievement than this Church\nsecurity [welfare] program . . . It is going to stand out in Church history as significant . . .\nBrethren, I congratulate you with all my heart.  You are not doing it for yourselves, but for\nothers and for the Lord, by providing, and contributing to the progress and success of the\nChurch.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The development of our spiritual nature should concern us most. Spirituality is the highest\nacquisition of the soul, the divine in man; 'the supreme, crowning gift that makes him king of\nall created things.' It is the consciousness of victory over self and of communion with the\ninfinite.  It is spirituality alone which really gives one of the best in life.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Throughout this conference frequent reference has been made, and appropriately so, to the\nplan inaugurated the General Authorities of the Church for the relief of those who are\nunemployed. It is at present one of our greatest, and one of the most important concerns of\nthe Church.  During the few minutes allotted to me I desire to call attention to the spiritual\nvalue of this important and far-reaching undertaking.\n<\/p><p>\n\"In the 29th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we are told that all things unto the Lord\nare spiritual, 'and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither\nany man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I gave unto him\ncommandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, for my commandments are\nspiritual; they are not natural nor temporal, neither carnal or sensual'\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13452\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13452)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13452)\">D&amp;C 29:34-35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"It is something to supply clothing to the scantily clad, to furnish ample food to those whose\ntable is thinly spread, to give activity to those who are fighting desperately the despair that\ncomes from enforced idleness, but after all is said and done, the greatest blessings that will\naccrue from the Church security [welfare] plan are spiritual.  Outwardly, every act seems to\nbe directed toward the physical: re-making of dresses and suits of clothes, canning fruits and\nvegetables, storing foodstuffs, choosing of fertile fields for settlement&mdash;all seem strictly\ntemporal, but permeating all these acts, inspiring and sanctifying them, is the element of\nspirituality.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThat is the declaration of our beloved President to us, and it has been the inspiration not alone\nfor the general Church welfare committee though all these years, but I am sure also the\ninspiration for you, my brethren and sisters, who have made this great accomplishment\npossible.\n<\/p><p>\nHistorically important as is the past, our attention must now be riveted upon the present and\nthe future while we are still taking care of our daily tasks.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is of prime importance, of course, that we should have acquired the various projects that we\nhave throughout the Church, but it is my humble judgment today that it would be better for\nus never to have acquired a welfare project than to fail to take care of it now that we have it. \nThe Lord will not hold us blameless, those of us who lead in the wards and the stakes of the\nChurch, if we take of the funds of people, those sacred trust funds, and purchase projects and\nthen do not utilize those projects as the Lord would have us. So I say today that the severest\ntest is here confronting us now.\n<\/p><p>\nNow we have never judged the success of our welfare projects by their earning power, by any\nprofit which might accrue therefrom, nor have we judged them as they might function in time\nof plenty, where ere is no unemployment, where we have been required to draw upon the\nbusy people of the Church for the greatest contribution for their maintenance.  We should\nnever forget the fact that these projects reach the peak of their importance when they produce\nin time of need that which is necessary to meet the emergency, and which at the same time\nwill furnish to the greatest number of men and women in periods of unemployment the\nemployment by which they can gain that which they need for the sustenance of themselves\nand their families.\n<\/p><p>\nI say to you today, this welfare plan has become a great insurance, not only to the people of\nthe Church but also to our neighbors and friends in the world.  And you might ask me, of\nwhat benefit is this program to the world and particularly the communities in which we live. \nI say to you, it is a benefit to them because we are prepared and will continue to be prepared\nto take care of our own and thus relieve the public load and to give that which the public has\nto those who have not been blessed by the inspiration and direction of the prophet of God\nwho leads the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in these days.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to say a word in conclusion about our tax situation.  Some people both within and\nwithout the Church seem to worry about some welfare projects upon which no state tax has\nbeen levied. Let me say to you humbly, my brethren and sisters, and to the\nworld, that we pay in very deed a hundred percent of the production of these farm projects of\nours to the same identical cause to which much of our taxes are dedicated.  The gross\nproduction of our welfare projects goes to relieve a tax burden rather than the small fraction\nwhich would be charged us were we limited alone to the tax that might be levied upon it if it\nwere not tax-exempt by law. I am sure that the people in the Church and out of the Church\nshould have no worry about our not meeting our civic responsibilities.  I am sure that we will\nalways be found doing more than our share in the communities in which we live throughout\nthe world.  Think of it, with the eat number of welfare projects we have now, scattered as\nthey are throughout the United States and Canada, we can be assured that no particular\nclimatic condition or no particular disaster could affect us all, and that we are in the position\nwhere when one community is hurt we can draw from the other communities and the other\nprojects of the Church to assist them.  With every new project we have added insurance for\nour future welfare and protection.\n<\/p><p>\nI hope and pray that we may always be responsive in the future as we have been in the past\nto the great leadership of President McKay and to that inspiration and direction which will\ncome to him as he continues to preside over us in the Church and kingdom of God, and this I\npray humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
