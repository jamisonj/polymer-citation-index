As I have accepted this invitation, I have found myself discovering new and exciting things in this book even though I have read it many times before. For instance, I rediscovered 2 Nephi 4:15 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44597\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44597)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44597)\">2 Ne. 4:15<\/a><\/span>], which reads, \u201cFor my soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p5\" class=\"\">This scripture teaches us how to read the Book of Mormon. It mentions three important ideas.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p6\" class=\"\">First, \u201cMy soul delighteth.\u201d I love this phrase! I have thought about hungering and thirsting after knowledge as I read the scriptures, but delighting in them is something else. I find that what I take away from the scriptures is determined by what I bring. Each time I read them, I am, in a sense, bringing a new person with new eyes to the experience. Where I am in my life, the experiences I am having, and my attitude all affect how much I will gain. I love the scriptures. I treasure the truths I find as I read them. Joy fills my heart as I receive encouragement, direction, comfort, strength, and answers to my needs. Life looks brighter, and the way opens before me. I am reassured of my Heavenly Father\u2019s love and concern for me every time I read. Surely this is a delight to me. As one little boy in a Sunbeam class put it, \u201cI feel happy about the scriptures!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p7\" class=\"\">Second, \u201cMy heart pondereth them.\u201d How I love to carry the scriptures with me in my heart! The spirit of what I have read rests there to bring me peace and comfort. The knowledge I have gained gives me guidance and direction. I have the confidence born out of obedience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p8\" class=\"\">Sometimes I have the luxury of immersing myself in the scriptures. Sometimes I read them in snatches. However, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter where or when I read the scriptures; I can still carry them in my heart. I have found that by reading them in the morning I am able to carry the influence of the Spirit with me throughout the day. When I read them midday, it is usually because a need has taken me there where I am able to find answers and directions that influence my decisions and actions. When I read them at night, the sweet, comforting messages from the Lord linger in my subconscious mind as I rest. Many times I awaken at night with ideas or thoughts that originate from the words I read just before drifting off to sleep. My mind may go many places during the day, but my heart securely embraces the words of the Lord found in the scriptures and \u201cpondereth them.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p9\" class=\"\">Through this I have learned that \u201cas [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44461\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44461)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44461)\">Prov. 23:7<\/a><\/span>). As I ponder the scriptures, something happens to me. I have a stronger desire to live close to my Heavenly Father. I long to serve Him. I want to live the principles that I learn in the scriptures, and as I do, my heart \u201cwriteth them for the learning and the profit of my children.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p10\" class=\"\">I, of course, do not write scriptures as did Nephi, but when I read the scriptures and live the principles learned, those scriptures become written in my life. They govern my actions and are written there for my children to see and follow. I can build a legacy, a tradition of righteous living, based on the principles I learn in the scriptures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p11\" class=\"\">Doctrine and Covenants 93:39\u201340 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44741\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44741)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44741)\">D&amp;C 93:39\u201340<\/a><\/span>] teaches: \u201cAnd that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cBut I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p13\" class=\"\">By reading the scriptures, I can be assured that I will know the \u201clight and truth\u201d that will bless me and my family.
