In that stressful period, some of our bishops observed that members who paid their tithing were able to support their families more effectively than those who did not. The tithe payers tended to keep their employment, enjoy good health, and be free from the most devastating effects of economic and spiritual depression (see <span class=\"emphasis\">Church News,<\/span> 9 Dec. 1961, p. 16). Countless tithe-paying Latter-day Saints can testify to similar blessings today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p15\" class=\"\">I am grateful to President Grant and other prophets for teaching the principle of tithing to my parents and to them for teaching it to me.

When I became conscious that we went without some desirable things because we didn\u2019t have enough money, I asked my mother why she paid so much of her salary as tithing. I have never forgotten her explanation: \u201cDallin, there might be some people who can get along without paying tithing, but we can\u2019t. The Lord has chosen to take your father and leave me to raise you children. I cannot do that without the blessings of the Lord, and I obtain those blessings by paying an honest tithing. When I pay my tithing, I have the Lord\u2019s promise that he will bless us, and we must have those blessings if we are to get along.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p17\" class=\"\">Years later I read President Joseph F. Smith\u2019s memory of a similar testimony and teaching by his widowed mother. In the April 1900 conference, President Smith shared this memory from his childhood:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cMy mother was a widow, with a large family to provide for. One spring when we opened our potato pits she had her boys get a load of the best potatoes, and she took them to the tithing office; potatoes were scarce that season. I was a little boy at the time, and drove the team. When we drove up to the steps of the tithing office, ready to unload the potatoes, one of the clerks came out and said to my mother, \u2018Widow Smith, it\u2019s a shame that you should have to pay tithing.\u2019 \u2026 He chided my mother for paying her tithing, called her anything but wise or prudent; and said there were others who were strong and able to work that were supported from the tithing office. My mother turned upon him and said: \u2018William, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Would you deny me a blessing? If I did not pay my tithing, I should expect the Lord to withhold His blessings from me. I pay my tithing, not only because it is a law of God, but because I expect a blessing by doing it. By keeping this and other laws, I expect to prosper and to be able to provide for my family\u2019\u201d (in Conference Report, Apr. 1900, p. 48).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p19\" class=\"\">Some people say, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to pay tithing.\u201d Those who place their faith in the Lord\u2019s promises say, \u201cI can\u2019t afford not to pay tithing.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p20\" class=\"\">Some time ago I was speaking to a meeting of Church leaders in a country outside of North America. As I spoke about tithing, I found myself saying something I had not intended to say. I told them the Lord was grieved that only a small fraction of the members in their nations relied on the Lord\u2019s promises and paid a full tithing. I warned that the Lord would withhold material and spiritual blessings when his covenant children were not keeping this vital commandment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p21\" class=\"\">I hope those leaders taught that principle to the members of the stakes and districts in their countries. The law of tithing and the promise of blessings to those who live it apply to the people of the Lord in every nation.

But I have often thought of that little boy\u2019s words as I have observed how some adult Church members relate to the law of tithing. I think we still have some whose attitude and performance consist of giving the bishop something like \u201ca very old horse.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p39\" class=\"\">The payment of tithing is a test of priorities. The Savior taught that reality when he gave this parable:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p40\" class=\"\">\u201cThe ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p41\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p42\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p43\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p44\" class=\"\">\u201cBut God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p45\" class=\"\">\u201cSo is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32503\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32503)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32503)\">Luke 12:16\u201321<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p46\" class=\"\">A modern illustration of that principle is suggested in the apocryphal story of two men standing before the casket of a wealthy friend. Asked one, \u201cHow much property did he leave?\u201d Replied the other, \u201cHe left all of it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p47\" class=\"\">President Lorenzo Snow taught that \u201cthe law of tithing is one of the most important ever revealed to man\u201d (quoted in Le Roi C. Snow, \u201cThe Lord\u2019s Way Out of Bondage,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era,<\/span> July 1938, p. 442). Faithful adherence to this law opens the windows of heaven for blessings temporal and spiritual. As a lifelong recipient of those blessings, I testify to the goodness of our God and his bounteous blessings to his children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/tithing.p48\" class=\"\">I pray that each member of this church will qualify for the blessings promised and bestowed on those who bring all their tithes into the storehouse.
