For many, there is simply too much light, too much truth, and too much intelligence. Others who resist the gospel have found its principles too pure, too noble, and much too elevating to accord with their chosen life-style. In all ages of the world since Adam\u2019s time, the gospel of Jesus Christ has always met opposition whenever and wherever it has been proclaimed. This negative spirit challenges the truths of God and concerns His servants, even today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p4\" class=\"\">The heavens have been opened to holy men of various ages. In each case, the receiver of the vision has been rejected by his fellowmen. Sometimes his life has been sought and he has had no peace upon the earth. Prophets and Apostles, even the Lord Jesus Christ, have met such adversity and challenges. The true gospel of Christ is very unpopular with the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p5\" class=\"\">If there is anyone listening who is deeply troubled by the apparent criticism thrown against us periodically, let me say that we have a glorious array of predecessors who have been persecuted and who have met opposition time and time again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p6\" class=\"\">It is a source of consolation and encouragement that we do not stand alone in this respect. In former times, Saints of God have been challenged and scorned for no other cause than for preaching the truth in its fulness and purity, and for standing up in defense of holy and pure principles revealed from God. In fact, the trials they have been called upon to pass through, instead of being an evidence against, are evidence in favor of the truth of the work they were engaged in.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p7\" class=\"\">The Lord Jesus said, \u201cWoe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you!\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32213\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32213)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32213)\">Luke 6:26<\/a><\/span>.) He warned His disciples of the danger when their names were honored and when all men spoke well of them. In a real sense, we as Latter-day Saints are also being warned. When our names are being honored in connection with all men speaking well of us, we need to renew our humility, dedication, and commitment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p8\" class=\"\">My beloved Saints of God, let us remember the warning from our prophets: \u201cOthers will he pacify and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4146\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4146)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4146)\">2 Ne. 28:21<\/a><\/span>.) If anyone finds himself in that position, it is time for renewed humility, commitment, and dedication.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p9\" class=\"\">When the Lord came to Jerusalem, He was rejected and despised by many from the day of His birth until His Golgothic death. He spoke and taught as none had ever done before. He worked as none had ever done. He performed miracles and wonderful works among men. But what kind of treatment did He receive? He was rejected by those who were supposed to have loved Him. He was buffeted, scourged, mobbed, and led like a lamb to the slaughter. Jesus, a being in whom there was no guile, bore a rough-hewn cross\u2014that cruel instrument of death which tore at His back as He hung in agony. The scribes, Sadducees, and Pharisees did not welcome Him with open arms. Nor did the learned, the wise, and the noble hail Him. Then need we expect the world to embrace and welcome us with open arms?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p10\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith knew and understood by the teachings given unto him of God and angels what he had to do. He was called of the Lord and raised up for this very purpose. He, too, was not popular among men, nor did the world clamor for his wisdom. Until the day of his death, he was persecuted and reviled for living and teaching the gospel. His blood sealed his testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p11\" class=\"\">In the Lord\u2019s own day, the proclamation was, \u201cCan there any good thing come out of Nazareth?\u201d (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"29235\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29235)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29235)\">John 1:46<\/a><\/span>.) Likewise, the life and teachings of Joseph Smith did not appeal to those with worldly thoughts. Joseph\u2019s teachings came into conflict with man-made traditions and prejudices. The cry in Joseph Smith\u2019s day was much the same as in the day of the Savior: \u201cCan anything good come out of Palmyra? Can anything good come from Joseph Smith?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p12\" class=\"\">Today we hear a similar cry: \u201cCan anything good come from the Mormon people? Can good be wrought by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?\u201d Falsehoods are spoken about the true Saints of God. These will continue to abound until the coming of the Son of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p13\" class=\"\">Saints of God in all ages have passed through these tests of opposition. Those of today find themselves in no different position. Until evil is bound, this shall ever be the case. This is one of the legacies left to the elect Saints while here in mortality. Opposition may be our companion, and adversity our fate until the Lord comes in a cloud of glory. Latter-day Saints, this is our legacy. We may depend on it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p14\" class=\"\">Said Jesus, \u201cI have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29263\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29263)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29263)\">John 15:19<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cIf the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cIf ye were of the world, the world would love his own.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cIf they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29262\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29262)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29262)\">John 15:18\u201320<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p18\" class=\"\">What if some of us have to sacrifice all that we have for the gospel and testimony of Christ?

He descended below all things that He might rise above all. Should we complain if we face challenges ourselves? As an individual, as one who has walked the path of poverty and trials, I am beginning to learn the value of such experiences. The Lord has always been my faith, strength, and courage. I want nothing but the best for my family and others. I desire salvation and eternal life for my family and for my fellowmen. I will pray for our critics and enemies. I will be patient and long-suffering toward them and will return kindness, prayer, and righteousness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p20\" class=\"\">There is no stopping the true work of God. Some men may resent it. The world may reject it. They may use every means and all their power against this work, but the work of God will roll forth and will gather every honest soul throughout the earth sooner or later.

We have gone from continent to continent, from land to land, from island to island, wherever there was a door open to preach the gospel. We have left our homes, families, wives, and children. Some have sacrificed their lives for the salvation of their fellowmen. Some have gone without purse or scrip. Some have faced shame and ridicule, even persecution. We shall continue to do this until we have taken this beloved gospel to the ends of the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/can-there-any-good-thing-come-out-of-nazareth.p22\" class=\"\">This message of salvation and eternal life has been entrusted to us.
