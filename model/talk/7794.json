Afterward the bishop shook his hand and addressed him as \u201cpresident,\u201d explaining to the quorum members that he \u201caddressed him as president to emphasize the sacredness of his calling. The deacons quorum president is one of only four people in the ward who hold keys of presidency. With those keys, he, with his counselors, will lead the quorum under the inspiration of the Lord.\u201d This bishop understood the power of a presidency led by a president who holds and exercises sacred priesthood keys. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122049\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122049)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122049)\">D&amp;C 124:142\u201343<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/sacred-keys-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p9\" class=\"\">Later I asked this young man if he was ready to preside over this great quorum.

Can you tell me?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/sacred-keys-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p10\" class=\"\">I told him he had a wonderful bishopric and advisers who would help him become a successful and powerful priesthood leader.

We determined to find a scripture that would be a starting place for his search to learn the responsibilities of his new calling.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/sacred-keys-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p14\" class=\"\">We turned to the 107th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122050\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122050)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122050)\">verse\u00a085<\/a><\/span>. It mentions that a deacons quorum president is to sit in council with his quorum members and teach them their duties. We noted that his quorum is not only a class but also a council of young men, and they are to strengthen and edify one another under the president\u2019s direction. I expressed confidence that he would be an outstanding president who would rely on the inspiration from the Lord and magnify his sacred calling as he taught his fellow deacons their duties.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/sacred-keys-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p15\" class=\"\">Then I asked, \u201cKnowing you are to teach the deacons their duties, do you know what those duties are?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">Again we turned to the scriptures and found:<\/p>\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A deacon is appointed to watch over and be a standing minister in the Church (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122051\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122051)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122051)\">D&amp;C 84:111<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Because the family is the basic unit of the Church, the most important setting in which an Aaronic Priesthood holder can fulfill this duty is in his own home. He provides priesthood service to his father and mother as they lead the family. He also watches over his brothers and sisters, the young men of his quorum, and the other members of the ward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A deacon assists the teacher in all his duties in the Church if occasion requires (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122052\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122052)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122052)\">D&amp;C 20:57<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>We determined that if a deacon is to assist with the teachers\u2019 duties, he needs to know their duties. We looked in the scriptures and quickly identified over a dozen duties for the office of teacher (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122053\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122053)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122053)\">D&amp;C 20:53\u201359<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122054\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122054)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122054)\">84:111<\/a><\/span>). What a powerful experience it would be for every young man\u2014and his father, advisers, and all of us\u2014to do exactly what this young man did: go to the scriptures and discover for ourselves what our duties are. I suspect that many of us will be surprised\u2014and inspired\u2014by what we find. Duty to God contains helpful summaries of Aaronic Priesthood duties and is a great resource for spiritual development. I urge you to consistently use it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Deacons and teachers are also to \u201cwarn, expound, exhort, and teach, and invite all to come unto Christ\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122055\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122055)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122055)\">D&amp;C 20:59<\/a><\/span>; see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122056\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122056)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122056)\">verses 46 and 48<\/a><\/span> for priests).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Many young men think that their missionary experience starts when they turn 19 and enter the Missionary Training Center. We learn from the scriptures that it starts long before that.
