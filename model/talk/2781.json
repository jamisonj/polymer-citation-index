Now for instance, this prophecy of Isaiah has always appealed to me. When Babylon was the greatest city in all the world, Isaiah prophesied that Babylon would be destroyed, that it would become the abode of reptiles and wild animals, that the Arabs would no more pitch their tents there. Then he said that Babylon would never be rebuilt.
