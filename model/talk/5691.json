It is <span class=\"emphasis\">I will<\/span> become very well acquainted with the noble prophet Nephi through studying, pondering, and feasting upon the first two books of the Book of Mormon. My young friends, I promise that when you come to really know Nephi, you will be so impressed with his determination, courage, and desire to be obedient to the \u201cthings the Lord commands\u201d that you will have a strong desire to incorporate his attributes into your own lives. Then when you are tempted by the adversary, as you may be nearly every day, to deviate from the counsel of the prophets, the wishes of your parents, or what \u201cthe Lord commands,\u201d you can immediately have the words of stalwart Nephi automatically come to your mind: \u201cI will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2092\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2092)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2092)\">1 Ne. 3:7<\/a><\/span>). And when someone with whom you associate suggests you participate in something that is not as \u201cthe Lord commands,\u201d you can think of the courageous plea Nephi made to his elder brothers: \u201cLet us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2093\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2093)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2093)\">1 Ne. 3:16<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/i-will-go.p14\" class=\"\">I am aware of a group of courageous young men who followed the example of Nephi. After winning a baseball state championship for their age group, their team, made up mostly of Aaronic Priesthood holders, was invited to represent their state in a tournament to be held in a distant location. Upon arriving at the tournament site, they learned that some of the games were scheduled to be played on the Sabbath day. Each of these young men had to make a difficult personal decision: would he support the team, including several nonmember team members; or if scheduled on Sunday, would he follow what \u201cthe Lord commands\u201d in keeping the Sabbath day holy? Their honoring the Sabbath day could mean the team would forfeit their chances of winning the tournament. One by one they quietly approached the coaches, and following the example of Nephi they independently chose to decline participation on the Sabbath day. As it turned out, when Sunday arrived the team\u2019s record, coupled with adverse weather conditions, interrupted the schedule. I have had occasion to closely follow these young men over the years. They have continued to pattern their lives after the sterling example of Nephi. They have gone on missions, and they continue to strive to do and say what the Lord has commanded.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/i-will-go.p15\" class=\"\">A few weeks ago I, like perhaps many of you, witnessed on television a long-standing baseball record broken. A record once thought unbreakable. Tears rolled down my cheeks as I watched this fine athlete who broke the record stand on the field with his family and receive accolades of the public and his team. Although I am impressed with this young man\u2019s ability to hit and field a baseball, I am far more impressed with the attributes he displayed in achieving that feat. He demonstrated great perseverance, constancy, sacrifice, courage, and determination in reaching his goal. These are some of the attributes we need to help us be successful in going, doing, and saying as \u201cthe Lord commands.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/i-will-go.p16\" class=\"\">You adult brethren, may I suggest an \u201cI will\u201d for us which has been repeatedly emphasized by modern prophets?

It is <span class=\"emphasis\">I will<\/span> resolve that the leadership of my family will be my most important and sacred responsibility; and <span class=\"emphasis\">I will<\/span> not leave the teaching and governance of my family to society, to the school, or to the Church.
