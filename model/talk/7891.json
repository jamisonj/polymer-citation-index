It is my prayer that by the power of the Holy Ghost, I may bring some measure of hope, of peace, and of understanding. It is my desire to be an instrument in bringing about a restoration of your faith in our loving Father in Heaven, who knows all things and allows us to experience trials so that we can come to know and love Him and understand that without Him we have nothing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/because-i-live-ye-shall-live-also.p17\" class=\"\">On February 4 of 1990, our third son and sixth child was born. We named him Tyson. He was a beautiful little boy, and the family greeted him with open hearts and open arms. His brothers and sisters were so proud of him. We all thought he was the most perfect little boy who had ever been born.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/because-i-live-ye-shall-live-also.p18\" class=\"\">When Tyson was eight months old, he aspirated a piece of chalk that he had found on the carpet. The chalk lodged in Tyson\u2019s throat, and he quit breathing. His older brother brought Tyson upstairs, frantically calling, \u201cThe baby won\u2019t breathe. The baby won\u2019t breathe.\u201d We began to administer CPR and called 911.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/because-i-live-ye-shall-live-also.p19\" class=\"\">The paramedics arrived and rushed Tyson to the hospital. In the waiting room we continued in fervent prayer as we pled to God for a miracle. After what seemed a lifetime, the doctor came into the room and said, \u201cI am so sorry. There is nothing more we can do. Take all the time you need.\u201d She then left.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/because-i-live-ye-shall-live-also.p20\" class=\"\">As we entered the room where Tyson lay, we saw our lifeless little bundle of joy. It seemed as though he had a celestial glow around his little body. He was so radiant and pure.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/because-i-live-ye-shall-live-also.p21\" class=\"\">At that moment it felt as if our world had come to an end. How could we return to the other children and somehow try to explain that Tyson wasn\u2019t coming home?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/because-i-live-ye-shall-live-also.p22\" class=\"\">I will speak in the singular as I relate the rest of this experience.

Most of the time I felt as if I were in a bad dream and that I would soon wake up and this terrible nightmare would be over. For many nights I didn\u2019t sleep. I often wandered in the night from one room to the other, making sure that our other children were all safe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/because-i-live-ye-shall-live-also.p24\" class=\"\">Feelings of guilt racked my soul. I felt so guilty. I felt dirty. I was his father; I should have done more to protect him. If only I would have done this or that. Sometimes even today, 22 years later, those feelings begin to creep into my heart, and I need to get rid of them quickly because they can be destructive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/because-i-live-ye-shall-live-also.p25\" class=\"\">About a month after Tyson died, I had an interview with Elder Dean\u00a0L. Larsen. He took the time to listen to me, and I will always be grateful for his counsel and love. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the Lord would want you to punish yourself for the death of your little boy.\u201d I felt the love of my Heavenly Father through one of his chosen vessels.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/because-i-live-ye-shall-live-also.p26\" class=\"\">However, tormenting thoughts continued to plague me, and I soon began to feel anger. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair! How could God do this to me? Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\u201d I even felt myself get angry with people who were just trying to comfort us. I remember friends saying, \u201cI know how you feel.\u201d I would think to myself, \u201cYou have no idea how I feel. Just leave me alone.\u201d I soon found that self-pity can also be very debilitating. I was ashamed of myself for having unkind thoughts about dear friends who were only trying to help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/because-i-live-ye-shall-live-also.p27\" class=\"\">As I felt the guilt, anger, and self-pity trying to consume me, I prayed that my heart could change. Through very personal sacred experiences, the Lord gave me a new heart, and even though it was still lonely and painful, my whole outlook changed. I was given to know that I had not been robbed but rather that there was a great blessing awaiting me if I would prove faithful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/because-i-live-ye-shall-live-also.p28\" class=\"\">My life started to change, and I was able to look forward with hope, rather than look backward with despair. I testify that this life is not the end. The spirit world is real. The teachings of the prophets regarding life after death are true.

Through the years it has been wonderful to see the mercy and kindness of a loving Father in Heaven, who has allowed our family to feel in very tangible ways the influence of Tyson. I testify that the veil is thin. The same feelings of loyalty, love, and family unity don\u2019t end as our loved ones pass to the other side; instead, those feelings are intensified.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/because-i-live-ye-shall-live-also.p30\" class=\"\">Sometimes people will ask, \u201cHow long did it take you to get over it?\u201d The truth is, you will never completely get over it until you are together once again with your departed loved ones.
