Moyle, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1956, pp. 112-115<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brethren and sisters, I can ask for nothing more than to have that spirit here\nwith me today that I enjoyed as I undertook to fulfil my assignment to visit the missions of\nSouth America this past summer.\n<\/p><p>\nI had no sooner set foot upon that great continent than I had an opportunity to meet with a\ngroup of wonderful elders in the great city of Rio de Janeiro. Conditions that day were not as\nfavorable as they might have been for the making of a good impression. I was inclined to be\njust a little discouraged. However an impression came over me when I stood up to address\nthose elders that there was a spiritual awakening in process in South America; that the elders\nwho were then working there would, during the short term of their mission, become conscious\nof this awakening; and that it would bring a great joy and satisfaction into their lives.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I toured those missions, I became more and more convinced that that awakening had\nstarted in large measure through the relatively recent visits of our General Authorities to that\ngreat continent. I have in mind the visit there of President David O. McKay and President\nStephen L Richards, and of Elder Mark E. Petersen some eighteen months preceding my visit.\n<\/p><p>\nI am here to bear witness to you today that those impressions which I received upon that\noccasion have in part fulfilled themselves already. In that great land of Brazil we are forging\nahead with our conversions and our baptisms far more rapidly than we have ever done before\nin the history of that mission. When I first arrived and made that prediction, President\nSorensen and his elders had hopes of three hundred baptisms this year. They have exceeded\nthat mark, and now hope for five hundred.\n<\/p><p>\nThere has been a change in the feeling, the attitude of the missionaries. They sense, as they\nhave never sensed before, that they are part of a great movement that is marching on to\naccomplish its great purpose among 54 million people who live in Brazil, and of which some\n35 million are of European extraction. These people represent half of the entire population of\nSouth America.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom the moment we landed in Brazil until we completed our mission in Brazil, the\nArgentine, and the Uruguayan missions, there seemed never to be a moment but what that\nassurance which we received in Rio de Janeiro was present with us. It seemed to radiate from\nthe membership of the Church. They are seeking diligently to lend obedience to the principles\nof the gospel of Jesus Christ. The elders are showing a degree of diligence which would\ncommend them to any group of missionaries, I am sure, anywhere in the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nWe had so many notable incidents and experiences that I shall not endeavor to detail any of\nthem. I have a feeling there is a great mission for us to perform at home, and that thought has\nnever left me. I sensed in the very first meeting the importance of our elders preaching an\neffective gospel. We have all experienced here today and in the previous sessions of this\nconference what it means to hear preached an effective gospel. Men have stood here and have\nborne their testimonies under the power and influence of the Holy Ghost. They have spoken\nwith authority. They have had a keen insight into the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ\nand understand their redeeming powers.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so I say, as we journeyed through those great missions and enjoyed the sweet\ncompanionship of the mission presidents and their wives and families, we were impressed\nconstantly with the thought that there was a work for us to do here at home&mdash;those of us\nwho are responsible for having sent these young men and women into the mission field. I\nhave come with a plea in my heart that we dedicate ourselves to teach the young and rising\ngeneration in our homes, first of all, the principles of the gospel long before they are called\nupon a mission. Develop within them power to explain principles, and have in their hearts a\ntestimony born of the Spirit that the heavens have once again been opened, that the gospel has\nonce again been brought to the earth, and that it is our mission above all other missions in life\nto promulgate this gospel among the nations of the earth and to teach the principles of the\ngospel to these peoples of the earth in their native lands and in their native tongue.\n<\/p><p>\nMy heart goes out to elders who are sent to missions in foreign-speaking countries. I am sure\nmy feelings are born somewhat of experiences which were mine when I was called to serve in\nwhat was then the Swiss-German Mission, under the presidency of Thomas E. McKay. I\nknow what it is to go to a strange country and sense keenly the responsibility that rests upon\nus as missionaries to preach the gospel to those people in their native tongues. I am sure that\nthe time has long since arrived when every Latter-day Saint family should cultivate within the\nfamily circle that tongue which was native to their parents or their grandparents.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have an example in the life of Lehi and his family. We would not have the Book of\nMormon today if it had not been for the fact that Lehi, inspired of our Heavenly Father, sent\nback for those brass plates of Laban, and thereby insured the perpetuation of the language of\ntheir forebears in their posterity.\n<\/p><p>\nI have a feeling that an obligation rests upon those of us whose parents came from\nforeign-speaking countries to show forth our love of the countries out of which we have been\ncalled by the priesthood of God to the extent of learning that language.\n<\/p><p>\nI have rather a deep-seated desire in my heart, and I always have had since I was a boy, to\nwant to meet my great-grandfather to whom the elders first preached the gospel. Now, in my\ncase, his language is my mother tongue. I am sure that same feeling exists in the hearts of all\ngood Latter-day Saints whose families sprung from foreign-speaking nations. That is the\nloyalty side of it. I have a feeling in my heart that we can be loyal to the nation of our birth,\nor of our adoption, and still show forth our love of the country of our parents to the extent of\nperpetuating its language in our family circles.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been reading with a great deal of interest recently a book published by James B.\nConant, former president of Harvard University, and now United States Ambassador to\nWestern Germany, in which he says that there are two subjects&mdash;he puts them above all other\nsubjects&mdash;which he would prescribe for modern day study in our universities and colleges.\nThe first one is foreign language, and the second one is history. Thus we have a second\nreason for wanting to learn a foreign language. President Conant points out in his book that in\ncountries such as Switzerland and Holland a man is not considered educated if he does not\nspeak at least two foreign languages. He points out that with modern-day transportation, the\ncapitals of the world today have been brought so closely together that we cannot carry on the\nbusiness of the world without a more intimate knowledge of foreign languages than we now\nhave. Surely that must be the case with the business of the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have today, for example, five or six Spanish-speaking missions. We have three\nGerman-speaking missions. We have three Scandinavian missions, and many other missions in\nwhich foreign tongues are spoken; for example, the Brazilian Mission, of which I have\nspoken, in which the Portuguese tongue is spoken.\n<\/p><p>\nI wonder if it would not be becoming of us as Latter-day Saints to revive the language of our\nforefathers in order that we might better qualify ourselves to carry out the great mission\nwhich is ours of preaching the gospel to the nations of the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nI was rather interested in the tendency of the South American countries to concentrate upon\nthe legal language, so to speak; in Brazil and in the Argentine many people are of German\nextraction. One whole state in Brazil is a German state, but during the war it became\nimportant that all should speak Portuguese as a security measure. So they had to give up the\nteaching of German in the schools of that German state of Santa Catarina. Inside of a few\nyears, just half a generation, you now go to young boys and girls whose parents and\ngrandparents spoke German fluently, and speak to them in German, and they answer you in\nPortuguese. They still understand a little, but they have entirely given up the speaking of that\ngreat tongue. The same is true to a large measure with the French. There are many French\npeople there.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, it is important, even down there, that these languages should be perpetuated. We have\nnot been able as a Church to send missionaries into Italy, into Portugal, into Spain. Every\ntime we convert a person in South America of European extraction, we are bringing the\ngospel closer to their families on the continent. Instance after instance was given us of how,\nwhen a Portuguese family in Brazil is converted to the Church, they begin immediately\nsending their tracts and their literature, and above all, the Book of Mormon, into Portugal.\nSome are able to save enough to go to Portugal. The primary purpose of the visit of these\npeople now to the Old Country, whether they be French or German or Portuguese or Italian,\nis to preach the gospel to their people, their families.\n<\/p><p>\nThe result is that we have some instances where they have gone to the Old Country and\nconverted their families, and then their families have had to come to this country in order to\nbe baptized.\n<\/p><p>\nIn all such instances, you see how essential it is to retain the language of our forebears. I\ndesire to tell you the story of one German lad who was born of very wealthy parents. His\nfather owned a tremendous estate in Germany. He called his son in one day and said, \"My\nboy, all this is yours. I am going to retire.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe boy looked up at his father and said, \"I do not know why, but I am not going to accept\nit. I am going to travel.\" Then he said, \"I was led as it were by a spirit to come here to\nBrazil, and for eight long years I wondered why I had left home. I never was dissatisfied. I\nwas always happy about it, but I did not know why until finally one day two Mormon elders\ncame to me and preached the gospel. Fortunately these two men who were on a mission\nstruggling to speak the Portuguese language could speak enough German to this young man to\nteach him the gospel. He said, \"They had no more than finished their first conference with me\nthan I knew why I had left my father's home.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHis home now has been a gathering place for the elders. He has left his wife and his family\nof five children and is laboring in a distant city in Brazil as a full-time missionary. He is\npreaching the gospel to those who speak German in that city.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is an obligation resting upon us, brethren and sisters, to see to it that the next\ngeneration of missionaries that come from our homes come better prepared in two respects to\ngo forth and fulfil their missions, wherever they may be called: \n<\/p><p>\nFirst, to learn those languages which are in a way native to the family. I am sure those who\ncome of German extraction will be able to speak the language with a better accent, with a\nlarger vocabulary, and with a greater natural ease than those who did not have that gift by\nright of inheritance.\n<\/p><p>\nSecond, to know the restored gospel and understand the great plan of life and salvation and\nhave a love of the work.\n<\/p><p>\nI plead with you, my brethren and sisters, to anticipate; and while we are anticipating a\nmission for our sons and our daughters, we ought to anticipate for them also a marriage, a\nmilitary career for our sons so long as we have compulsory military training, and then a life's\nwork. We cannot begin too young. We certainly will increase the percentage of temple\nmarriages if we take it upon ourselves to instruct our young people in these important affairs\nof life in their early ages; we will make better missionaries of them, make better citizens and\nbetter soldiers.\n<\/p><p>\nI bring you the greetings of the Saints and of the elders in South America. They are growing\nnot only in numbers; they are also growing in strength, and they have a warmth and a\nhospitality which is not excelled anywhere in the world. In our very first meetings in the\nArgentine at La Paz and Buenos Aires we had a total of just under nine hundred people\npresent. There was hardly a soul who left those meetings without coming up and shaking\nhands with Sister Moyle and me and welcoming us, telling us how grateful they were to the\nChurch for sending first Brother Petersen, and then me, to tour these missions. They had the\ndeep-seated hope in their hearts that they would be continually favored with such visits.\n<\/p><p>\nI do not feel that this report would be complete if I did not tell you of a little story that my\nwife used in practically all of the meetings that we held in these three missions. We were\ntrying to impress upon the people the personality of God, his personal attributes. Sister Moyle\ngenerally emphasized that point by telling this little story. There was a boy (I cannot tell it as\nwell as she does, but I will do my best), five years old who was accustomed to kneel down at\nhis bed at night and say his prayers. On this particular night the mother listened at the door to\nsee just what he said. This is what she heard: \"God, bless Mama, bless Papa, bless Grandma,\"\nand then he usually hopped into bed. But on this occasion he remained on his knees and he\nsaid, \"And dear God, please take care of yourself, for if anything happened to you we would\nall be sunk.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I hope and pray, my brethren and sisters, that we may all sense keenly the importance\nof living closely to our Heavenly Father and having our children live closely to him, that they\nmay appreciate in very deed the personality of God and qualify themselves to go out into the\nworld and preach Jesus Christ and him crucified\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"272\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 272)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(272)\">1 Cor. 2:2<\/a><\/span>);\nfor I bear witness to you today that he lives,\nand that he died for the sins of the world, and that he has arisen as our atoning Savior and\nmade possible for us through his redeeming sacrifice the privilege of gaining immortality and\neternal life in the kingdom of our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nThis I pray humbly, may be our lot, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
