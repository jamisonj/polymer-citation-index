Jones, who joined the Church in 1960. He had been raised in a wonderful Christian home, where reading the Bible and adhering to Christian principles were a normal part of family life. At his mother\u2019s knee he learned many truths, including the importance of having faith in Jesus Christ and following His example.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/a-brief-introduction-to-the-church.p6\" class=\"\">As he examined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he was able to retain truths formerly acquired, while enjoying a rich treasure of additional knowledge. I would like to mention 10 points that he understood that can also help you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/a-brief-introduction-to-the-church.p7\" class=\"\">\n\t<span class=\"strong\">1.

We are God\u2019s children. He loves us and has prepared a plan whereby through His Son, Jesus Christ, we will enjoy blessings beyond this mortal life. These blessings include an immortal, glorious, resurrected body for all mankind and the opportunity to return to our Heavenly Father\u2019s presence as eternal families for those who have faith in Jesus Christ and are obedient to the conditions of His gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/a-brief-introduction-to-the-church.p9\" class=\"\">\n\t<span class=\"strong\">2.

Their work was to bring all men to a \u201cunity of the faith\u201d regarding Jesus Christ and His teachings (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21560\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21560)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21560)\">Eph. 4:13<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/a-brief-introduction-to-the-church.p11\" class=\"\">\n\t<span class=\"strong\">3.

These prophecies became a reality when in the years following the Savior\u2019s crucifixion, the Apostles were killed, the authority to direct the Church was eventually lost, and for many centuries, including the period known as the Dark Ages, the Church of Jesus Christ was not found on the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/a-brief-introduction-to-the-church.p13\" class=\"\">\n\t<span class=\"strong\">4.

We are grateful for the great reformers such as Luther, Wycliffe, Wesley, Tyndale, and many others who helped set the stage for open religious dialogue, study of the scriptures, and the desire engendered in the hearts of good men and women for an expression of religious liberty. But their faith, their desire, their sacrifice, and even their martyrdom were insufficient to restore that which was lost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/a-brief-introduction-to-the-church.p15\" class=\"\">The founding fathers of the United States of America were inspired in drafting a constitution that guarantees religious and other freedoms for all. Religious tolerance and changing attitudes helped prepare a people while the conditions created under the umbrella of the U.S. Constitution prepared a location where the restoration of the gospel could take place.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/a-brief-introduction-to-the-church.p16\" class=\"\">\n\t<span class=\"strong\">5.

Daniel, Jeremiah, Joel, Ezekiel, Malachi, and other ancient prophets spoke of the great events that would take place in our day. Isaiah spoke of the marvelous work and a wonder that would come to pass, referring to the promised restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24927\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24927)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24927)\">Isa. 29:14<\/a><\/span>).

The gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored in its fulness.<\/span>\n      <\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/a-brief-introduction-to-the-church.p19\" class=\"\">We declare that the great restoration that the ancient prophets spoke of began in 1820 when the Lord called a young man named Joseph Smith to reestablish the Church. The Restoration began as Joseph, perplexed by the confusion among the churches of his day, sought to know which church was true. I solemnly declare that, in a sacred grove of trees in upstate New York, this young man was visited by the Father and the Son and was told he was to join none of the existing churches. He learned that he was to be an instrument in the hands of God to again establish the Church of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/a-brief-introduction-to-the-church.p20\" class=\"\">In time Joseph received the priesthood of God, giving him the authority to organize the Church once again. The Church now exists with apostles, prophets, and others who have authority to administer the ordinances of the gospel. Since its organization on the sixth of April of 1830, the Church has begun to fill the whole earth, as the ancient prophet Daniel had prophesied (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"10563\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10563)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10563)\">Dan. 2:45<\/a><\/span>). We now find ourselves on the threshold of unprecedented growth where millions are receiving this good news and are joining the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/a-brief-introduction-to-the-church.p21\" class=\"\">\n\t<span class=\"strong\">7.

It contains a history of God\u2019s dealings with His people in ancient America and stands beside the Bible as another witness of Jesus Christ. From its pages we learn more fundamental truths about the nature of God, the mission of His Son, and His plan for His children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/a-brief-introduction-to-the-church.p23\" class=\"\">\n\t<span class=\"strong\">8.

Authority has been conferred upon man once again, whereby in sacred temples a man can be eternally sealed to his wife, a woman to her husband, parents to their children, and the extended family eternally linked together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/a-brief-introduction-to-the-church.p25\" class=\"\">Dear friends and neighbors, we know that you love your families as we love ours, and we are pleased to share these sacred truths with you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/a-brief-introduction-to-the-church.p26\" class=\"\">\n\t<span class=\"strong\">9.
