Included are every hidden and secret sin and all unholy and impure thoughts and practices. One of the worst of these is incest. The dictionary defines incest as \u201csexual intercourse between persons so closely related that they are forbidden by law to marry.\u201d The spirituality of one\u2019s life may be severely, and sometimes irreparably, damaged by such an ugly sin.

The <\/span>confession of sin is an important element in repentance. Many offenders have seemed to feel that a few prayers to the Lord were sufficient.

There are two remissions which one might wish to have. First, the forgiveness from the Lord, and second, the forgiveness of the Lord\u2019s church through its leaders. As soon as one has an inner conviction of his sins, he should go to the Lord in \u201cmighty prayer\u201d as did Enos and never cease his supplications until he shall, like Enos, receive the assurance that his sins have been forgiven by the Lord. It is unthinkable that God absolves serious sins upon a few requests. He is likely to wait until there has been long, sustained repentance as evidenced by a willingness to comply with all his other requirements. Next, the offender should seek the forgiveness of the Church through his bishop. No priest or elder is authorized to thus act for the Church. The Lord has a consistent, orderly plan. Every soul in stakes is given a bishop who, by the very order of his calling and his ordination, is a \u201cjudge in Israel.\u201d The bishop is our best earthly friend. He will hear the problems, judge the seriousness, then determine the degree of repentance and decide if it warrants an eventual forgiveness. He does this as the earthly representative of God\u2014the master physician, the master psychologist, the master psychiatrist. If repentance is sufficient he may waive penalties, which is tantamount to forgiveness. The bishop claims no authority to absolve sins, but he does share the burden, waive penalties, relieve tension and strain; and he may assure a continuance of activity. He will keep the whole matter most confidential.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/president-kimball-speaks-out-on-morality.p76\" class=\"\">4. <span class=\"emphasis\">Restitution for sin. <\/span>When one is humble in sorrow, has unconditionally abandoned the evil, and confessed to those assigned by the Lord, he should next restore insofar as possible that which was damaged. If he burglarized, he should return to the rightful owner that which was stolen. Perhaps one reason murder is unforgivable is that having taken a life, the murderer cannot restore it. Restitution in full is not possible.
