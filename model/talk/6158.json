I was divorced\u2014a single mother of a small daughter. I had also lost a son. I spent hours on my knees calling for help from my Savior and Heavenly Father. But there was the Relief Society. It was my organization. All week I struggled trying to provide for my little daughter and myself on my small wages and minimal education. Every Sunday we went to church. It seemed to me that going to Relief Society each week helped me become a stronger and better sister. Not that I missed my other meetings; I didn\u2019t. I went because I knew that\u2019s where I was supposed to be. I went and then feasted on the word and especially Relief Society. It was my \u2018relief\u2019 and my \u2018society.\u2019 I belonged; I felt a part. I lost myself in lessons, service to others \u2026 and to my little child. I found if I kept my mind and hands busy there was less time to think of the pain of the past. \u2026 But through all those years what I remember most was the belonging I felt\u2014to the organization my Lord and Savior gave to all the sisters, not just to me.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-98911_000_037\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Used with permission.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/come-let-us-walk-in-the-light-of-the-lord.p21\" class=\"\">As sisters in Relief Society we are to assist one another preparing for the day the bridegroom returns.
