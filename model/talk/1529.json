Evans, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1967, pp. 9-12<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nPresident McKay, my beloved brethren and sisters, and I include in this salutation my friends\nworldwide and all mankind everywhere: \n<\/p><p>\nWe come back from having been on every continent and more than fifty countries, with\ngratitude for our fellowship with you and for the happiness of homecoming, which is one of\nthe greatest blessings on earth. If the welcome in heaven is as happy as the welcome at home,\nit will be well worth all the doing and enduring, and well worth waiting for.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Happy homecoming&mdash;here and hereafter<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIf we were to focus on this&mdash;a happy homecoming, here and hereafter&mdash;we wouldn't go far\nwrong in this world. May we live to be comfortable in the presence of our Father, with the\nassurance of a happy homecoming, and reunion with our loved ones everlasting.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have met worldwide many wonderful people, many in positions of high public\nresponsibility&mdash;heads of countries and communities, men of business and professional\ncompetence, men who make decisions and who do much to shape the future and much to run\nthe world. Generally, we have felt their earnest sincerity as they carry a heavy complexity of\nproblems. And often this thought has come: Without a source of guidance and inspiration and\ndirection outside themselves, men of themselves, however earnest and able, are not equal to\nthe problems and complexities of the day in which we live.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have met no infallible men, no indestructible men&mdash;just men mostly honest and able,\ntrying to do their best. And we have come to a deeper awareness than ever before of the need\nfor divine guidance, for inspiration, for revelation, thanking God more fervently for a prophet\nto guide us in these latter days. We come with a greater awareness that without such guidance\nthere are no adequate answers. Never in the past did we need revelation, inspiration,\ncommandments, standards, principles, and a prophet more than in the present.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>To keep the counsels of God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWith the charge and admonition and appeal we have heard from President McKay, may we\nturn our hearts, young and old&mdash;indeed all of us&mdash;to live and keep the counsels of God, to\nlive and keep the commandments. In any other way of life there is frustration and sorrow and\nan empty rationalizing uneasiness within, that never rests and never seems to satisfy. In\nanswer to the question, \"Shouldn't the commandments be rewritten?\" someone thoughtfully\nreplied, \"No, they should be reread.\" This is true of things physical and temporal, as well as\nthings spiritual and eternal. We need to look closely to the counsel and commandments God\nhas given.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Heed the gospel<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt isn't unusual&mdash;indeed, it is expected&mdash;that the maker of any machine should send a set of\ninstructions on how best to use it, how best to care for it; and this our Father in heaven has\ndone for us, mentally, morally, physically, spiritually. In the gospel are instructions from our\nMaker on how to care for and keep ourselves at our best for the purpose for which we were\nbrought into being.\n<\/p><p>\nAs to the physical side: More than a century ago, a prophet of God simply said that some\nthings are not good for man (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15006\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15006)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15006)\">D&amp;C 89:5-9<\/a><\/span>).\nNow, knowledgeable and intelligent men of science and\nmedicine also say so. But we had just as well have saved all the time and trouble, for the\nMaker knew it and said it to his servant. And what could be more important than a\ncompleteness of health and happiness&mdash;happiness and health of the spirit, the body, and the\nmind of man.\n<\/p><p>\nSome say there is no moral question on how we physically live our lives. But isn't it a moral\nquestion to abuse what God has given? And what a waste to abuse any useful creation of any\nkind. If someone were to give us a finely working watch, wouldn't it be foolish, indeed\nirrational, to put into it that which would corrode and defeat its purpose?\n<\/p><p>\nWe have only one body. It is irreplaceable, indispensable, sacred. It has to last a mortal\nlifetime. With it, and the spirit within, we think, we plan, we work, we feel, we live our\nmortal lives.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a miracle and most amazing: the housing for the spirit, the mind, the intelligence of man;\nthe instrument through which we think and plan and pursue life's purpose.\n<\/p><p>\nDon't dissipate it; don't impair any part of it. Keep it clean and functioning. Don't quibble\nabout words, about what is counsel and what is commandment. Don't rationalize. Don't\nclutter life with what is sure to distress and embarrass and lose peace and cause problems.\nFind what is good, and do it. Find what isn't good, and leave it alone.\n<\/p><p>\nIf I may cite a phrase: \"If a thing is right, it can be done. If wrong, it can be done without.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Beware false lures<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nDon't let the temptations, the false advertising, the false appeals, the false endorsements, the\nglamorizing of evil, conceive the cynicism and sophistry of those them who would pull man\ndown to the lower levels of life&mdash;don't let these impair health and peace and happiness and\nthe everlasting possibilities of life. \"If a thing is right, it can be done. If wrong, it can be done\nwithout. Basically, it is that simple.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd don't expect life to be easy. It never was for anyone, and never was intended to, so far\nas I know. On this point I quote from President McKay: \"I am grateful for membership in a\nChurch whose religion fits men for the struggle with the forces of the world,\" he said, \"and\nwhich enables them to survive in this struggle.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Strength from struggle<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOf course there are temptations, problems, things to overcome. Learning is a long and\nperennial process. The pursuit of excellence requires the best of all our effort. Life is for\nlearning, and the lessons are clearly there to learn. The rules, the basic laws of life, have been\ngiven. The choice is ours. There is a law of cause and consequences. We realize the results of\nthe lives we live. And we must live to respect ourselves and others also.\n<\/p><p>\nI would cite a sentence or two from Harold B. Lee: \"Oh, God, help me to hold a high opinion\nof myself.\" That should be the prayer of every soul: not an abnormally developed self-esteem\nthat becomes haughtiness, conceit, or arrogance, but a righteous self-respect, a belief in one's\nown worth, worth to God and worth to man.\n<\/p><p>\nSometimes we may feel that it is easier for others than it is for us. But we all have our\nstruggles. We all have our problems. We all have things to overcome, decisions to make, need\nfor self-control.\n<\/p><p>\nMany years ago Phillips Brooks said: \"But . . . some men live strongly and purely in this\nworld, you say, and then go safely and serenely up to heaven . . . [men] who never know\nwhat struggle is. What shall we say of them? . . . you may search all the ages.... You may go\nthrough the crowded streets of heaven, asking each saint how he came there, and you will\nlook in vain everywhere for a man morally and spiritually strong, whose strength did not\ncome to him in struggle. Will you take the man who never had a disappointment, who never\nknew a want . . . ? Do you suppose that [any] man has never wrestled with\nhis own success and happiness . . . ?\" There are no such.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The gospel, the way of life<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nBlessedly, as we engage, each of us, in this struggle, we have the principles and the purposes.\nGod help us to live by them, to live what we teach, for our own sake as well as for the sake\nof others.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is no place, no people anywhere on earth, that would not be benefitted and blessed by\nthe gospel of Jesus Christ. And ours is the opportunity and obligation of example, of sharing\nit with others. How can we be a light unto men if we don't live according to the light that\nGod has given?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Gratitude for a bounteous heritage<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMay I say, before concluding, how grateful I am for those who gave us this Tabernacle, with\nits organ, its traditions, and all that pertains to Temple Square, this year being the hundredth\nanniversary of this great building, at which thoughtful men the world over have marveled. It\nhas been my privilege to spend much of my life here, for 38 years, at every hour of the day\nand night, at every season meeting visitors who have come from worldwide, and reaching out\nworldwide by radio and television through the facilities God has given.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have performed in many of the great concert halls of Europe and America, and have\ntalked in many auditoriums around the world, and find nothing to exceed this building in\nuniqueness of structure, in remarkable versatility, in its most pleasing and responsive acoustic\nqualities, in its simplicity and beauty and spirit. There have been some who would change it,\nsome who have thought to \"improve\" it, so they say, even as to some of its basic essentials;\nbut it satisfies my soul, and I thank God for the minds that conceived it, for the inspiration\ngiven them to do so, for the hands that fashioned it in their poverty and loving care and skill\nand devotion\n<\/p><p>\nMany of the great artists and engineers and architects of the earth have commented on it. I\ngive you one from Eugene Ormandy, director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, that he sent in\nBrother Isaac Stewart, president of the Tabernacle Choir. \"We have, as you probably know,\"\nsaid Mr. Ormandy, \"performed in almost every great hall in the world, but we have found no\nbetter hall anywhere than the Tabernacle. Its acoustics are superb, and I only hope that no\nhuman hands will alter them in trying to make improvements. It is as near perfect now as any\nhall can be, and it is a joy to perform in it for you wonderful audiences.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis is typical of many, many more, and I hope we may always preserve it in its simple and\nbasic qualities and character.\n<\/p><p>\nWith you I thank my Father in heaven for the heritage from our fathers, for the restoration of\nthe Gospel, for a prophet to guide us in these latter days, for devoted parents, for wholesome\nhomes, for faithful young people, for our opportunities, for the beauty of the earth, for the\ncommandments to subdue it. May we also subdue and control ourselves and realize the\nhighest possibilities in life, physically, spiritually, mentally, and morally, in a completeness of\nthe greatest possible attainments, now and always and forever.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless President McKay and these my brethren, and all of you, and your families, and our\nbeloved friends, worldwide, that the spirit of truth may move upon us all and bring gospel of\nus closer together in a oneness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and in the brotherhood of\nmankind.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd may we remember how many there are yearning in their hearts for what we have or\ncould hold in our hands, and never turn away from our opportunities for education, for\npreparation, for improvement, never turn away from respecting life, respecting ourselves, our\nbodies, our minds, our spirits, our eternal opportunities&mdash;remembering that \"if a thing is\nright, it can be done; If it is wrong, it can be done without.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI bear you my witness of the personal reality of God, our Father, of the divinity of his Son,\nour Savior, and the divine calling and authority and inspiration and\nprophetic office of President McKay, and his predecessors.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless our President and strengthen and sustain him, and each of us in our\nhomes, in our counsels with our families, in our private and public performance; and lead us\nto know the truth, to live it; and help us in the struggle to become strong and improve and\nrepent and refine our selves so that we may face our Father and his Son our Savior,\nstraightforwardly, when the summons comes to each of us, as we must leave this life, so that\nwe will be comfortable where they are.\n<\/p><p>\nA line from Albert Camus comes to mind: \"We have nothing to lose&mdash;except everything.\"\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to live so as to have a happy homecoming always&mdash;here and hereafter, I pray,\nin the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
