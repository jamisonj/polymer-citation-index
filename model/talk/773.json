Brown<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Hugh B. Brown, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1955, pp. 79-82<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brethren and sisters, President McKay has been kind enough to advise the General\nAuthorities in advance that they might be expected to speak at certain sessions of the\nconference.  My turn was to come next Wednesday.  During a half century of active service\nin the Church, I have never felt so wholly inadequate, so totally dependent on divine guidance\nas I feel right now.  For that guidance I humbly pray.\n<\/p><p>\nWe sang yesterday, \"We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet.\" This hymn referred originally to\nthe Prophet Joseph Smith. In a meeting not long ago when President McKay announced that\nthe congregation would sing, \"We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet,\" he said,\ncharacteristically, \"I wish you would have in mind the Prophet Joseph Smith when you sing\ntoday.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to offer a prayer that has been in my heart for years, a prayer which I believe is\nin the heart of every Latter-day Saint throughout the world.  \"We thank thee, O God, for the\nProphet, David O. McKay, to guide us in these later-latter days.  We thank thee that through\nthy blessings he has had the vitality, the vigor, and the health to carry the message of the\ngospel to the four corners of the earth.  We thank thee that his influence and his presence\nhave revitalized the Saints wherever he has gone and have given them courage and ape.  We\nthank thee that he more than any man among us, more than any of his predecessors, has\ncarried the inspiration and the message of the gospel to the greatest and to an ever-increasing\ninternational audience.  We pray that thou wilt bless him continually and spare him to us, that\nwe may enjoy his great leadership for many years to come.\"\n<\/p><p>\nFrom the bottom of my heart I sustain and support these men, the President of the Church and\nhis Counselors, the President of the Council of the Twelve, and each individual member of\nthat Council, and the Patriarch as prophets, seers, and revelators to the Church.  I am grateful\nfor the privilege of meeting with them occasionally.\n<\/p><p>\nSome of our friends have said we are inclined to worship the General Authorities.  We love\nthem; we listen to their counsel; we thank God for them; but they would not permit us to\nworship them.  If we should be so inclined, they would be the first to rebuke us.  They would\ndoubtless say to us what the angel said to John on the Isle of Patmos, when he was about to\nkneel before him,\n<\/p><p>\nSee thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant . . . worship God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42252\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42252)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42252)\">Rev. 19:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBut it is our privilege to be guided by their inspired counsel.  I pray that God will help us\nnever to lose sight of and ever be grateful for the outstanding leadership in the Church today.\n<\/p><p>\nElder Alma Sonne mentioned Easter-tide.  This is the season of the year when we know\nspring is coming, although here in Salt Lake City today it takes a lot of faith to believe it. \nBut it is the season of the year when things are revitalized and renewed, and it is the time of\nyear when Christians everywhere celebrate Easter in commemoration of the resurrection of the\nLord.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I speak of these men and of their leadership, I am reminded of some additional reasons\nwhy we should be grateful for the Easter season. Through the restoration of the gospel we\nhave knowledge and assurance regarding the actual resurrection of the body of the Lord Jesus\nChrist. Not only that he was resurrected from the dead, but also that he ascended into heaven\nwith his glorified body, and he will come again in material form and substance.  We are\ngrateful for the comfort and the hope which comes with this assurance.\n<\/p><p>\nThe revelations concerning the nature and attributes of our Heavenly Father and of his Son,\nJesus Christ, are of transcendent importance to all men everywhere.  Modern confirmation and\nelucidation of biblical evidence on this all-important subject began with the first vision in the\nSacred Grove in 1820, and it was renewed and continued in that glorious vision in 1832 at\nHiram, Ohio, when the Lord declared,\n<\/p><p>\nHear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, and rejoice ye inhabitants thereof, for the Lord is\nGod, and beside him there is no Savior.\n<\/p><p>\nGreat is his wisdom, marvelous are his ways, and the extent of his doings none find\nout.\n<\/p><p>\nHis purposes fail not, neither are there any who can stay his hand.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom eternity to eternity he is the same, and his years never fail\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13379\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13379)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13379)\">D&amp;C 76:1-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ came pursuant to prophetic promise and was a\nnecessary sequel to the great apostasy.  It was during the apostasy that an attempt was made\nto harmonize pagan philosophy with Christian truth.  This task was undertaken at the behest\nof non-Christian emperors and resulted in uninspired declarations in which God was\ndefined&mdash;or rather denied&mdash;by declaring him to be immaterial, incomprehensible, and without body or\nparts, occupying no part of finite or infinite space, in other words, non-existent.\n<\/p><p>\nWe thank God for the restoration of the gospel which refutes such doctrine. In their attempt to\nincorporate Jesus the Christ into their pagan concept of the Godhead, the Roman emperors,\nthrough their appointed delegates to various councils, undertook to have him divest himself of\nhis body, that body which came from the tomb when the angel rolled the stone away, that\nglorified body with which he ascended into heaven before the wondering gaze of his disciples. \nObviously this resurrected body, being material, could not become a part of their immaterial\nGod which had no parts.  They would have him shed that body and thereby everything that\nEaster stands for; for if he is incomprehensible and immaterial, then he is not a resurrected\nbeing; and if he is not a resurrected being, Easter is meaningless.\n<\/p><p>\nAgain I say let us thank God for the clarification that has come through modern revelation\nconcerning the personal attributes of the three members of the Godhead.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus Christ revealed the Father to us and said, \". . . he that hath seen me hath seen the\nFather\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27647\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27647)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27647)\">John 14:9<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Son was in his express image\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24265\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24265)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24265)\">Heb. 1:3<\/a><\/span>).  He revealed a compassionate\nFather, a divine Parent, one in whom were incorporated the attributes of justice, judgment,\nmercy, and truth.  He revealed a God of love, of forgiveness, and understanding.  The\nrestored gospel supplants the motives of fear and awe with faith and trust.  The beloved\ndisciple tells us, \". . . perfect love casteth out fear\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1047\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1047)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1047)\">1 Jn. 4:18<\/a><\/span>). Love as a dominant\nattribute of God and a saving quality in man is reasserted and emphasized.\n<\/p><p>\nThe new commandment which Jesus gave was, \"That ye love one another, even as I have\nloved you\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27645\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27645)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27645)\">John 13:34<\/a><\/span>).\nHis love for us is eternal.  Nothing can separate us from it.  Sin may separate us\nfrom him, but his love endures forever. Listen to Paul's testimony: \n<\/p><p>\nFor I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor\npowers, nor things present, nor things to come,\n<\/p><p>\nNor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the\nlove of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42725\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42725)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42725)\">Rom. 8:38-39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to speak to these young people who have been singing for us, and to other\nyoung people of the Church, for like others who have spoken, my heart is with the youth of\nZion. I should like to say to these young people that God is their Father, that the Savior is\npleading for and with them to keep clean, clean in their thinking, in their speaking, in their\nconduct, that he expects them to be worthy of him and of the sacrifice he made for them and\nfor all of us. He is the Good Shepherd who gave his life for the sheep\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27641\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27641)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27641)\">John 10:14-15<\/a><\/span>).  He evinced the\nsolicitude of the Good Shepherd in his last injunction to Peter, \"Feed my sheep\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27669\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27669)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27669)\">John 21:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to add another word to the young people.  One of the most lethal weapons\nwhich the Adversary has devised to destroy the young people of the Church and of the world\nis to persuade them that if they have made a mistake they are lost, there is no hope.\nAccording to that doctrine, if a young person, in a weak moment, becomes guilty of some\nmisdemeanor, he might as well go on to juvenile delinquency and crime and felony because\nhe is lost anyway.  So the devil would have them believe and thus lead them down to hell.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung people, your Father in heaven loves you; he loves you with a love beyond what your\nearthly parents can know. If you make mistakes&mdash;and you will and all of us have&mdash;our\nHeavenly Father stands ready to forgive and to welcome you when you come to yourselves\nand turn your backs on the husks and your faces toward home\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31407\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31407)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31407)\">Luke 15:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\nHe will embrace you and say,\n\"For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost and is found\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31410\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31410)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31410)\">Luke 15:24<\/a><\/span>). But\nlet no one think he will not have to pay for his folly.  The Father could not in justice say to\nthe prodigal what he said to his older son, \"All that I have is thine\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31411\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31411)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31411)\">Luke 15:31<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOur Father is kind and loving and forgiving, but there is an inexorable law which has not\nbeen repealed.  It Is the law of the harvest,  \"<i>As ye sow, so shall ye reap<\/i>\" (see\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23247\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23247)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23247)\">Gal. 6:7<\/a><\/span>).\nWe cannot sow thistles and reap figs, nor plant thorns and harvest grapes\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34695\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34695)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34695)\">Matt. 7:16<\/a><\/span>). But when we\nhave had enough of thistles and thorns, we may have the grapes and the figs if we are willing\nto pay the price&mdash;and they cost less.  While ours is a world governed by rigid and\nunwavering law, man has free agency, he may choose to obey or disobey the law, but he must\nof course abide the consequences of his choice.\n<\/p><p>\nOne other thing to the young folk&mdash;sometimes you come to us with problems when you are\nperplexed and confused and feel that you are inhibited, not free to think or express opinions.\nWhen we talk to you of free agency and explain that it refers not only to actions but to\nthoughts and opinions, you wonder if that is always the case. Some of you have said to us,\n\"But our right to express our own opinions is trammeled or abridged by the authoritative\nstatements of parents, teachers, and others.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYoung people, we will protect your freedom to think, to express your thoughts, and to search\nfor truth.  We want you to continue that search fearlessly.  We promise you will be\nuninhibited in that search.\n<\/p><p>\nYou should remember, however, that God has given us sources through which we may have\nsome authoritative answers. Not all the answers, no!  If we had all the answers, there would\nbe an end to the search. We must not expect to have all the answers immediately, for God\nhimself in his wisdom has withheld some of them. We believe in continued and continuing\nrevelation, and that means that we believe there are things to be made known which we do\nnot now know.  We believe it is a good thing to reserve judgment on problems that are difficult of\nsolution until more light comes.  This principle of withholding judgment and waiting for new\nrevelation should apply in all fields of learning.  Scientists make rather definite statements at\ntimes, but some of us have lived to see them either amend or abandon their findings in the\nlight of newly discovered truth. As long as scientists are still searching and discovering and as\nlong as new revelation is promised, why insist upon final answers now? It is my conviction\nthat new revelation will come when we have learned to live up to the truth we now have. \nWisdom counsels patience.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, with respect to some things that now seem difficult to understand, we can well afford\nto wait until we have all the facts, until all the evidence is in.  Now do not misunderstand me.\nThere will never come a time when any revelation of truth from God will be in conflict with\nany other truth revealed from him, whether it comes as direct revelation or as reward for\ndiligent search.  If there seems to be conflict, it is because men, fallible men, are unable\nproperly to interpret God's revelations or man's discoveries.\n<\/p><p>\nMay he help us that we may go forward fearlessly but reverently in our search for truth and\nhave due respect not only for our parents and our teachers, but also for those through whom\nGod has promised his revelations.\n<\/p><p>\nBy the same token, we should not undertake to state the time nor the order in which the\ngospel shall be given to any of the races or nations of the earth.  We should not attempt to\nregulate God's program by our little wrist watches nor insist that he be governed by our\nschedule of events.  He has promised the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42251\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42251)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42251)\">Rev. 14:6<\/a><\/span>),\nand he and only he knows when they are ready for its message and its blessings. When that\ntime comes, I bear you my witness, prophetic witness, if you will, that he will reveal his will\nto the leaders of the Church concerning all of his people. He has said,\n<\/p><p>\nRemember the worth of souls [all souls] is great In the sight of God; \n<\/p><p>\nFor, behold the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered\nthe pain of all men, that <i>all men<\/i> might repent and come unto him.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring <i>all men<\/i> unto him, on\nconditions of repentance.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13353\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13353)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13353)\">D&amp;C 18:10-13<\/a><\/span>, italics added).\n<\/p><p>\nBrothers and sisters, I humbly bear my testimony to you that I do know that God is my\nFather, that Jesus of Nazareth is my Redeemer and my friend.  I thank him for the blessed\nprivilege of engaging in the ministry, and I praise his holy name that through his servants he\nhas shown his willingness to use the weakest of us to do some little good in that ministry.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us to recognize him as the Good Shepherd and to go forward with faith, unafraid of\nthe future, and with complete confidence to say with the Psalmist: \n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\n<\/p><p>\nHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.\n<\/p><p>\nHe restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.\n<\/p><p>\nYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for\nthou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.\n<\/p><p>\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my\nhead with oil; my cup runneth over.\n<\/p><p>\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in\nthe house of the Lord forever (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41794\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41794)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41794)\">Ps. 23:1-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe pray this may be true for all of us in the name of Jesus Christ.
