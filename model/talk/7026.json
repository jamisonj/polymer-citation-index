Forty-one years ago I prayed earnestly to the Lord and told Him I wished I had lived on earth when the Apostles walked upon it, when there had been a true Church, and when Christ\u2019s voice was still heard. Within a year of that prayer Heavenly Father sent two LDS missionaries to me, and I found that all those hopes could be realized.

In the tumultuous years of the first settlements in this nation, Roger Williams, my volatile and determined 10th great-grandfather, fled\u2014not entirely of his own volition\u2014from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and settled in what is now the state of Rhode Island. He called his headquarters Providence, the very name itself revealing his lifelong quest for divine interventions and heavenly manifestations. But he never found what he felt was the true New Testament church of earlier times. Of this disappointed seeker the legendary Cotton Mather said, \u201cMr. Williams [finally] told [his followers] \u2018that being himself misled, he had [misled them,\u2019 and] he was now satisfied that there was none upon earth that could administer baptism [or any of the ordinances of the gospel], \u2026 [so] he advised them therefore to <span class=\"emphasis\">forego<\/span> all \u2026 and wait for the coming of <span class=\"emphasis\">new<\/span> apostles.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-24911_000_004\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Magnalia Christi Americana<\/span> (1853), 2:498.]<\/span><\/sup> Roger Williams did not live to see those longed-for new Apostles raised up, but in a future time I hope to be able to tell him personally that his posterity did live to see such.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/prophets-seers-and-revelators.p15\" class=\"\">Anxiety and expectation regarding the need for divine direction was not uncommon among those religious reformers who set the stage for the Restoration of the gospel.

For one and all\u2014ecclesiastics, historians, and laymen alike\u2014the issue is still the same. Are the heavens open? Does God reveal His will to prophets and apostles as in days of old? That they are and that He does is the unflinching declaration of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to all the world.
