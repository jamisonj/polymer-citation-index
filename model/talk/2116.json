It is the contention of some students of history and men of learning that our civilization is rapidly deteriorating and we are drifting into a decadent period of existence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p5\" class=\"\">We have made remarkable progress in scientific research and education, in transportation and communication. Science has found the cure for many dread diseases, alleviated pain, and lengthened the span of life. Superstition has been overcome to a great extent and we have been blessed with such comforts of life as our forefathers never dreamed possible. But in spite of these remarkable developments, there is great confusion and uncertainty in the realm of religion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p6\" class=\"\">The thing that is needed more than anything else today is a return to faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in the gospel plan that he gave. Today, as perhaps seldom if ever before, civilization is in need of a knowledge of the true and living God. Yes, the cure for the ills that beset the world today is true religion. We need the humility of prayer, and a determination to learn God\u2019s will and to keep the commandments that he has given. We need faith that our Savior lives, faith in his redeeming sacrifice. In other words, Christ and his teachings should become the center of our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p7\" class=\"\">Our late president, President David O. McKay, in an interview with a leading journalist sometime ago, was asked: \u201cIf you had the power to grant unto America one great wish, what would it be?\u201d His answer was: \u201cI would wish that America had a testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ and would obey his principles; that would bring peace on earth. I believe that is the greatest blessing that can be given.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p8\" class=\"\">Do we need Jesus today? Do we need his teachings? If we are to survive, if our civilization is to persist, we must accept him and his inspiration and guidance. Someone has said that \u201cthe world needs a bath in Christ\u2019s pure religion. Only a dedication to Christ can wash the dirt out of our society.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p9\" class=\"\">A noted lecturer and traveler was recently asked: \u201cWhat is the greatest message that could be broadcast to the world today?\u201d And he answered that the greatest message would be the message that God has again spoken to man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p10\" class=\"\">There are those who have wished that they might have had the privilege of living when the Savior was upon the earth, that they might have known him and heard the sound of his voice and felt the touch of his hands. Yes, it would have been a great privilege and blessing to have been with him when he walked upon the earth had we been among his followers and had faith in his mission. Very few at that time recognized him as the creator of heaven and earth and the Savior of mankind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p11\" class=\"\">It would have been a marvelous experience to have been as closely associated with him as were his disciples, but even they did not fully appreciate his mission. Though he explained his mission to them and told them that he would lay down his life for the salvation of mankind, that he would come forth again from the tomb on the third day, that he would take upon himself the sins of all mankind, it was difficult for his followers to understand these things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p12\" class=\"\">After his crucifixion and his body was placed in the tomb, Peter and others of the apostles returned to their nets and their fishing. Those in other occupations no doubt manifested a similar attitude. They did get a glimpse of his Messiahship on one occasion before his crucifixion when Jesus asked his disciples:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cWhom do men say that I the Son of man am?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cHe saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36082\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36082)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36082)\">Matt. 16:13\u201317<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p18\" class=\"\">Peter and others were permitted to witness the Master\u2019s transfiguration, and they had seen the wonderful miracles that he had performed; yet it was not until after his resurrection and his appearance and association with them prior to his ascension and after they had been endowed with the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost that they were prepared to proclaim to the world without fear that he was the Christ, the Son of the living God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p19\" class=\"\">The holy scriptures tell us that following his resurrection, the risen Lord was seen by Mary Magdalene at the sepulcher.

The record tells us that this is just what happened on this continent at the time of his birth. Christ, the light of the world, was born; the influence of that light permeated the whole earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p24\" class=\"\">And then at the time of his death and crucifixion, as had been prophesied by Samuel the Lamanite, there was darkness upon this continent for three days while Christ\u2019s body lay in the tomb. There was thick darkness over the face of the entire land. The light of Christ had gone out of the world, and darkness, thick darkness, covered the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p25\" class=\"\">And so it is with our own lives when we have the Spirit of the Lord, which we can only have if we keep his commandments. There is light in our souls; there is joy and happiness. But when we fail to keep the Lord\u2019s commandments and wickedness prevails, darkness comes into our lives, and great is the darkness when the Spirit of the Lord withdraws from us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p26\" class=\"\">Nearly two thousand years have passed since that time, and in our dispensation the resurrected Christ, our Lord and Savior, has appeared to men again. The dispensation in which we live was introduced by the appearance of the Father and his Beloved Son to a boy in the woods near Palmyra, New York, in answer to sincere and humble prayer. The heavens were opened and he beheld with his eyes and heard with his ears the voices of God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, two separate individuals. Light and knowledge were revealed to the boy regarding God and the restoration of his kingdom that could come from no other source. It was the introduction of the last dispensation of the gospel, the dispensation of the fulness of times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p27\" class=\"\">The Savior has also appeared to men at other times in this dispensation. As recorded in the 76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, he appeared to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon in vision in February 1832, and they bear witness of this occasion to the following effect:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cFor we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father\u2014<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cThat by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15760\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15760)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15760)\">D&amp;C 76:22\u201324<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p31\" class=\"\">And again:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd this is the gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us\u2014<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p33\" class=\"\">\u201cThat he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p34\" class=\"\">\u201cThat through him all might be saved whom the Father had put into his power and made by him.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15763\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15763)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15763)\">D&amp;C 76:40\u201342<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p35\" class=\"\">Then again, in the 110th section of the Doctrine and Covenants the Prophet Joseph and Oliver Cowdery relate this experience:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p36\" class=\"\">\u201cThe veil was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understanding were opened.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p37\" class=\"\">\u201cWe saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p38\" class=\"\">\u201cHis eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of Jehovah, saying:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p39\" class=\"\">\u201cI am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with the Father.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15801\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15801)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15801)\">D&amp;C 110:1\u20134<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-living-christ.p40\" class=\"\">Others in this dispensation have seen the Lord.
