His tenure in office was brief, but the impression for good that he left was tremendous. Mild of manner, quiet in his ways, he was nonetheless the man whose strong convictions of the truth of this work made him powerfully persuasive in his advocacy of the Christlike life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/this-is-the-work-of-the-master.p5\" class=\"\">He suffered much in his body before he was finally taken from us on the morning of March 3, 1995.

I think I know something of the meaning of heavy responsibility. But with all of that, I have, during these past few days, been overwhelmed with feelings of inadequacy and total dependency upon the Lord, who is my head and whose church this is, and upon the strength of these good men who are my counselors, my dear Brethren of the Twelve, of the Seventy, and of the Presiding Bishopric, and of the membership of the Church throughout the world. I search for words to express the depth of my gratitude and my appreciation and my love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/this-is-the-work-of-the-master.p14\" class=\"\">Years ago I gave a talk on the loneliness of leadership. Now for the first time I realize the full import of that loneliness. I do not know why this mantle has fallen upon my shoulders. I suppose some of you may also wonder. But we are here.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/this-is-the-work-of-the-master.p15\" class=\"\">In circumstances such as these one\u2019s searching thoughts go back over all of the years of one\u2019s life, and even beyond. I am of only the third generation in the Church. My grandfather as a boy was baptized in the summer of 1836 in Ontario, Canada. His widowed mother eventually brought her two boys to Springfield, Illinois. From there, my grandfather walked to Nauvoo where he listened to the Prophet Joseph Smith. When the exodus of our people occurred in 1846, he was an eighteen-year-old youth of strength and capacity and faith. He was a skilled builder of wagons and a blacksmith. He was among those whom President Young requested remain for a time in Iowa to assist those still on the westward trail. He married in 1848, and set out for this valley in the spring of 1850.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/this-is-the-work-of-the-master.p16\" class=\"\">Somewhere along that wearisome trail, his young wife sickened and died. With his own hands he dug a grave, split logs to make a coffin, lovingly buried her, then tearfully took their eleven-month-old child in his arms and marched on to this valley.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/this-is-the-work-of-the-master.p17\" class=\"\">He was among those who repeatedly was called by President Young to undertake a variety of difficult assignments incident to the establishment of our people in these mountain valleys. He served as president of the Millard Stake of Zion when there were only a handful of stakes, and when it included a vast area of central Utah, traveling thousands of miles by horse and buggy in the discharge of his ministry. He gave so generously of his substance in the establishment of schools that his once substantial estate was small at the time of his death.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/this-is-the-work-of-the-master.p18\" class=\"\">My father was similarly a man of great faith, who served the Church without reservation in many trusted capacities. For a number of years he presided over what was then the largest stake in the Church, with more than fifteen thousand members. My mother and grandmothers were likewise women of great faith, whose lives were not always easy because of requirements made upon them by the Church. But they did not complain. They met their responsibilities with cheerfulness and devotion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/this-is-the-work-of-the-master.p19\" class=\"\">For these forebears I feel a great sense of gratitude and love, and an almost overwhelming obligation to keep the trust which they have passed. To my beloved wife of fifty-eight years later this month, I express appreciation. How empty our lives would be without these, our wonderful companions. How grateful I am for this precious woman, who has walked at my side through sunshine and storm. We do not stand as tall as we once did. But there has been no shrinkage in our love one for another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/this-is-the-work-of-the-master.p20\" class=\"\">I likewise speak with gratitude for my children and my grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who have honored us with the goodness of their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/this-is-the-work-of-the-master.p21\" class=\"\">And most particularly, to each of you I express my deep appreciation. I have had opportunity to travel far and wide across this church during the thirty-seven years of my service as a General Authority. Everywhere I have gone, I have met wonderful people. There is so much of goodness in the lives of the Latter-day Saints. There are such tremendous expressions of faith in the service which you give. I know something of the sacrifices made by many of you. I wish I had the capacity to express my feelings of love and gratitude for you. I stand as your servant and pledge to you and to the Lord my very best effort as I ask for your continuing faith and prayers and uplifted hands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/this-is-the-work-of-the-master.p22\" class=\"\">I am fully aware that I am not a young man as I shoulder the responsibilities of this sacred office. Sister Hinckley and I are learning that the so-called golden years are laced with lead. But I think I can honestly say that I do not feel old. I cannot repudiate my birth certificate, but I can still experience a great, almost youthful exuberance in my enthusiasm for this precious work of the Almighty.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/this-is-the-work-of-the-master.p23\" class=\"\">I love the people of this church, of all ages, of all races, and of many nations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/this-is-the-work-of-the-master.p24\" class=\"\">I love the children.

How lovely you are, wherever you are, you precious children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/this-is-the-work-of-the-master.p25\" class=\"\">I love the youth of the Church.

It is a time to do what is right regardless of the consequences that might follow. It is a time to be found keeping the commandments.
