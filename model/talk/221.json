Merrill, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1946, pp. 27-32<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nThe conditions in the world today are such that every Latter-day Saint faces a challenge&mdash;a\nchallenge of loyalty to the leadership of the Church and to its teachings and standards. The\nforces of evil were perhaps never more rampant and their influence never more widespread\nthan now. Let us take a brief glance at the gloomy situation.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>The Prevalence of Evil<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nTo the eyes of a Latter-day Saint, and judged by his professed standards, the sinful ways of\nthe world were never more largely indulged in by its people generally than they are today.\nWere sex moral standards ever lower? Were selfishness, greed, and crime ever more rampant?\nWas religious faith ever colder? Was the desire to get something for nothing ever stronger?\nWas the struggle for place and power ever keener? Were family ties ever looser? Were\nmarriage vows ever more frequently violated? As for America, is not a negative answer to\nthese questions the correct one? Was not Alexander Pope stating facts when he wrote:\n<\/p><p>\nVice is a monster of so frightful mien, <br \/>\nAs to be hated needs but to be seen; <br \/>\nYet seen too oft, familiar with her face, <br \/>\nWe first endure, then pity, then embrace.\n<\/p><p>\nJudged by Latter-day Saint teachings and standards, the moral conditions of the country are\nmost deplorable. And yet, sad to say, our people are by no means quite justified in assuming\na \"holier-than-thou\" attitude. Worldly sins of every type exist among us. It is\nfolly to close our eyes and deny the presence of these things. Then I suggest we look the\nsituation squarely in the face and do something about it. What, does one ask? I answer,\nsincerely repent and help our fellow men to do likewise. Investigation will show that\nsmoking, drinking, gambling, juvenile delinquency, fornication, violation of marriage vows,\nbroken homes, divorces&mdash;to name a few things only&mdash;are growing evils among us. To the\nworldly-minded, most of them are minor matters, devoid of sinful aspects. But to Latter-day\nSaints the case is wholly different. We cannot indulge in any of these things with a guiltless\nconscience because we have been differently taught. We have divine revelations relative to\nthem, the Word of Wisdom, for example. Hence we know that indulgence in smoking and\ndrinking is displeasing to the Lord. Gambling is adjudged a wrong by every moral code.\nMarriage is a holy estate requiring sacred vows and imposing binding obligations. If these are\nall faithfully kept then within the precincts of the home, there may be heaven on earth a place\nwhere live innocent and joyous children, happy parents, and a united Christian family.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Juvenile Delinquency<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nAccording to authentic reports, juvenile delinquency of both boys and girls has greatly\nincreased during recent years until it has reached alarming proportions. Broken homes and\nabsence of mothers from their homes are given as major causes. To Latter-day Saints, family\nlife, home, and children are requisites for greatest happiness and glory, both in this life and in\nthe life to come. Children are the brightest gems in any woman's diadem. This truth might\nwell be indelibly impressed on the mind of every wife.\n<\/p><p>\nRespecting the duty of parents to the children, the Lord, through his Prophet Joseph Smith\nsaid:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are\norganized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the\nSon of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the\nhands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents . . . And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12267\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12267)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12267)\">D&amp;C 68:25,28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFurther in the D&amp;C, we read:\n<\/p><p>\nAll children have claim upon their parents for their maintenance until they are of age\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12278\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12278)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12278)\">D&amp;C 83:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThus divine law, as well as civil law, makes the parents responsible for their children. No\nLatter-day Saint lives a worthy life in the eyes of the Lord who neglects to do everything\nfeasible to bring up his children according to gospel standards. Let every parent take heed of\nthese requirements. Wise Solomon declared:\n<\/p><p>\nTrain up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41386\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41386)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41386)\">Prov. 22:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYet there are parents who erroneously and foolishly say that they must let their children grow\nup without religious teaching and training in order that they can be free to choose for\nthemselves when they are grown. This is a doctrine of Satan. It cannot in the least degree\nrelease parents from the responsibility to their children which the Lord places upon them&mdash;a\ntruth that they will some day certainly learn and, if neglected, to their sorrow.\n<\/p><p>\nLet all Latter-day Saints be faithful to their parental duties that their children may be a joy to\nthem and a credit to the community where they live.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Increase in Divorces<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nA year ago from this pulpit President David O. McKay discussed the divorce question and\nasserted that in the United States divorces had so increased that one marriage out of every six\nended in the divorce court. Recently, it has been publicly said that about fifty percent of the\nwar marriages of American boys in service are being terminated by divorce. The picture\npainted by these figures is a sad and deplorable one. It is indicative of unstable, sinful, and\ndemoralizing conditions, ruinous to the ideals of marriage, family, and home, a distinctive\nblight upon the happy life that every wedded couple may achieve by being true to their\nmarriage vows. Then is not a marriage failure necessarily an unfavorable reflection upon one\nor both of the parties to the marriage&mdash;the ones responsible for the failure? A grave\ndelinquency is certainly indicated, for the conditions of a happy union have not been met.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat are these conditions, the novice may ask? Since I do not qualify as an expert in these\nmatters I will not venture to answer the question except to say that if each party to the\nmarriage contract will faithfully live the Golden Rule in all of his or her relations with the\npartner, then the marriage undoubtedly will be successful. A Latter-day Saint marriage is a\nunion of two equal partners, obligated to build a home where mutual love, respect, trust,\nfidelity, tolerance, patience, and kindness are some of the essential operating factors. And in\nthe home where these prevail the ugly specter of divorce will never enter.\n<\/p><p>\n. . . Men are, that they might have joy\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3467\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3467)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3467)\">2 Ne. 2:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWedlock is essential to a fulness of joy. Let every Latter-day Saint who enters the holy\nprecincts of the marriage state do so with a firm determination to live so that all the joys and\nhappiness obtainable therein may be his realization. Marriage was instituted by God himself.\nNo one can violate its covenants with impunity.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Smoking and Drinking Decried<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now a few words about smoking and drinking. I am speaking to Latter-day Saints&mdash;to\npeople who accept the Word of Wisdom as being a divine revelation. This\nbeing true, they cannot indulge in the consumption of liquor or tobacco without having to\nsome extent at least, a feeling of guilt because the Lord has said liquor and tobacco are not\ngood for man, and indulgence is therefore contrary to his will and to Church teachings. So\nwhen it comes to smoking and drinking, a Latter-day Saint and a nonbeliever are not on the\nsame moral plane. The latter is not conscious of sinning; the former is. Why then do\nLatter-day Saints indulge? There is a variety of reasons, but perhaps the chief one is that other\npeople do. We are more or less influenced by the actions of others. A woman wears short\ndresses because it is the fashion, not because it adds to the beauty of her appearance. But the\nLord said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . they that knew no law shall have part in the first resurrection; and it shall be tolerable for\nthem (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12252\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12252)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12252)\">D&amp;C 45:54<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAlso:\n<\/p><p>\nFor of him unto whom much is given much is required; and he who sins against the greater\nlight shall receive the greater condemnation\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12275\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12275)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12275)\">D&amp;C 82:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIs this not a merciful and just standard by which to be judged? I repeat, Church members\ncannot justify themselves in violating the laws and commandments of the Lord because\nnonmembers do. Indeed, in any case, each person will be held accountable for what he does,\nfor he is given his free agency. But I call attention to the fact that every person is accountable\nfor the example he sets and the influence he has with others. Be he ever so humble, his words\nand acts will affect one or more of his fellows. Hence, for these words and acts he must give\nan account. That his example may be good, particularly for young people, is one reason why\nwe are so persistent in trying to convert to abstinence all of our older people who indulge in\nthe use of narcotics.\n<\/p><p>\nBut let me warn you that smoking and drinking are on the increase among the people, as are\nother evils such as juvenile delinquency, gambling, Sabbath breaking, profanity, fornication,\nand other types of wickedness.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Movement to Increase Liquor Sales<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nIn view of the whole situation there is need for every Latter-day Saint to buckle on the armor\nof righteousness and go forward battling valiantly for the cause of right, Christian morality,\njustice, and truth according as the Lord has given us eyes to see and intellects to understand\nthese things. Satan and his hosts are on the alert to extend his domain and increase his power.\nFor instance, notwithstanding testimony and facts which prove that the consumption of\nalcoholic beverages results in physical, mental, moral, and spiritual evils of many types and\nkinds, and that the liquor business is always more or less lawless and corrupting, there is now\na movement on foot in Utah to extend this business, to multiply the avenues\nof liquor sales, and to increase the ease with which liquor may be obtained.\n<\/p><p>\nThe official advocates of repeal in 1933 loudly proclaimed that the saloon would never be\nallowed to return. That disreputable joint was a stench in the nostrils of clean-minded people.\nDecent women never darkened its doors. But now the proposition is to multiply in Utah by\nmany fold the places where liquor may be legally dispensed and turn myriads of dining places\nand food counters into liquor taverns. Further, we are asked to legalize the sale of liquor at\nsocial and night clubs. All of this would in effect turn every social club and public eating\nplace into a saloon. Is there anyone who believes these night clubs would be clean,\nrespectable, law-abiding places? Experienced people know that many of them would be dens\nof drunkenness, gambling, fornications, and other vile things.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Better Laws and Enforcement Needed<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nWill the good people of Utah permit opening the gates of hell wider than they are now? On\nthe other hand, should they not unite to secure better laws, better enforcement, more\nrestrictions&mdash;all in the interest of a better and cleaner environment? Nineteen forty-seven is\ncentennial year. Millions of tourists will come within the borders of this state. Shall they go\naway with the impression that Utah has copied Reno? Certainly not!\n<\/p><p>\n\"Utah, We Love Thee\" is the title of a song we joyously sing. Let us prove our love to the\nsatisfaction of our centennial visitors by cleaning up, fixing up, and painting up, not only\nmaterially, but morally and spiritually as well. In preparation let us at once begin to live a\nmore genuine Christian life by abstaining from doing evil, by more fully living the Golden\nRule and by intensifying our efforts to be fair, honest, dependable, and just in all our dealings\nwith our fellow men.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Facts on Use of Alcoholic Beverages<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now a few more facts relative to alcoholic beverages. These are taken from an article\npublished in <i>The Christian Advocate<\/i>, February 21, and written by M. E. Lazenby:\n<\/p><p>\nFifty million people in the United States drink alcoholic beverages&mdash;half of all people over\nfifteen years of age. Three million of these are excessive drinkers, 750,000 being chronic\nalcoholics. Has drinking become public enemy Number One? In pre-prohibition days this\ncountry had 177,000 licensed liquor places; there are now 360,000&mdash;more than twice as many.\nIn 1944 the American people spent more than seven billion dollars for alcoholic drinks, a sum\nabout equal to that spent for all educational, religious, and charitable work combined in a\nsimilar period of time, as the following shows:\n<\/p><p>\nAdd all the money spent in the United States during the school year 1941-42, for educational\npurposes, including that spent on all public and private schools, colleges and universities,\nprofessional and special schools of all types, including public libraries and reading rooms of\nall kinds. To this sum, add all the expenditures, gifts and bequests to\norganized religion for 1942, then add all expenditures from American Red Cross funds by the\nnational and local chapters from January 1942 to March 1945. To this add the total income of\nthe National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis for the eight months' period ending May 1944;\nadd the expenditures of the United States health service; add the expenditures by the\nforty-eight state governments for benefits in 194l, such as public safety, health, hospitals,\ninstitutions for the handicapped, public welfare, corrections, and recreation; add all the\nexpenditures of the federal government during the fiscal year 1944 under the Social Security\nAct, including old-age assistance, aid to dependent children, aid to the blind, unemployment\ncompensation administration; add the Department of Labor expenditures for maternal and\nchild health service and crippled children; add, finally, the expenditures of the United States\nVeterans' Administration during the fiscal year 1944. The sum total of all these is\n$7,039,914,950&mdash;about the same amount as that spent for alcoholic beverages during 1944.\nCan we believe it? The seven billion dollars spent in 1944 for alcoholic beverages drew that\nstaggering amount from the cash registers of legitimate business. Further, in America four\nbillion, one hundred forty-seven million pounds of grain and two hundred thirty-eight million,\nsix hundred fifty-five thousand (238,655,000) pounds of sugar, syrup, and molasses were used\nin the manufacture of distilled and fermented liquors. Yet abroad millions of people are dying\nfor food.\n<\/p><p>\nStatistics show that during 1942 there were 28,309 traffic accident deaths, in 25.1 percent of\nwhich the parties involved had been drinking. There are some significant facts relative to\nalcohol and crime that are illuminating. The F.B.I. reports for 1932 show that in 596 cities\nhaving a population of 21,660,000, there were 831 arrests for drunkenness per 100,000\npopulation. In 1944 in these cities there were 1,726 arrests for drunkenness per\n100,000,&mdash;more than double. The F.B.I. is quoted as saying that our crime bill is\n$16,000,000,000 a year and that \"twenty-three percent of this is caused by drink.\"\n<\/p><p>\nFurther, an officer of the Distillers Produce Corporation, speaking before a Rotary Club,\nOctober 1945, said the liquor traffic industry is spending almost $50,000,000 a year in\nadvertising, the purpose of which, of course, is to get more men and women and young\npeople to drink. Whither are we going?\n<\/p><p>\nCan Latter-day Saints, wherever they are, in Utah or elsewhere, favor any move that will\nmake liquor more easy to get or more widely consumed? May the Lord forbid!\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that the Lord will give us all a greater desire and a stronger will to live righteously,\nand I do it in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
