My mind went back to the\ntwenty-third chapter of Matthew where the Lord Jesus Christ was speaking to people who\ndisregarded the solemn and sacred things that were there for their acceptance. In words\ncondemnatory he said:\n<\/p><p>\nWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of\nthe prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,\n<\/p><p>\nAnd say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been\npartakers with them in the blood of the prophets.\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men and scribes: and some\nof them ye shall kill and crucify . . .\n<\/p><p>\nand then later:\n<\/p><p>\nO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are\nsent unto thee... (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34309\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34309)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34309)\">Matt. 23:29-30,34,37<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYou folk in the Church and out of the Church heard a prophet of God bear testimony that this\nwas the only true and living Church upon the earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12584\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12584)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12584)\">D&amp;C 1:30<\/a><\/span>).\nDid you listen, or do you also build\nsepulchres for the dead prophets and tombs for those who have passed away long ago and\ndisregard the living ones? I bear witness to you that the Prophet of God who bore testimony\nto you on Friday morning is the recognized head of God's kingdom here upon this earth, and\nyou would do well to listen and to accept it in your hearts. I bear testimony\nalso, in all solemnity, that this is the true and living Church and that it is officered by\nmen who are called of God, and it is accepted of the Lord, and that the gospel which it\npromulgates, by these thousands of missionaries abroad and the other thousands here at home,\nis the gospel of Jesus Christ which will cure all ills and solve all problems and will exalt\nmankind as well as save him.\n<\/p><p>\nWORK AMONG LAMANITES\n<\/p><p>\nI had thought of saying something about the Indian or Lamanite program at this conference,\nbut I have been \"pressed by the spirit\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7617\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7617)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7617)\">Acts 18:5<\/a><\/span>),\nas Paul said, to speak upon other matters; however, I\nshould like to make this one statement, that the work among the Lamanites, though still in its\ninfancy, is going forward at an incredible pace. The responsiveness of the children of Lehi is\nunbelievable. There will be many hundreds of baptisms this year both in stakes and missions,\nand I pray the blessings of the Lord upon all those who are contributing toward fulfilment of\nthe promises with which the Lord has filled his books of scripture.\n<\/p><p>\nMuch has been said in this conference already about the fundamental principle of repentance.\nPresident Clark repeated the other night the passage where the Lord said, \"...preach nothing\nbut repentance unto this people\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12594\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12594)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12594)\">D&amp;C 6:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems that most of us think that repentance is for the other person, for the one who has\ncommitted murder or adultery or theft or something that is very heinous, but repentance, as I\nread the scriptures, is for us all.\n<\/p><p>\nNEED FOR REPENTANCE\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my pleasure, also, to go into the homes of the leaders in the missions, wards, and stakes\nof Zion, and I am deeply appreciative of the fact that most of our people are trying to live the\ncommandments of the Lord. I find in this Church many people who amaze me with their\nclose approach toward perfection, but I do find, as I go about the Church, some who need this\nprinciple of repentance. I thank the Lord for this glorious principle. I find parents who have\nlost the natural affection for their children. I find children who disown and disclaim their\nparents and evade responsibility concerning them. I find sometimes husbands who desert their\nwives and their children, and who use almost every pretext to justify such action. I find wives\nwho are demanding, unworthy, quarrelsome, and who are uncooperative and selfish and\nworldly, provoking such action. I find those who gossip and bear false witness against their\nneighbors (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22604\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22604)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22604)\">Ex. 20:16<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40225\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40225)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40225)\">Mosiah 13:23<\/a><\/span>). I find brethren who hate each other into the courts on trivial matters that could\nhave been settled by themselves. I find blood brothers and sisters who fight over inheritances\nand bring each other into the courts of the land and draft before the public the most intimate\nand personal family secrets, bringing all of the skeletons out of the\nclosets, leaving nothing sacred, having little regard for each other, interested only in that\nwhich they might acquire by such action. I saw one family split wide apart, half of the\nbrothers and sisters on one side, and half on the other, in a most disgraceful feud. At the\nfuneral half of them sat on one side of the aisle and half on the other. They would not speak\nto each other. The property involved was worth only a few thousand dollars, and yet they are\navowed enemies. I have seen people in wards and branches who impugn the motives of the\nAuthorities and of each other and make them \"offender for a word\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25095\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25095)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25095)\">Isa. 29:21<\/a><\/span>). I have seen people in\nbranches where they have broken wide apart and say unkind things about each other and will\nhardly speak to each other. They bring into their meetings the spirit of the evil one instead of\nthe spirit of the Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nFAULTS TO BE OVERCOME\n<\/p><p>\nI have seen husbands and wives, living under the same roof, who are selfish, unbending, and\nunforgiving, who with their misunderstandings have hardened their hearts and poisoned their\nminds.\n<\/p><p>\nThen I have seen many people who have become offended at Church authorities, their ward,\nstake, mission, auxiliary, and priesthood leaders, for things which have been said or were\nimagined to have been said or thought.\n<\/p><p>\nTo the children who are unkind to their parents the Lord has said, \"Ye hypocrites\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34282\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34282)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34282)\">Matt. 15:7<\/a><\/span>).\n\"He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34281\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34281)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34281)\">Matt. 15:4<\/a><\/span>).

To\nthose who would impugn motives, he said: \"Judge not, that ye be not judged\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34265\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34265)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34265)\">Matt. 7:1<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd to those who would criticize the Authorities and use them as stumbling blocks, who\nwould absent themselves from their meetings, who would fail to pay their tithes and other\nobligations because of fancied offenses, I would like to read from the Doctrine &amp; Covenants,\nSection 121:16-18, 20-21:\n<\/p><p>\nCursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed, saith the\nLord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned before me, saith the\nLord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and which I commanded\nthem.\n<\/p><p>\nBut those who cry transgression do it because they are the servants of sin, and are\nthe children of disobedience themselves.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd those who swear falsely against my servants...\n<\/p><p>\nTheir basket shall not be full, their houses and their barns shall perish, and they\nthemselves shall be despised by those that flattered them.\n<\/p><p>\nThey shall not have right to the priesthood, nor their posterity after them from\ngeneration to generation\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12726\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12726)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12726)\">D&amp;C 121:16-18,20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd to all who sin in devious ways, the Savior says:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31246\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31246)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31246)\">Luke 13:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nALL NEED TO REPENT\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, repentance is not for the murderer alone, nor the adulterer. It comes to them, too, but\nto all those who have been tempted of the evil one to commit sins of omission and sins of\ncommission.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I read the scriptures, I find that all the various sins are condemned. May I name only a\nfew whom he calls to repentance: the murderer and the adulterer and the thief, the proud, the\ncoveter, the drinker, the smoker, the ungrateful, the liar, the gambler, the drunkard, the\nselfish, the unforgiving, the accuser, the defrauder, the gossip, the profane, the vulgar, the\nintolerant, the malicious, the idler, the persecutor, the envious, the jealous, and to all these the\nLord says:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . repent and walk more uprightly before me\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12591\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12591)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12591)\">D&amp;C 5:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nRepentance is required of us all. In this dispensation the Lord said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . entangle not yourselves in sin, but let your hands be clean, until the Lord\ncomes (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12692\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12692)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12692)\">D&amp;C 88:86<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPaul told the Romans:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . There is none righteous, no, not one\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42685\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42685)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42685)\">Rom. 3:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nEven in the days of Kirtland the Lord flashed forth this indictment:\n<\/p><p>\nBehold, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with many who are in the church at\nKirtland;\n<\/p><p>\nFor they do not forsake their sins, and their wicked ways, the pride of their hearts,\nand their covetousness, and all their detestable things, and observe the words of\nwisdom and eternal life which I have given unto them.\n<\/p><p>\n. . . I, the Lord, will chasten them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12708\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12708)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12708)\">D&amp;C 98:19-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHe called even the Prophet Joseph to repentance, though his sin was as nothing compared to\nours:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . now I command you, my servant Joseph, to repent and walk more uprightly\nbefore me, and to yield to the persuasions of men no more\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12592\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12592)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12592)\">D&amp;C 5:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHis sin had been in yielding to the persuasions of Martin Harris to permit him to borrow the\nsacred records and let them be viewed. The Lord said further:\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, I will that all men shall repent, for all are under sin, except those\nwhich I have reserved unto myself, holy men that ye know not of\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12629\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12629)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12629)\">D&amp;C 49:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd surely every man must repent or suffer, for I, God, am endless\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12603\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12603)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12603)\">D&amp;C 19:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA MERCIFUL LAW\n<\/p><p>\nRepentance is a glorious and merciful law. It means a sorrow for sin, a confession of sin,\nabandonment of sin, restitution for sin, and then the living of the commandments of the Lord,\nwhich itself includes the forgiving of others, even those who sin against us. The Father says:\n<\/p><p>\nBy this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins&mdash;behold, he will confess them\nand forsake them (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12637\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12637)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12637)\">D&amp;C 58:43<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has made provisions for those who commit heinous crimes, but I shall not dwell\nspecifically upon them today. Those who are in deep sin should go to their ward, stake, or\nmission authorities for assistance. I am talking now, generally, about the sins that many of us\ncommit.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the Doctrine &amp; Covenants, Section 59, the Lord says,\n<\/p><p>\nBut remember that on this, the Lord's day, thou shalt offer thine oblations and thy\nsacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, and before\nthe Lord (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12643\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12643)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12643)\">D&amp;C 59:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLong years ago in every testimony meeting we had people who arose and said to their\nbrothers and sisters, substantially, this: \"I confess before you my weaknesses and\nimperfections and ask your assistance, your help, your tolerance, your understanding, and I\npray the Lord will forgive me.\" We do not hear it so much any more. I think the Lord so\ninstructed us, that we might seek forgiveness of our sins, by having confessed them humbly,\nacknowledging them before the people and the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, in Proverbs 28:13, the Lord inspired his prophets to say,\n<\/p><p>\nHe that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh\nthem shall have mercy (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41401\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41401)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41401)\">Prov. 28:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nABANDONMENT OF SIN\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then to the Nephites this word came from the Lord:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd whosoever repented of their sins and did confess them, them he did number\namong the people of the church;\n<\/p><p>\nAnd those that would not confess their sins and repent of their iniquity, the same\nwere not numbered among the people of the church, and their names were blotted\nout (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40229\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40229)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40229)\">Mosiah 26:35-36<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe abandonment of sin is an important part of repentance and is a requirement before\nforgiveness can be expected. The Lord says we may know a man has repented if he confess\nand forsake his sins\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12638\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12638)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12638)\">D&amp;C 58:43<\/a><\/span>) and:\n<\/p><p>\n...whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41402\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41402)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41402)\">Prov. 28:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nRESTITUTION\n<\/p><p>\nThe sinner should make restitution. It is obvious that the murderer cannot give back a life he\nhas taken; the libertine cannot restore the virtue he has violated; the gossip may be unable to\nnullify and overcome the evils done by a loose tongue; but, so far as is possible, one must\nrestore and make good the damage done. Perhaps the warning of the Redeemer \". . . thou\nshalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31245\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31245)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31245)\">Luke 12:59<\/a><\/span>) may have reference\nto restitution as well as to the suffering of the sinner. Again the Lord says: \". . . and they [the\nsins] shall not be blotted out until he repent and reward the four-fold in all things wherewith\nhe has trespassed against thee\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12711\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12711)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12711)\">D&amp;C 98:44<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the most important elements in repentance and forgiveness is living the commands of\nGod for the Father says in his preface to his latter-day revelation,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance,\n<\/p><p>\nNevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be\nforgiven (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12585\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12585)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12585)\">D&amp;C 1:31-32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFORGIVENESS OF SINS\n<\/p><p>\nNow, the doing of the commandments includes many things, and much good works, but one\nof its very important aspects is the purging of our own hearts and forgiving others their\ntrespasses against us.\n<\/p><p>\nTo obtain forgiveness of our sins, we must forgive. Read the scriptures given us on that point:\n\"And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for\nChrist's sake hath forgiven you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21638\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21638)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21638)\">Eph. 4:32<\/a><\/span>).\nThen in the Lord's prayer to the people in\nJerusalem, he said: \"Our Father which art in heaven ... forgive us our debts, as we forgive\nour debtors\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34258\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34258)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34258)\">Matt. 6:9,12<\/a><\/span>).\nDid he not mean in the same manner and in the same degree,\nperhaps, as we forgive our debtors? He made it a little more clear even to the Nephites, for\nafter he had said, \"forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5484\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5484)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5484)\">3 Ne. 13:11<\/a><\/span>) he said,\n\"For, if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you;\n<\/p><p>\n\"But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5485\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5485)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5485)\">3 Ne. 13:14-15<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd again to the Nephites the Lord says: \". . . ye shall also forgive one\nanother your trespasses; for verily I say unto you, he that forgiveth not his neighbor's\ntrespasses when he says that he repents, the same hath brought himself under condemnation\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40228\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40228)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40228)\">Mosiah 26:31<\/a><\/span>).\nCondemnation, then, comes to you who will not forgive, probably even\ngreater than to him who gave the offense.\n<\/p><p>\nEven the ancient Apostles suffered on this account: \"My disciples, in days of old, sought\noccasion against one another and forgave not one another in their\nhearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his\nbrother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the\ngreater sin\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12651\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12651)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12651)\">D&amp;C 64:8-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHE HIGHER LAW\n<\/p><p>\nNow, the Savior said to his people when he was upon the earth, \"Ye have heard that it hath\nbeen said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34249\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34249)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34249)\">Matt. 5:38<\/a><\/span>), and then he went on to\ngive us the higher law. He proceeded: \"But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but\nwhosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34250\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34250)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34250)\">Matt. 5:39-41<\/a><\/span>). And\nagain Jesus said: \"Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate\nthine enemy.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate\nyou, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34251\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34251)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34251)\">Matt. 5:43-44<\/a><\/span>).\nWhy? That you might have the benefit of it. It does not injure him so much when you hate a\nperson, especially if he is far removed and does not come in contact with you, but the hate\nand the bitterness canker your unforgiving heart.\n<\/p><p>\nOne great blessing that comes to those who will forgive, and love their neighbors and enemies\nalso, is: \"That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"For if ye love them which love you, what reward have you? do not even the publicans the\nsame?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34253\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34253)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34253)\">Matt. 5:45-46<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd then he commanded: \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your\nFather which is in heaven is perfect\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34255\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34255)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34255)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"HOW OFT SHALL I . . .

And the Lord\nsaid: \"I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34289\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34289)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34289)\">Matt. 18:22<\/a><\/span>).\n\". . . and as oft as thine enemy repenteth of the trespass wherewith he has trespassed against\nthee, thou shalt forgive him, until seventy times seven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12709\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12709)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12709)\">D&amp;C 98:40<\/a><\/span>). Until seventy times\nseven! That seems very difficult indeed for us mortals, and yet there are still harder things to\ndo. When they have repented and come on their knees to ask forgiveness, most of us can\nforgive, but the Lord has required that we shall even forgive them if\nthey do not repent nor ask forgiveness of us.\n<\/p><p>\nIn D. &amp; C. Sec. 98:41-45, he said:\n<\/p><p> \"And if he trespass against thee and repent not the first\ntime, nevertheless thou shalt forgive him.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And if he trespass against thee the second time, and repent not, nevertheless thou shalt\nforgive him.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And if he trespass against thee the third time, and repent not, thou shalt also forgive him.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But if he trespass against thee the fourth time thou shalt not forgive him, but shall bring\nthese testimonies before the Lord; and they shall not be blotted out until he repent and reward\nthee fourfold in all things wherewith he has trespassed against thee.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And if he do this, thou shalt forgive him with all thine heart\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12710\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12710)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12710)\">D&amp;C 98:41-45<\/a><\/span>); we must still forgive. The\nLord will avenge us. \"Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42687\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42687)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42687)\">Rom. 12:19<\/a><\/span>), and\nman must not seek vengeance nor retaliate against those who have damaged him. Bitterness\ninjures the one who carries it more than the one against whom it is directed.\n<\/p><p>\nJUDGE NOT\n<\/p><p>\nCan we ever forget the lesson taught us by the Lord Jesus Christ when he said:\n<\/p><p>\nJudge not, that ye be not judged,\n<\/p><p>\nFor with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye\nmete, it shall be measured to you again.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not\nthe beam that is in thine own eye?\n<\/p><p>\nOr how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye;\nand, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?\n<\/p><p>\nThou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou\nsee clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34267\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34267)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34267)\">Matt. 7:1-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe contrast between the huge beam and the tiny mote brings to our attention, forcibly, that\nwe mortals should totally avoid judgment of our fellow men. When a beam is obscuring our\nown vision, how can we know their motives, intents, and desires? And not knowing, how can\nwe judge righteously?\n<\/p><p>\nAnother indictment of us who accuse others is the touching story of the woman taken in\nadultery and brought before the Savior for judgment. Her accusers, apparently with\nmonumental beams in their eyes blinding them, brought the unfortunate sinner demanding the\nextreme penalty of stoning. The Lord was wise beyond their comprehension and could not be\ntrapped by these wanton sinners.\n<\/p><p>\n. . . But Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though\nhe heard them not.\n<\/p><p>\nSo when they continued asking him, he lifted himself, and said unto them,\nHe that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27368\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27368)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27368)\">John 8:6-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd when he looked up a little later, all the accusers \". . . being convicted by their own\nconscience\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27369\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27369)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27369)\">John 8:9<\/a><\/span>), had sneaked away.\n<\/p><p>\nUNHOLY JUDGING\n<\/p><p>\nAnother impressive example of unholy judging comes to us in the Lord's parable of the\nunmerciful servant who owed to his lord ten thousand talents but being unable to pay, his lord\ncommanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children and all that he had, and payment to be\nmade. The servant fell down and begged for a moratorium, and when the compassionate lord\nhad loosed him and forgiven his debt, this conscienceless person straightway found one of his\nfellowservants who owed him an hundred pence, and taking him by the throat demanded\npayment in full, and upon failure of the debtor, cast him into prison. When the lord heard of\nthis rank injustice (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34290\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34290)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34290)\">Matt. 18:23-31<\/a><\/span>), he chastised the unmerciful servant:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:\n<\/p><p>\nShouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had\npity on thee?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay\nall that was due unto him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34291\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34291)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34291)\">Matt. 18:32-34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen the Redeemer, summarizing, said to his disciples:\n<\/p><p>\nSo likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts\nforgive not every one his brother their trespasses\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34292\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34292)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34292)\">Matt. 18:35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAccording to my Bible, the Roman penny is an eighth of an ounce of silver, while the talent\nis 750 ounces. Accordingly the unmerciful servant was forgiven 600,000 units but would not\nforgive one unit.\n<\/p><p>\nI met a woman once, demanding and critical. She accused her stake president of harshness\nand would have displaced him if she could. She had committed adultery, and yet with her\ncomparative debt of 600,000 pence she had the temerity to criticize her leader with a hundred\npence debt. I also knew a young man who complained at his bishop and took offense at the\nleader's inefficiency and his grammatical errors, yet he himself had in his life sins comparable\nto the talents and had the effrontery to accuse his bishop of weaknesses comparable only to\nthe pence.\n<\/p><p>\nThose of us who have sins, heinous or less serious, would do well to sing frequently the\nbeautiful hymns: \"Should You Feel Inclined to Censure,\" by George H. Durham; \"School Thy\nFeelings, O My Brother,\" by President Charles W. Penrose; and \"Let Each Man Learn to\nKnow Himself,\" so much sung and loved by President Heber J. Grant.\n<\/p><p>\nEXAMPLES OF FORGIVENESS\n<\/p><p>\nRemember that we must forgive even if our offender did not repent and ask forgiveness.\nStephen yet in his young life had mastered this principle. His accusers, unable to find\nanything against him other than fancied blasphemy, stoned him to death. Not waiting for them\nto repent, Stephen displayed his saintliness by using his last breath to forgive them saying:\n\"Lord, lay not this sin to their charge\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7607\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7607)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7607)\">Acts 7:60<\/a><\/span>).\nThey had taken his very life, and yet he\nforgave them. The Prophet Joseph moved to his certain death with the same spirit of\nforgiveness (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12755\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12755)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12755)\">D&amp;C 135:4<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Lord Jesus also gave to us the lesson. Before they asked forgiveness, before\nthey repented, while they were still in their murderous passion, he found it in his heart to\nforgive them and to ask his Father to \". . . forgive them; for they know not what they do\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31251\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31251)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31251)\">Luke 23:34<\/a><\/span>).\nHe did not wait till his crucifiers, the high priests, scribes, elders, and\nPharisees, should have a change of heart, but forgave them while they were yet covered with\nhis life's blood.\n<\/p><p>\nDUTIES OF OFFENDED ONE\n<\/p><p>\nIt frequently happens that offenses are committed when the offender is not aware of it.\nSomething he has said or done is misconstrued or misunderstood. The offended one treasures\nin his heart the offense, adding to it such other things as might give fuel to the fire and justify\nhis conclusions. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the Lord requires that the offended\none should make the overtures toward peace. He says:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd if thy brother or sister offend thee, thou shalt take him or her between him\nor her and thee alone; and if he or she confess thou shalt be reconciled\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12627\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12627)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12627)\">D&amp;C 42:88<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo the Nephites the Lord said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . if ... thy brother hath aught against thee&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nGo thy way unto thy brother, and first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come\nunto me with full purpose of heart, and I will receive you\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5483\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5483)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5483)\">3 Ne. 12:23-24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd to the disciples in Judea he said:\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother\nhath ought against thee;\n<\/p><p>\nLeave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy\nbrother, and then come and offer thy gift\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34248\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34248)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34248)\">Matt. 5:23-24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nDo we follow that commandment or do we sulk in our bitterness, waiting for our offender to\nlearn of it and to kneel to us in remorse?\n<\/p><p>\nFORGIVENESS INVOLVES FORGETTING\n<\/p><p>\nAnd this reconciliation suggests also forgetting. Unless you forget, have you forgiven? A\nwoman in a branch in the mission field where there had been friction finally capitulated and\nsaid, \"Yes. I will forgive the others, but I have an eternal memory.\" Certainly she had not\nfulfilled the law of forgiving. She was meeting the letter but not the spirit. Frequently we say\nwe forgive then permit the grievance to continue to poison and embitter us.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord forgets when he has forgiven, and certainly must we. He inspired Isaiah to say:\n<\/p><p>\nI, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will\nnot remember thy sins (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25098\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25098)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25098)\">Isa. 43:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again in our dispensation, he said:\n<\/p><p>\nBehold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven; and I, the Lord, remember them no more\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12636\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12636)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12636)\">D&amp;C 58:42<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd we are instructed by him that\n<\/p><p>\n. . . thou shalt forgive him with all thine heart; . . .\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12712\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12712)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12712)\">D&amp;C 98:45<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNo bitterness of past frictions can be held in memory if we forgive with all our hearts.\n<\/p><p>\nSo long as we are bitter, hold grudges, are unrepentant ourselves, unforgiving to others, how\ncan we partake of the sacrament? Read again what God said in the matter:\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord,\nunworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
