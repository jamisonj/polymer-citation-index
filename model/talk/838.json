Brown, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1956, pp. 103-106<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI wonder if sometimes our people think when they hear each speaker ask for divine guidance\nthat it has come to be just a habit.  If you were asked to occupy this position, you would\nknow that that is not the case.  For that guidance I humbly pray.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to follow the example of being brief which was set yesterday by President\nJoseph Fielding Smith.  I think he demonstrated the truth of the statement that for a speech to\nbe immortal it does not need to be everlasting.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is not surprising that Elder LeGrand Richards and I should be thinking along similar lines,\nbecause both of us have had missionary experience, and whenever a missionary stands before\na congregation of Saints, if there is one single individual present who is not a member of the\nChurch, the missionary will talk to him and ignore all the rest.  I should like to follow his\nlead, if I may, and address what I have to say to you out there, our other brothers and sisters\nwho are not members of the Church, and I think it is not presumptuous to think there are\nthousands of you listening in.\n<\/p><p>\nSince our last April conference, reporters, editors, commentators, and others at home and\nabroad have given considerable time and space to the Church and its activities.  As has been\nintimated, this results partly at least from the tour of the choir, the dedication of the Swiss\nand Los Angeles temples, and the announcement of other temples to be built.  We appreciate\nthe uniform friendliness and general accuracy of these reports and comments. They have\nranged from learned discussions of various phases of the gospel to such brief and inaccurate\ngeneralizations as that, \"To be a Mormon simply means that one does not drink tea or coffee\nor use tobacco or liquor.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow, we do accept and try to live the Word of Wisdom\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13504\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13504)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13504)\">D&amp;C 89:1-21<\/a><\/span>),\na law of health, first because the\nLord thought enough of it to give a revelation on it and also because for a hundred years we\nhave proved its worth.  But there are other things we would like our friends to know about\nthe Church, and so for a few moments I would like to discuss some phases of Mormonism\nwhich are not so generally known.\n<\/p><p>\nBecause of limitation of time and of the speaker, any attempted exposition will be inadequate\nand incomplete.  I should like first, however, to say to you that the conduct of a typical\nmember of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or Mormon, is influenced not so\nmuch by prohibitions, inhibitions, or Church discipline as by his own inner convictions\nregarding the essential dignity and possible glory of the individual, the meaning of life, man's\norigin, purpose, and possible destiny.\n<\/p><p>\nMormonism is not just a code of ethics; it is not merely a set of inhibitive injunctions; it is\nnot just a theoretical system of doctrine and philosophy.  It is rather a way of life, based upon\na concept of God as our Eternal Father, and of man, created in the bodily image of God, a\nson of God, who has all of the obligations, opportunities, and potentials of heirship. The\nMormon concept of Deity with its accompanying concept of man's potential Godlike status,\nshould cause believers to resist the down drag of habits and indulgences which are inimical to\nor would impede or delay man's progress towards his goal.\n<\/p><p>\nPerhaps you would like to take a quick look at Mormonism through the eyes of a\nnon-member of the Church who has taken time to study it.  I have the author's permission to\nread some paragraphs from a pamphlet recently published by the department of humanities of\nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the general caption \"The Sociology of\nMormonism.\" These studies were made and written by Dr. Thomas F. O'Dea, who has a\ndistinguished academic career at Harvard, at Stanford, and at M.I.T. These writings show\ncareful study, keen analysis, and an enviable facility of expression. I shall read some excerpts:\n<\/p><p>\nOf the many churches founded in the regions south of the Great Lakes in the first\nhalf of the nineteenth century, the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints or the Mormon Church alone avoided the stagnant back-waters of\nsectarianism.  The need to start over again four times in sixteen years contributed to\nflexibility and avoided sectarian atmosphere and culture.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again he says,\n<\/p><p>\nIn 1847 the Mormons, harassed and persecuted, dispossessed of all but faith, leadership\nand a superb organization, crossed the plains and settled in the Utah desert. * * * The\nMormon leadership deliberately chose an unattractive region to gain the necessary\nrespite that isolation would give, and resisted the seductions of more pleasant\nprospects.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then speaking of our Americanism, he said: \n<\/p><p>\nTheir American patriotism is an Article of Faith with them. * * * The development of\na nationhood was inhibited by American patriotic convictions on the part of the\nLatter-day Saints themselves.  Mormonism sees America as a chosen land and holds\nthat the second coming of Christ will be to this continent.  America is a\ndivinely-preferred country and the previous periods of history were preparatory for the\nMormon restoration.  Thus the Mormons, while exalting America and exulting in it,\ncould at the same time feel called out of Babylon to build the city of God. * * * The\nMormons are pre-eminently practical and are the typical American religious\nmovement.  As such Mormonism presents a heightening, a more explicit formulation\nand summation of the American experience of time and of America's timeliness.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Mormon Church defines itself as a restoration in the latter days of the original\ngospel of Jesus Christ, which had been corrupted and lost in part for the past fifteen\ncenturies.  Its restoration is conceived in terms of Christian history.  * * * It is a new\ninterpretation of Christianity itself. A unique prophet and a unique and timely moment\nas well as a uniquely appropriate place are part of this conception.  Mormonism holds\nitself to have been revealed in the fullness of time&mdash;a fullness of time which involves\nthe destiny of the Western Hemisphere and the American nation. The discovery of\nAmerica and the development of the political institutions of the United States are seen\nas prepared by divine guidance for the restoration which was to be made through the\nagency of the original prophet, Joseph Smith.\n<\/p><p>\nWithin this larger framework the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has its\nown history, a record of wandering and persecution, of construction and conquest over\nhostile elements coming to fruition in the building of Zion in the mountain tops. * * *\nMormonism lived its Exodus and Chronicles not once but many times.  It had its\nMoses and its Joshua. Circumstances had given it a stage upon which its reenactment\nof Biblical history was neither farce nor symbolic pageant.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, our history has been in part a reenactment of biblical history, but what is more\nimportant, our doctrine is a reaffirmation of biblical truth.  We believe in the God of the Old\nTestament&mdash;Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. We believe that that Divine\nPersonage became Jesus the Christ of the New Testament, the Son of God, the Redeemer of\nthe world.  We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved\nobedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6695\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6695)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6695)\">A of F 1:3<\/a><\/span>).  We emphasize \"all mankind\" and\n\"obedience\" because the gospel and its saving ordinances are to be made available to the\nliving on this earth, and to the living elsewhere, with obedience as prerequisite to blessings.\n<\/p><p>\nFor for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might\nbe judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2263\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2263)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2263)\">1 Pet. 4:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBelieving as we do in the great vicarious service of the Master which is the very foundation\nof Christianity, we undertake to do for our dead, what they cannot do for themselves, and\ntherefore we build these temples which you, our friends, have seen and of you have heard.\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe in a pre-existent state where we exercised free agency, where there were\nindividual differences, where life was purposeful and progressive, and where man in his\noriginal state existed as intelligence.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter referring to \"the inestimable contributions to the settlement of the West and the planting\nthere of a viable and vital American civilization,\" Dr. O'Dea Says: \"How remarkably familiar\nare the basic elements of the Mormon gospel, how remarkably like apprehension of America\nby other Americans when it sheds its theological poignancy.\" He refers to Mormon theology\nas\n<\/p><p>\nA distillation of what is peculiarly American in America and that incorporating the\ngoals of the present world into a vision of eternal progression the Church succeeded in\nannihilating for its followers the line of demarcation between time and eternity in quite\na new way.\n<\/p><p>\nFor Mormonism the world is uncreated and God and men are winning mastery over\nother uncreated elements.  God has become a demiurge once again which means one\nwho works on existing material, a craftsman.\n<\/p><p>\nAll that is, is in process, and it is a process that is marked by two main characteristics: It is\nbecoming increasingly more complex, and intelligent beings, God and men, are collaboratively\ngaining increasing mastery over it. Man's life on earth is seen as one of an infinity of\nepisodes characterized by increasing development and mastery of the other elements of nature.\nThis concept of God's purpose and method respecting man's existence was clearly stated by\nthe late Dr. John A. Widtsoe, himself a great scholar and a profound student of the gospel,\n<\/p><p>\nThe law of progression is then a law of endless development of all the powers of man\nin the midst of a universe, becoming increasingly more complex. No more hopeful\nprinciple can be incorporated into a philosophy of life (<i>A Rational Theology<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord revealed in the 93rd Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 29,\n<\/p><p>\nMan was also in the beginning with God.  Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not\ncreated or made, neither indeed can be. * * * For man is spirit.  The elements are\neternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13510\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13510)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13510)\">D&amp;C 93:29,33<\/a><\/span>). \n<\/p><p>\nOn this point Dr. Widtsoe wrote as follows: \n<\/p><p>\nIn the beginning, which transcends our understanding, God undoubtedly exercised his\nwill vigorously and thus gained great experience of the forces lying about him. As\nknowledge grew into greater knowledge by the persistent efforts of the will, his\nrecognition of universal laws became greater until he obtained at last a conquest over\nthe universe which to our finite understanding seems absolutely complete.\n<\/p><p>\nWe proclaim the scriptural and inspiring doctrine that man should look up and not down for\nhis source, for he is of divine lineage; that man is innocent at birth, which is the antithesis of\nthe ball and chain doctrine of original sin and innate wickedness.\n<\/p><p>\nEvery spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man\nfrom the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13515\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13515)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13515)\">D&amp;C 93:38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMan faces a vista of limitless development, eternal progression, if he will cooperate in\nwinning mastery over himself and the universe.  We believe that man's earth life was made\npossible by Adam's role in a foreordained plan which included the provision for man to come\nface to face with both good and evil and, under the eternal law of free agency, elect good or\nevil without compulsion, knowing however that under the immutable law of the harvest he\nmust abide the consequences of his choice, must reap as he sows\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23250\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23250)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23250)\">Gal. 6:7<\/a><\/span>).  Free agency is prerequisite\nto any character-building plan, and while with free agency any plan is inevitably crammed\nwith risk, we, with all the sons of God, accepted that risk and shouted for joy at the prospect\nof earth life.  The Lord said to Job,\n<\/p><p>\nWhere wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?<br \/>\nWhen the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26674\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26674)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26674)\">Job 38:4,7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf God is in fact our Father, then we, Father and children, belong to the same society of\neternal intelligences.  Among them he is supreme, he is the most advanced, most powerful,\nand most intelligent.\n<\/p><p>\nNow the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized\nbefore the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great\nones . . .<br \/>\nI am the Lord thy God, I am more intelligent than they all\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7206\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7206)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7206)\">Abr. 3:22,19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we say man may become like our Father, we do not mean to humanize God, but rather\nto deify man&mdash;not as he now is but as he may become. The difference between us is\nindescribably great, but it is one of degree rather than of kind.\n<\/p><p>\nBut as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27674\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27674)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27674)\">John 1:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo the Latter-day Saints salvation or being saved does not imply a sudden transformation or\nmetamorphosis into something entirely unlike one's nature nor can it be achieved by mere\nmental assent or sudden conversion. It is rather a continuing process of becoming or unfolding\npursuant to law and divine plan, of bringing one's life into harmony with eternal and\ninexorable law.\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe that in his infinite and eternal development toward a Godlike status, man moves\ntoward and through a turnstile called death; that there is no interruption of life at this portal,\nfor eternity is indefinitely prolonged time. We believe that man, after passing through this\nturnstile, will continue his eternal journey from the point where his actions in this life have\nbrought him. \"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us\nin the resurrection\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13528\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13528)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13528)\">D&amp;C 130:18<\/a><\/span>).\nTo deny the possibility of eternal progression is to\naccept the awful alternative of eventual stagnation which would be damnation.\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe that being saved involves education, that man cannot be saved in ignorance\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13532\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13532)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13532)\">D&amp;C 131:6<\/a><\/span>) any\nmore than he can be saved in sin, for as the glory of God is intelligence, or light and truth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13513\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13513)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13513)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span>), so\nthe degree of our intelligence will be the measure of our glory. Neither the ignorant nor the\nsinner would be comfortable or at home in heaven.  This concept glorifies intelligence as\nwell as righteousness.  But let us not confuse mere knowledge with intelligence. The\nknowledge of which we speak must seek enlightenment and be applied with wisdom. The\nknowledge that will save us is not mere know-how, certainly not cunning or mental agility or\nsagacity; it is not just erudition. The wise man may not be learned, and the learned are not\nalways wise. The intelligence which is the glory of God is all knowledge (and knowledge is\npower) applied with supreme wisdom and total righteousness.\n<\/p><p>\nTime will not permit a further discussion of our teachings with respect to some of the things\nthat Dr. O'Dea has mentioned. Suffice it to say that Mormonism, among other things, is an\neternal quest for knowledge which is power, for truth which is joyous because it makes us\nfree, for intelligence, which is the glory of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13514\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13514)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13514)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span>),\nand for the righteousness which will enable\nus to feel at home in his holy presence.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to live worthily and to go forward fearlessly in our search for truth, I pray, in the\nname of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
