On that occasion, entering one classroom, I noticed the rapt attention the children gave their native instructor. His textbook and theirs lay closed upon the desks. In his hand he held a strange-appearing fishing lure fashioned from a round stone and large seashells. This, I learned, was a <span class=\"emphasis\">maka-feke,<\/span> an octopus lure. In Tonga, octopus meat is a delicacy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/true-to-the-faith.p5\" class=\"\">The teacher explained that Tongan fishermen glide over a reef, paddling their outrigger canoes with one hand and dangling the maka-feke over the side with the other. An octopus dashes out from its rocky lair and seizes the lure, mistaking it for a much-desired meal. So tenacious is the grasp of the octopus and so firm is its instinct not to relinquish the precious prize that fishermen can flip it right into the canoe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/true-to-the-faith.p6\" class=\"\">It was an easy transition for the teacher to point out to the eager and wide-eyed youth that the evil one\u2014even Satan\u2014has fashioned so-called maka-fekes with which to ensnare unsuspecting persons and take possession of their destinies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/true-to-the-faith.p7\" class=\"\">Today we are surrounded by the maka-fekes which the evil one dangles before us and with which he attempts to entice us and then to ensnare us.

It is the maka-feke of excessive debt. It is a human tendency to want the things which will give us prominence and prestige. We live in a time when borrowing is easy. We can purchase almost anything we could ever want just by using a credit card or obtaining a loan. Extremely popular are home equity loans, where one can borrow an amount of money equal to the equity he has in his home. What we may not realize is that a home equity loan is equivalent to a second mortgage.

Many enter into long-term debt only to find that changes occur: people become ill or incapacitated, companies fail or downsize, jobs are lost, natural disasters befall us. For many reasons, payments on large amounts of debt can no longer be made.
