Eyring and President Dieter\u00a0F. Uchtdorf. They are men of wisdom and understanding. Their service is invaluable. I love and support my Brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. During this conference we sustained a new member of that Quorum. He is completely dedicated to the work of the Lord, and I testify that he is the man our Heavenly Father wants to fill this position at this time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/until-we-meet-again.p10\" class=\"\">I express my love to the members of the Seventy and the Presiding Bishopric. They serve selflessly and so effectively. Similarly, I pay tribute to the general auxiliary officers. In accordance with our policy of rotation, we have sustained new general presidencies of the Young Men and of the Sunday School. We look forward to working with them. We thank those who were released from these positions at this conference and who served so faithfully in these capacities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/until-we-meet-again.p11\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, may we strive to live closer to the Lord.

We live at a time when the adversary is using every means possible to ensnare us in his web of deceit, trying desperately to take us down with him. There are many pathways along which he entices us to go\u2014pathways that can lead to our destruction. Advances in many areas that can be used for good can also be used to speed us along those heinous pathways.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/until-we-meet-again.p15\" class=\"\">I feel to mention one in particular, and that is the Internet. On one hand, it provides nearly limitless opportunities for acquiring useful and important information. Through it we can communicate with others around the world. The Church itself has a wonderful Web site, filled with valuable and uplifting information and priceless resources.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/until-we-meet-again.p16\" class=\"\">On the other hand, however\u2014and extremely alarming\u2014are the reports of the number of individuals who are utilizing the Internet for evil and degrading purposes, the viewing of pornography being the most prevalent of these purposes. My brothers and sisters, involvement in such will literally destroy the spirit. Be strong. Be clean. Avoid such degrading and destructive types of content at all costs\u2014wherever they may be! I sound this warning to everyone, everywhere. I add\u2014particularly to the young people\u2014that this includes pornographic images transmitted via cell phones.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/until-we-meet-again.p17\" class=\"\">My beloved friends, under no circumstances allow yourselves to become trapped in the viewing of pornography, one of the most effective of Satan\u2019s enticements. And if you have allowed yourself to become involved in this behavior, cease now. Seek the help you need to overcome and to change the direction of your life. Take the steps necessary to get back on the strait and narrow, and then stay there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/until-we-meet-again.p18\" class=\"\">May we say, with Joshua of old, \u201cChoose you this day whom ye will serve; \u2026 but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-04205_000_037\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117766\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117766)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117766)\">Joshua 24:15<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/until-we-meet-again.p19\" class=\"\">Now, my brothers and sisters, we have built temples throughout the world and will continue to do so. To you who are worthy and able to attend the temple, I would admonish you to go often. The temple is a place where we can find peace. There we receive a renewed dedication to the gospel and a strengthened resolve to keep the commandments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/until-we-meet-again.p20\" class=\"\">What a privilege it is to be able to go to the temple, where we may experience the sanctifying influence of the Spirit of the Lord. Great service is given when we perform vicarious ordinances for those who have gone beyond the veil. In many cases we do not know those for whom we perform the work. We expect no thanks, nor do we have the assurance that they will accept that which we offer. However, we serve, and in that process we attain that which comes of no other effort: we literally become saviors on Mount Zion. As our Savior gave His life as a vicarious sacrifice for us, so we, in some small measure, do the same when we perform proxy work in the temple for those who have no means of moving forward unless something is done for them by those of us here on the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/until-we-meet-again.p21\" class=\"\">I am deeply grateful that as a church we continue to extend humanitarian aid where there is great need. We have done much in this regard and have blessed the lives of thousands upon thousands of our Father\u2019s children who are not of our faith as well as those who are. We intend to continue to help wherever such is needed. We express gratitude to you for your contributions in this regard.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/until-we-meet-again.p22\" class=\"\">How grateful I am, my brothers and sisters, for the Restoration of the gospel in this dispensation and for all the blessings that have come into my life and into your lives as a result.
