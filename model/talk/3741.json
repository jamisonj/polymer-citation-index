I feel that the Spirit of the Lord has been with us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p4\" class=\"\">It\u2019s a great thing to hold the priesthood of God, and that is what this is tonight\u2014a priesthood meeting. The priesthood of God is power. It\u2019s an endowment, which the Lord has given to us who hold the priesthood, to perform sacred ordinances that have effect in this world and in the world to come. It\u2019s the greatest power in the world\u2014the priesthood\u2014and I am very happy that I have had the privilege through the years to bear the priesthood and to receive offices in the priesthood from deacon up to the offices of the Melchizedek Priesthood which I have had assignments to work in. I know that it\u2019s the priesthood that will save this world. It is not a man-made organization; it is not a man-prepared organization\u2014it embodies a power revealed from heaven and sent here to us to help us prepare our lives for eternal life in the presence of our Father in Heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p5\" class=\"\">It\u2019s a great thing to see this building completely filled with bearers of the priesthood, both men who bear the Melchizedek Priesthood\u2014old men like myself\u2014and young men who bear the Aaronic Priesthood. I hope that we appreciate the authority that the Lord has given us to act in his service in the respective offices in the priesthood that we hold.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p6\" class=\"\">I have held the priesthood for three-quarters of a century, from the time I was a deacon until I now hold the Melchizedek Priesthood, and I have enjoyed it all through the years. It has been sacred to me, and it is sacred to me now. I hope that you have the same feeling about the priesthood. Don\u2019t ever do anything that you would be ashamed of, that you would be ashamed to talk to the Lord about, because we will meet him someday if we live the gospel well enough to have that privilege. We will be very grateful then, if we know, as he will know, that our lives have been in harmony with the teachings of the gospel and the responsibility that is placed upon us who hold the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p7\" class=\"\">I have enjoyed this meeting. I am glad I came, and I am glad I have heard what I have heard here tonight. I pray the Lord will bless each boy and man, old and young, that is here tonight with the feeling and determination that he will live the teachings of the gospel and magnify the priesthood which the Lord has given him. It will be a great day for us individually, when we\u2019re called to give an account of our deeds down here on the earth, if we can be assured that the Lord will approve our actions and we can go on to the eternities beyond this life to experience the growth that comes to men and boys who hold the priesthood, faithfully do their duties, and seek the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p8\" class=\"\">As I said before I have enjoyed this meeting tonight and I\u2019m happy that you\u2019ve been here. I hope you\u2019ll all come tomorrow to the conference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p9\" class=\"\">I leave my blessings with you and pray that you will be given an understanding that priesthood power is the power of God. Never do anything to disappoint yourselves or your loved ones or the Lord, or that would diminish your right to blessings that will come to you through obedience to the priesthood as long as you live. I leave my blessings with you and my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
