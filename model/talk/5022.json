I also wish to speak of the exquisite beauty and fragrance to be found in life, and of a crown of glory. I wish that I better understood all of the divine purposes in having to contend with so many painful irritants in this life. Lehi explained one reason: that we will appreciate and savor the goodness and loveliness of the world.

Likewise, mortality is \u201ccursed\u201d with the thorns of worldly temptation and the slivers of sin so that we can be tested and prove ourselves. This is necessary for our eternal progression. The Apostle Paul explained, \u201cLest I should be exalted above measure \u2026 , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3124\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3124)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3124)\">2 Cor. 12:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/a-crown-of-thorns-a-crown-of-glory.p4\" class=\"\">The denial of our own sins, of our own selfishness, of our own weakness is like a crown of thorns which keeps us from moving up one more step in personal growth. Perhaps worse than sin is the denial of sin. If we deny that we are sinners, how can we ever be forgiven? How can the atonement of Jesus work in our lives if there is no repentance? If we do not promptly remove the slivers of sin and the thorns of carnal temptation, how can the Lord ever heal our souls? The Savior said, \u201cRepent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6220\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6220)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6220)\">3 Ne. 9:13<\/a><\/span>.) It is most difficult for us to pray for those who hate us, who despitefully use us, who persecute us. But by failing to take this vital extra step, however, we fail to remove some of the festering briars in our souls. Extending forgiveness, love, and understanding for perceived shortcomings and weaknesses in our wives, husbands, children, and associates makes it much easier to say, \u201cGod be merciful to me a sinner.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32428\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32428)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32428)\">Luke 18:13<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/a-crown-of-thorns-a-crown-of-glory.p5\" class=\"\">It seems that no matter how carefully we walk through life\u2019s paths, we pick up some thorns, briars, and slivers. As a young boy, when school was out for the summer and we went to the farm, off came our shoes. The shoes stayed off all summer long except for special occasions. For the first week or two, when our feet were tender, the smoothest pebble or stick would be painful. But as the weeks came and went, the soles of our feet toughened so that they could withstand almost anything in the path except thistles, of which there seemed to be more than any other weed. And so it is with life; as we grow and mature and keep close to Him who was crowned with thorns, our souls seem to get stronger in withstanding the challenges, our resolve hardens, our wills become firmer, and our self-discipline increases to protect us from the evils of this world. These evils are so omnipresent, however, that we must always walk in the paths which are the most free of the thistles of earthly temptation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/a-crown-of-thorns-a-crown-of-glory.p6\" class=\"\">As children, we used to delight in waving thistledown stalks to watch the seeds float on the wind. Only later did we realize the effects that this had on our own and neighboring gardens. Many of us delight in flirting with temptation, only later to learn how we and others have sown the seeds of our own unhappiness and how we can also affect our neighbor\u2019s happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/a-crown-of-thorns-a-crown-of-glory.p7\" class=\"\">There is a defense mechanism to discern between good and evil. It is called conscience. It is our spirit\u2019s natural response to the pain of sin, just like pain in our flesh is our body\u2019s natural response to a wound\u2014even a small sliver. Conscience strengthens through use. Paul told the Hebrews, \u201cBut strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24559\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24559)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24559)\">Heb. 5:14<\/a><\/span>.)

The power to remove the thorns in our lives and in the lives of others begins with ourselves. Moroni writes that when we deny ourselves of ungodliness, then the grace of Christ is sufficient for us.

How much we resist the momentary pain of removing a sliver, even though it will relieve the longer-lasting pain of a festering sore. Everyone knows that if thorns and briars and slivers are not removed from the flesh, they will cause sores that fester and will not heal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/a-crown-of-thorns-a-crown-of-glory.p10\" class=\"\">One of the members of our family has a remarkable dog named Ben. A few years ago, on a beautiful fall day, some of us were walking in the fields. Ben was going back and forth in front of us, sniffing the ground, tail wagging, and obviously enjoying himself. After a while we sat down on a ditch bank to rest and could feel the warmth of the autumn sun caressing us. Ben came limping up to his master and, with a pained look in his eye, held up his front paw. Ben\u2019s master gently took his paw into his hands and examined it carefully. Between two of his toes was a thorn. The thorn was carefully removed, and Ben stayed long enough to wag his tail a little more vigorously and receive a few pats on his head. He then ran off, no longer limping nor bothered by the pain. I was amazed that Ben instinctively seemed to know that the thorn needed to come out to relieve the pain and to know where to go to have it removed. Like Ben, we also seem to instinctively look for relief from the thorns of sin that inflict us. In contrast, however, we do not always seek our Master for relief; and many do not yet know who their Master is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/a-crown-of-thorns-a-crown-of-glory.p11\" class=\"\">As a carpenter, Jesus would have been familiar with slivers and thorny woods. As a child, He would have learned that one rarely gets a sliver when working the wood in the right direction. He would also have known more than any how slivers\u2014small and painful\u2014divert attention from important matters. The scourging of Jesus took place partly with thorns:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/a-crown-of-thorns-a-crown-of-glory.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cThen the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/a-crown-of-thorns-a-crown-of-glory.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/a-crown-of-thorns-a-crown-of-glory.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/a-crown-of-thorns-a-crown-of-glory.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37420\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37420)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37420)\">Matt. 27:27\u201330<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/a-crown-of-thorns-a-crown-of-glory.p16\" class=\"\">Perhaps this cruel act was a perverse attempt to mimic the placing of an emperor\u2019s laurel upon His head. Thus, there was pressed down upon Him a crown of thorns. He accepted the pain as part of the great gift He had promised to make. How poignant this was, considering that thorns signified God\u2019s displeasure as He cursed the ground for Adam\u2019s sake that henceforth it would bring forth thorns. But by wearing the crown, Jesus transformed thorns into a symbol of His glory.

When one stands on a small hill above the rose fields, the aroma is delightful and the beauty is exhilarating. The thorns on the bushes are there, but they in no way lessen the enjoyment of the sight and the smell. I would challenge all to put the thorns, slivers, and thistles we encounter in life in proper perspective. We should deal with them but then concentrate on the flowers of life, not on the thorns. We should savor the smell and beauty of the flower of the rose and the cactus. To savor the sweet aroma of the blossoms, we need to live righteous and disciplined lives in which the study of the scriptures, prayer, right priorities, and right attitudes are integrated into our lives. For members of this church, that focus sharpens inside of our temples. We will all surely encounter some of the thorns, but they are only incidental to the sweet fragrances and exquisite beauty of the blooms. Did not the Savior say, \u201cYe shall know them by their fruits.

So selfishness can make what we think is a noble crown into a crown of thorns beyond our power to endure. When I first started my professional career, one of the senior members in our office asked another senior member for some help on a legal matter. The other man who was asked to help was gifted and able but also selfish. He replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me\u201d The \u201cwhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d philosophy is basically what\u2019s wrong with the world.

Is it not time that we begin denying ourselves, as the Savior counseled, and surrender and master ourselves rather than indulge ourselves in a \u201cdo my own thing\u201d selfish little world? The question is not so much what we can do, but what God can do through us.

When going to school I was very poor. I worked long hours in a canning factory catching steaming-hot cans for twenty-five cents an hour. I learned that selfishness has more to do with how we feel about what we have than how much we have. A poor man can be selfish and a rich man generous, but a person obsessed only with getting will have a hard time to find God. I have come to know that with any privilege comes responsibility. Most privilege carries with it the responsibility to serve, to give, and to bless. God can take away any privilege if it is not used under His omnipotent will. Meeting that challenge to give, to serve, to bless in faithfulness and devotion is the only way to enjoy the crown of glory spoken of by the original Apostles.
