Of course there are times when human nature is physically incapacitated from labors. Nevertheless I rejoice exceedingly in the contemplation of the work that we are engaged in. Certainly the review of our immense subject, our great calling, our vast labor, and the wonderful results that follow them&#x2014;when they are reviewed as they were this morning, and called up before our minds, must awaken deeply interesting and I should hope broadly expanded views and reflections in the minds of the Saints. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n327\"> We are, as a people, and also our labors as well as the results of them, a great outstanding witness to the world of the divine character of the work we are performing&#x2014;the high order of our calling to perform that <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"98b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0098.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;98b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9430\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> work, as well as pointing significantly to the grand and glorious results which must inevitably follow the labor and toil that are now upon the Latter-day Saints. Any person whose bosom is warmed and whose intellect is lit up by the Holy Spirit must rejoice greatly in the contemplation of the great last dispensation which is now fairly before the world, fairly upon the Saints, like the harness that is upon those that are appointed to labor, to pull, to lift, and to toil. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n328\"> Where is there any people upon the face of the earth, except the Latter-day Saints, who have from their religious convictions&#x2014;or from any system of ethics or morals that they possess, gone forth upon the face of the earth, and, from honest, conscientious convictions, and, from their most heartfelt appeals, taken hold of the honest in heart, or of the vicious in heart; anywhere upon the face of the earth, and gathered  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"99a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0099.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;99a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9429\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>together a people comprising twenty to thirty different languages and nations, and brought them together to any place, located them, and established a system of government that has been for their improvement, for their benefit, for the increase of their influence, their peace, or their happiness in any sense, either spiritual or temporal? <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n330\"> You can look abroad upon the earth in vain to find any other example that has any kind of relationship, or bears any kind of analogy or appearance like unto the work that is being performed by the Latter-day Saints in the days in which we live. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n331\"> Who is it that is doing this work?

This is the way in which we ought to look at these small but precious jewels.

You cannot pick up the Bible and find anything that is like it. In ancient days, when there was a warfare, it was a warfare of carnal weapons, many times. Not so, in our days; and as if the Lord were determined to put carnal weapons far away from us, He even permitted the Gubernatorial order preventing us carrying firearms with which to celebrate the 4th of July, and then, on the top of that, He has given us the abundant testimony of peace all around, even with the hostile natives. Is not this an overwhelming testimony that the Lord wants us to work with the other class of weapons&#x2014;the sword of His Holy Spirit,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"75395\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 75395)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(75395)\">Eph. 6:17<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"84689\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 84689)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(84689)\">D&amp;C 27:18<\/a><\/span> the power of eternal truth&#x2014;the ammunition that wants to be kept alive, active and burning in our hearts. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n341\"> When we come to contemplate this matter, our warfare is entirely in another direction, it has to be carried on and accomplished by the power of faith. We have to contend for our liberties and the rights of the people before the courts, wherein we strive to maintain the Constitutional rights to which we are entitled, both civilly and politically. We have not gone to the authorities that are over us in the nation and supplicated them saying: &#x201C;Will you please give us some extraordinary liberties or privileges&#x2014;we  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"102a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0102.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;102a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9426\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>contend for the rights of every American citizen, which are our rights.&#x201D; We have not cut ourselves off from the rights of citizenship. Our fathers fought to help obtain and bled to help establish the blessings and privileges, the liberties and powers of this glorious government to all its loyal citizens; and when this Church was established, it went on for more than thirty-two years&#x2014;no law of the Church conflicted with the laws of the land, until it became necessary in the opinion of some politicians that the Saints should be made offenders in the eyes of the nation and of the world. Then it was that Congress passed a law&#x2014;the law of 1862&#x2014;prohibiting plurality of wives, polygamy, or bigamy, as they choose to call it. Now, then, we have not risen up against the laws of the land; it is the laws of the land and the men of the land that have risen up against the people of God, and have brought their offensive warfare in this matter, and we are thereby placed on the defensive. The nation have been pleased to say that we shall not worship God according to the dictates of our consciences,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"94191\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 94191)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(94191)\">A of F 1:11<\/a><\/span> as required by some of the laws and ordinances of His Church; and have made laws to prevent us from so doing, if possible. Hence it is that, while we go before the courts we do not go as suppliants for something extraordinary, or for something that other people have not got. We ask to be preserved our rights, the rights that belong to every American citizen. It is for this that we go through the courts, appealing from the District Court to the Supreme Court of the Territory, and then to the Supreme Court of the United States. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n343\"> Now, is not this a great and an important lesson of experience and <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"102b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0102.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;102b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9426\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> instruction, and yet there is occasion, for all this is required in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. The Lord has said through the Prophet Joseph to us, that we must importune at the feet of the judges&#x2014;do you remember it?&#x2014;and at the feet of Governors&#x2014;do you recollect that&#x2014;and at the feet of the President, and then, says He, if your importuning does not prevail, and you do not obtain all things which you have a right to, He will come out of His hiding place and take the matter into His own hands.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"89638\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 89638)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(89638)\">D&amp;C 101:86-89<\/a><\/span> So you see we have some importuning to do before, or at the feet of Judges, Governors, and Presidents, in order to maintain the liberties guaranteed by the Constitution of our country. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n344\"> Right here I want to say a word or two especially in regard to the way we have to do our importuning. I refer to a discourse by President Young, in which he said he wished he had five hundred young lawyers full of the spirit of the Gospel who would rise up and help to maintain and defend our rights before the courts of our country. The discourse was published in the <span class=\"italic\">Deseret News<\/span> and republished in the <span class=\"italic\">Journal of Discourses<\/span>. It is public matter for anybody to read that wishes to. But a few days ago, however, a Bishop remarked that it looked very singular for one of the Apostles to raise up a lawyer, and thought there must be a screw loose somewhere. It happens, however, once in a while that some Bishop wants my son or someone else's son to help defend them before the courts. (Laughter.) I wonder if there is any screw loose there. Excuse me, brethren, for this reference; but I wish we could have a goodly number of substantial young men growing up in our midst who would become skilled and  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"103a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0103.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;103a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9425\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>mighty in the law, and who could go into any of the courts and set forth the true principles of justice and equity in all cases. We need more of such men. We do not want men to become lawyers, turn infidels, and live for nothing but the little money they can make. We want to raise up a corps of young men armed with the Spirit of the Gospel, clothed with the Holy Priesthood, who can tell the judges in high places what the law is, and what equity is, and can plead for the cause of Zion, and help maintain the rights of God's people. Hence you see we have got to carry on these matters. Our rights are infringed, and we have got to defend ourselves as best we can. We are told that we must plead with the dignitaries of the earth; plead with them until their position on our question is known; they have got to declare themselves. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n346\"> There are different branches of the government, which are considered coordinate. For instance&#x2014;there is the legislative branch, namely, Congress. Then there is the President, who represents the executive branch. Then there is the army and navy, which is the arm of power to carry out and maintain physical defenses. And then there is the Supreme Court, the legal tribunal that stands at the very head, if you please, and pronounces upon the constitutionality of the acts which Congress passes. Hence we see our case has not only to be brought before and had cognizance of in the Congress of the United States to ascertain if they will make laws to oppress us, but these laws can be taken to higher courts, to see whether they will maintain the rights of God's people in the land. And does it seem a terrible thing that one or two should get cast into <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"103b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0103.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;103b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9425\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> prison? As President Cannon contemplated this morning, half a dozen would cover all such cases within the last twenty-two years, and the persons connected with the most notable cases have come in and furnished the evidence for their own crimination, under the promise that punishment would not be inflicted. But like the Governor of Illinois, who pledged his honor and the honor of the state to protect our Prophet and Patriarch, all such promises were broken. Nevertheless, in this manner we have got to test the purity or impurity, the integrity or otherwise, of the different branches of the government under which we live. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n347\"> God is going to make His people a great people.

Some battles have had to be fought, some victories had to be achieved. It is while the war is going on that some get wounded, and other contingencies arise, and some things necessarily happen that are unpleasant. But after the war is over, and the new government is instituted, the grand improvement is then felt, as it has been felt in this nation ever since the thirteen colonies fought and maintained their independence from the mother country. It is true we have been oppressed a little. But our enemies do not make very much at it. We live and thrive notwithstanding, do we not? How singularly the Lord works with men. The people of the Southern States through the war and since, have been limited or deprived of some of their rights. And some few men&#x2014;Senator Brown for one&#x2014;are not afraid to rise up from their seat and defend the right whether in behalf of Mormon or non-Mormon, and expose the doings of self-righteous men in New England, exposing the fruits of their monogamous marriage relations as compared with our marriage institution. The Lord has raised up men sometimes to maintain the rights of His people. He will allow us to be pinched from time to time as it may be necessary to unite us together, to make a wife love her husband a little better, to make a husband love his wives and children a little better, and to strengthen the bond of union in every heart. For my part I rejoice in this work, and seek continually to gather knowledge. I rejoice that I have lived to see the work of God established on the earth. Let me tell you, my brethren and sisters, <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"104b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0104.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;104b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9424\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> the greatest affliction some of us have: it is some great fearful apprehension that something is going to happen. We naturally borrow trouble. We should not do that. Just consider that the work is the Lord's. Be certain you do your duty every day. And when you lay down at night do so with a clear conscience, and enjoy slumber and be refreshed, and rise up in the morning, in the likeness of the resurrection, prepared to renew the contest of life. Thus we should go on step by step, adding faith to faith, keeping the commandments of God, and purifying ourselves all we can. The Lord will bless us in proportion to the degree that we endeavor to purify ourselves, and keep His commandments. That is the great secret of our full acceptance with God. We must purify ourselves as He is pure.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"78692\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 78692)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(78692)\">1 Jn. 3:3<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n350\"> I do not consider it proper for me to occupy more of your time this afternoon.
