There is no sufficient way to express either the sense of responsibility or feelings of inadequacy one has in being called to such a ministry. In these many weeks of self-examination, I have repeatedly felt, as Paul once wrote, \u201cpressed out of measure, [and stretched] above strength.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3120\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3120)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3120)\">2 Cor. 1:8<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/he-loved-them-unto-the-end.p4\" class=\"\">I also wish to express appreciation to my family, who have loved me, prayed for me, comforted and sustained me all of my life\u2014as only a family can.

It is no small thing to \u201csustain\u201d another person. The word literally means to \u201cuphold\u201d or, if you prefer, to \u201chold up.\u201d When we sustain life, we nourish it, we keep it going. When we sustain a friend or a neighbor or a stranger in the street, we give support, we share strength, we provide help. We hold each other up under the weight of present circumstance. We bear one another\u2019s burdens under the heavy personal pressures of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/he-loved-them-unto-the-end.p6\" class=\"\">As with all else in our experience, the Lord Jesus Christ is our exemplar and ideal in this very important matter of providing sustenance. His is the ultimate arm of strength and his the endurance which endures all things. At no time did he demonstrate that unfailing devotion more clearly than during the final moments of his earthly life, hours when he might well have wished that others could have been sustaining him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/he-loved-them-unto-the-end.p7\" class=\"\">As the sacred supper of that ultimate Passover was being prepared, Jesus was under the strain of deep and profound emotion.

This small circle of believers in this scarcely founded kingdom were about to pass through their severest trial, so he would set aside his own increasing anguish in order that he might yet once more serve and strengthen them. It does not matter that no one washed his feet. In transcendent humility he would continue to teach and to cleanse them. He would to the final hour\u2014and beyond\u2014be their sustaining servant. As John wrote, who was there and watched the wonder of it all, \u201cHaving loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29432\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29432)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29432)\">John 13:1<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/he-loved-them-unto-the-end.p9\" class=\"\">So it had been, and so it was to be\u2014through the night, and through the pain, and forever.

And he left them to do what only he could do. The Light of the World stepped away from human company and entered the garden grove to wrestle with the prince of darkness alone.

What of Christ\u2019s sleep? What of his fatigue? What rest or slumber will sustain him through such an agonizing ordeal? That is simply not his concern here, nor does it ever seem to be. He will endure. He will triumph. He will not falter nor fail us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/he-loved-them-unto-the-end.p15\" class=\"\">Even in crucifixion he would reign with the benevolence and bearing of a King.

And to the penitent thief at his side he gently promises paradise. To his beloved mother he is unable to make any caring gesture with his hands.
