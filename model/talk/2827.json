To them, to Elder Richards and the members of the First Quorum of the Seventy I pledge that my little footnote on the page of the quorum\u2019s history will read clearly that I wore out my life in helping to spread Jesus\u2019 gospel and helping to regulate his church. To worthy predecessor presidents, my admiration. Thirty years ago President Dilworth Young ordained me a seventy, but only after extracting a promise that I would preach the gospel the rest of my life. His stern demeanor was such that I felt I\u2019d been asked to jump off a tall building. I went over the side saluting. Now I salute that same selfless, sweet seventy, President Young, once again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/notwithstanding-my-weakness.p4\" class=\"\">Now may I speak, not to the slackers in the Kingdom, but to those who carry their own load and more; not to those lulled into false security, but to those buffeted by false insecurity, who, though laboring devotedly in the Kingdom, have recurring feelings of falling forever short.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/notwithstanding-my-weakness.p5\" class=\"\">Earlier disciples who heard Jesus preach some exacting doctrines were also anxious and said, \u201cWho then can be saved?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125031\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125031)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125031)\">Mark 10:26<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/notwithstanding-my-weakness.p6\" class=\"\">The first thing to be said of this feeling of inadequacy is that it is normal. There is no way the Church can honestly describe where we must yet go and what we must yet do without creating a sense of immense distance.
