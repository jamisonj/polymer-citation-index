Crowell Co., 1960). In his book Dr. Blanton explains how for forty years he had used great ideas to heal people of their emotional difficulties and psychiatric problems. These ideas were not all in poetic form. He also used the great scriptures, the great prose, and the great hymns.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-poetry-of-success.p4\" class=\"\">I suppose this healing power of the psychiatrist might be related to the practice of a medical doctor who writes prescriptions for people to be filled not at drugstores but at bookstores, for he has discovered that there is frequently more healing power in books than in bottles. A mother heals the bumps and bruises of her children by her caresses and her loving expressions of sympathy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-poetry-of-success.p5\" class=\"\">As I meditated upon these healing procedures, I tried to understand some of the things that Jesus may have had in mind when he said, \u201cPhysician, heal thyself.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32006\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32006)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32006)\">Luke 4:23<\/a><\/span>.) And I think he was giving us the detail of one method for handling this healing power when he instructed Emma Smith to make a selection of the inspiring hymns to be regularly run through our minds and hearts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-poetry-of-success.p6\" class=\"\">I recently went to the library and obtained a copy of this little book, which I hold in my hand, which is a compilation of the ninety hymns selected by Emma Smith for our benefit. (<span class=\"emphasis\">A Collection of Sacred Hymns, for the Church of the Latter Day Saints,<\/span> Kirtland, Ohio: F. G. Williams and Co., 1835. Available on microfilm in the Church Historical Department, Salt Lake City.) And because each of us has a different set of needs and a different set of interests, it seems to me that each one of us ought to make his own selection of hymns and then see to it that each one is thoroughly memorized and enthusiastically appreciated so that we may get the maximum from their healing message as well as their growing and saving power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-poetry-of-success.p7\" class=\"\">William James, the great Harvard psychologist, once asked this question, how would you like to create your own mind? But isn\u2019t that about what usually happens? Professor James explains that the mind is made up by what it feeds upon. He said that the mind, like the dyer\u2019s hand, is colored by what it holds. If I hold in my hand a sponge full of purple dye, my hand becomes purple. And if I hold in my mind and heart great ideas of faith and enthusiasm, my whole personality is changed accordingly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-poetry-of-success.p8\" class=\"\">If we think negative thoughts, we develop negative minds. If we think depraved thoughts, we develop depraved minds. On the other hand, if we think celestial thoughts, which are the kind of thoughts that God thinks, then we develop celestial minds and fulfill the meditation of Edward Dyer when he wrote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">My mind to me a kingdom is,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Such present joys therein I find,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">That it excels all other bliss<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">That earth affords or grows by kind.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-poetry-of-success.p13\" class=\"\">(\u201cMy Mind to Me a Kingdom Is,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Poet\u2019s Gold,<\/span> comp.

Recently a bereaved couple came into my office to tell me about their little three-year-old daughter who, without warning, died suddenly before their eyes. Of course the parents were heartbroken. They had shed many tears but their pain had not gone away, and they wanted to release their tensions by talking with someone. We all understand that we can heal others by listening sympathetically to an expression of their grief. It helped me to help them by remembering that as a very young man I sat at the bedside of my little seven-year-old sister, whom I loved very much, while she died of diphtheria.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-poetry-of-success.p15\" class=\"\">The mother of this other little girl felt that there could be nothing quite so terrible as for her beautiful little daughter to die almost before she had begun to live. And I could understand her pain. But finally I said to her, \u201cSister Jones, if you think it would help, I think I can tell you something that would be worse than your present trouble.\u201d She said, \u201cIf you know of anything worse, I would like to hear about it.\u201d So I recited for her James Whitcomb Riley\u2019s poem entitled \u201cBereaved.\u201d This was not the bereavement of one whose child had died, it was the bereavement of one who had no children.
