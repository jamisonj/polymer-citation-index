We are the ones with the special opportunity of helping build His kingdom once again. I offer prayers of gratitude that I have any part in this work which has been spoken of for centuries by many prophets and the Lord Himself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/establishing-the-church.p7\" class=\"\">Establishing His Church is a unique assignment. We must take the gospel of Jesus Christ to all people in their own language without defiling the purity of the message. The Church must help develop leaders of integrity, leaders from whom honest people everywhere can receive inspired guidance. The Church has an equal obligation for all who have lived, who now live, and for those who will yet live on this earth. The Church must teach correct laws and ordinances, in the Lord\u2019s way, which qualify the obedient believer for eternal life. There are many other requirements familiar to us that make the task of establishing such a church seem overwhelming, but such is the assignment from the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/establishing-the-church.p8\" class=\"\">And how is such a church established? On a much smaller scale, I know what it takes to build a beautiful temple, and it is more than detailed plans or quality materials. It requires skillful workers in every part of the process, each one doing his best work in a united effort. I also know that the leadership of an inspired prophet is vital in building lovely temples, as it is in every other part of this great work. I dearly cherish the special opportunities I have had to see inspiration and the Spirit of the Lord flow through President Hinckley. He is truly a prophet for this time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/establishing-the-church.p9\" class=\"\">As in building temples, dedicated workers are a necessary part of establishing the Lord\u2019s kingdom on earth. The work moves well if each one has a driving conviction in his heart and mind that Jesus Christ is the head of this Church, that He truly lives and guides this work, and that all of us have an important part in bringing it to pass. We must be willing to learn gospel principles and practice them, and pray about them with sincere hearts, with real intent and having faith in Christ. Then comes the assurance that the principles are true. And with true conversion comes an excitement about being part of this great work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/establishing-the-church.p10\" class=\"\">It is an interesting thought that the Lord has declared this is the time to establish His Church, and then to realize it happens as each of us develops a firm, unwavering testimony of the truthfulness of its precepts. The Church can build temples, send missionaries throughout the world, and do marvelous humanitarian acts, but it still comes to what exists in our own thoughts and feelings and actions as to how solidly it is established. Will the good news of the gospel be shared with our neighbors? Will new converts be warmly fellowshipped? Will the temples be filled with dedicated patrons doing work for their ancestry? Will families learn to live on a celestial level, all because we have a pure love for our Father in Heaven, His teachings, and His children?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/establishing-the-church.p11\" class=\"\">President Kimball declared the kingdom of God that we seek to establish \u201ccan only be done through consistent and concerted daily effort by every single member of the Church.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-98911_000_032\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cBecoming the Pure in Heart,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1978, 81.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/establishing-the-church.p12\" class=\"\">The wonderful part is that every person devoted to the establishment of the latter-day Church of Jesus Christ receives innumerable and eternal blessings.

A sweet assurance of what is truth comes into our lives. We will sense we are an important part of an eternal cause. We will truly enjoy the leadership of a wonderful prophet and other great leaders. Our lives can be filled with the peace of the Lord and the benefit of having His Church solidly established on this earth.
