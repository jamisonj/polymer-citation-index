If it be from heaven, as we testify, and have testified ever since the rise of the Church, then the Lord our God has manifested His power, and in His mercy has once more bestowed authority upon the children of men to administer His holy ordinances, and to occupy the positions to which we have severally been called. On the other hand, if the views of the world are correct&#x2014;they do not consider us to have any authority&#x2014;we are then on <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"27b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD22\/JoD22_0027.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;27b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8349\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> the same ground and platform with the rest of the religious world, there is no authority upon the earth. One or the other is true. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v22n84\"> There never was a principle more clearly proven than that the inhabitants of the earth are destitute of all divine authority, among all religious denominations, whether Pagan, Mahometan or so-called Christian; the authority cannot be found throughout all the various denominations that have existed through the long period of time called the dark ages, until the Lord, in His mercy, has organized His Church again on the earth and bestowed that authority, and if He has not done it, as the world say He has not, there are no persons upon this whole earth that have any authority from the heavens; and therefore we are just as well off as the balance of them. <\/div> <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"28a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD22\/JoD22_0028.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;28a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8348\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v22n86\"> We are not indebted to man for the various authorities in this Church; this is our testimony. Man did not commence this work, man is not the originator of this work, neither is he the origin of the authority by which we administer. The Lord did not see proper to organize the authority of this Church all at once in all the various councils and authorities that, from time to time, have been ordained among this people; it was a gradual work. Authority was bestowed before there was any Church. First (not the authority of the Priesthood) but the authority to bring forth the plates of the Book of Mormon, and to translate them by the Urim and Thummim, by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. This was the first authority conferred upon the one whom the Lord chose to commence this great work. The authority of the Priesthood was not conferred upon him at that time, but He revealed unto him concerning the everlasting Gospel contained in the ancient records kept by the Nephites, or Israelites, upon this great Western Continent. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v22n87\"> Joseph Smith, when he translated these records by the aid of the Urim and Thummim, had not yet received any Priesthood, so far as his temporal existence was concerned. But now, do not misunderstand me in regard to this position. He did hold the Priesthood before he came here upon the earth. I remarked that Joseph, so far as any ordination here in the flesh was concerned, held no Priesthood at the time that he brought forth the plates of the Book of Mormon and translated them; but he did hold the Priesthood, which was conferred upon him in the councils of eternity, before this world was formed. You will find this recorded in a sermon delivered by the Prophet Joseph, showing that not only he, <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"28b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD22\/JoD22_0028.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;28b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8348\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> but also all of the faithful that have received the Priesthood here in this life, were ordained before the foundation of the world.

Said He to the Church in the State of New York, in the General Conference, through the mouth of His servant Joseph, in a revelation given on the 2nd day of January, 1831, He said, Let my Church in this land flee out from the State of New York; let them go westward to the land of Kirtland, and join my people in the State of Ohio; let them do this immediately, lest their enemies come upon them, etc.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"85179\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 85179)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(85179)\">D&amp;C 38:31-32<\/a><\/span> The Lord understood what was in the hearts of the enemies of His people; He understood what they were doing in their secret councils, in their secret chambers to bring to pass the destruction of the Latter-day Saints that were in the States of New York and Pennsylvania.
