I\nwish also to express gratitude for your uplifted hands and your sustaining vote. I hope that\nwhat I shall say will not detract in any way from the beautiful truths that have been given to\nus already in this conference, particularly with reference to the pioneers. My grandfather was\none of the original group to enter this valley. I am proud that his statue will grace the new\nmonument with Wilford Woodruff and his file leader, Brigham Young.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE FORMER INHABITANTS OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT\n<\/p><p>\nI have been thinking today also, of the pioneers, but of other pioneers who preceded the ones\nwe have been honoring today. About twenty-five centennials ago, a hardy group left the\ncomforts of a great city, crossed a desert, braved an ocean, and came to the shores of this,\ntheir promised land. There were two large families, those of Lehi and Ishmael, who in not\nmany centuries, numbered hundreds of millions of people on these two American continents.\nTheir scriptures and records taught them of God. They had many blessings, and many\npromises. They were given, by the creator of this land, a clear title to the Americas&mdash;a\ncertificate of title, free and clear of all encumbrance. There was, however, one condition:\nThey must serve the Lord their God if they were to retain title to the property. Their\nwickedness brought on wars, which scattered and destroyed them and divided them into two\nfactions, the Nephites and Lamanites, and finally they peopled the continents. The years went\napace; the Savior came to them after his resurrection&mdash;which glorious event we are celebrating\ntoday, this Easter day. The Savior so inspired them that for twice the period of our own\nChurch history they were righteous and were devoted to their Heavenly Father. And then\ncame prosperity and wealth. The sins of the world overtook them, and for about one hundred\nand seventy years, both factions were wicked, very wicked indeed, until the\ngreat battle on Cumorah when the Nephites were literally destroyed. The Prophet Mormon\nrecounted two hundred and thirty thousand people lying in their blood in death, and this\nbecause of their wickedness. Their enemies had been permitted to come upon them. Mormon\nexclaims:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd my soul was rent with anguish because of the slain of my people, and I cried:\n<\/p><p>\nO ye fair ones, how could ye have departed from the ways of the Lord! O ye fair\nones, how could ye have rejected that Jesus, who stood with open arms to receive\nyou!\n<\/p><p>\nBehold, if ye had not done this, ye would not have fallen\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37951\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37951)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37951)\">Morm. 6:16-18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe penalty for their wickedness was that they were to be scattered and driven, cursed and\nscourged. They were to be \"cut off from the presence of the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1464\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1464)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1464)\">1 Ne. 2:21<\/a><\/span>).

I will cause that they shall be loathsome unto thy people . . .\n<\/p><p>\nAnd cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed; . . .\n<\/p><p>\n. . . they did become an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3481\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3481)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3481)\">2 Ne. 5:21-24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAPPRECIATION FOR THE DESCENDANTS OF LEHI\n<\/p><p>\nI do not know when I began to love the children of Lehi. It may have come to me at birth,\nbecause those years preceding and after I was born, were spent by my father on missions\namong the Indians in Indian territory. He was president of the mission. This love may have\ncome in those first years of my childhood, when my father used to sing the Indian chants to\nus children and show us souvenirs from and pictures of his Indian friends. It may have come\nfrom my patriarchal blessing which was given to me by Patriarch Samuel Claridge, when I\nwas nine years of age. One line of the blessing reads:\n<\/p><p>\nYou will preach the gospel to many people, but more especially to the Lamanites,\nfor the Lord will bless you with the gift of language and power to portray before\nthat people, the gospel in great plainness. You will see them organized and be\nprepared to stand as the bulwark \"round this people.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI do not know when my appreciation for them came, but I have always had a sympathetic\nheart for the sons and daughters of Lehi, and so, recently, when President Smith called\nBrother Cowley, Brother Ivins, and myself to give attention to their problems and to\n<\/p><p>\n. . . the work of disseminating the gospel among the Indians . . . not only to the\nIndians close to us but also over the world, in the islands of the sea and elsewhere\n. . . a great thrill came to me such as I have had few times in my life.\n<\/p><p>\nFULFILMENT OF A PATRIARCHAL BLESSING\n<\/p><p>\nI had waited forty-two years for the fulfilment of this patriarchal blessing! When I was called\nto the mission field in 1914, my assignment was to the Swiss-German Mission, and then the\nwar broke out and prevented my going there, and I was sent to the Central States Mission. I\nknew there were no Indians in Switzerland and Germany. I knew also there were Indians in\nthe Central States Mission, but in all my two years' mission, I had not seen an Indian. I\nwondered, \"Can I have failed, or did the patriarch err,\" and now, forty-two years after the\npromise, President George Albert Smith called me to this mission, and my blessing was\nfulfilled.\n<\/p><p>\nI love those downtrodden and deprived people. Brother Cowley and I spent some time on the\nHawaiian Islands last summer, and those good people found their way into my heart. We have\nabout a half-million children of Lehi in the islands of the sea, and about sixty million of them\nin North and South America, about a third of them perhaps, being pure-blood Indians, and\nabout two-thirds are mixtures, but they have the blood of Jacob in their veins.\n<\/p><p>\nSomeone said:\n<\/p><p>\nIf my pen might have the gift of tears I would write a book and call it \"The Indian,\" and I\nwould make the whole world weep.\n<\/p><p>\nI hope I may help to make the whole world weep for the children of Lehi. Can one refrain\nfrom tears as he contemplates the fall of these people who have been brought down from\nculture and achievement to illiteracy and degradation; from kings and emperors, to slavery\nand serfdom; from landowners of vast continents, to indigent wards of governments and\npeons&mdash;from sons of God with a knowledge of God, to rude savages, victims of superstition,\nand from builders of temples to dwellers in dirt hogans.\n<\/p><p>\nMIGRATION OF NEPHITES TO PACIFIC ISLES\n<\/p><p>\nThe predictions concerning the scattering of the early American was fulfilled to the letter. Not\nlong before the birth of Christ, a great man by the name of Hagoth left continental America\nwith colonies of people. He\n<\/p><p>\n. . . went forth and built him an exceedingly large ship . . . and launched it forth into the west\nsea . . . \n<\/p><p>\nAnd behold, there were many of the Nephites who did . . . sail forth with much\nprovisions, and also many women and children; and they took their course\nnorthward.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the next year:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . this man built other ships, And the first ship did also return, and many more people did\nenter into it; . . . and set out again to the land northward.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it came to pass that they were never heard of more . . . And . . . one other ship also did\nsail forth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8857\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8857)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8857)\">Alma 63:5-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt has been thought by many people that they went to the Pacific islands. And the scripture\nwould so indicate:\n<\/p><p>\nBut great are the promises of the Lord unto them who are upon the isles of the\nsea; wherefore as it says isles, there must needs be more than this, and they are\ninhabited also by our brethren (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3483\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3483)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3483)\">2 Ne. 10:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nElder Cowley and I visited some of these peoples on the \"isles of the sea\" and found them\ndeveloping and progressing and doing well.\n<\/p><p>\nBut we are not so fortunate here at home in the United States. There are some bad conditions\nin our own nation and continent.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE SAD STORIES OF THE CRUELTIES OF THE SPANISH CONQUERORS\n<\/p><p>\nThe conquerors came and robbed and despoiled and destroyed. The battle of America, a\nfour-hundred-year struggle began with the discovery of America and ended not until the\nowners were dispossessed of nearly everything they had owned. Cortez with a handful of\nsoldiers came into Mexico and through deceit and misrepresentation was able to conquer\nthirty million people. Preying upon their superstitions and beliefs in the return of the Fair\nGod, he gained access to their beautiful city, took their lives, carried off their treasures and\ndesecrated their homes and temples. He gave them a soldier's helmet which they brought back\nto him full of gold nuggets. They laid at his feet great quantities of gold and silver, jewels,\nand other priceless treasures. These valuables seemed only to whet his appetite, and he\nsacked their chests and vaults for more. His soldiers closed the three exits to the courtyard at\nCholula, it is written, and with his mystery weapon, the cannon, massacred them by the\nthousands. And in their loved city of Tenochtitlan his soldiers were permitted to profane the\ntemples with the very blood of the Indians who were slaughtered in great numbers. The Aztec\nking was tortured and assassinated. It is a sad story how they were despoiled and dispossessed\nof their rich homeland&mdash;how whole valleys together with thousands of the Indians for servants,\nwere granted to individual Spanish conquerors. The Aztecs were enslaved and branded. The\nhistory of Mexico claims that in 1800 though \". . . only ten percent of the population was\nSpanish, but almost all the property belongs to them.\" And even after the slaves were\npresumably freed, their condition of servitude as peons for centuries following, was nearly as\ndistasteful and onerous. The millions of Indians could literally have\nsmothered the invaders with their very bodies, but it was not to be. For the prophecies had to\nbe fulfilled.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE INDIANS A DOWNTRODDEN RACE\n<\/p><p>\nThat is a gloomy picture, but the world should weep also at the treatment of the real\nAmericans in our own states. As the colonists came from Europe and settled along the Eastern\nseaboard, the great \"push\" continued. Mile by mile we crowded them back. When the Indians\nresisted our encroachments, we called them \"murderous redskins\" and continued our relentless\naggression. When they killed us \"whites,\" we called it a massacre, but when we took their\nlives, we termed it a necessary riddance of a menace. We were fighting for their lands and\nrivers and forests and minerals, but they were fighting for their rights, their homeland, their\nfamilies, their very lives.\n<\/p><p>\nI would not justify any evil that the Indians ever did, but can we not see that they were on the\ndefensive, fighting for their liberty, for independence and to perpetuate their rights to the\npromised land to which they had title from the Creator?\n<\/p><p>\nBut the laws had been broken. They had forfeited their rights because they had failed to keep\nthe commands of God. The prophecies must be fulfilled, and the plan of God must now be\nconsummated. It was necessary, for the ultimate good of the Indian himself, that the Gentiles\nmust come from foreign shores to become \"nursing fathers\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25063\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25063)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25063)\">Isa. 49:23<\/a><\/span>) to these benighted people; the\nPilgrims and Puritans had to come to settle this land; the Revolutionary War had to be fought\nand won so that peace and freedom and liberty could be established here, and so that the\ngospel could be restored, and this that the record of the ancestors of the Indians might come\nforth, and the gospel of Jesus Christ be made plain to them.\n<\/p><p>\nThe prophecies were being fulfilled by us Gentiles. We pushed the natives ever westward\nuntil the Pacific stopped their further movement in that direction. Then we crowded them into\nthe corners and upon reservations, ofttimes territory of little value. The country became\ncrowded, and we pushed southward, this time making war on Mexico, a Lamanite country.\nAgain we used might, and subdued and took from the original Lehite owners and also from\nMexico, the new claimants, the great territory of the southwest, including much of the states\nof Arizona, New Mexico, California, Utah, Wyoming, and Nevada. We did pay for this vast\nempire, some fifteen million dollars, which is the approximate present value of the one little\nGila valley in Arizona where I lived for so many years. We later paid ten million dollars for\nanother area involving a considerable portion of Arizona, known as the Gadsden Purchase.\n<\/p><p>\nWe went relentlessly on in our battle of aggression until we finally were undisputed\nconquerors of this expansive domain, so rich in natural wealth.\n<\/p><p>\nTROUBLES MULTIPLIED THROUGH INJUSTICE\n<\/p><p>\nDown near Lordsburg, New Mexico, there is an unpretentious monument. On it are the words,\n\"Here Geronimo surrendered, thus ending Indian wars in America forever.\" The final war of\nself-defense was waged in the southwest by the Apache chief, the courageous Geronimo. He\nled his thirty-four warriors with their wives and children against the United States army. And\nthe battle of America lasting four hundred years had ended. We battled but a few short years\nfor our independence from Britain and were rewarded with success. The Indians fought\nvaliantly four centuries for their freedom and lost. This proud people was reduced from\nwealth to poverty; from two vast continents to crowded reservations. We hail George\nWashington as the great patriot because he led us successfully against our aggressors. And\nbecause they cannot, we erect a tiny monument to mark the spot where the last survivor chief\nwas subdued while resisting our aggression. It is a sad story. Let the world weep.\n<\/p><p>\nBut there were still some outbreaks. Because of the chaotic condition and the hopelessness of\ntheir situation, some groups of natives continued to commit depredations against the new\nalleged owners of their properties. The Navajos were in the way also. We sent our army\nagainst them. We tracked them into the mountains and canyons of northern Arizona and killed\nthem in great numbers: they claim we killed their sheep numbering fifty thousand; we\ndestroyed all their thousands of peach trees, in <i>Canyon de Chelly<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>\nOur war against them was relentless. The ultimatum was surrender by July 20, 1863, or\nextermination.\n<\/p><p>\nOrders were given to kill every male Navajo capable of bearing arms, wherever\nhe may be found. Women and children were to be captured and held as prisoners.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then to Colonel Riggs came these instructions:\n<\/p><p>\nI have been informed that there is a spring called <i>Ojo de Cibolo<\/i> . . . where the\nNavajos drive their stolen cattle and \"jerk\" the flesh at their leisure. Cannot you\nmake arrangements for a party of resolute men from your command to be\nstationed there for say, thirty days, and kill every Navajo and Apache they can\nfind? A cautious, wary commander hiding his men and moving about at night\nmight kill off a good many Indians near that point.\n<\/p><p>\nA bounty of twenty dollars was placed on a good Indian horse, and a dollar for a sheep.\n<\/p><p>\nWe did an efficient job of it. The Indians claimed later that they did not know they had an\noption to surrender; they thought that they were the victims of an\nextermination order, and not till they were starved out did they finally raise the flag of truce.\nWe took them over into New Mexico on a reservation and after four years of starvation and\nfreezing and hopelessness for them we imposed upon them a treaty. They were to commit no\nmore depredations and were to be given that vast area of territory of little value. They were to\nreceive some small allowances. They were to require their children to go to the schools, and\nwe were to furnish them a school, and a teacher for every thirty children. If you could go\nwith me to the reservation and hear these Navajo parents plead for schools for their children,\nyou would realize how greatly we have failed to live up to our part of that treaty of 1868.\nThere are more than twenty-four thousand children of school age, but with all the government\nschools, plus those schools operated by churches, only about 5,100 of the little folk can hope\nto get into a school. The nearly 19,000 children yearn in vain for schooling. In September,\nambitious parents send these little ones long, rugged miles, to a school building, only to find\nit filled to capacity, or to find it locked for want of repair or a teacher. Back of these long\nrugged miles, even longer now, they trudge home to wait another year, still hoping for better\nluck next time. There is a big backlog with many thousands of children and adults who have\nnever had a day of school, and unless we change our policy, these defrauded people in the\nheart of this rich and educated nation, will still be illiterate fifty years hence. The median\nschool year for the Navajo is .9 of a year, as compared to 5.7 years for the average Indian\nand 8.4 years for our own children. The records reveal that while 3.7 percent of us have had\nno schooling, and 25.2 percent of the Indians in general have had none, there are sixty-six\npercent of the Navajos who have never had such opportunity. Illiteracy is reported to be about\nseventy-five percent among the Navajos while the United States negro is only 16.1 percent\nand we United States whites are 1.5 percent illiterate. When we speak of educated Indians, we\ndo not mean those with degrees but those who can read and write. Of one hundred ninety-five\nliterate, \"educated\" Navajos surveyed, only sixteen had more than eighth grade training. To\ntake care of the children on the reservation it would require twelve five-hundred-pupil high\nschools. There is not a single one available. The tribal leaders say:\n<\/p><p>\nA PLEA FOR SCHOOLS FOR CHILDREN\n<\/p><p>\nWhy? Why can we not have schools? We cooperate always. We reduce our sheep\nwhen we are told we have too many. We do everything. But all they do is to close\nour school.\n<\/p><p>\nIn Tolani area there are six hundred school children with one little school building which\nmight accommodate sixty, but even it is closed. At Tohatchi, New Mexico, is a large school\nplant with school buildings, dormitories, residences, hospital, but for five years it has been\nclosed. The officials say there is no appropriation to repair and fit it for\nschool purposes. At Aneth, Utah, are 1,500 Navajos. They beg for a teacher for the one little\nclosed school there. At Sheep Springs the Indians called a mass meeting and wrote us:\n<\/p><p>\n. . .We want a Mormon school here so our children will get good education by you Mormons.\nThe government cannot take care of us all.\n<\/p><p>\nOne group came to the superintendent and asked; \"Can't you help us build a school?\" The\nsuperintendent said he was sorry, but \"there is no money for lumber, doors, windows, nails,\nroofing.\" So the Indians collected one hundred dollars for materials and with old lumber and\nlogs built themselves a building, then begged for a teacher to train their children. The appeals\nof these untaught people cause one to weep in sympathy. They wrote:\n<\/p><p>\nOur little children beg us to go to school, but there is none for them. We cannot\nvote. We do not have influence with congressmen. We pay taxes and send our\nsons to war. The United States Congress makes big treaties with other countries\nand makes big loans, but not once in history has it observed the sacred treaty of\n1868 to give us schools.\n<\/p><p>\nEven under most unfavorable conditions of roads and long distances and cold weather, the\nattendance of the children is eighty percent to ninety percent. In our little school at Blanding,\nIndian mothers kneel at the desk of their little ones and urge them on in their learning.\n<\/p><p>\nPITIABLE CONDITIONS\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord had promised the sons of Lehi:\n<\/p><p>\nThey shall prosper in the land of promise if . . .\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1465\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1465)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1465)\">1 Ne. 4:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBut little prosperity has come to the Navajo and little can come until we Gentiles, their\n\"nursing fathers\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25064\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25064)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25064)\">Isa. 49:23<\/a><\/span>),\nhelp to train them. Though they have sixteen million acres of land, it is of\nsuch barrenness that it takes about one hundred sixty acres to support a horse. Of seven\nthousand three hundred livestock owners only about one hundred have an economic unit. The\naverage of seven sheep, a half-acre of land and the little they can make from rug weaving and\nsilversmithing and incidentals, will bring about eighty dollars a year, or $1.50 a week,\nincome, for each person.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is estimated that the Navajo woman makes about three cents to seven cents an hour at her\nweaving and the silversmith makes little more. During the war the allotments from the three\nthousand six hundred service boys gave the tribesmen some financial relief, but now they are\nreduced again to their starvation incomes.\n<\/p><p>\nThe health conditions are deplorable. They have but one full-time dentist for sixty-three\nthousand people and no field nurse or doctor, though they should have\ntwenty-five or thirty of each to even approach rural standards. The birth rate is high, but the\ndeath rate is also very high, being sixteen per thousand as against 10.5 for the nation and 6.36\nfor the Church. The large family lives in the dirt hogan being one small circular room with\ndirt floor, no windows, and with a stove or fire in the center. All members of the family sleep\non sheep pelts on the floor. There is no privacy, practically no furniture or equipment. There\nare no sanitary conveniences inside or out. With a single towel, a common cup, no hot water\nnor disinfectants, it is easy to see why trachoma, impetigo, and other skin diseases run\nthrough the family, and why dysentery, venereal diseases, and tuberculosis run rampant. In a\nsurvey of thirty-one families it was found that three in each family had tuberculosis. In their\nscattered condition, and with such limited hospital facilities, many lie in their hogans,\ncoughing in the air, spitting on the floor, to finally die on the ground floor without medical\nassistance. Their numerous superstitions bind them down. The use of peyote is increasing, and\nits demoralizing opiate effect is most destructive. The Indians have learned all the white\nman's vices, and liquor is \"at flood stage\" there. And thus they live without the power to raise\nthemselves from the deplorable situation. They cannot lift themselves by their bootstraps.\nThey must have help. They realize it. The late chairman of the tribal council epitomized their\nthinking when he said:\n<\/p><p>\nWe are a ward of the people&mdash;that means we are slaves. They chase us down . . . with a gun .\n. . to Ft. Sumner.\n<\/p><p>\n\"WEEP AND PRAY FOR THE INDIAN\"\n<\/p><p>\nHow I wish you could go with me through the Indian reservations and particularly Navajo\nLand and see the poverty, want, and wretchedness, and realize again that these are sons and\ndaughters of God; that their miserable state is the result, not only of their centuries of wars\nand sins and godlessness, but is also attributable to us, their conquerors, who placed them on\nreservations with such limited resources and facilities, to starve and die of malnutrition and\nunsanitary conditions, while we become fat in the prosperity from the assets we took from\nthem. Think of these things, my people, and then weep for the Indian, and with your tears,\npray; then work for him. Only through us, the \"nursing fathers and mothers\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25065\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25065)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25065)\">Isa. 49:23<\/a><\/span>), may they\neventually enjoy a fulfilment of the many promises made to them. Assuming that we do our\nduty to them, the Indians and other sons of Lehi will yet rise in power and strength. The Lord\nwill remember his covenant to them; his Church will be established among them; the Bible\nand other scriptures will be made available to them; they will enter into the holy temples for\ntheir endowments and do vicarious work; they will come to a knowledge of their fathers and\nto a perfect knowledge of their Redeemer Jesus Christ; they shall prosper in\nthe land and will, with our help, build up a holy city, even the New Jerusalem, unto their\nGod.\n<\/p><p>\nOnly in our doing all in our power to restore these people to their heritage can we even\napproach a justification for having taken their promised land. May the Lord assist us all to see\nour full duty respecting these people and give us the courage and determination to guarantee\nthat they have the education, culture, security, and all other advantages and luxuries that we\nenjoy&mdash;I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
