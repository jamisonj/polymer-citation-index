It is also a great responsibility. It\noccurred to me as I was listening to the speakers today that there is much encouragement and\nmuch inspiration in the history of this Church. I recall many years ago of hearing Elder James\nE. Talmage deliver a baccalaureate sermon. In his sermon he said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"The Mormon pioneers\nwere well nigh perfect in the work which they did.\" He also said that their program was\nconstructive throughout, and that they laid a solid foundation for that part of the vineyard\nwhich has been planted in the heart of these Rocky Mountains.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the month of July 1847, Brigham Young looked into the Salt Lake Valley and\nremarked: \"This is the place.\" After the lapse of 115 years you and I know he was right. It is\nstill the place. It is the best place on the earth for the Church to grow, develop, and expand,\nand to direct its activities in the process of building up God's kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure Brigham Young had no doubts nor misgivings as he made that famous declaration,\nfor the work of colonization had already commenced. Fields were being plowed and irrigated.\nCrops were planted, and homes provided. Scarcely a week had passed before he had\ndesignated the very spot where a temple was to be built and where it now stands. \"Here we\nwill build a temple to our God,\" he said. Do you catch the significance of that statement?\n<\/p><p>\nThere was so much to do to provide the material comfort for his people and for all those who\nwere to follow. Ordinarily his chief concern would be for the physical well-being of these\npeople. They were in a desert land. The hard and stern reality was before them. They could\nnot return, for they had nowhere to go. By every law of probability they should have perished\nin the desert country, and yet this prophet-leader thought first about the spiritual welfare of\nthose who were to come. I can think of nothing on the pages of history to match it.\n<\/p><p>\nBrigham Young knew that no people can endure permanently without God. Nations crumble\nand fall when they ignore the standards and the concepts by which they arose to power and\ninfluence. President Young's ambition was to lay a solid foundation that would not corrode\nnor disintegrate; but what was the situation when he undertook to lay this foundation? Where\nwere the Saints? Where was the body of the Church? They were scattered from the British\nIsles to the Great Basin in the Rocky Mountains.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the year 1847 closed there were approximately 10,000 church members in England; 2,000\nin Scotland; and 4,160 scattered on a world-wide basis. The church population in the Great\nSalt Lake Valley was about 2,000, and between 5,000 and 13,000 were at Winter Quarters in\nNebraska, and between 2,000 and 4,000 in the various settlements in Iowa. Less than 200\nremained in Nauvoo, and between 200 and 300 in the city of St. Louis, Missouri. There were\nbetween 7,000 and 13,000 scattered throughout the eastern and the southern states, and 2,000\nin the Society [Tahitian] Islands.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Mormon Battalion numbering 200 were stationed in San Diego and Sutter's Mill. The\nchurch membership in 1847 was approximately 40,000 souls. Most of them were headed for\nthe Rocky Mountains, the place of gathering in fulfillment of prophecy, for according to\nMicah: \". . . in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the Lord\nshall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and\npeople shall flow unto it\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37889\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37889)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37889)\">Micah 4:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Latter-day Saints, no matter where they were, knew they were a chosen people. Their\nmovement westward was not an accident. The Prophet Joseph Smith had referred to the West\nwhen he prophesied that the Saints would become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky\nMountains.\n<\/p><p>\nWe need only review the history of the Church to feel the importance of what was done in\nthose early days. These daring, venturesome men and women believed in God. They\nworshiped him in spirit and in truth. In the desert, coming and going, they had time to think\nand pray and to appraise their new faith and make comparisons with all they had left behind.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so they laid a foundation that makes for permanency. Again I say the pioneer movement\nwas not a venture. It was a directed movement, God-inspired and sustained by an over-ruling\nprovidence. It was a search for freedom, where sincere and honest men could worship God in\ntheir own way.\n<\/p><p>\nMay that freedom be preserved in this land of America and wherever there is a liberty-loving\npeople, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
