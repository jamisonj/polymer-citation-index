Evans, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1958, pp. 58-60<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy beloved brethren and sisters, in that spirit of prayer of which President Clark spoke so\nbeautifully this morning, I pray that I may be given utterance to say that which would best be\nsaid in this place and at this time.\n<\/p><p>\nI think to those of you who have heard what has preceded at this conference, it must be\nsomewhat apparent that there has been a considerable and, I think, significant emphasis and\nreaffirmation of the principle of revelation, of continuous revelation&mdash;or at least it has\nseemed so to me, as I have sat and listened with you.\n<\/p><p>\nThere were some events associated with the dedication of the London Temple which I should\nlike to relate, also. Our President went there, and we had arranged a press conference for him\non the late afternoon following what was to have been the morning of his arrival, thinking\nthat he would have time for rest and still time to face that arduous task. But\nhis plane was three hours late, or more. He had been up all the night before with those who\naccompanied him, President and Sister Smith and Brother Reiser, and there was no time for\nrest; and he faced that battery of some thirty or forty newsmen representing the great London\ndailies and others of the British Empire and the wire services, and the BBC television camera.\n<\/p><p>\nThey pressed many questions, difficult and sometimes tenacious and penetrating questions, as\nis the function of alert and seasoned newsmen.  He met them forthrightly, with some\ndeclarations of affirmation as to things we would know and how we could be assured of\nknowing them. They were respectful, but one always wonders what will happen the morning\nafter when what was said appears in print, with the reporter's personal color or understanding\nor misunderstanding on it.  Some of us worried about it considerably.  I saw the President in\nthe lobby of the hotel that evening and expressed some of my concern, and he made a very\nsignificant statement.  I do not know whether he remembers it or not, but I think I shall not\nforget it.  He said, \"When I have said what I know to be true, I do not worry about the\nconsequences.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis put me in mind of that great statement of the Prophet Micaiah as he declared to Ahab,\nthe king, those things which the Lord God had given him to speak.  The king had previously\nsaid that he hated the prophet because he never prophesied him good, and the prophet replied:\n\"As the Lord liveth, what the Lord saith unto me, that will I speak\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1210\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1210)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1210)\">1 Kgs. 22:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is the burden of the prophets always to speak what the Lord God saith, no matter who likes\nit or who does not, or what one would wish to be the truth. It takes a kind of courage beyond\nwhat most men have reason to reach down for.\n<\/p><p>\nWe might just as well have slept, those of us who didn't sleep so well that night, because the\nnewspapers the next morning were factual and respectful, and none of them that I knew of\nhad reached for the sensational, or the old false representations, that some of us had been\naccustomed to in times gone by.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay's calm and assurance, which is so characteristic of him, was in evidence\nagain (with which calm assurance some of us may have felt he has sent us at times into the\nfiery furnace, but we have never found ourselves scorched, and he has never sent us where he\nwas not willing to walk with us).\n<\/p><p>\nTo hear him six times deliver significant addresses at six of the dedicatory sessions, to hear\nthe repeated notable dedicatory prayer, a meaningful document, inviting attention to the fact\nthat the Magna Charta, 1215 A.D., had been signed in that same County of Surrey where the\ntemple was now being dedicated, was a great privilege and a moving experience.  And to\ncelebrate with him his eighty-fifth birthday in that far land was a sweet occasion that some of\nus will never forget. And long before he arrived, he was with us, many times a day, because\nwe had made a motion picture explaining the purpose of temples, with President McKay's\nvoice and picture in colored film, and as those 76,000 and more visitors came and went into\ntents where this film was being shown, we heard his voice from fifty to one hundred times a\nday as the tents filled and emptied about as fast as the film could be shown.  It was a choice\nand glorious occasion.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, one thing these newsmen wanted to know, some of them, is, \"How do you know?  How\ncan you know some of these things?\"\n<\/p><p>\nDoes it seem a thing strange that the Lord who admittedly had prophets in former days should\nhave them in this day? Does it seem a thing strange that there should be living prophets as\nwell as dead ones?  Does it seem that this people in this time should need less, for these\nchanging times and changing conditions, the interpretation of the everlasting principles and\nstandards, and less need a living voice to help to find the way? Is there less of wilderness in\nour generation and in our world than ever there was?  Or less need for living prophets? Does\nit seem that the Lord would give prophets to one small people in one small place at one\nlimited time, and leave all the rest of his children for all of the rest of time without the living\nwitness of his words, and the interpretation of them according to their own\ntime and day?  Just consistency and reason would seem to suggest living prophets and\ncontinuous revelation without any deep-seated affirmation of it within our souls.\n<\/p><p>\nAs to answering the question of the newsmen, \"How can you know?\" Of course, you can go\nback and read the record.  We invited the attention of some of them to the fact that a prophet\na century and a quarter ago had said that tobacco was not good for man, and that medical\nscience was now affirming it. And they said, \"Then in this respect your prophet was a century\nor so ahead of the findings of medical science.\" And we let them say it.  We did not have to\nsay it for them.\n<\/p><p>\nBut beyond tangible and specific historical evidences, there are things a man can know inside\nhis soul that are beyond the things he can touch and see and rest his feet upon, which are\nundeniable.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd as to those friends to whom President Richards spoke so earnestly yesterday morning, I\nwould witness to them, also, with him, that this in which we are engaged is not merely a\nvocation or a profession, but the dedication of a life to a conviction that cannot be denied.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd as to how one can know: He who does not know cannot know that another man does\nknow, and some things are so certain within the souls of men that they cannot be denied.\n<\/p><p>\nA few days ago President Clark spoke a sentence that I have not been able to forget.  He said,\n\"We are no better than we are.\" It is profound in its simplicity and it leads into many\napplications.  Our positions do not make us better, or do not assure our being better than we\nare.  I know of no generalizations that would save the souls of men. It is the specific\nperformance of specific things that make men better&mdash;not theory, not merely the fact that\nthere is a set of principles or that there are commandments, or that there is counsel, but the\nliving of it.\n<\/p><p>\nI am thinking of the Danish sculptor of great fame, Thorvaldsen, who chose to be buried in\nthe midst of his works&mdash;not in a cathedral or a cemetery, but in a museum among the\nmonuments of his own making&mdash;in the midst of his statuary; and there what he made and\nwhat he did with his life surrounds him.  He did not theorize upon sculpturing, only, but with\nhis hands and with his creative gift he fashioned those things and he lies there in the midst of\nhis works, as we all shall do someday&mdash;and it will not be the theories or the discussions or\nthe speculations or the set of principles or the set of commandments that shall save us. We\nshall be no better than we are.  We are no better than the tithing we pay, no better than the\nteaching we do, no better than the service we give, no better than the commandments we\nkeep, no better than the lives we live, and we shall have a bright remembrance of these things\nand we shall, in a sense, lie down in the midst of what we have done when that time comes,\nand never in my life have I felt more fully to say with all the earnestness of my soul, \"We\nthank thee, O God, for a prophet, to guide us in these latter days.\"\n<\/p><p>\nMy beloved brethren and sisters, may we take counsel with each other. There is safety in\ncounsel: counsel with our children, with the family, with our friends, with our Father in\nheaven, and not attempt to live life alone and to make the decisions alone, but to strengthen\neach other, and encourage each other, and go forward and do what there is to be done and\nfollow the living leadership as the prophet interprets for us the great principles and\ncommandments of all time.\n<\/p><p>\nI thank God for a prophet this day, for an assurance that I am not alone in life, and that you\nare not, that we none of us are, nor are left without inspired leadership.  Thank God for it.\nAnd I leave this witness with you, in the name of him in whose name we do all things, and in\nwhose name we are met, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
