McKay yesterday morning, he offered a\nprayer that we might be inspired and encouraged. Truly his prayer has been answered, for we\nhave been inspired. Our testimonies have been strengthened. We have received encouragement\nto live the words of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay also quoted from the Master wherein he said we should deny ourselves, take\nup our cross daily (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31430\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31430)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31430)\">Luke 9:23<\/a><\/span>),\nand follow him, that we might be able to enjoy life in this mortal\nexistence regardless of its trials or its obstacles.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the limited time afforded me this morning, I should like to suggest one important principle\nof the gospel&mdash;that of temple marriage. If we would follow the Master, we must understand\nthis principle and take advantage of the blessings it offers.\n<\/p><p>\nI would encourage young people to prepare for this glorious experience in the temples of the\nLord by living clean, good lives, by studying and praying, that Satan may have no power to\nkeep them out of the temple. Just as we are dedicated to getting our young folk into the\ntemple, so is Satan dedicated to keeping them out.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to relate three experiences which I trust will stimulate your thinking and\nmotivate some to action.\n<\/p><p>\nWe never know when Satan is at work. It was my privilege a few years ago to witness a\nmarriage ceremony in the temple performed by President McKay. The young people who\nwere being married came from good Latter-day Saint homes where they participated in family\nand individual prayer. To an outsider, it would seem that all was well. Yet, following the\nceremony I overheard the young bride say as she embraced her mother \"Why did I ever think\nof marrying any other way?\" This indicated to me that there was a question in her mind at\none time.\n<\/p><p>\nToo many members of our Church do not understand the principles of temple marriage and\nsuccumb to the wiles of Satan in being satisfied with a civil marriage; or worse still, they do\nnot cherish virtue and are not worthy to go into the temple. This brings me to my second\nstory: \n<\/p><p>\nA lovely Latter-day Saint mother told me of her son who had been taught the principles of\nthe gospel, to respect his body and keep it clean. He was to be married on the morrow in the\ntemple. The evening before the ceremony his friends gave him a party and when he arrived\nhome he tiptoed into his mother's bedroom as had been the custom, regardless of the hour.\nAwakening his mother and sitting upon her bed, he said, \"Mother, I have a confession to\nmake to you tonight.\" For a moment her heart sank. \"I am just as clean tonight as the day you\ngave me birth.\" My, what a dividend to a parent. My child is worthy of temple marriage!\n<\/p><p>\nThe third story is a review of an experience from the life of Brother Matthew Cowley and his\ndear wife Elva. I trust she will forgive me. Matthew and she were working in Washington,\nD.C. They decided to be married there by civil law and then later on to come out to the\ntemple and be sealed for time and eternity. Their invitations were printed and were about to\nbe mailed when a letter came from Matthew's father pleading that they forsake such a plan\nand be married by that authority which God has restored to earth. He even forwarded the\nmoney for their transportation back to Salt Lake City. Their response was favorable. The\ngospel teachings from early youth, almost put aside for a time, finally registered upon the\nminds of these young people. They obeyed, and have always rejoiced that they followed the\ncounsel of their parents. It is not good to substitute a civil ceremony even for a time when it\nis at all possible to accept the blessings of a temple marriage.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung people, this is my testimony in all humility and sincerity to you this day: regardless of\nthe promptings you may have to the contrary, stop, deliberate, and pray, study, and let the\ntruth and light of the gospel come through.\n<\/p><p>\nIn conclusion, the words of Robert Burns come to me: \"An atheist's laughs are a poor\nexchange for Deity offended.\" There may be those who would scoff at temple marriage.\nNever offend our Eternal Father and Jesus Christ by not accepting one of their greatest and\nmost important blessings.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless us as parents to teach more earnestly this vital truth of temple marriage and\nmay our children respond to these teachings, I humbly pray in the name of the Lord Jesus\nChrist, our Savior. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
