These next few minutes give\nme an opportunity to be about the business of that charge.\n<\/p><p>\nWill Mary, the mother of the babe, Jesus, born in Bethlehem away from home, please come\nto the witness stand?\n<\/p><p>\nWhile she is coming to the stand, let me explain: I am pretending that you, under the sound\nof my voice, are another informal court of the people in which Jesus is on trial&mdash;should I say\non trial again or still on trial?\n<\/p><p>\nIn the minds of many people, Jesus is still on trial. Two-thirds of this earth's inhabitants are\nnon-Christian. To them, he is not the Son of God. Among the skimpy Christian third are\nmany who accept him merely as a great moralist, a great teacher, a great spiritual leader,\nperhaps a prophet. To them, he is not the Son of God.\n<\/p><p>\nOn trial 2,000 years ago, Jesus said: \"I am\"&mdash;the Son of God (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33155\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33155)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33155)\">Mark 14:61-62<\/a><\/span>). With cries\nof \"Crucify him, crucify him,\" the earlier court of the people&mdash;the rabble&mdash;sealed his doom\n(see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"33156\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33156)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33156)\">Mark 15:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf Jesus is not the Son of God, he did blaspheme; he also lied. Why not compound the charge\nof blasphemy with perjury? Add fraud, deceit, or whatever else you will, the truth must come\nout, for every knee must bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Son of God (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41258\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41258)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41258)\">Philip. 2:10-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLet me pretend that I am counsel for the defense, calling witnesses to prove&mdash;<i>He is the Son of God<\/i>.\nNow please stretch your imagination and in your mind's eye see Mary on the witness\nstand. I shall now address her.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> Mary, when you were \". . . a virgin, espoused to . . . Joseph, of the House of David\n. . .\" an angel came unto you (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31563\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31563)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31563)\">Luke 1:27<\/a><\/span>).\nWill you please tell the court what the angel said to you?\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Witness:<\/i> He said, \". . . Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, <i>and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\n\"He shall be great, and shall be called <i>the Son of the Highest<\/i>\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31564\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31564)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31564)\">Luke 1:30-32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> Thank you, Mary, that will be all.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> My next witness is one John, descriptively cited in the scriptures as John the Baptist.\nJesus came to Jordan to be baptized by John, and \". . . when he was baptized . . . the\nheavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and\nlighting upon him: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And lo a voice from heaven, saying . . .\" John, you heard the voice.

He \". . . had his\ndwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . neither could any man tame him.\" Unclean spirits possessed him&mdash;spirits which\nundoubtedly were cast out of heaven with Lucifer, for they remembered Jesus. \"But when he\n[the wild man] saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,\n<\/p><p>\n\"And cried with a loud voice, and said . . .\" the witness may now repeat what you said.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Witness:<\/i> I said, \". . . <i>What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I<\/i>\n<i>adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not<\/i>.\" And Jesus said to the spirit, \". . . Come out of\nthe man . . .\" and many devilish spirits did come out, \"And all the devils besought him,\nsaying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33150\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33150)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33150)\">Mark 5:2-12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> Thank you, sir, you may leave to go your way.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> Nathanael, a friend of Jesus, may now come to the witness stand. It is rumored\nabout, that one Philip told you, Nathanael, about finding down in Nazareth the man that\nMoses and the prophets wrote about. Will you please confirm that rumor and relate your\nconversation with Philip?\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Witness:<\/i> I said, \". . . Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?\" Philip answered me\nand said, \". . . Come and see.\" So I went to see, and I saw Jesus, and I said to him, \". . .\n<i>Rabbi, thou art the Son of God<\/i>; thou art the King of Israel\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27994\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27994)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27994)\">John 1:45-49<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> Thank you, Nathanael; you are excused.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> Another very close friend of Jesus will now take the stand. Martha, will you please\nstep up? Martha sorrowed because Jesus arrived at her home too late to heal her sick brother,\nLazarus, who died and was laid away before Jesus arrived. Tell us, Martha, what Jesus said\nand did upon arrival.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Witness:<\/i> He said, \". . . I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he\nwere dead, yet shall he live: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?\" I \". . . saith\nunto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that <i>thou art Christ, the Son of God<\/i>, which should come into\nthe world.\" Then at the cave where Lazarus lay, \". . . he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus,\ncome forth.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And he that was dead came forth\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28025\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28025)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28025)\">John 11:25-44<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> That will be all, Martha.

You may delete reference to\nMoses and Elias, whom you saw there. Just tell what the voice said about Jesus.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Witness:<\/i> \". . .

Thank you.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> Now will John, the beloved disciple, please come forward. While he is coming, may\nI say that this witness wrote a book with the apparent intent of revealing Jesus to be the\nChrist, the Son of God. Am I right, John? Why did you write your book?\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Witness:<\/i> I wrote \". . . that ye might believe that <i>Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God<\/i>; and that\nbelieving ye might have life through his name\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28047\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28047)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28047)\">John 20:31<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> Anything else you would like to say, John?\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Witness:<\/i> Only this, \"For God so loved the world, <i>that he gave his only begotten Son<\/i>, that\nwhosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28004\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28004)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28004)\">John 3:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> Thank you, John. You may step down.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> The tall, rugged man now approaching the witness stand is the Apostle Peter, a man\nof action and few words. His testimony, like those of his associates, James and John, deserves\nprofound consideration. When you hear it you will agree, I am sure. You may proceed, Peter.\nNeed I say, be brief?&mdash;please.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Witness:<\/i> Jesus once asked his disciples, saying, \". . . <i>Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\n\"And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or\none of the prophets.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\". . .

You are excused.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> My next witness begged for the privilege of testifying. He said that he might have\nsome peace of mind were he accorded the privilege. Will the centurion who assisted in the\ncrucifixion of the Master&mdash;as a matter of duty&mdash;and who \"stood over against him, saw that\nhe so cried out, and gave up the ghost,\" please step up and repeat what you said when the\nLord did give \"up the ghost.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Witness:<\/i> I said, \"<i>Truly this man was the Son of God<\/i>\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33157\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33157)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33157)\">Mark 15:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> Thank you, Centurion. May God grant you peace of mind.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Counsel:<\/i> From another quarter, I bring one more ancient witness&mdash;sorry time will only\npermit one. This witness is Nephi, a disciple of the Lord on the American continent among\nthe Nephites and Lamanites. Nephi, like the Apostle John, also wrote a book to show that\nJesus was the Son of God. He witnessed the appearance of our Lord upon the American\ncontinent after his resurrection, and he will now give a brief recital of that wonderful event.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Witness:<\/i> I \". . . heard a voice as if it came out of heaven . . . it was not a harsh voice,\nneither was it a loud voice\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . and it said . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"<i>Behold my Beloved Son<\/i> . . . in whom I have glorified my name&mdash;hear ye him\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5641\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5641)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5641)\">3 Ne. 11:3-7<\/a><\/span>).\nI also heard Jesus say, \"<i>Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God<\/i>.

It is\nwith great pleasure that I present to the court the great American Prophet Joseph Smith, who\nwent to the Lord in prayer and asked . . . President Smith, this is your story; please take over\nand be brief.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Witness:<\/i> \"My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was\nright . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"I kneeled down and began to offer up the desire of my heart to God . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\". . .

Now, if you will step down, I will take Your place\nand bear my humble witness: \n<\/p><p>\nTo whom it may concern&mdash;and may it concern men everywhere: \n<\/p><p>\nUnlike the Prophet Joseph, I have never had the heavens opened to me nor have I in this\nmortal sphere, ever physically walked and talked with Jesus, yet I know that <i>he is the<\/i>\n<i>Christ<\/i>&mdash;<i>the Son of God<\/i>, and I know this because of the ministration of the Holy Ghost unto me.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, may it please the Court, I rest my case. I have submitted twelve solid witnesses&mdash;all\nthat my limited time will permit. If, after hearing their testimonies, there are those who are\nstill reluctant to accept Jesus as the Son of God and who still prefer to accept his teachings as\nman-made philosophy rather than God's truth&mdash;they would do well to ponder studiously the\nforegoing testimonies.\n<\/p><p>\nIn early Israel, Moses established under God, a law of witnesses namely: \n<\/p><p>\n\"In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21242\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21242)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21242)\">Deut. 17:6<\/a><\/span>).\nThis became the Jewish law in the days of our Lord\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3044\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3044)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3044)\">2 Cor. 13:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe early Common Law of England, after which our law is patterned, required twelve\nwitnesses to the fact; also twelve jurors to the fact, and these jurors were supposed to know\nsomething about the case.\n<\/p><p>\nI have given you twelve witnesses. If you will accept them also as jurors, the verdict is\nplain&mdash;<i>Jesus Christ is the Son of God<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, he truly is&mdash;and in his name I rest my case. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
