In the Bible Dictionary we learn that the word <span class=\"emphasis\">grace<\/span> frequently is used in the scriptures to connote a strengthening or enabling power:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cThe main idea of the word is divine means of help or strength, given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p12\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 It is likewise through the grace of the Lord that individuals, through faith in the atonement of Jesus Christ and repentance of their sins, receive strength and assistance to do good works that they otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to their own means. This grace is an enabling power that allows men and women to lay hold on eternal life and exaltation after they have expended their own best efforts\u201d (p. 697).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p13\" class=\"\">Thus, the enabling and strengthening aspect of the Atonement helps us to see and to do and to become good in ways that we could never recognize or accomplish with our limited mortal capacity. I testify and witness that the enabling power of the Savior\u2019s Atonement is real. Without that strengthening power of the Atonement, I could not stand before you this morning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p14\" class=\"\">Can we sense the grace and strengthening power of Christ in the testimony of Ammon? \u201cYea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43841\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43841)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43841)\">Alma 26:12<\/a><\/span>).

We were making final preparations for an unexpected and historic assembly on our campus the next morning and the announcement by President Hinckley that Ricks College would become a baccalaureate-degree-granting institution and take on the name of Brigham Young University\u2013Idaho.

But we will have help from heaven. Because we know who is in charge and that we are not alone, then no, I am not scared.\u201d And we who serve at BYU\u2013Idaho unitedly testify that there has been help from heaven, miracles have occurred, revelations have been received, doors have been opened, and we have been greatly blessed as individuals and as an institution.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p21\" class=\"\">Please permit me now to express gratitude and appreciation.

Priesthood keys and authority and saving ordinances are again found on the earth. By the power of that priesthood, families truly can be together forever. The Book of Mormon is the word of God and the keystone of our religion. And, brothers and sisters, the heavens are not closed.
