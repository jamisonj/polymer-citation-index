Recently I received a letter written by a young lady who went on a long, dark journey, a journey that ultimately led her into moral transgression. Her story is important because she is going through the anguish of full repentance and now is beginning to feel the joy that honest repentance can bring. She has asked that her personal experience be shared with you in the hope that there might be one who can be helped and not take that same journey. She writes (excerpts from a letter):<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cIt began when I left my home to go to college. Until that time, under the righteous guardianship of my parents, I had not indulged in the loose morals of my friends and acquaintances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cProbably the first dent in the armor of faith which my parents had built up around me was the realization that some \u2018good returned missionaries\u2019 were not always so good and really did indulge in necking and petting episodes. I began to think that a certain amount of physical relations were natural and included them in the closer relationships I had with young men.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cSatan is insidious. He leads a person away from the righteous way of living and little by little tempts them into greater and greater wrongs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cThe months passed, and I fell further and further from the truth. I moved in with a friend who was inactive in the Church and who also had loose morals and drank and smoked. With her I visited bars and nightclubs I never would have gone into on my own initiative.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cNext, I stopped attending Church meetings and even stopped praying. I found that my whole life had changed. I was always depressed. My grades dropped to an all-time low. I couldn\u2019t get along with my roommates. Everything, <span class=\"emphasis\">everything,<\/span> was <span class=\"emphasis\">wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cI found myself totally rejecting the Church and all its teachings. I knew in the depths of my soul that I was afraid. I was truly a \u2018ship without a rudder.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cI found myself searching everywhere for some semblance of security and stability. My parents were physically a long way away. But even at long distance they sensed some of my inner conflict and were worried.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cI finally met a young man, also inactive, with whom I thought I was in love. By then it was easy for me to convince myself that making love was all right as long as I truly felt that I loved the man. So I made love and desecrated the temple of my body. I became pregnant. When I realized my condition, I went to the young man and told him of my problem. He wanted nothing to do with me or my baby. He did say he would pay for an abortion, however, if I so desired.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cAt first I rejected the very idea of abortion, but as I thought about it, I began to rationalize. It took me a couple of weeks to talk myself into making an appointment and having the abortion done.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cShortly thereafter I had the good fortune to meet and marry a young man of extremely high caliber. He was not active in the Church, but he was and is morally a fine, honest, upstanding man. Ever since that time, I have been working and living toward the goal of becoming active in the Church and of once again attaining a position of righteousness in our Heavenly Father\u2019s kingdom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cA few months ago I realized I must go to the bishop of my ward and confess the terrible things I had done. I did so knowing that my sins were grievous before the Lord, that I faced possible disfellowshipment or even excommunication. I also knew that the time had come to put myself and my life into the Lord\u2019s hands, that I might be able to cleanse my sins and stand spotless before Him on the judgment day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cI made an appointment one Sunday afternoon with the bishop. He took time out of his busy schedule to hear of my terrible transgressions. Oh, how I prayed to my Heavenly Father before my interview. The bishop was kindly. He asked that I would have the courage to tell him everything; that I would not hold anything back. As I tried to touch lightly on my transgressions and go on, I <span class=\"emphasis\">couldn\u2019t!<\/span> A horrible tightening in my throat and chest made it impossible for me to go on. I suddenly knew it was the answer to my prayers. The Spirit of our Father in heaven was with me demanding complete confession. I bear witness that I felt the Spirit constraining me to tell the whole truth!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to admit past sins even to ourselves. I found that it was as hard for me to admit the exact nature of my sins to myself as it was to admit them to the bishop. I didn\u2019t want to think about them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAfter my confession the bishop commended me on taking the first step toward returning to my Heavenly Father and outlined additional steps to prepare me for the day when I would realize that I had truly been forgiven. He emphasized that he, himself, could not forgive me. That was the Lord\u2019s decision. He helped me to understand that I <span class=\"emphasis\">could<\/span> be forgiven, that my Heavenly Father loves me, that I could gain an awareness of my future goals and not constantly condemn myself all of my life, thus halting my eternal progression. He asked me to read the <span class=\"emphasis\">Miracle of Forgiveness<\/span> by President Spencer W. Kimball. It helped a great deal in making me aware of the process of forgiveness. We had several appointments, the bishop and I, so that he could help me to see my course toward reestablishing myself in good standing in the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cFollowing my interview with the bishop, I found myself alternating between depression in which I wondered if I would ever be forgiven and becoming lax in doing the things I should be doing. I have learned that \u2018to change\u2019 isn\u2019t easy. It takes time. One must learn to \u2018try\u2019 and \u2018try again.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cNow I find myself growing ever closer to the Lord\u2014more positive. I know if I continue to work and to grow, <span class=\"emphasis\">my Father in heaven will forgive me,<\/span> but most importantly, <span class=\"emphasis\">I will also forgive myself.<\/span> The important thing is that I must persevere in doing what I know to be right.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cIf my experiences sound familiar, I beg you from the very depth of my heart to <span class=\"emphasis\">please<\/span> pause and take stock of your life. Do not be misled by the superficial moral codes of our day. They are Satan\u2019s most persuasive tools. They have no <span class=\"emphasis\">eternal<\/span> significance. It is Satan who will <span class=\"emphasis\">entice us away from<\/span> the joyous richness awaiting us in the <span class=\"emphasis\">eternal family circle.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-lord-offers-everyone-a-way-back-from-sin.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cYou are sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. Stay true to your birthright. Do not bring into your lives the miseries and anguish of soul that I brought into mine.
