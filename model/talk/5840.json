In his job, he completed work and was paid a few months later. He could see that the family was going to be far short of money. He and his wife decided to share the problem with their children. If they paid their tithing, they would run out of food on about the 20th of the month. If they didn\u2019t pay their tithing, they could buy enough food to last until the next paycheck.

I thought it was a great honor to be a deacon. My father was always considerate \u2026 and \u2026 permitted me to take the buggy and horse to gather fast offerings. My responsibility included that part of the town in which I lived, but it was quite a long walk to the homes, and a sack of flour or a bottle of fruit or vegetables or bread became quite heavy as it accumulated. So the buggy was very comfortable and functional. We have changed to cash in later days, but it was commodities in my day. It was a very great honor to do this service for my Heavenly Father: and though times have changed, when money is given generally instead of commodities, it is still a great honor to perform this service.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-96911_000_019\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">The Teachings of Spencer W.

On one such occasion, an elderly member, Brother Wright, welcomed me at the door and, with aged hands, fumbled at the tie of the envelope and placed within it a quarter. His eyes fairly twinkled as he made his contribution. He told me of a time years before when the Relief Society president, Sister Balmforth, with food collected from those who had given, carried to his home in a small red wagon food for his cupboard and provided gratitude for his soul. He described her as \u201can angel sent from heaven.\u201d I have not forgotten Eddie Wright.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p29\" class=\"\">Deacons and others of the Aaronic Priesthood who perform today this sacred service, please know this to be a sacred duty.

Not a word of reproof was spoken, but during the following week we escorted the boys to Welfare Square in Salt Lake City for a guided tour. They saw firsthand a lame sister operating the telephone switchboard, an older man stocking shelves, women arranging clothing to be distributed\u2014even a blind person placing labels on cans of food. Here were individuals earning their sustenance through their contributed labors. A penetrating silence came over the boys as they witnessed how their effort each month helped to collect the sacred fast offering funds which aided the needy and provided employment for those who otherwise would be idle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p30\" class=\"\">From that hallowed day forward, we no longer had to urge our deacons with regard to collecting fast offerings.

For instance, I shall ever remember the time we gathered together the teenaged Aaronic Priesthood young men to really give the poultry project a spring cleaning. Our enthusiastic and energetic throng gathered at the project and in a speedy fashion uprooted, gathered, and burned large quantities of weeds and debris. By the light of the glowing bonfires we ate hot dogs and congratulated ourselves on a job well done. The project was now neat and tidy. However, there was just one disastrous problem. The noise and the fires had so disturbed the fragile and temperamental population of several thousand laying hens that most of them went into a sudden molt and ceased laying.
