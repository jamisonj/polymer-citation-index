One Sunday, after I had been attending the small branch for six months, a missionary offered me the bread as he was passing the sacrament. I looked at him and softly said, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/if-you-will-be-responsible.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">\u201cWhy not?\u201d he replied.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/if-you-will-be-responsible.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">I told him, \u201cBecause I am not a member of the Church.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-12455_000_046\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Please note that \u201calthough the sacrament is for Church members, the bishopric should not announce that it will be passed to members only, and nothing should be done to prevent nonmembers from partaking of it\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Handbook 2: Administering the Church<\/span> [2010], 20.4.1).]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/if-you-will-be-responsible.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">The missionary couldn\u2019t believe it.

But since my family was not interested, it was only my weekly Church attendance for more than six months that made the missionaries feel confident enough to continue. Finally, the great moment I had been waiting for came when they invited me to become a member of the Church of Jesus Christ. The missionaries explained to me that since I was a minor, I would need my parents\u2019 permission. I went with the missionaries to see my father, thinking that his loving answer would be \u201cSon, when you are of legal age, you will be able to make your own decisions.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/if-you-will-be-responsible.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">While the missionaries spoke with him, I prayed fervently for his heart to be touched so he would give me the permission I wanted. His answer to the missionaries was the following: \u201cElders, over the past six months, I have seen my son Jorge get up early every Sunday morning, put on his best clothes, and walk to church. I have seen only a good influence from the Church in his life.\u201d Then, addressing me, he surprised me by saying, \u201cSon, if you will be responsible for this decision, then you have my permission to be baptized.\u201d I hugged my father, gave him a kiss, and thanked him for what he was doing. The next day I was baptized. Last week was the 47th anniversary of that important moment in my life.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/if-you-will-be-responsible.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">What responsibility do we have as members of the Church of Jesus Christ?
