They are great men and carry much of the load of this great Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">Brethren, I should like to say a few words to you tonight before we close. We are deeply concerned over the need to reduce the inflow from the youth of the Church into the ranks of inactive adults and also to bring substantial numbers out of the adult rank into activity. With this in mind, we have the following to suggest:<\/p>\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A greater effort in fellowshipping converts to the Church. It is imperative that those who are baptized as converts immediately be assigned home teachers who will fellowship them in a very personal and concerned manner. These home teachers, working with their priesthood officers, should see that each mature convert is given some challenging activity as well as an opportunity and encouragement to increase his knowledge of the gospel. He should be assisted in establishing social relationships with the members of the Church so that he will not feel alone as he begins his life as an active Latter-day Saint.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Added emphasis on the approved Aaronic Priesthood Young Men and Young Women programs. These have been designed to strengthen the teaching process of our youth and to afford them rewarding and challenging opportunities for the kinds of activities which will give expression to their many and varied talents. In saving our youth, we save generations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Infusing ward and stake Relief Society officers with an added sense of responsibility to enroll the women of the Church and bring them into full activity. This will entail an accommodation in scheduling meetings so that it will be possible for more of our women to attend and participate in the program of this great organization. We ask that bishops consult with their Relief Society presidents concerning this.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">4.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Impressing our home teachers to take upon themselves greater responsibility for members of the Church who move from one area to another. Through contacts with relatives and neighbors, many of those who move can be identified and steps taken to see that they are welcomed immediately upon arrival in the area of their new residency.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">5.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Working more actively with those whom we classify as <span class=\"emphasis\">prospective elders.<\/span> Under our present program, our elders quorums assume responsibility for these men. It should be remembered however, that provision is made in the program under which high priests and even seventies may be called to assist with these men. The elders quorum, through the priesthood executive committee, may ask that high priests serve as home teachers to some of these men, particularly to those who would find greater congeniality with high priest home teachers. Likewise, in those families where there are nonmembers of the Church, the seventies might be asked to assist, with the thought that they will go to the homes not only as home teachers, but also as missionaries to the nonmembers of the Church who may reside there. I am satisfied, brethren, that we can do much more than we are now doing to bring many of these men back into full activity. In so doing, we shall bless their lives and the lives of their families, and in a very substantial manner strengthen the work of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">6.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For years we have urged that seminars be held to which prospective elders and their wives, as well as inactive elders, may be invited to meet together. There, under the tutelage of an inspired and effective teacher, they can increase their knowledge of the gospel with the objective that they may prepare themselves to go to the house of the Lord. We have approved a course of study for such seminars. This has been prepared under the direction of the Priesthood Executive Committee, and we are hopeful that bishops and stake presidents will utilize it in this important undertaking.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-power-of-forgiveness.p11\" class=\"\">Brethren, we cannot relax while many of our brothers and sisters and many of our young men and women are failing to participate in the programs of the Church. I ask that you again reflect on your responsibilities in this matter and take steps to accelerate this work of redemption.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-power-of-forgiveness.p12\" class=\"\">I knew a young mother who lost her husband by death. The family had been in poor circumstances and the insurance policy was only $2,000, but it was like a gift from heaven. The company promptly delivered the check for that amount as soon as proof of death was furnished. The young widow concluded she should save this for emergencies, and accordingly deposited it in the bank. Others knew of her savings, and one kinsman convinced her that she should lend the $2,000 to him at a high rate of interest.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-power-of-forgiveness.p13\" class=\"\">Years passed, and she had received neither principal nor interest.

To think that an able-bodied man would defraud a young widow with a family to support! \u201cHow I loathe him!\u201d she repeated over and over. Then I told her my Bishop Kempton story, where a man forgave the murderer of his father. She listened intently. I saw she was impressed. At the conclusion there were tears in her eyes, and she whispered: \u201cThank you. Thank you sincerely. Surely I, too, must forgive my enemy. I will now cleanse my heart of its bitterness. I do not expect ever to receive the money, but I leave my offender in the hands of the Lord.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-power-of-forgiveness.p15\" class=\"\">Weeks later, she saw me again and confessed that those intervening weeks had been the happiest of her life. A new peace had overshadowed her and she was able to pray for the offender and forgive him, even though she never received back a single dollar. (See Spencer W.

Vicious and ugly was the act. Anyone would be shocked and disturbed at such a crime, but to be unwilling to forgive is not Christlike. The foul deed was done and could not be undone. The culprit had been disciplined. In her bitterness the woman shriveled and shrank into a miserable person.

The sharp edge of the weapon could damage neither April\u2019s vivaciousness, nor her compassion. \u2018\u2026 I wish that somebody could do something for him, to help him.

The sun still illumines the day and gives light and life to all things; the moon still brightens the night; oceans still feed the world and provide transportation; rivers still drain the land, and provide irrigation water to nourish crops. Even the ravages of time have not sloughed off the majesty of the mountains. Flowers still bloom and birds still sing, and children still laugh and play.
