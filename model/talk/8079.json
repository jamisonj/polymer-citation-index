In the Church today we are offered the opportunity to fast once a month and give a generous fast offering through our bishop or branch president for the benefit of the poor and the needy. Some of what you give will be used to help those around you, perhaps someone in your own family. The Lord\u2019s servants will pray and fast for the revelation to know whom to help and what help to give. That which is not needed to help people in your local Church unit will become available to bless other Church members across the world who are in need.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/is-not-this-the-fast-that-i-have-chosen.p25\" class=\"\" id=\"p25\">The commandment to fast for the poor has many blessings attached to it.

Even a child can feel it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/is-not-this-the-fast-that-i-have-chosen.p51\" class=\"\" id=\"p51\">Many children, and some adults, may for personal reasons find a 24-hour fast difficult. It can be, in the words of Isaiah, felt that the fast has \u201cafflicted [their] soul.\u201d Wise parents recognize that possibility and so are careful to follow the counsel of President Joseph\u00a0F. Smith: \u201cBetter to teach them the principle, and let them observe it when they are old enough to choose intelligently.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote12-12455_000_010\">12<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Joseph\u00a0F.

One of my grandsons had found a 24-hour fast beyond his powers of endurance. But his wise parents still placed the principle in his heart. One of his school friends recently lost a young cousin to accidental death. My grandson asked his mother on fast day, at about the time he had always felt the fast was too hard to continue, whether it would make his grieving friend feel better if he continued his fast.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/is-not-this-the-fast-that-i-have-chosen.p53\" class=\"\" id=\"p53\">His question was the confirmation of President Joseph\u00a0F. Smith\u2019s counsel. My grandson had come to the point where he not only understood the principle of the fast, but it had also been planted in his heart. He had come to feel that his fasting and prayers would lead to a blessing from God for someone in need. If he lives the principle often enough, it will bring the wonderful effects in his own life, as promised by the Lord. He will have the spiritual blessing of power to receive inspiration and greater capacity to resist temptation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/is-not-this-the-fast-that-i-have-chosen.p54\" class=\"\" id=\"p54\">We do not know all the reasons why Jesus Christ went into the wilderness to fast and to pray.
