Today, in the various handbooks of the priesthood, you will find four major categories of duties appointed unto the ward bishop. Except for those duties which are unique to the Presiding Bishopric of the Church and those which were made inoperative at the time the formal law of consecration was suspended, the role of the bishop today is essentially the same as was defined in these early revelations. Bishops have been given added responsibilities for the youth and as presiding high priest of the ward. However, of all of the bishop\u2019s assignments, as important as each one is, none is more important than care for the poor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/the-role-of-a-bishop-in-the-church-welfare-program.p13\" class=\"\">There is only one common judge in each ward, only one man authorized to perceive the needs of the people, only one priesthood holder acting as the Lord\u2019s representative to succor the feeble knees and hands that hang down (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"17242\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17242)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17242)\">D&amp;C 81:5<\/a><\/span>).

A Needs and Resources Analysis form has been provided by the Welfare Services Department to assist in this evaluation. Need may arise from any one of a number of causes, such as injuries, infirmity, unemployment, lack of education, poor management, or physical or mental deficiencies. Regardless of the kind or scope of problems, the bishop must learn the cause of the difficulty, how serious it is, and who can help in the solution.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/the-role-of-a-bishop-in-the-church-welfare-program.p30\" class=\"\">In most instances, the bishop will want the ward Relief Society president to assist in the study.

In the process, he should teach the fundamentals of Church welfare assistance, including self-help, family assistance, and Church responsibility. In an appropriate way, the bishop should determine if those directly involved have done all they can reasonably be expected to do for themselves. This will include ascertaining if other family members and relatives have done their part to assist.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/the-role-of-a-bishop-in-the-church-welfare-program.p33\" class=\"\">Finally as led by the Spirit, the bishop <span class=\"emphasis\">should render the needed assistance.<\/span> He will explain the nature and extent of Church resources to be given as temporary assistance. This may include cash assistance from fast offerings; food, clothing, etc. from the storehouse; or items from Deseret Industries. Certain kinds of problems may require services from the employment system or from the LDS Social Services. Of course, to officially authorize these goods and services, the bishop will sign a bishop\u2019s order, which either he or his Relief Society president has prepared.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/the-role-of-a-bishop-in-the-church-welfare-program.p34\" class=\"\">In authorizing assistance, the bishop, as common judge, has the further responsibility to determine the work or services to be performed by the recipients. This provides them the privilege of maintaining their dignity and self-respect, while sharing in the process of generating the resources they and others will use. Bishops must be ever watchful on this point of work by recipients for what they receive. We must never let the Lord\u2019s program of self-help become a dole, for \u201cthe idler shall not have place in the church, except he repent and mend his ways\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17228\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17228)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17228)\">D&amp;C 75:29<\/a><\/span>).

By this we mean dealing with the root cause of the problem so the individual or family can again become self-sustaining and able to provide for themselves. This rehabilitative action may be of short duration and quite straightforward, such as helping to find a new job for the breadwinner. Sometimes, serious accidents or problems require long-term rehabilitative action. In these cases, the priesthood quorum of which a needy person is a member should lead out and provide the impetus to plan and carry out rehabilitative activity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/the-role-of-a-bishop-in-the-church-welfare-program.p36\" class=\"\">As noted in several successive welfare handbooks: \u201cIn his temporal administrations the bishop looks at every able-bodied needy person as a purely temporary problem, caring for him until he can help himself. The priesthood quorum must look at its needy member as a continuing problem until not alone his temporal needs are met but his spiritual ones also. As a concrete example,\u2014a bishop extends help while the artisan or craftsman is out of work and in want; a priesthood quorum assists in establishing him in work and tries to see that he becomes fully self-supporting and active in his priesthood duties. In Church welfare work, the rehabilitation of quorum members and their families spiritually is the primary responsibility of quorums functioning as quorums\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Welfare Plan of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: Handbook of Instructions,<\/span> 1952, p. 20).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/the-role-of-a-bishop-in-the-church-welfare-program.p37\" class=\"\">All bishops should realize that they will be truly successful in lifting lives only if they apply these principles in the spirit in which they are given. As President Clark so often reminded us, \u201cThe rule of the bishop in all these matters, is the rule of the priesthood,\u2014a rule of kindness, charity, love, [and] righteousness\u201d (J.

They will know that what they receive has been given to them under the inspiration of the Lord. I am thoroughly convinced that the Lord will touch their hearts that they might be worthy receivers and that their desires may be to do all that they can to truly earn those things that are given to them. I believe that it is not too much to believe that bishops can have in their hearts a desire to give all that is really needed, even sometimes more, and at the same time, our people can have the true Christian spirit that would want them to accept less than their good bishop is willing to give. This is not an idle statement.

As the common judge, you must live worthy to get the answers for each case from the only source provided\u2014the inspiration of heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/the-role-of-a-bishop-in-the-church-welfare-program.p40\" class=\"\">While we have been speaking directly to bishops about their responsibilities, it should be remembered that we have branch presidents who share the same responsibilities of watching over the poor and the needy as do bishops in organized wards.
