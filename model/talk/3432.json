You may wonder why I would speak to them from this pulpit, rather than in a family meeting. There are two reasons.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p10\" class=\"\">First, a careful account is kept of these proceedings, and through that record I hope to speak to those who are not yet born.

I fear that when I have given this counsel, some will say, \u201cWell, I knew that already,\u201d and regard it as prosaic, unimaginative, even dull. For what I want to say is so ordinary, so commonplace, that it is very difficult to have it universally regarded as important.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p12\" class=\"\">Nevertheless, we want our children and grandchildren to know that, beyond the fundamental truth that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, there has been a restoration of His gospel through the prophets, that the fulness of the gospel is upon the earth. After that (really as an essential part of it), this is the one truth we most want to teach our children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p13\" class=\"\">Three weeks ago I spent a day with Sister Packer in the record office in London.

She was refused permission to leave to check on a report that her child was being badly abused at the workhouse school. In great frustration she had \u201cwillfully broken a window.\u201d And so they sent her to prison.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p16\" class=\"\">Another entry reported an inspection of the school. The doctor complained that piles of manure along the edge of the school yard blocked the drainage. Water and sewage had backed up into the yard until the mire was ankle deep. Because of the cold and the poor condition of the children\u2019s shoes, many children were ill.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p17\" class=\"\">The record of dismissals listed \u201cdead\u201d or \u201cdied\u201d time after time, with an explanation: \u201ccomplaint,\u201d \u201cfever,\u201d \u201cconsumption,\u201d \u201cdropsy.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p18\" class=\"\">We found Mary Haley! She married Edward Sayers, and they had eleven children. Six of them died before they were seven years of age, one from burns. To our knowledge, only one of the eleven grew to maturity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p19\" class=\"\">That was Eleanor Sayers, my wife\u2019s great-grandmother. She was born at Pullham, Norfolk, in the Depwade Union Workhouse and was the first of her family to join the Church. She died of cancer in a dismal London hospital.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p20\" class=\"\">The lives of those souls, our forebears, were characterized from beginning to end by both poverty and obscurity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p21\" class=\"\">Before Eleanor Sayers Harman died, she gave all of her funds to her daughter Edith and counseled her to go to America.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p22\" class=\"\">Edith had been cast out by her husband when she joined the Church. She and eight-year-old Nellie left England with the flimsy assurance that a missionary <span class=\"emphasis\">thought<\/span> his family in Idaho <span class=\"emphasis\">might<\/span> take them in until they could be located.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p23\" class=\"\">Nellie was my wife\u2019s mother; Edith, her grandmother.

We want our children to remember that their lineage runs to the poorhouse in Pullham, Norfolk, and to remember this: It is the misapprehension of most people that if you are good, really good, at what you do, you will eventually be both widely known and well compensated.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p27\" class=\"\">It is the understanding of almost everyone that success, to be complete, must include a generous portion of both fame and fortune as essential ingredients.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p28\" class=\"\">The world seems to work on that premise. The premise is false. It is not true. The Lord taught otherwise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p29\" class=\"\">I want you, our children, to know this truth:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p30\" class=\"\">You need not be either rich or hold high position to be completely successful and truly happy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p31\" class=\"\">In fact, if these things come to you, and they may, true success must be achieved in spite of them, not because of them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p32\" class=\"\">It is remarkably difficult to teach this truth. If one who is not well known, and not well compensated, claims that he has learned for himself that neither fame nor fortune are essential to success, we tend to reject his statement as self-serving. What else could he say and not count himself a failure?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p33\" class=\"\">If someone who has possession of fame or fortune asserts that neither matters to success or happiness, we suspect that his expression is also self-serving, even patronizing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p34\" class=\"\">Therefore, we will not accept as reliable authorities either those who have fame and fortune, or those who have not. We question that either can be an objective witness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p35\" class=\"\">That leaves only one course open to us: trial and error\u2014to learn for oneself, by experience, about prominence and wealth or their opposites.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p36\" class=\"\">We thereafter struggle through life, perhaps missing both fame and fortune, to finally learn one day that one can, indeed, succeed without possessing either. Or we may, one day, have both and learn that neither has made us happy; neither is basic to the recipe for true success and for complete happiness. That is a very slow way to learn.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p37\" class=\"\">Was it Poor Richard who said, \u201cExperience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard\u2019s Almanac, and Other Papers,<\/span> New York: A.

The choice is between good and evil, and that is a very different matter indeed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p40\" class=\"\">When we finally understand this lesson, thereafter our happiness will not be determined by material things.

Over the years these little choices will be bundled together and show clearly what we value.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-choice.p44\" class=\"\">The crucial test of life, I repeat, does not center in the choice between fame and obscurity, nor between wealth and poverty.
