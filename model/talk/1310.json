Ivins, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1963, pp. 117-118<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nBrethren and sisters:\n<\/p><p>\nAs I stand before you today, I seek an interest in your faith and prayers that, perhaps, I may\nsay something that may be of help to some of us.\n<\/p><p>\nMy life span covers nearly sixty-two percent of the lapsed time since the Church was\nre-established on the earth through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Jun. For\nnearly forty percent of my life I have had opportunity to observe the forward movement of\nthe Church as a member of the First Council of the Seventy. Quite naturally, I have been able\nto check, in a way, the responses of the priesthood members of the Church to the programs\ninstituted, from time to time, for their encouragement and aid. In this I have reached a\nconclusion that what we, the bearers of the priesthood, most need is faith.\n<\/p><p>\nWe declare in the Articles of Faith, \"We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son,\nJesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.\" Also, \"We believe that the first principles and\nordinances of the Gospel are; first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third,\nBaptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift\nof the Holy Ghost\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6776\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6776)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6776)\">A of F 1:1<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6780\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6780)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6780)\">A of F 1:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo me this means that we believe that God exists; that he is our Eternal Father and the Father\nof Jesus Christ; and we believe in the Holy Ghost. We believe also that Jesus Christ, the Son\nof God, took upon himself mortal life, accepted death, and rose from death to be the first\nevidence to man of the resurrection&mdash;\"the first fruits of the resurrection\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"379\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 379)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(379)\">1 Cor. 15:20<\/a><\/span>). In so doing he\novercame the effects of Adam's act which introduced mortality into the world. It was then\npossible, through death and the resurrection, for man to re-enter the presence of God in an\nexalted estate.\n<\/p><p>\nThat man might be exalted, a plan of life was given him, and this we call the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nRecurring to the Fourth Article of Faith we learn that the first principle of this plan is that\nman should have faith in God and in our Redeemer Jesus Christ\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6781\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6781)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6781)\">A of F 1:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFaith is defined in one biblical passage as follows: \". . . faith is the substance of things hoped\nfor, the evidence of things not seen\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24313\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24313)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24313)\">Heb. 11:2<\/a><\/span>). Faith gives our yearnings substance and\nevidences to us the possibility of actual accomplishment. With this possibility before us, we\nundertake things new to us, gaining strength and courage, both physical and spiritual. In other\nwords, faith in its broadest sense prompts every act of our lives. We increase faith in\nourselves by the exercise of our faculties; we gain faith in our neighbors when our mutual\ninterchanges accord with the gospel plan. We gain faith in the gospel plan&mdash;which means\nfaith in God&mdash;by doing the various things required by it, and this means service. The only\nway I have discovered to serve God is to help his work along among his children. As we\nserve, we gain greater power of understanding and appreciation. Man is that\nhe may have joy, and the greatest joy I have experienced has come through serving others.\n<\/p><p>\nService, then, becomes a measuring stick for faith. If men serve faithfully and willingly, it is\nan indication of faith.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we apply this measure to the service of the many men who held the Melchizedek\nPriesthood, we discover that too many of us fail to measure to a high standard of service.\nShall we call it a lack of faith?\n<\/p><p>\nI like to believe, and this comes from my experience and observation, that many men rail in\ntheir interest in the work of the priesthood from lack of responsible opportunity and\napplication. How can a man enjoy doing a thing in which he is not experienced and familiar?\n<\/p><p>\nThe program of the Church is sufficiently broad to offer opportunity for most men to serve in\nsome interesting capacity&mdash;this must be in a friendly atmosphere, for most people respond to\nfriendship.\n<\/p><p>\nThe purpose of the program awaiting initiation at the beginning of the new year is to surround\nthese inactive brethren and sisters with an atmosphere of friendship and sincere interest,\nfinding opportunity for attractive and friendly fellowship and service.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is in the Church a veritable army of men who hold only the Aaronic Priesthood, hold\nno priesthood at all, or who, holding the Melchizedek Priesthood, fail to honor it by active\nservice. Many of these men are burdened with, and struggle to overcome, habits which make\nthem feel out of harmony with the program of the Church. When this may be the case, we\nshould give them every possible aid in their struggle. There are few things more powerful\nthan habits. When they are good, they become a great safeguard; when they are not, they\nreduce their capacity according to the seriousness of the affliction. Our problem is to aid with\nas little embarrassment as possible. Many men of my acquaintance have made this battle with\nthemselves successfully and attained to greater happiness.\n<\/p><p>\nChanging from a life of inactivity in the Church, or even opposition to the teachings and\nprogram of the Church, implies the need of repentance. It need not be offensive to suggest to\na person that he change his ways to be more happy. That is what repentance means: a Godly\nsorrow for acts, improper or even just not wisely performed, and a change to a life filled with\nproper and correctly performed activities. This not only results in one's contentment and\nhappiness but increases his interest in others and his service in their behalf. This change\nbrings about a closer relationship with the Spirit of the Lord under whose influence one\ncorrects his private life and his social relationships. Why should it be offensive to a person to\nbe told that if he will, of his own volition, prove victor over his unfortunate habits, he will be\nhappier and more useful?\n<\/p><p>\nThis, brethren and sisters, is one of our major problems. Salvation is the objective of the\nChurch. May God help us to realize this purpose. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
