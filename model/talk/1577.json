Our nation is searching for an answer to this most serious\nproblem; and our efforts to this point have been somewhat futile, primarily because we are\nnot adhering to the \"sound doctrine\" mentioned by Paul.\n<\/p><p>\nIn an editorial aired recently on KSL, which dealt with this problem, we find some searching\nquestions. I quote: \n<\/p><p>\n\"You hear all kinds of solutions proposed&mdash;better schools, more public housing, more\nintegration, more social workers, more federal money to eliminate poverty.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But most of those solutions run up against some troubling questions, such as, Why is there\nmore crime than ever before when per capita income is higher than ever before? Why more\ncrime when national illiteracy is at an all-time low? Why does crime seem to rise, the more\nfederal money is poured in to fight poverty?\n<\/p><p>\n\"There are no simple answers. But on one principle most people can agree: Juvenile crime is\nusually spawned by inadequate homes.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Responsibility as parents<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe can spend millions in remedial programs aimed at the prevention and cure of crime, but\nthe plain fact remains that until citizens recognize their divine responsibility as parents and are\nwilling to be honest and respected themselves, and to teach their children likewise, crime will\ncontinue to increase. The home must ever foster the great and lasting virtues of purity of life,\nhonesty, thrift, benevolence, and patriotism. To do this requires effort from both mother and\nfather. It cannot be relegated to a baby sitter or a nursery school.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Neglect of children cause of crime<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFrom an editorial written by David Lawrence, it seems that all who study the problem agree\nthat neglect of children is a major factor in the rapid rise in crime, particularly among persons\nunder 21. Placing much of the blame on parents, the report of the National Crime\nCommission makes these two significant statements: \n<\/p><p>\n1. \"The programs and activities of almost every kind of social institution with which children\ncome in contact&mdash;schools, churches, social service agencies, youth organizations&mdash;are\npredicated on the assumption that children acquire their fundamental attitude toward life, their\nmoral standards, in their homes.\"\n<\/p><p>\n2. \"What appears to be happening throughout the country, in the cities and in the suburbs,\namong the poor and among the well-to-do, is that parental or paternal authority over young\npeople, is becoming weaker.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Value of parental discipline and guidance<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe value of parental discipline and guidance is further illustrated from a broadcast delivered\nby Paul Harvey on Saturday, March 27, 1965: \n<\/p><p>\n\"San Francisco's Chinatown epitomizes grinding poverty.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For the child of Chinatown, life is mostly rice and salt, fish and work with his hands as soon\nas he's able.\n<\/p><p>\n\"This is poverty. Chinatown population is 16 times more dense than the San Francisco\naverage. Eight-tenths of all buildings need renovating.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe further states (which seems almost unbelievable): \n<\/p><p>\n\"Yet, in the United States there has never been arrested a chronic delinquent child of Chinese\nparents!\n<\/p><p>\n\"Seven percent of America's juveniles will be in trouble with the law this year. Not one\nChinese.\n<\/p><p>\n\"In the United States there has never been a Chinese convicted for rape, burglary, bank\nrobbery, or desertion.\n<\/p><p>\n\"In the half century of Chicago's Chinatown, there has been only one arrest\nfor breaking and entering.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Despite generations of western influence, this race has somehow check-reined the impulses of\nits vigorous youngsters. How?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Albert K. Leong, president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of Chicago,\nsays, 'We keep a tight rein on our children until they are really responsible.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"Editor Thomas Y. Fu of the <i>China Times<\/i> in Chicago's Chinatown says, 'Our children just\nnaturally respect and obey their parents. A boy or girl would not bring shame on his family or\nhis family name.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"P. H. Chang, [former] Chinese Consul-General in New York City, says, 'A Chinese child, no\nmatter where he lives, is brought up to recognize that he cannot shame his parents. Before a\nChinese child makes a move, he stops to think what the reaction of his parents will be.'\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Respect and love at home<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThis being true, what then is wrong with our homes? Wherein does the weakness lie, or may\nwe ask whence will come the strength to cope with the problem? Such strength as we will\nmuster can only come from within&mdash;within the individual, within the family, and within the\ncommunity. Such strength can only come by the family's being solidly bound together with\nlove and respect of the child for the parent, and parent for the child, and the love of husband\nand wife. The home is the place to build such strength. This can only be done with full-time\nmothers, who are the divinely appointed keepers at home.\n<\/p><p>\nIf there is no order in the home, if mother is absent, if it is deficient of a sound code of moral\nethics, if it fails to have unity of purpose and omits the parental performance of guiding,\ndisciplining, and teaching children, heaven cannot help that home. Parents must teach their\nchildren that the family name is important, that their actions must always be for the good of\nthe individual, the family, and the society as a whole. They should be taught never to bring\nshame on themselves, their families, or their community. Since the family builds the\nindividual, the family needs to be strong; and strong families come from strong parents who\nhave adhered to the sound doctrine alluded to in Paul's epistle.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Order in the family divinely set<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nGod set the order of the family. He created Adam; then, because, as he said, it is not good for\nman to be alone (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23750\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23750)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23750)\">Gen. 2:18<\/a><\/span>), he created the woman, whom Adam called Eve because she was to be the\nmother of all living (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23755\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23755)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23755)\">Gen. 3:20<\/a><\/span>). Mother is the term given to \"one who gives birth\" and \"exercises\nprotective care over.\" Father is the term given to \"the male parent who begets a child\" and\n\"exercises protective care over.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAs Adam and Eve were sent out of the Garden of Eden, Adam received the command, \"in the\nsweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23754\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23754)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23754)\">Gen. 3:19<\/a><\/span>), and Eve received the admonition, \"in\nsorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall\nrule over thee\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23751\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23751)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23751)\">Gen. 3:16<\/a><\/span>). This was the family relationship as it was divinely instituted.\nAny action to upset that order can only lead to failure and trouble.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Keepers at home\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn Paul's epistle, he instructed those responsible to teach the young women to be \"keepers at\nhome\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43039\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43039)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43039)\">Titus 2:5<\/a><\/span>). We are prone to skip lightly over that statement, but it is one of the saving factors of\nthe home. There is one place for the mother, and that is in the home; particularly, she needs\nto be there when the children are home.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are further comments that advise us that economic factors indirectly play a part in the\nabsence of parental discipline. Working mothers are not at home during most of the day, and\nthey are unaware of what their children are doing before or after school hours or with whom\nthey are associating. Usually when the working mother is at home, her waking hours are filled\nwith the usual domestic chores of washing, ironing, and general household duties. The school,\ntherefore, during five days of supervision each week, must play a serious\npart in teaching morality. Admittedly, this is a poor substitute for a mother's duty, and the\nevidence stares at us.\n<\/p><p>\nThe economic factor referred to above seems to be mothers leaving the home in an effort to\nsecure unnecessary worldly goods and conveniences. Even with the most sophisticated\nreasoning to justify why mothers should work, the risk of failure in the home is still present.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter discussing the subject at a recent stake conference, I received this letter from a working\nmother. The letter reads: \n<\/p><p>\n\"At our stake conference today, I could have stood up and cheered your comments about\nworking mothers. I am thoroughly convinced that many of the nation's ills could be\neliminated by mothers remaining at home and being good homemakers and wives. Husbands\nwould respond to the dependence of being the provider and head of the family; youngsters\ncould contribute to their own miscellaneous needs for money by paper routes, etc., and not be\ncontributing to delinquency. The whole family could definitely benefit and grow by working\ntogether in harmony and understanding to live within the wage that was brought into the\nhome. Being a good wife and mother and sweetheart is career enough for any woman.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For us, 25 years of ideal marriage (20 years temple marriage) has evaporated in divorce and\ndespair . . . A goodly portion of the breakdown came from my going out of the home to\nwork, and the chain reaction of minute events that grew like a cancer, quietly and deadly.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSorrow and unfulfillment will lie at the end of the career of a working mother who has\nneglected her family. While it is understood that some mothers must work because of no other\nincome coming to the home, there should be no excuse for supplementing the husband's\nincome for the purchase of so-called luxuries and conveniences.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Making family income do<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMy wife and I were married during the time of the depression. I had purchased a new car,\nand it was all paid for. I was employed&mdash;my salary was $ 125 per month. I remember\nbringing home my first check. My wife said, \"It isn't very much, is it?\" I replied, \"No, but it\nwill do.\" She said, \"Yes, if we budget it.\" So we sat down and budgeted: $12.50 for tithing;\n$1.00 for fast offerings; $45 for rent; $40 for food, and additional amounts for utilities and\nclothing; and $10 in the savings account, for we presumed and anticipated that a child would\ncome eventually. When we added it all up, the $125 was all allocated. I said to my wife, \"It's\nall gone, and there isn't any left to buy gasoline for my car. What am I going to do?\" She\nreplied, \"Sorry. I guess you'll have to walk.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSo I walked back and forth to work, and the car stayed right in the garage for several months\nuntil I got a raise and could spare a little to buy gasoline. We've always managed to get along\non my income, and I don't think we have ever had an unhappy moment over it, but rather,\nmuch satisfaction in coping with the situation. It isn't so much what you earn but how you\nmanage.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful for the home in which I was reared. It was a humble home, but mother was\nalways there, just in case an injury occurred or we needed discipline and attention.\n<\/p><p>\nThis, my brothers and sisters, is the way out of the racking situation that we are in today in\nthis nation. It is sound doctrine for the mother to assume her divinely appointed role as\n\"keeper at home\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43040\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43040)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43040)\">Titus 2:5<\/a><\/span>), and the father to provide for his family, and for both mother and father to\nrestore parental authority in the home through sound teachings and wise love and discipline of\ntheir children.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we not have to learn through suffering and misery the truth of our Prophet's words, \"No\nother success can compensate for failure in the home.\" This is my fervent prayer in the name\nof Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
