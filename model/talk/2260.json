Not only that, but hundreds of thousands who have already gone to their rest, such as my father and his father.

My testimony and witness to you here today is that there is not an honest man or an honest woman in this world who really loves the Lord, and would like to serve him as he would like to be served, who would not join this church if they would just take time to find out the marvelous things the Lord has done in restoring his work to the earth in this day and time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/strange-creeds-of-christendom.p7\" class=\"\">Some years ago one of our nationally known radio commentators was asked the question, \u201cWhat message could be broadcast to the world that would be considered of greater importance than any other message?\u201d And he said, after giving the matter careful thought and deliberation, \u201cTo be able to say that a man who had lived here upon this earth had returned again with a message from God would be the greatest message that could be broadcast to the world.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/strange-creeds-of-christendom.p8\" class=\"\">And that being true, the Latter-day Saints have the greatest message, not only that prophets like Moroni and John the Baptist and Peter, James, and John have visited this earth, but God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, as President Tanner just testified.
