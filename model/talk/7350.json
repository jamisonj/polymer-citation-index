I do this as an introduction to a subject that has weighed heavily on my mind for some time. In 1955, after my freshman year of college, I spent the summer working at the newly opened Jackson Lake Lodge, located in Moran, Wyoming. My mode of transportation was a 14-year-old 1941 Hudson automobile that should have received its burial 10 years earlier. Among the car\u2019s other identifying traits, the floorboards had rusted so badly that, if not for a piece of plywood, I could have literally dragged my feet on the highway. The positive is that unlike most 14-year-old cars in this time period, it used no oil\u2014lots of water in the radiator, but no oil. I could never figure out where the water went and why the oil continually got thinner and thinner and clearer and clearer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/three-towels-and-a-25-cent-newspaper.p6\" class=\"\">In preparation for the 185-mile (298-km) drive home at the end of the summer, I took the car to the only mechanic in Moran. After a quick analysis, the mechanic explained that the engine block was cracked and was leaking water into the oil. That explained the water and oil mystery. I wondered if I could get the water to leak into the gas tank; I would get better gasoline mileage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/three-towels-and-a-25-cent-newspaper.p7\" class=\"\">Now the confession: after the miracle of arriving home, my father came out and happily greeted me. After a hug and a few pleasantries, he looked into the backseat of the car and saw three Jackson Lake Lodge towels\u2014the kind you cannot buy. With a disappointed look he merely said, \u201cI expected more of you.\u201d I hadn\u2019t thought that what I had done was all that wrong. To me these towels were but a symbol of a full summer\u2019s work at a luxury hotel, a rite of passage. Nevertheless, by taking them I felt I had lost the trust and confidence of my father, and I was devastated.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/three-towels-and-a-25-cent-newspaper.p8\" class=\"\">The following weekend I adjusted the plywood floorboard in my car, filled the radiator with water, and began the 370-mile (595-km) round trip back to Jackson Lake Lodge to return three towels. My father never asked why I was returning to the lodge, and I never explained. It just didn\u2019t need to be said. This was an expensive and painful lesson on honesty that has stayed with me throughout my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/three-towels-and-a-25-cent-newspaper.p9\" class=\"\">Sadly, some of the greatest missing values in today\u2019s world are honesty and integrity. In the past few years an increasing number of business leaders have been exposed for dishonesty and other forms of bad behavior. As a result, tens of thousands of loyal, long-term employees have lost their livelihoods and pensions. For some this has resulted in loss of homes, change of education and other life plans. We read and hear of widespread cheating in our schools, with more concern about receiving a grade or degree than learning and preparation. We hear of students who have cheated their way through medical school and are now performing complicated procedures on their patients. The elderly and others are victims of scam artists, often resulting in the loss of homes or life savings. Always this dishonesty and lack of integrity are based on greed, arrogance, and disrespect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/three-towels-and-a-25-cent-newspaper.p10\" class=\"\">In Proverbs we read, \u201cLying lips are abomination to the Lord: but they that deal truly are his delight\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"45250\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45250)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45250)\">Proverbs 12:22<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/three-towels-and-a-25-cent-newspaper.p11\" class=\"\">Mormon, speaking of the converted Lamanites who were known as the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, wrote: \u201cAnd they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered among the people who were of the church of God.

When he handed me a newspaper, I put a quarter in the machine and, trying not to offend but to make a point, jokingly said, \u201cJim, for 25 cents I can maintain my integrity. A dollar, questionable, but 25 cents\u2014no, not for 25 cents.\u201d You see, I remembered well the experience of three towels and a broken-down 1941 Hudson. A few minutes later we passed the same newspaper vending machine. I noticed that Jim had broken away from our group and was stuffing quarters in the vending machine. I tell you this incident not to portray myself as an unusual example of honesty, but only to emphasize the lessons of three towels and a 25-cent newspaper.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/three-towels-and-a-25-cent-newspaper.p14\" class=\"\">There will never be honesty in the business world, in the schools, in the home, or anyplace else until there is honesty in the heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/three-towels-and-a-25-cent-newspaper.p15\" class=\"\">Important and lasting lessons are often taught through simple examples\u2014perhaps as simple as three towels or a 25-cent newspaper.

For Latter-day Saints, honesty is an important requirement for entering the Lord\u2019s holy temple. Honesty is embedded in the covenants that we make in the temple. Each Sunday as we partake of the holy emblems of the Savior\u2019s flesh and blood, we again renew our basic and sacred covenants\u2014which encompass honesty. As Latter-day Saints we have a sacred obligation to not only teach the principles of honesty, but also to live them, perhaps with examples as simple as three towels or a 25-cent newspaper.
