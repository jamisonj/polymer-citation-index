To the world we testify that he was the prophet of God foreordained to bring about the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Through the inspired sacrifices of God\u2019s children through the ages, the foundation of the Restoration was laid, and the world is preparing for the Second Coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p6\" class=\"\">His gospel was first established on the earth beginning with Adam and has been taught in every dispensation through such prophets as Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and others. Each of these prophets foretold the coming of Jesus Christ to atone for the sins of the world. Those prophecies have been fulfilled. The Savior did establish His Church. He called His Apostles and established His priesthood. Most importantly, He laid down His life and took it up that all will rise again, thus carrying out the atoning sacrifice. But that was not the end.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p7\" class=\"\">After the Savior\u2019s Resurrection, He commissioned His Apostles to lead the Church and administer gospel ordinances. Faithful to this charge, they were persecuted, and some were eventually martyred. As a result, the Lord\u2019s priesthood authority was no longer on earth, and the world fell into spiritual darkness. In the centuries that followed, God\u2019s children had the Light of Christ, could pray, and could feel the influence of the Holy Ghost. But the fulness of the gospel had been lost. There was no one left on earth with the power and authority to lead the Church or perform sacred ordinances such as baptism, conferral of the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the saving ordinances of the temple. Almost everyone was denied access to the scriptures, and most people were illiterate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p8\" class=\"\">Making the scriptures available and helping God\u2019s children learn to read them was the first step to the Restoration of the gospel. Originally the Bible was written in Hebrew and Greek, languages unknown to common people throughout Europe. Then, about 400 years after the Savior\u2019s death, the Bible was translated by Jerome into Latin. But still the scriptures were not widely available. Copies had to be written by hand, usually by monks, each taking years to complete.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p9\" class=\"\">Then, through the influence of the Holy Ghost, an interest in learning began to grow in the hearts of people. This Renaissance or \u201crebirth\u201d spread throughout Europe. In the late 1300s, a priest named John Wycliffe initiated a translation of the Bible from Latin into English. Because English was then an emerging, unrefined language, church leaders deemed it unsuitable to convey God\u2019s word. Some leaders were certain that if people could read and interpret the Bible for themselves, its doctrine would be corrupted; others feared that people with independent access to the scriptures would not need the church and would cease to support it financially. Consequently, Wycliffe was denounced as a heretic and treated accordingly. After he died and was buried, his bones were dug up and burned. But God\u2019s work could not be stopped.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p10\" class=\"\">While some were inspired to translate the Bible, others were inspired to prepare the means to publish it. By 1455 Johannes Gutenberg had invented a press with movable type, and the Bible was one of the first books he printed. For the first time it was possible to print multiple copies of the scriptures and at a cost many could afford.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p11\" class=\"\">Meanwhile, the inspiration of God also rested upon explorers. In 1492 Christopher Columbus set out to find a new path to the Far East. Columbus was led by the hand of God in his journey. He said, \u201cGod gave me the faith, and afterwards the courage.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-25911_000_030\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Quoted in Mark E.

In the early 1500s young William Tyndale enrolled at Oxford University. There he studied the work of the Bible scholar Erasmus, who believed that the scriptures are \u201cthe food of [a man\u2019s] soul; and \u2026 must permeate the very depths of [his] heart and mind.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-25911_000_030\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Quoted in Benson Bobrick, <span class=\"emphasis\">Wide as the Waters: The Story of the English Bible and the Revolution It Inspired<\/span> (2001), 89.]<\/span><\/sup> Through his studies, Tyndale developed a love for God\u2019s word and a desire that all God\u2019s children be able to feast on it for themselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p13\" class=\"\">At about this time, a German priest and professor named Martin Luther identified 95 points of error in the church of his day, which he boldly sent in a letter to his superiors. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli printed 67 articles of reform. John Calvin in Switzerland, John Knox in Scotland, and many others assisted in this effort. A reformation had begun.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p14\" class=\"\">Meanwhile, William Tyndale had become a trained priest and was fluent in eight languages. He believed a direct translation from Greek and Hebrew into English would be more accurate and readable than Wycliffe\u2019s translation from Latin. So Tyndale, enlightened by the Spirit of God, translated the New Testament and a portion of the Old Testament. His friends warned him that he would be killed for doing so, but he was undaunted. Once, while disputing with a learned man, he said, \u201cIf God spare my life, ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plough shall know more of the scripture than thou dost.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-25911_000_030\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Quoted in S.

But the belief for which he gave his life was not lost. Millions have come to experience for themselves what Tyndale taught throughout his life: \u201cThe nature of God\u2019s word is, that whosoever read it, \u2026 it will begin immediately to make him every day better and better, till he be grown into a perfect man.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-25911_000_030\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Quoted in Wilcox, <span class=\"emphasis\">Fire in the Bones,<\/span> xv.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p16\" class=\"\">Turbulent political times brought change. Because of a disagreement with the church in Rome, King Henry VIII declared himself the head of the church in England and required that copies of the English Bible be placed in every parish church. Hungry for the gospel, people flocked to these churches, reading the scriptures to one another until their voices gave out. The Bible was also used as a primer to teach reading. Though martyrdoms continued across Europe, the dark night of ignorance was coming to an end. Declared one preacher before being burned, \u201cWe shall this day light such a candle, by God\u2019s Grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-25911_000_030\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Quoted in Bobrick, <span class=\"emphasis\">Wide as the Waters,<\/span> 168; see also James E.

By God\u2019s grace, the light grew brighter. Aware of the divisions within his own country, English King James I agreed to a new official version of the Bible. It has been estimated that over 80 percent of William Tyndale\u2019s translations of the New Testament and a good portion of the Old Testament (the Pentateuch, or Genesis through Deuteronomy, and Joshua through Chronicles) were retained in the King James Version.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-25911_000_030\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Wilcox, <span class=\"emphasis\">Fire in the Bones,<\/span> 125\u201326, 197; <span class=\"emphasis\">Fox\u2019s Book of Martyrs,<\/span> William Byron Forbush, ed.

Other colonists soon followed, including those like Roger Williams, founder and later governor of Rhode Island, who continued to search for Christ\u2019s true Church.
