We are bound together in the greatest cause and the most sacred work in all the world. To exercise these great powers, we must be clean in thought and action. We must do nothing which would impair the full exercise of this transcendent power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p6\" class=\"\">Priesthood is the greatest power on earth. Worlds were created by and through the priesthood. To safeguard this sacred power, all priesthood holders act under the direction of those who hold the keys of the priesthood. These keys bring order into our lives and into the organization of the Church. For us, priesthood power is the power and authority delegated by God to act in His name for the salvation of His children. Caring for others is the very essence of priesthood responsibility. It is the power to bless, to heal, and to administer the saving ordinances of the gospel. Righteous priesthood authority is most needed within the walls of our own homes. It must be exercised in great love. This is true of all priesthood holders\u2014deacon, teacher, priest, elder, high priest, patriarch, Seventy, and Apostle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p7\" class=\"\">I first learned the principle of priesthood caring from my own father and grandfather, but I have also seen it manifested by thousands of worthy men. I learned great lessons of priesthood caring as a teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood. I was assigned to serve as a junior home teaching companion to a great Scandinavian immigrant named Algot Johnson from Malmo, Sweden. I learned to admire everything about him, including his endearing Swedish accent. He taught me the true meaning of the Lord\u2019s instruction to the teachers:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cThe teacher\u2019s duty is to watch over the church always, and be with and strengthen them;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd see that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd see that the church meet together often, and also see that all the members do their duty.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-97905_000_021\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20726\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20726)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20726)\">D&amp;C 20:53\u201355<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p11\" class=\"\">Brother Johnson had paid a great price to leave his beloved Sweden and come to the United States. He was very dedicated. Despite the difference in our ages, we became lifelong friends. When he became our ward Sunday School superintendent, he asked for me to be his counselor. I was only 17 years of age. He was a successful contractor, and when I returned home from World War II, he built my first home. When I graduated from law school, I did legal work for him, and when I billed him for my legal services, he paid me more than I asked. That did not happen very often. I cite this experience to emphasize the importance of giving every Aaronic Priesthood holder the opportunity to serve as a junior companion to faithful Melchizedek Priesthood holders.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p12\" class=\"\">The duty of home teachers cannot always be satisfied with a once-a-month visit. They need to be caring and willing to serve as the need arises. I know of members of one high priests group who take tools when they go home teaching. We do not expect home teachers to be able to fix everything, such as computers and other highly technical equipment. They can, however, offer their wisdom and experience in assisting their assigned families to find the needed help. Caring home teachers should make appointments in advance, if possible. Aaronic Priesthood home teaching companions can learn lifelong lessons and be greatly blessed by serving with faithful Melchizedek Priesthood senior companions. Brother Robert F. Jex shares his faith-strengthening experience as a junior home teaching companion many years ago:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cMy legs felt like gelatin and there was a knot in my stomach as we approached the door. I was sure that I was going to faint as my [home teaching] companion told me that this was my door.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p14\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 I was a 15-year-old home teacher climbing the stairs to the apartment of Sister Rice, a widow living in the Bountiful (Utah) First Ward. Don Gabbott, my companion, was to teach me a great lesson that night about the nurturing role of priesthood bearers to shut-ins who are cut off from the mainstream of Church activity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cBrother Gabbott had given me a topic to present to the five families assigned us, and I was frightened. \u2026 I [had] prepared \u2026 some notes on a paper, but I was unsure of how to take the lead in the presence of a high priest.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cThe response to our knocking was slow. \u2026 I was about to suggest that no one was home. Then the shrunken figure of a frail, aged sister, came around a corner in the hallway. She seemed uncertain of what waited her answer at the door. Her face brightened as she recognized Brother Gabbott. We were invited into her living room and asked to take a seat.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cAfter a short greeting, Brother Gabbott looked at me as if to say, \u2018Okay, Bob, it\u2019s time to give our message.\u2019 The knot in my stomach tightened as I began to speak. I cannot recall what I said\u2014it doesn\u2019t really matter\u2014for I was the pupil in the classroom of priesthood duty and responsibility. As I glanced up from my notes at the conclusion of my remarks, my eyes fell upon the tear-stained cheeks of that sweet, sensitive sister. She expressed her gratitude for the presence of priesthood bearers in her humble home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cI was speechless. \u2026 What had I said that had been so profound? What could I do? Fortunately, Brother Gabbott came to my rescue by bearing his testimony and asking if there were any needs in the home. There were.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cSister Rice said that she had not been feeling well and asked that she be remembered as we offered our prayer before leaving. She then turned to me and asked if I would offer that prayer. By that time, I was so overcome by the spirit of the occasion \u2026 [and] surprised that I was asked to pray when someone older and more experienced and trusted was present. Automatically, I consented and offered a benediction upon that home teaching visit, asking that a special blessing of health and strength be given to that faithful sister whom I barely knew but quickly came to love and respect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cTwenty-five years have passed since my introduction to home teaching in the home of Sister Rice, and she has long since passed away. But I cannot pass that orange-brick fourplex on Bountiful\u2019s Main Street without thinking about the experience provided by Brother Gabbott and a faithful sister who knew the appropriateness of calling upon the powers of heaven embodied in an obedient high priest and an insecure, frightened teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-97905_000_021\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cMy First Door,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">New Era,<\/span> May 1989, 27.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/power-of-the-priesthood.p21\" class=\"\">I wish to say a word to our faithful and devoted bishops.

We should avoid the bondage of crushing, unnecessary indebtedness. We should also try to have some savings to tide us over for a rainy day.
