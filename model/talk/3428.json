Gospel truth stands as a pillar of peace, security, and freedom for all who would avail themselves. And I further attest that the ultimate in revealed truth, light, and eternal assurance is inseparably connected with the temple. Those sacred buildings are reverently and accurately referred to as the house of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-house-of-the-lord.p4\" class=\"\">A temple of God in this day and age? How can this be? Most God-fearing folks think only in terms of ancient temples built when prophets lived among the people more than two thousand years ago.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-house-of-the-lord.p5\" class=\"\">Come with me inside the temple\u2014a modern temple in our day; a temple that has been dedicated to the Lord, just as ancient temples were; a special building where sacred ordinances are performed by those who have been commissioned with appropriate, divine authority. The temple is indeed a house of quiet worship\u2014everyone speaks softly, usually in whispers. All who participate dress in white. All who come have been found worthy and clean.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-house-of-the-lord.p6\" class=\"\">The temple is a house of prayer, for Heavenly Father is glorified by every ordinance performed therein. He who enters for the first time receives a pronouncement of special blessings that are not available outside the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-house-of-the-lord.p7\" class=\"\">The temple is a house of instruction\u2014yes, even divine instruction\u2014about God\u2019s eternal plan for his children. In the temple one gains a superior perspective about his personal relationship with his Maker and with the Savior\u2014yes, special knowledge about God and Jesus Christ, which is essential to the obtaining of life eternal. \u201cAnd this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29046\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29046)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29046)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-house-of-the-lord.p8\" class=\"\">The temple is a house of revelation\u2014yes, continuing revelation.

You see, eternal families reason together in family council with dad at the head.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-house-of-the-lord.p13\" class=\"\">The temple is a house of God where all of those declared worthy are extended the privilege of performing the sacred ordinances of the temple on behalf of their forebears, that in very deed the hearts of the children might be turned to their fathers, as foretold in the holy scriptures (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32863\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32863)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32863)\">Mal. 4:6<\/a><\/span>). Like all of Heavenly Father\u2019s blessings for his children, the eventual realization is always on condition of faithfulness and conformity to priesthood principles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-house-of-the-lord.p14\" class=\"\">The ultimate blessings of the temple are centered in the love and devotion between husband and wife. They must set the example\u2014they are the core. The scriptures say it best of all: \u201cNevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"684\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 684)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(684)\">1 Cor. 11:11<\/a><\/span>). Everything in this world that is counter to a tender and loyal husband-wife relationship is a tool of the adversary. Everything that promotes and perpetuates family unity\u2014mother, father, and children properly endowed with and motivated by the light and truth of Christ\u2014is in harmony with the Lord\u2019s plan for mortal man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-house-of-the-lord.p15\" class=\"\">Husbands, love your wives; wives, honor your husbands. Look to the gospel for all solutions to your problems; be a proper example to your children. That is where it all starts.

His despair was not so much over the temporal loss he had suffered, but rather, and far more important, his lovely wife and four children were unaccounted for and presumed drowned. But, within the hour good news came: his family had been miraculously saved and were waiting for him at a nearby emergency facility. The reunion that soon followed was a scene of supreme joy and happiness. His comment in the midst of the jubilation was classic: \u201cI have my family again, and although I stand without one earthly possession left to my name, I feel like a millionaire.\u201d Each family member nodded concurrence. For, you see, this family was a very special family; they had recently been sealed together for time and for all eternity in a temple of the living God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-house-of-the-lord.p23\" class=\"\">Just yesterday it was my special privilege to be present as a lovely young couple knelt at the altar of the temple. Each was dressed in robes of sparkling white. They were surrounded by a host of family and friends as these special words were spoken as part of the marriage covenant: \u201cFor time and for all eternity.\u201d You see, such was the precise nature of their <span class=\"emphasis\">forever<\/span> marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-house-of-the-lord.p24\" class=\"\">Oh, that all people everywhere could be touched by this divine teaching of light and truth that makes such a union possible, not for just a select few, but for any and all of God\u2019s children who might properly prepare themselves.

These young people had been found morally clean and worthy by their bishop. You see, bishops today are bound by the same guidelines as bishops of old, who were also taught: \u201cWho shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41960\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41960)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41960)\">Ps. 24:3\u20134<\/a><\/span>.)
