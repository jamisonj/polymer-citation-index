Unlike those who have never heard the gospel, these individuals have known some light and so have some accountability\u2014hence the urgency!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/a-brother-offended.p5\" class=\"\">This work of reactivation often involves group study and socials, but, essentially, it is done a soul at a time, quietly and with dignity. It is done less \u201cby the numbers\u201d and more \u201cby the Spirit.\u201d It is less technique than genuine caring, more extending a helping hand than writing new handbooks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/a-brother-offended.p6\" class=\"\">There are no slick tricks, and quickie campaigns usually fail, for \u201ca brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41557\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41557)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41557)\">Prov. 18:19<\/a><\/span>.) Further, while we must stand on higher ground in order to lift another, there must be no condescension or suggestion that our concern is statistical rather than spiritual. Nor are souls to be dropped soon after they have been painstakingly lifted. How many times are we supposed to find the elect anyway?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/a-brother-offended.p7\" class=\"\">A <span class=\"emphasis\">first<\/span> step is to recognize, where known, the causes of inactivity in these men. This often suggests how to customize our expressions of concern. However, never underestimate the power of privately extending a simple, loving, but direct challenge. Though it may not be reciprocated, such love is never wasted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/a-brother-offended.p8\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Second,<\/span> recognize that this work takes time; it does interrupt our regular routine. The parable of the Good Samaritan teaches us that. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32111\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32111)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32111)\">Luke 10:29\u201337<\/a><\/span>.) Some wounds require more than a quick Band-Aid.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/a-brother-offended.p9\" class=\"\">A <span class=\"emphasis\">third<\/span> step to be overseen by priesthood executive committees and ward correlation councils, is the careful matching of person to person. Organized love is better than generalized concern. Yet this redemptive labor should not be so institutionalized that friends and neighbors feel released from their responsibilities. An inspired effort is needed, for in the work of reactivation the <span class=\"emphasis\">best<\/span> approach may be the <span class=\"emphasis\">only<\/span> approach! Fasting and praying may be necessary to know when the timing is right to make an approach to a certain brother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/a-brother-offended.p10\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Fourth,<\/span> provide such individuals with a fresh opportunity to serve, because they are genuinely needed. Moses learned this principle while recruiting Hobab as a guide. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"41126\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41126)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41126)\">Num. 10:29\u201332<\/a><\/span>.) Remember, while their condition cries out for unconditional love, they usually desire a modest chance to express their own love and talents. For instance, elders quorum presidencies should organize several appropriate committees, each chaired by an active elder, who is to report regularly to the quorum presidency, with two or three active brethren to help. Each committee may be given the names of the inactive brethren most likely to respond when invited to serve on that committee, such as an athletic or welfare committee. These inactive men are less likely to respond to a general invitation to start coming to church than to a request to serve on a specific committee which takes account of their interests. One inactive brother started serving as a greeter and is now a bishop.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/a-brother-offended.p11\" class=\"\">Significantly, brethren, Church members did not become inactive while crossing the plains, when the sense of belonging and being needed was so profound.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/a-brother-offended.p12\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Fifth,<\/span> provide the needed teaching. <span class=\"emphasis\">Activation requires conversion.<\/span> Believing requires gospel beliefs to be understood. Quorum instruction and Gospel Essentials classes must be of a high quality. Attendees must feel the Spirit as they are taught. These individuals need the bread of life, not crumbs from the table. After all, the father of the prodigal son prepared a feast for the returnee\u2014he did not merely warm up some leftovers!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/a-brother-offended.p13\" class=\"\">Temple preparation seminars should feature enough informality to make real learning possible. Assign fellowshipping couples to attend these same seminars along with the inactive couples. Those attending should be lovingly encouraged to set some personal goals in order to be ready to go to the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/a-brother-offended.p14\" class=\"\">Surveys indicate 30 percent of those invited to attend seminars will attend! Of the remainder, experience shows that eight out of ten, properly approached, will permit priesthood leaders to go into their homes to teach them. Brethren, in view of such realities, what are we afraid of?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/a-brother-offended.p15\" class=\"\">These encouraging statistics suggest how important it is not to stand by and wring our hands but to do something! The reason, frankly, brethren, that so little is happening is that so little is being tried. An experienced woodcarver was asked how one begins to be a woodcarver. He said bluntly, \u201cStart making some chips.\u201d Brethren, let\u2019s start making some chips!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/a-brother-offended.p16\" class=\"\">A <span class=\"emphasis\">sixth<\/span> step is to remember the Lord\u2019s hand is in this work.

Sometimes, ironically, prevention requires no more than a few extra minutes of loving conversation or an expression of empathy. Being given the priesthood and a church assignment soon after baptism not only helps to anchor new converts, but assists other Church workers who are busy and whose hands hang down and whose knees are feeble.
