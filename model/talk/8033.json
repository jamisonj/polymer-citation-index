There we were in a crowded hallway, reciting together the Young Women theme as we said, \u201cWe will stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/general-womens-meeting\/keeping-covenants-protects-us-prepares-us-and-empowers-us.p7\" class=\"\">Tonight we gather together all over the world as His disciples, with a desire to defend and sustain the kingdom of God.
