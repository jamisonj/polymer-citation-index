What I have to say I was taught between thirty and forty years ago, principally by President J. Reuben Clark.

But in our current handbooks and other literature they are taught. In the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bishops Guide<\/span> the duties of the bishop are outlined under five major categories; one of these is entitled \u201cDirector of Welfare Services.\u201d On pages 24 to 26 of this guide, the specific duties of bishops are listed. They, together with the instructions in the <span class=\"emphasis\">Welfare Services Handbook,<\/span> should be read, studied, and implemented by every bishop.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p14\" class=\"\">In order to adequately care for the spiritual and temporal needs of his people through the facilities of Welfare Services, a bishop must know the needs of each ward member. With respect to the importance of so knowing, President Clark said in the October 1944 Conference:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cA bishop could hardly say he was doing his duty \u2026 if \u2026 he did not take stock of his whole ward to see about how much he is going to require to care for those who need help and sustenance. This could not be a mere cursory operation. \u2026 To be effective, [it] must be one that involved the visiting, by some proper authority, \u2026 every household in the ward, and for a final check, a visit by the bishop himself, to determine the proper help he must be prepared to render to every needy person in the ward.\u201d (\u201cFundamentals of Church Welfare Plan,\u201d Bishops Meeting, October 6, 1944, p. 567.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p16\" class=\"\">The effective bishop will be adequately informed on the condition of his ward members, physically, emotionally, economically, and spiritually.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p17\" class=\"\">To obtain this information, you bishops may call upon any organization in your ward or any member of the ward. Particularly you should use your ward Relief Society presidents, the Relief Society visiting teachers, and, of course, your priesthood home teachers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p18\" class=\"\">In addition to knowing their needs, <span class=\"emphasis\">the bishop should determine to what extent individuals and families can solve their own problems.<\/span> That this be done is fundamental to Welfare Services work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p19\" class=\"\">We do not bless anybody when we do for them what they can do for themselves. The purpose of Welfare Services is to promote \u201cindependence, thrift, and self-respect,\u201d and every individual should value his or her independence and labor with all their might to maintain it by being self-sustaining.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p20\" class=\"\">Next to himself, the responsibility for sustaining an individual rests upon his family\u2014parents for their children, children for their parents. It is an ungrateful child, as President Kimball has said, who, having the ability, is unwilling to assist his needy parents.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p21\" class=\"\">Finally, the individual having done all he can to maintain himself, and members of his family having done what they can do to assist him, the Church, through Welfare Services, stands ready to see that such members, <span class=\"emphasis\">who will accept the program and work in it to the extent of their ability,<\/span> are cared for, each \u201caccording to his family, according to his circumstances and his wants and needs.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16844\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16844)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16844)\">D&amp;C 51:3<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p22\" class=\"\">Having determined the need, the bishop must marshall the required resources. The Ward Welfare Services Committee has been provided to help him do this. The Ward Welfare Services Committee can be of inestimable value. I remember president Lee\u2019s saying that an inactive bishop is one who does not hold his weekly Ward Welfare Services Committee Meeting. I hope that we do not have inactive bishops in the Church today. If there are such, they should repent and become active during this coming week and continue to be active.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p23\" class=\"\">With respect to social services\u2014an important part of Welfare Services\u2014President Lee, at the Regional Representatives Seminar in October 1970, said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p24\" class=\"\">\u201c[This] program has already been a great blessing to our Church members. [It] seeks to respond to many problems that beset our members in an affluent society, and it will no doubt increase in its importance, because so many of the problems which this cluster of agencies deals with are symptomatic of our time. Members may need counseling more than clothing, and members, who, through bishops, are referred to any agency in our social services program should feel no more hesitancy in asking for help of this kind than they should in requesting help through the priesthood [production] program.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>The Responsibility of Priesthood Quorums<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p26\" class=\"\">Having reviewed now the role of the bishop in Welfare Services, I remind you stake presidents particularly that priesthood quorums have an important role in Welfare Services. They do not, of course, have the obligation prescribed to the bishop, although they should and do assist in the production and gathering of materials.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p27\" class=\"\">But the relationship of the priesthood, the spirit of lofty, unselfish brotherhood which it carries with it, does require that they individually and as quorums use their means and energy in rehabilitating spiritually and temporally their erring and unfortunate brethren.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p28\" class=\"\">In his temporal administrations, the bishop looks at every needy person as a temporary problem, caring for them until they can help themselves. The priesthood quorums must look at their needy brethren as a continuing problem, until not only their temporal needs are met but their spiritual ones also.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p29\" class=\"\">As a concrete example: a bishop extends help while the artist or craftsman is out of work and in want; a priesthood quorum sets him up in work and tries to see that he goes along until fully self-supporting and active in his priesthood duties. Much, much more attention must be given to this aspect of our welfare work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p30\" class=\"\">Now, third, I call attention to a most significant fact. Specifically, it is that help given by a bishop is far different from help given for political, social, or economic considerations in which moral and spiritual considerations play only a secondary part. The welfare of the state, not the welfare of the individual, is the measure by which that kind of relief is gauged and its amount determined. In such relief special favors are frequently given in exchange for some special favor\u2014usually political support\u2014to be given in return. Such a prostitution of relief is destructive of the state and of the individual and must be carefully guarded against.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p31\" class=\"\">Relief by private nonchurch agencies and individuals is often motivated by the highest considerations; it is given responsive to general religious commandments and admonitions. But in this giving, the emphasis is rather on the giver than the receiver. There can be a distinct element of selfishness in this\u2014one may give, because to do so makes him truly religious.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p32\" class=\"\">But the help given by the bishop is wholly different.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p33\" class=\"\">In the first place, the Church is expressly and directly to care for its poor and needy, and the bishop is charged with the responsibility of carrying out that command and is given all the rights, prerogatives, and functions necessary therefor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p34\" class=\"\">In the next place, the standard of care has been indicated.
