Indeed, we see many joys and sorrows in the world, many changed plans and new directions, many blessings that do not always look or feel like blessings, and much that humbles us and improves our patience and our faith.

President Spencer W.

That image brings to mind a line from Cervantes\u2019 great classic, <span class=\"emphasis\">Don Quixote,<\/span> that has given me comfort over the years. In that masterpiece, we find the short but very important reminder that where one door closes, another opens. Doors close regularly in our lives, and some of those closings cause genuine pain and heartache. But I <span class=\"emphasis\">do<\/span> believe that where one such door closes, another opens (and perhaps more than one), with hope and blessings in other areas of our lives that we might not have discovered otherwise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/the-opening-and-closing-of-doors.p11\" class=\"\">Our beloved quorum president, Marion G. Romney, is not able to be with us here today. My, how we miss his companionship and his wit, his experience and his leadership! President Romney has had some doors swing closed for him even in the work of his ministry. He has known considerable pain and discouragement and has seen his plans changed during these past few years. But it was he who, from this very pulpit a few years ago, said that all men and women, including the most faithful and loyal, would find adversity and affliction in their lives because, in the words of Joseph Smith, \u201cMen have to suffer that they may come upon Mount Zion and be exalted above the heavens\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 5:556; see Conference Report, Oct. 1969, p. 57).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/the-opening-and-closing-of-doors.p12\" class=\"\">President Romney then said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/the-opening-and-closing-of-doors.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cThis does not mean that we crave suffering.

Obviously, prophets of an earlier day have known adversity and difficulty as well. They were not spared these challenges any more than our generation has been spared. The great Book of Mormon patriarch, Lehi, spoke encouragingly to his son Jacob, a son born in the wilderness in a time of travail and opposition. Jacob\u2019s life was not as he might have expected it to be and not as the ideal course of experience might have outlined. He had suffered afflictions and setbacks, but Lehi promised that such afflictions would be consecrated for his son\u2019s gain (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"4202\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4202)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4202)\">2 Ne. 2:2<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/the-opening-and-closing-of-doors.p31\" class=\"\">Then Lehi added these words that have become classic:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/the-opening-and-closing-of-doors.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cFor it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things.

I take even greater comfort that the greatest of men and women, including the Son of God, have faced such opposition in order to better understand the contrast between righteousness and wickedness, holiness and misery, good and bad. From out of the dark, damp confinement of Liberty Jail, the Prophet Joseph Smith learned that if we are called to pass through tribulation, it is for our growth and experience and will ultimately be counted for our good (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18698\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18698)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18698)\">D&amp;C 122:5\u20138<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/the-opening-and-closing-of-doors.p34\" class=\"\">Where one door shuts, another opens, even for a prophet in prison.
