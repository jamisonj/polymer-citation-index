McConkie<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Of the First Council of the Seventy<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Bruce R. McConkie, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1951, pp. 146-150<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nTwo great truths must be accepted by mankind if they shall save themselves: first, that Jesus\nis the Christ, the Messiah, the Only Begotten, the very Son of God, whose atoning blood and\nresurrection save us from the physical and spiritual death brought to us by the Fall; and next,\nthat God has restored to the earth, in these last days, through the Prophet Joseph, his Holy\nPriesthood with the fullness of the everlasting gospel, for the salvation of all men on the\nearth. Without these truths man may not hope for the riches of the life hereafter. (See THE\nIMPROVEMENT ERA, vol. 38, pp. 204-205.)\n<\/p><p>\nThose words were given by the First Presidency of the Church in a testimony to the world on\nthe occasion of the one hundredth anniversary of the establishment of the Quorum of the\nTwelve Apostles in this dispensation, and if the Spirit will give me utterance, I would like to\nsay a few things with reference to them.\n<\/p><p>\nSALVATION CENTERED IN CHRIST\n<\/p><p>\nWe are the people of God. We are the members of the kingdom of God on earth, which is\nthis Church, and we have the knowledge and light and revelation which causes us to know\nthat salvation is centered in Christ. We believe in Christ. We are the Church of Christ. We\nbelieve that through his atoning blood and the sacrifice which he worked out, all men will be\nraised in immortality, that is to say, the body and the spirit will be reunited, a resurrection\nwill be brought to pass, and we believe that those who obey the laws and ordinances of the\ngospel will gain, in addition to immortality, the glorious gift of eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have the witness and knowledge that Christ was the Firstborn of the Father, that in the\nspirit world, in the pre-existent eternities, he obeyed the laws of the Father and by diligence\nand righteousness ascended even there to the status of a God.\n<\/p><p>\nWe recognize him as the Creator, under the Father, of the world and all that in it is. We\nworship him as the God who revealed his saving truths to all the ancient prophets, those\nmighty leaders who have come in every age when he has had a people on the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe that he came into the world, born of Mary, literally and actually, as we are born\nof our mothers; that he came into the world, born of God the Eternal Father, the Almighty\nElohim, literally and actually, as we are born of our earthly fathers.\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe that he had the power to lay down his life, and the power to take it up again\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27489\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27489)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27489)\">John 10:17-18<\/a><\/span>),\nbecause Mary was his mother and God was his father.\n<\/p><p>\nWe certify of Christ; we preach of Christ; and we have the knowledge that salvation is in and\nthrough him and him alone. \"Salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning\nblood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40238\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40238)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40238)\">Mosiah 3:18<\/a><\/span>), and \"how great the importance,\" as\nLehi expressed it, \"to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3531\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3531)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3531)\">2 Ne. 2:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nACCEPTANCE OF PROPHETS\n<\/p><p>\nNow it is not possible, in my judgment, for people in the world to accept Christ and come to\nsalvation, unless at one and the same time they accept the prophets whom Christ has sent and\nreceive the administration of holy ordinances under their hands.\n<\/p><p>\nChrist and his prophets are one. We could not believe in Christ if there were not prophets to\ndeclare Christ and his saving truths unto us. The Apostle Paul reasoned on this subject, and he\nsaid: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they\nhear without a preacher?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd how shall they preach, except they be sent?\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42694\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42694)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42694)\">Rom. 10:14-15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nExcept for Christ, there would be no salvation. Except for the prophets of God, sent in the\nvarious ages of the earth's history, the testimony of Christ would not be borne, the message of\nsalvation would not be taught, and there would be no legal administrators who could perform\nthe ordinances of salvation for men, that is, perform them so they will be binding on earth\nand sealed eternally in the heavens.\n<\/p><p>\nSo it is that the Lord has sent prophets. No one would suppose that he could believe in Christ\nand reject Peter, James, and John. The Lord and his prophets go hand in hand. Christ said, \"I\nam the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman\"; then he said to his Apostles, \"Ye are the\nbranches\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27501\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27501)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27501)\">John 15:1,5<\/a><\/span>).\nThe branches and the vine are connected. He taught also that if the\nbranches were torn away from him, they would wither and die and be cast into the fire\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27502\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27502)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27502)\">John 15:6<\/a><\/span>). If\npeople in the world would pick the fruit of eternal life off the branches, they have to accept\nthe prophets, for the branches are the prophets.\n<\/p><p>\nGOSPEL DISPENSATIONS\n<\/p><p>\nThis has been the system that the Lord has had from the days of Father Adam to the present\nmoment, and it will continue eternally. The Lord sent Adam in the beginning to teach the\nprinciples of salvation. Adam had a dispensation of the gospel, that is, the Lord revealed\ndirect from heaven to Adam, dispensed to him, the saving truths; and anybody that lived in\nthe days of Adam, to be saved in the celestial kingdom, had to accept Jesus Christ in whom\nsalvation lay, and also had to accept Adam as the revealer, the prophet, the legal administrator\nwho taught the laws of salvation and administered the ordinances thereof. It went in just that\nmanner in every succeeding dispensation.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the days of Enoch, if a man would be saved in the celestial kingdom, he accepted Christ as\nthe Savior of the world and Enoch as his prophet. And so in the days of Abraham, of Moses,\nof Peter, James, and John, and of this day.\n<\/p><p>\nI suppose that the Church procedure was not too different in former days. They had testimony\nmeetings then, and when people stood up in them, as they were moved upon by the Holy\nGhost, they bore witness that Jesus Christ was the Son of God who would come, and that\nAdam was his prophet, or Enoch, or the head of whatever dispensation was involved; and that\nis the way it is today. We certify of Jesus Christ, and we certify of Joseph Smith, and they\nare one. They are united perfectly.\n<\/p><p>\nFor he that receiveth my servants receiveth me; \n<\/p><p>\nAnd he that receiveth me receiveth my Father; \n<\/p><p>\nAnd he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my\nFather hath shall be given unto him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12910\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12910)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12910)\">D&amp;C 84:36-38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nVISION OF ABRAHAM\n<\/p><p>\nNow may I mention the great vision that the Patriarch Abraham had? You recall that the Lord\nshowed him the pre-existent hosts and, more particularly, the noble and great in that world.\nAbraham saw them, the intelligences, the spirit sons of God our Father, the noble and great\nspirit who were among them, and the Lord said to him, \". . . Abraham, thou art one of them;\nthou wast chosen before thou wast born\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7183\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7183)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7183)\">Abr. 3:23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs with Abraham, so with all the prophets of God. Sometimes someone may wonder, that is,\nsomeone in the world, how is it that the Father and the Son would appear to a\nfourteen-and-a-half- year-old boy in the spring of 1820, to usher in, as we express it, the\nDispensation of the Fullness of Times.\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph Smith sat with Father Abraham in the councils of eternity, and Joseph Smith was\nordained as Abraham was ordained to come down and be the head of a gospel dispensation\nhere. He had ascended by virtue of obedience, intelligence, progression, and righteousness to a\nhigh state of spiritual perfection in that world. When he came here, he brought with him the\ntalents and abilities, the deep spirituality, and the innate righteousness that he developed back\nthere under the tutelage of God the Father.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the eternal worlds, the Firstborn spirit offspring of the Father was Jehovah who is Jesus\nChrist. He was pre-eminent. Standing next to Christ was the great spirit, Michael. Christ was\nordained as a lamb slain from the foundation of the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42221\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42221)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42221)\">Rev. 13:8<\/a><\/span>), chosen to come here and be the\nRedeemer. Michael was prepared and chosen and sent here as Father Adam, the first man of\nall men, the first flesh upon the earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38991\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38991)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38991)\">Moses 3:7<\/a><\/span>),\nthe head of the human race, and the presiding high\npriest, under Christ, over all the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nPLACE OF JOSEPH SMITH\n<\/p><p>\nThe spirit men who were associated with Christ and with Adam in the pre-existent eternities,\nand who were more valiant than all their fellows, were the ones chosen to head the various\ndispensations of the gospel. One of these was the Prophet Joseph Smith. It doesn't take much\nreflection then, it seems to me, for us to know that Joseph Smith was one of the dozen\ngreatest spirits that God the Eternal Father had in all the councils of eternity; that he came so\nas to be here at the appointed time and at the express hour and at the very moment that the\nLord designed to open this dispensation He was here to take his part in that event.\n<\/p><p>\nI do not think that the Father and the Son would have appeared to an ordinary\nfourteen-and-a-half-year-old boy, if he had gone out into that grove of trees to ask the Lord\nwhich of all the churches was right (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30301\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30301)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30301)\">JS&mdash;H 1:11-19<\/a><\/span>).\nI think the Lord had been preparing Joseph Smith for that\nevent from all eternity; that Joseph Smith had the spiritual stature, the strength for\nrighteousness that enabled him to endure the vision; that he had the talent and ability to press\nforward in righteousness in the kingdom of God on earth: first, to establish it; and then,\nsomewhat, to perfect its organization before he was taken home, before he sealed his\ntestimony with his blood.\n<\/p><p>\nIn my judgment Christ and his prophets are one; and salvation in this day is, first, through\nChrist and his atoning sacrifice, and it is, second, through accepting the atoning sacrifice and\nthe doctrines of Christ as they have been revealed by the Prophet Joseph Smith, and as they\nare taught by the living oracles who wear the mantle of the Prophet and stand at this moment\nat the head of the kingdom of God on earth.\n<\/p><p>\nPERSONAL EXPERIENCE\n<\/p><p>\nMay I just tell you one experience that I had. I have never told this to any person before,\nexcept my wife. Six months ago in the Solemn Assembly, when the First Presidency of the\nChurch were sustained, as I sat down here behind one of these lower pulpits, the voice of the\nLord came into my mind as certainly, I am sure, as the voice of the Lord came into the mind\nof Enos (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21477\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21477)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21477)\">Enos 1:5,10<\/a><\/span>),\nand the very words were formed, and it said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"These are they whom I have chosen as the First Presidency of my Church. Follow\nthem\"&mdash;those few words.\n<\/p><p>\nI have had a testimony of the divinity of this work from my youth. I was reared in a family\nwhere love was the motive force, where my parents taught me righteousness, and I have\ngrown up with a testimony. But that witness was an added assurance. It meant to me, if I\nhadn't known before, which I did know before, that this is the Lord's Church; that his hand is\nover it; that he organized it; that these men who preside are called of him: that they are his\nanointed; that if we will follow them as they follow Christ, we will have eternal life, which is\nmy prayer for myself and for all Israel. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
