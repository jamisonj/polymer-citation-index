Its organization, effectiveness, and sheer goodness are respected by all who sincerely seek to understand it. The Church has programs for children, youth, men, and women. It has beautiful meetinghouses that number more than 18,000. Majestic temples\u2014now totaling 136\u2014dot the earth, with another 30 under construction or announced. A full-time missionary force of over 56,000, comprised of the young and less so, are serving in 150 countries. The Church\u2019s worldwide humanitarian work is a marvelous display of the generosity of our members. Our welfare system cares for our members and promotes self-reliance in a manner unduplicated anywhere. In this Church we have selfless lay leaders and a community of Saints who are willing to serve one another in a remarkable way. There is nothing like this Church in all the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/converted-to-his-gospel-through-his-church.p11\" class=\"\">When I was born, our family lived in a tiny cottage on the grounds of one of the great and historic meetinghouses of the Church, the Honolulu Tabernacle. I now apologize to my dear friends in the Presiding Bishopric, who oversee the facilities of the Church, but as a boy I climbed over and under and through every inch of that property, from the bottom of the water-filled reflecting pool to the top of the inside of the imposing lighted steeple. We even swung (Tarzan-like) on the long hanging vines of the huge banyan trees that are on the site.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/converted-to-his-gospel-through-his-church.p12\" class=\"\">The Church was everything to us. We went to lots of meetings, even more than we have today. We attended Primary on Thursday afternoons. Relief Society meetings were on Tuesday mornings. Mutual for the youth was Wednesday night. Saturday was for ward activities. On Sunday, men and young men would go to priesthood meeting in the morning. Midday we would attend Sunday School. Then in the evening we returned for sacrament meeting. With comings and goings and meetings, it seemed our time was consumed with Church activities all day Sunday and most other days of the week.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/converted-to-his-gospel-through-his-church.p13\" class=\"\">As much as I loved the Church, it was during those boyhood days that, for the first time, I had a sense there was something even more. When I was five years old, a major conference was held at the tabernacle. We walked down the lane on which we lived and over a small bridge leading to the stately meetinghouse and sat on about the 10th row in the large chapel. Presiding and speaking at the meeting was David\u00a0O. McKay, the President of the Church. I do not recall anything he said, but I vividly remember what I saw and what I felt. President McKay was dressed in a cream-colored suit and, with his wavy white hair, looked very regal. In the tradition of the islands, he wore a triple-thick red carnation lei. As he spoke, I felt something quite intense and very personal. I later understood that I was feeling the influence of the Holy Spirit. We sang the closing hymn.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">Who\u2019s on the Lord\u2019s side?

Therein lies a danger. It is possible to be active in the Church and less active in the gospel. Let me stress: activity in the Church is a highly desirable goal; however, it is insufficient. Activity in the Church is an outward indication of our spiritual desire. If we attend our meetings, hold and fulfill Church responsibilities, and serve others, it is publicly observed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/converted-to-his-gospel-through-his-church.p21\" class=\"\">By contrast, the things of the gospel are usually less visible and more difficult to measure, but they are of greater eternal importance. For example, how much faith do we really have? How repentant are we? How meaningful are the ordinances in our lives? How focused are we on our covenants?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/converted-to-his-gospel-through-his-church.p22\" class=\"\">I repeat: we need the gospel <span class=\"emphasis\">and<\/span> the Church. In fact, the purpose of the Church is to help us live the gospel. We often wonder: How can someone be fully active in the Church as a youth and then not be when they are older? How can an adult who has regularly attended and served stop coming? How can a person who was disappointed by a leader or another member allow that to end their Church participation? Perhaps the reason is they were not sufficiently converted to the gospel\u2014the things of eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\"><p class=\"preamble\">I suggest three fundamental ways to have the gospel be our foundation:<\/p><ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Deepen our understanding of Deity.<\/span> A sustained knowledge of and love for the three members of the Godhead are indispensable. Mindfully pray to the Father, in the name of the Son, and seek direction from the Holy Ghost. Couple prayer with constant study and humble pondering to continually build unshakable faith in Jesus Christ. \u201cFor how knoweth a man the master \u2026 who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122833\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122833)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122833)\">Mosiah 5:13<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Focus on the ordinances and covenants.<\/span> If there are any of the essential ordinances yet to be performed in your life, intently prepare to receive each of them. Then we need to establish the discipline to live faithful to our covenants, fully using the weekly gift of the sacrament. Many of us are not being regularly changed by its cleansing power because of our lack of reverence for this holy ordinance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Unite the gospel with the Church.<\/span> As we concentrate on the gospel, the Church will become more, not less, of a blessing in our lives. As we come to each meeting prepared to \u201cseek learning, even by study and also by faith\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122834\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122834)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122834)\">D&amp;C 88:118<\/a><\/span>), the Holy Spirit will be our teacher. If we come to be entertained, we often will be disappointed. President Spencer\u00a0W.
