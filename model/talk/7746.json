However, with all the heavenly blessings bestowed upon us, Satan, ever so real, is ever so active, and conflicting messages are continually bombarding all of us. The angel Moroni warned the young Prophet Joseph Smith that his name would be known for good and evil throughout the world (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120682\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120682)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120682)\">Joseph Smith\u2014History 1:33<\/a><\/span>), and never has the fulfillment of a prophecy been more evident. The Prophet gave his life for his testimony, and the attacks continue today against the Church and even the Savior Himself. The reality of the Savior, His atoning sacrifice, and its universal application for all of us is challenged and often dismissed as a myth or the baseless hope of a weak and uneducated mind. Furthermore, the reality of the Restoration of the gospel in these latter days continues to be challenged. The continual bombardment of such messages may cause confusion, doubt, and pessimism, each attacking the fundamental truths we believe in, our faith in God, and our hope in the future.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/faith-the-choice-is-yours.p6\" class=\"\">This might be the reality of our world, but we can still choose how we react to it. When our sacred doctrine and beliefs are challenged, this is our opportunity to become acquainted with God in a most private and intimate manner. This is our opportunity to choose.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/faith-the-choice-is-yours.p7\" class=\"\">Because of the conflicts and challenges we face in today\u2019s world, I wish to suggest a single choice\u2014a choice of peace and protection and a choice that is appropriate for all. That choice is faith. Be aware that faith is not a free gift given without thought, desire, or effort. It does not come as the dew falls from heaven. The Savior said, \u201cCome unto me\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120683\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120683)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120683)\">Matthew 11:28<\/a><\/span>) and \u201cKnock, and it shall be [given] you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120684\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120684)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120684)\">Matthew 7:7<\/a><\/span>). These are action verbs\u2014<span class=\"emphasis\">come, knock.<\/span> They are choices. So I say, choose faith. Choose faith over doubt, choose faith over fear, choose faith over the unknown and the unseen, and choose faith over pessimism.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/faith-the-choice-is-yours.p8\" class=\"\">Alma\u2019s classic discussion on faith, as recorded in the 32nd chapter of Alma in the Book of Mormon, is a series of choices to ensure the development and the preservation of our faith. Alma gave us a directive to choose. His were words of action initiated by choosing. He used the words <span class=\"emphasis\">awake, arouse, experiment, exercise, desire, work,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">plant.<\/span> Then Alma explained that if we make these choices and do not cast the seed out by unbelief, then \u201cit will begin to swell within [our] breasts\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120685\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120685)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120685)\">Alma 32:28<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/faith-the-choice-is-yours.p9\" class=\"\">Yes, faith is a choice, and it must be sought after and developed. Thus, we are responsible for our own faith. We are also responsible for our lack of faith. The choice is yours.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/faith-the-choice-is-yours.p10\" class=\"\">There is much that I do not know. I do not know the details of the organization of matter into the beautiful world we live in. I do not understand the intricacies of the Atonement, how the Savior\u2019s sacrifice can cleanse all repentant people, or how the Savior could suffer \u201cthe pain of all men\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120686\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120686)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120686)\">D&amp;C 18:11<\/a><\/span>). I do not know where the city of Zarahemla was, as referred to in the Book of Mormon. I do not know why my beliefs sometimes conflict with assumed scientific or secular knowledge. Perhaps these are matters our Father in Heaven described as the \u201cmysteries \u2026 of heaven\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120687\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120687)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120687)\">D&amp;C 107:19<\/a><\/span>) that will be revealed at a later date.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/faith-the-choice-is-yours.p11\" class=\"\">But while I don\u2019t know everything, I know the important. I know the plain and simple gospel truths that lead to salvation and exaltation. I know that the Savior did suffer the pain of all men and that all repentant people can be cleansed from sin. And what I don\u2019t know or don\u2019t completely understand, with the powerful aid of my faith, I bridge the gap and move on, partaking of the promises and blessings of the gospel. And then, as Alma teaches, our faith brings us to a perfect knowledge (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120688\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120688)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120688)\">Alma 32:34<\/a><\/span>). By moving forward into the unknown, armed only with hope and desire, we show evidence of our faith and our devotion to the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/faith-the-choice-is-yours.p12\" class=\"\">And so, following Alma\u2019s formula, let us choose.
