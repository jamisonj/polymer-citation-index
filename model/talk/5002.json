It has seemed that one of the inevitable side effects that occurs as people apply gospel principles in their lives is that their material circumstances also improve. This does not suggest that it should be the right nor the expectation of all who accept the gospel of Jesus Christ to become wealthy in the possession of the world\u2019s goods. The Lord has made it clear, however, that when his people are obedient, he desires to bless them with the necessities and the comforts of life so that none should live in want.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/beware-lest-thou-forget-the-lord.p10\" class=\"\">To the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord said: \u201cI have made the earth rich, and behold it is my footstool, wherefore, again I will stand upon it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/beware-lest-thou-forget-the-lord.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd I hold forth and deign to give unto you greater riches, even a land of promise, a land flowing with milk and honey, upon which there shall be no curse when the Lord cometh.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19416\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19416)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19416)\">D&amp;C 38:17\u201318<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/beware-lest-thou-forget-the-lord.p12\" class=\"\">Historically, the abundance with which the Lord has blessed his people has proved to be one of their greatest tests.
