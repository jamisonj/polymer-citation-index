It is a\ngreat work in which they are engaged, and they are unafraid. You missionaries who are\npresent at this conference, remember, please, that you are in the service of God; and all the\nsacred scriptures&mdash;the scriptures are great and many&mdash;have been have been entrusted to you to\nstudy, to think about, and to teach.\n<\/p><p>\nA SACRED CALLING\n<\/p><p>\nYesterday we heard beautifully expressed the admonition of Jesus Christ to His disciples to go\nforth and preach the Gospel unto all people\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32974\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32974)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32974)\">Mark 16:15<\/a><\/span>),\nand that causes us to recall the words of the Lord\nthat have been written by the Prophet Joseph Smith:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of My disciples, whom I\nhave chosen in these last days\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11834\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11834)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11834)\">D&amp;C 1:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYou are called to go forth to learn, and to teach, and to bear your testimonies, which are\nsacred. And when you do bear your testimonies, it is the depths speaking unto the depths of\npeople's souls.\n<\/p><p>\nAbove the door of the School of Music at Harvard University are these words: \"To charm, to\nstrengthen, and to teach, these are the three great cords of might.\" Remember, my fellow\nmissionaries, the words of a prophet of old when he said:\n<\/p><p>\nWe have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their\ndays, in the times of old. . . . For they got not the land in possession by their\nown sword, neither did their own arm save them; but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the\nlight of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favor unto them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41725\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41725)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41725)\">Ps. 44:1,3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYou must awaken, strengthen, teach all people, and with your faith in the Lord securely fixed,\nyou will be able to reach the hearts of those people with whom you speak. It is truth and\nsincerity that are called for today, and you have the power to say: \"In the name of Jesus\nChrist of Nazareth, rise up and walk\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7504\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7504)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7504)\">Acts 3:6<\/a><\/span>).\nYou are called to do service. You are servants of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a great thing it is to say to people, \"We believe in God, the Eternal Father.\" Think of it!\nThe Creator of heaven and earth and the stars, the Father of all things, our Father and our\nGod. \"And in Jesus Christ,\" the Redeemer of the world, Christ the King, our Lord, who died\nfor us that we might have life eternal if we will but work out our own destinies by Him.\n\"And in the Holy Ghost\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6602\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6602)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6602)\">A of F 1:1<\/a><\/span>).\nWhat a sacred message you and I carry to the world!\n<\/p><p>\nVISITORS AT TEMPLE SQUARE IMPRESSED\n<\/p><p>\nBefore any of you were admitted to these grounds this morning, I met a lady and gentleman\njust outside the gate and because of their desire to see the flowers, trees, and buildings, I had\nthem admitted with me, when I explained something of the history of the temple and\ntabernacle, the sea gull monument, and the monuments of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. The\nconversation was soon over, when the gentleman said: \"I take it that you are a Mormon. We\nare Lutherans. I have often wondered what you people believe.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYou see, there was a family with certain ideals of life, as I had my ideals of life. The very\nspirit of the surroundings gave them a feeling of reverence, for they so expressed themselves.\nSaid the lady: \"What noble buildings to be created by the pioneers of your state. Only good\npeople could build such houses of worship.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow, my brother missionaries before we can teach, we must get on common ground, with\nthat love that has just been spoken about, with that genuineness of understanding of the\nhuman heart. This man said, \"I am a Lutheran.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI had the pleasure of saying to him, \"I remember what Luther taught his people when he Said:\n'I believe it takes the truth of the heart and soul to understand the truths of God.'\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe replied: \"I believe that.\" And continuing, he said, \"You are a great admirer of Luther?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Yes, very much so.\" I will not go into detail, for my time is up, but when he went through\nthe gate he turned to me and said: \"And I want to say to you, friend, that I am an admirer\nnow of Joseph Smith, who, you say, is a prophet of God.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYou see, we came on common ground, and he felt happy that we found something good in\nhis belief, and I felt happier that he found something noble in mine.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you, and let us all remember that we are missionaries of God, declaring the Gospel\nof His kingdom, that it may be lodged in the hearts of men. I have a humble testimony of this\ngreat work of God that has been revealed in these the last days through prophecy, of those\nservants who have been near to God and have spoken for him and His holy word. God bless\nyou all, I ask, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
