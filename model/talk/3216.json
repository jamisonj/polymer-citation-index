McKay told from this pulpit of the experience of some of those in the Martin handcart company. Many of these early converts had emigrated from Europe and were too poor to buy oxen or horses and a wagon. They were forced by their poverty to pull handcarts containing all of their belongings across the plains by their own brute strength. President McKay relates an occurrence which took place some years after the heroic exodus: \u201cA teacher, conducting a class, said it was unwise ever to attempt, even to permit them [the Martin handcart company] to come across the plains under such conditions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-refiners-fire.p6\" class=\"\">\u201c[According to a class member,] some sharp criticism of the Church and its leaders was being indulged in for permitting any company of converts to venture across the plains with no more supplies or protection than a handcart caravan afforded.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-refiners-fire.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cAn old man in the corner \u2026 sat silent and listened as long as he could stand it, then he arose and said things that no person who heard him will ever forget. His face was white with emotion, yet he spoke calmly, deliberately, but with great earnestness and sincerity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-refiners-fire.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cIn substance [he] said, \u2018I ask you to stop this criticism. You are discussing a matter you know nothing about. Cold historic facts mean nothing here, for they give no proper interpretation of the questions involved. Mistake to send the Handcart Company out so late in the season? Yes. But I was in that company and my wife was in it and Sister Nellie Unthank whom you have cited was there, too. We suffered beyond anything you can imagine and many died of exposure and starvation, but did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism? <span class=\"emphasis\">Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the Church, because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-refiners-fire.p9\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018I have pulled my handcart when I was so weak and weary from illness and lack of food that I could hardly put one foot ahead of the other. I have looked ahead and seen a patch of sand or a hill slope and I have said, I can go only that far and there I must give up, for I cannot pull the load through it.\u2019\u201d He continues: \u201c\u2018I have gone on to that sand and when I reached it, the cart began pushing me. I have looked back many times to see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew then that the angels of God were there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-refiners-fire.p10\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018Was I sorry that I chose to come by handcart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. <span class=\"emphasis\">The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay, and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Handcart Company.\u2019\u201d<\/span> (<span class=\"emphasis\">Relief Society Magazine,<\/span> Jan. 1948, p. 8.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-refiners-fire.p11\" class=\"\">Here then is a great truth. In the pain, the agony, and the heroic endeavors of life, we pass through a refiner\u2019s fire, and the insignificant and the unimportant in our lives can melt away like dross and make our faith bright, intact, and strong. In this way the divine image can be mirrored from the soul. It is part of the purging toll exacted of some to become acquainted with God. In the agonies of life, we seem to listen better to the faint, godly whisperings of the Divine Shepherd.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-refiners-fire.p12\" class=\"\">Into every life there come the painful, despairing days of adversity and buffeting. There seems to be a full measure of anguish, sorrow, and often heartbreak for everyone, including those who earnestly seek to do right and be faithful. The thorns that prick, that stick in the flesh, that hurt, often change lives which seem robbed of significance and hope. This change comes about through a refining process which often seems cruel and hard. In this way the soul can become like soft clay in the hands of the Master in building lives of faith, usefulness, beauty, and strength. For some, the refiner\u2019s fire causes a loss of belief and faith in God, but those with eternal perspective understand that such refining is part of the perfection process.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-refiners-fire.p13\" class=\"\">In our extremities, it is possible to become born again, born anew, renewed in heart and spirit.

No person whose soul is illuminated by the burning Spirit of God can in this world of sin and dense darkness remain passive. He is driven by an irresistible urge to fit himself to be an active agent of God in furthering righteousness and in freeing the lives and minds of men from the bondage of sin.\u201d (In Conference Report, 4 Oct. 1941, p. 89.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-refiners-fire.p17\" class=\"\">The feelings of being reborn were expressed by Parley P.

Central to solving these problems is the great need to get back on the right track and, if necessary, engage in each of the steps for full and complete repentance. Through this great principle, many things can be made fully right and all things better. We can go to others for help. To whom can we go? Elder Orson F. Whitney asked and answered this question: \u201cTo whom do we look, in days of grief and disaster, for help and consolation? \u2026 They are men and women who have suffered, and out of their experience in suffering they bring forth the riches of their sympathy and condolences as a blessing to those now in need.
