A lesson for us lies in the account of the life of the Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p4\" class=\"\">Soon after his baptism Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wild, uncultivated wilderness. There he remained for forty days and nights, preparing himself for the formal ministry which was then to begin. The greatest task ever to be accomplished in this world lay before him, and he needed divine strength. Throughout these days in the wilderness he chose to fast, that his mortal body might be completely subjected to the divine influence of his Father\u2019s Spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p5\" class=\"\">When Jesus had completed the fast of forty days and had communed with God, he was, in this hungry and physically weakened state, left to be tempted of the devil. That, too, was to be part of his preparation. Such a time is always the tempter\u2019s moment\u2014when we are emotionally or physically spent, when we are weary, vulnerable, and least prepared to resist the insidious suggestions he makes. This was an hour of danger\u2014the kind of moment in which many men fall and succumb to the subtle allurement of the devil.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p6\" class=\"\">Satan\u2019s first temptation was to entice Jesus to satisfy his craving for food, that most basic, physical, biological need. It was a temptation of the senses, an appeal to appetite, and in many ways the most common and most dangerous of the devil\u2019s allurements. \u201cIf thou be the Son of God,\u201d he said, \u201ccommand that these stones be made bread.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36415\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36415)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36415)\">Matt. 4:3<\/a><\/span>.) During the long weeks of seclusion, the Savior had been sustained by the exaltation of spirit that would naturally accompany such meditation, prayer, and communion with the heavens. In such a devoted spirit, bodily appetites were subdued and superceded, but now the demands of the flesh were inevitable.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p7\" class=\"\">Satan was not simply tempting Jesus to eat. Had he suggested, \u201cGo down out of this wilderness and obtain food from the bread maker,\u201d there would have been no temptation because undoubtedly Jesus intended to eat at the close of his fast. Satan\u2019s temptation was to have him eat in a spectacular way\u2014using his divine powers for selfish purposes. The temptation was in the invitation to turn stones into bread miraculously, instantaneously, without waiting or postponing physical gratification. His reply to the tempter was crystal clear: \u201cIt is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36417\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36417)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36417)\">Matt. 4:4<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p8\" class=\"\">Then followed the second temptation. Realizing that he had utterly failed in his attempt to induce Jesus to use his divine powers for personal, physical gratification and having seen Jesus defer totally to the will and spirit of his Father\u2019s sustenance, Satan went to the other extreme and tempted Jesus to wantonly throw himself upon the Father\u2019s protection. He took Jesus into the Holy City, to the pinnacle of the temple overlooking the spacious courts and people below, and quoted scripture:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cIf thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36418\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36418)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36418)\">Matt. 4:6<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"41936\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41936)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41936)\">Ps. 91:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p10\" class=\"\">There lurked in this appeal from Satan another temptation of the human side of mortal nature\u2014the temptation to perform some dazzling feat, some astounding exploit which might bring crowds of amazed and attentive onlookers. Surely leaping from the dizzy heights of the temple turret and landing in the courtyard unhurt would be such a feat. This would be public recognition that Jesus was a superior being and did have a message from on high. It would be a sign and a wonder, the fame of which would spread like wildfire throughout all Judaea and cause many to believe that the Messiah had indeed come. But faith is to precede the miracle; miracles are not to precede the faith. Jesus, of course, answered scripture for scripture by replying, \u201cIt is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36420\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36420)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36420)\">Matt. 4:7<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"21305\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21305)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21305)\">Deut. 6:16<\/a><\/span>.) Once more the purposes of Satan were thwarted and Christ became the victor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p11\" class=\"\">In his third temptation, the devil casts away all subtlety and scripture and all deviousness and disguise. Now he staked everything on a blunt, bold proposition. From a high mountain he showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them\u2014the cities, the fields, the flocks, the herds, and everything nature could offer. Though they were not his to give, Satan offered them all to Jesus\u2014to him who had lived as a modest village carpenter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p12\" class=\"\">With wealth, splendor, and earthly glory spread before them, Satan said unto him, \u201cAll these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36421\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36421)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36421)\">Matt. 4:9<\/a><\/span>.) In a final ploy Satan was falling back on one of his false but fundamental propositions, one which resulted in his leading one-third of the hosts from heaven and continues to direct his miserable efforts against the children of men here on earth. It is the proposition that everyone has a price, that material things finally matter most, that ultimately you can buy anything in this world for money.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p13\" class=\"\">Jesus knew that if he were faithful to his Father and obedient to every commandment, he would inherit \u201call that [the] Father hath\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16726\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16726)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16726)\">D&amp;C 84:38<\/a><\/span>)\u2014and so would any other son or daughter of God. The surest way to lose the blessings of time or eternity is to accept them on Satan\u2019s terms. Lucifer seemed to have forgotten that this was the Man who would later preach, \u201cFor what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cOr what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33274\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33274)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33274)\">Mark 8:36\u201337<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p15\" class=\"\">In power and dignity, Jesus commanded, \u201cGet thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36422\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36422)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36422)\">Matt. 4:10<\/a><\/span>.) Anguished and defeated Satan turned and went away. \u201cAnd when the devil had ended all the temptation,\u201d Luke adds, \u201che departed from him for a season.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31954\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31954)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31954)\">Luke 4:13<\/a><\/span>.)

There is, of course, running through all of these temptations, Satan\u2019s insidious suggestion that Jesus was not the Son of God, the doubt implied in the tempter\u2019s repeated use of the word if. \u201cIf thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36416\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36416)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36416)\">Matt. 4:3<\/a><\/span>.) \u201cIf thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36419\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36419)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36419)\">Matt. 4:6<\/a><\/span>.) These, of course, were foreshadows of that final, desperate temptation which would come three years later: \u201cIf thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36487\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36487)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36487)\">Matt. 27:40<\/a><\/span>.) But Jesus patiently withstood that ploy also, knowing in due time every knee would bow and every tongue confess.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p17\" class=\"\">It was not necessary then, or ever, for Jesus to satisfy the curiosity of men, least of all unholy men. So as victory in every encounter came to Jesus, the pathos and tragedy of Lucifer\u2019s life is even more obvious: First bold and taunting and tempting; then pleading and weak and desperate; finally, and ultimately, simple banishment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p18\" class=\"\">The question for us now is\u2014will we succeed? Will we resist? Will we wear the victor\u2019s crown? Satan may have lost Jesus, but he does not believe he has lost us. He continues to tempt, taunt, and plead for our loyalty. We should take strength for this battle from the fact that Christ was victorious not as a God but as a man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p19\" class=\"\">It is important to remember that Jesus was capable of sinning, that he could have succumbed, that the plan of life and salvation could have been foiled, but that he remained true. Had there been no possibility of his yielding to the enticement of Satan, there would have been no real test, no genuine victory in the result. If he had been stripped of the faculty to sin, he would have been stripped of his very agency. It was he who had come to safeguard and ensure the agency of man. He had to retain the capacity and ability to sin had he willed so to do. As Paul wrote, \u201cThough he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24450\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24450)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24450)\">Heb. 5:8<\/a><\/span>); and he \u201cwas in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24448\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24448)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24448)\">Heb. 4:15<\/a><\/span>). He was perfect and sinless, not because he had to be, but rather because he clearly and determinedly wanted to be. As the Doctrine and Covenants records, \u201cHe suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16626\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16626)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16626)\">D&amp;C 20:22<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-temptations-of-christ.p20\" class=\"\">What about us? We live in a world of temptation\u2014temptation that seems more real and oppressively rampant than any since the days of Noah. Are we remaining faithful in such a world?

Why, they come to us in our social gatherings, they come to us at our weddings, they come to us in our politics, they come to us in our business relations, on the farm, in the mercantile establishment, in our dealings in all the affairs of life, we find these insidious influences working, and it is when they manifest themselves to the consciousness of each individual that the defense of truth ought to exert itself.\u201d (David O.
