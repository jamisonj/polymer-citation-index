That is the commandment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p4\" class=\"\">When the Savior lived on this earth, he taught that we are to love God and keep his commandments. Jesus said, \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36095\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36095)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36095)\">Matt. 22:37<\/a><\/span>.) This is the first and great commandment. It is much easier to know the commandment than it is to live it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p5\" class=\"\">Why should the Lord command his children to love him with all their heart, and with all their soul, and with all their mind? There is great wisdom and divine security for mortal man in full and complete love for God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p6\" class=\"\">God created the heavens and the earth and all plant and animal life upon the earth. God created the universe with all of its profound greatness and blessings. The greatest of all miracles is God\u2019s creation of man in his own image and likeness; eyes that can see, ears that can hear, minds that can reason were created within our mortal mothers. We know that our mortal mothers do not know how to make eyes that can see and ears that can hear and mortal minds that can reason. God said that he created man in his own image and likeness. Our creation and mortal birth is evidence of divine power. All that we have that is good for this life and eternal life comes from God. We owe our full respect, dedication, allegiance, and love to him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p7\" class=\"\">The alternatives are to love Satan or some other part of God\u2019s creations. Satan did not participate in any of the creations that were for the good of man. We owe him absolutely nothing. But some pay tribute to Satan through bad temper, quarreling, dishonesty, adultery, covetousness, drugs, disrespect for God and Jesus Christ, disrespect for the Sabbath day, nonpayment of tithes, hatred, etc.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p8\" class=\"\">Satan is an enemy to man and seeks to destroy his freedom and his obedience to the Lord and to keep man from developing his divine nature and godliness. Satan is the author of evil, sin, and wickedness, and we should not by our thoughts or acts love or serve him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p9\" class=\"\">Jesus Christ said, \u201cNo man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.

Prayers are uttered by many sincere people to various concepts of a supreme being or power. The pagans, the Buddhists, the Hindus, the Mohammedans, the sun and nature worshipers, and many others have their way of praying. Because of many man-made ways of praying, Jesus Christ gave a commandment on the proper way to pray. Here is the commandment\u2014and many do not know that it is a commandment:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAfter this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cThy kingdom come.

If we love our Father in heaven, we should pray and talk to him. We should desire to do his will and to have a program for his kingdom on earth as it is in heaven. The prayer teaches us to pray to be kingdom builders and to help build the kingdom of God on this earth. When we love God and sincerely pray for the kingdom of God to come to this earth, as it is in heaven, we commit ourselves to the giving of our time and talents and money.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p17\" class=\"\">When we say, \u201cFather, thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven,\u201d we should be subject to the will and desires of our Heavenly Father, even as a little child is subject to the will of its earthly parents. To sincerely submit and agree with the Lord that his will be done shows respect, love, and oneness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p18\" class=\"\">Jesus Christ is the example of one who was dedicated and submitted himself to the building of the kingdom of God upon this earth and in doing the will of the Father.

If we love and trust God, we should ask him to deliver us from evil. There is peaceful assurance and comfort in sincerely asking to be delivered from evil. In our family prayers, we should teach our children to ask the Lord to deliver them from evil. When did you ask, and follow the commandment of the Lord to be delivered from evil, and teach your children and those that you have the privilege of teaching?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p20\" class=\"\">The price the Lord has asked us to pay to be delivered from evil is to sincerely ask him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p21\" class=\"\">The prayer closes with these heavenly oriented words: \u201cFor thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.\u201d It keeps our minds on the goal that we are all seeking\u2014the kingdom of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p22\" class=\"\">I would like to read the law from the Lord that is used to finance the building of the kingdom of God on this earth\u2014the law of tithing as it is recorded in the Holy Bible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p23\" class=\"\">The Lord said, \u201cFor I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/love-of-god.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cEven from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them.
