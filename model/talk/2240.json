For almost forty years I have watched as the Lord has honed and polished and prepared President Lee as our teacher, as our stake president, whom we so much loved, as an apostle, and now as President of the Church. I am grateful and pledge my support to him and his counselors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p4\" class=\"\">President Tanner is our home teacher, who watches over us and cares for us in our home. We are grateful for him and pledge our loyalty to him. We are grateful for President Romney, who fourteen years ago came to Germany and helped me to become a better missionary. I have loved and respected him ever since. And these my brethren who sit before you today are men of God, and I am grateful for the teachings they have given me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p5\" class=\"\">Now may I share a thought with you this afternoon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p6\" class=\"\">I received a letter recently in which I was asked why, as president of the Genealogical Society, I didn\u2019t speak about genealogy. The writer also asked why my brethren did not preach about genealogy, when it was one of the fundamental priesthood programs of the Church. This quite startled me, for I have heard some excellent sermons on that subject given by my brethren and have given many sermons on genealogy myself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p7\" class=\"\">Perhaps we have all been too subtle. Perhaps our understanding of priesthood genealogy is so broad that we expect all Church members to think of priesthood genealogy as we do. In our understanding it includes the whole plan of salvation, in which, through righteous living and revealed sacred ordinances, families are bound together eternally, worthy to live in the celestial kingdom in the very presence of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost in an exalted, resurrected state. Perhaps we <span class=\"emphasis\">have <\/span>been too subtle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p8\" class=\"\">Stated, then, in simple words, I say to every member of the Church that you have a personal, individual responsibility to become engaged in priesthood genealogical activity. The real impact of the priesthood genealogy program is one of individual responsibility. The actual work must be performed by individuals, not by organizations. What is everybody\u2019s business is nobody\u2019s business, so I must say that this work is your individual responsibility and each of you, as an individual, must become converted to this work as a personal responsibility. It is not my responsibility alone, nor that of your stake president, nor that of your bishop alone. It is not confined to the high priests. Neither is genealogy and temple work reserved for older people. It should not be put off until you retire or become too old and infirm to do anything else.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p9\" class=\"\">Priesthood genealogy is an exciting, living, vital program involving the whole family. Elijah came to turn the hearts of children to their parents and parents to their children, so priesthood genealogy and temple work is a family affair, a total family program involving children, youth, and parents. We ought to change our attitudes toward priesthood genealogy and realize that the real impact of this program converges on each individual member of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p10\" class=\"\">Some persons have asked me, \u201cJust what <span class=\"emphasis\">is <\/span>my personal responsibility in this work?\u201d I answer that your individual responsibility is to be, or to become, worthy to enter the temple of God to participate in ordinances of salvation for yourself and for others. Youth are to be baptized in behalf of the dead. Young adults are to receive an endowment of power and to be married in the Lord\u2019s appointed way. Wives are to be sealed to husbands and have their children sealed to them for all eternity. Thus, just as you can be saviors for the living through active missionary work, so you are to qualify yourselves to become saviors for those who are dead who rely on you for help and assistance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p11\" class=\"\">As revealed by the scriptures, one of the characteristics of these last days is the appearance of saviors on the earth.

What curse? Why, earth life itself becomes a curse to those who fail in their mission in mortality. Their earthly existence becomes a stumbling block for them instead of a glorious steppingstone to the ladder of exaltation and glorification. When God speaks to man, his words can become either a curse or a blessing, as Moses explained to the children of Israel:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cA blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you this day:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21291\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21291)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21291)\">Deut. 11:26\u201328<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p29\" class=\"\">So this command of God, given through his prophets today, is as binding upon us as were the commands of God binding upon the children of Israel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p30\" class=\"\">But I would like to turn again to this personal responsibility which God has given us to become saviors on Mount Zion.
