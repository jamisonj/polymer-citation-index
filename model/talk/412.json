It is because Joseph Smith lived and functioned that we are all here today, and I have\nsaid from this stand and from other stands that in my opinion Joseph Smith was a most\nmarvelous man, the greatest prophet this world has ever seen, aside from Jesus Christ himself\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12752\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12752)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12752)\">D&amp;C 135:3<\/a><\/span>),\nand, as I believe history will declare, one of the greatest Americans\nthat this country has ever known.\n<\/p><p>\nWhy am I justified in saying all this? I believe that a real, serious, honest investigation of\nJoseph Smith, from the time of his birth to the time of his death, will justify anyone who goes\ncarefully into all the history and all the things he did in saying that at least he was a most\nmarvelous man, and in saying that, in coming to that conclusion, such an investigator would\nbe guided by exactly the same standard that is used in judging greatness of all other people:\nby his works shall he be known, by his works he should be judged. And in my opinion every\nhonest, conscientious, intelligent man and woman, in the light of his claims, ought to feel\njustified in going carefully into a study of this wonderful man.\n<\/p><p>\nA PRACTICAL RELIGION\n<\/p><p>\nIn the few minutes allotted to me I desire to talk in plain, everyday language of some things\nthat I believe are important for all of us to study and think about. First of all, the gospel of\nJesus Christ as accepted and taught by the elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints is a very practical religion&mdash;one that should enter into every phase of the lives of its\nmembers, whether this phase be spiritual or material. One of our basic teachings is that faith\nwithout works is dead. \"...shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith\nby my works\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26076\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26076)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26076)\">James 2:18<\/a><\/span>).\nAgain, \"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall\nenter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in\nheaven\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34273\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34273)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34273)\">Matt. 7:21<\/a><\/span>).\nOther of our teachings pertinent to my theme are articles 12 and 13 of our faith:\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in\nobeying, honoring and sustaining the law\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6637\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6637)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6637)\">A of F 1:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good\nto all men . . . (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6642\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6642)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6642)\">A of F 1:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf we implement these articles in our daily lives, we will be good family members, good\nneighbors, good citizens, and good Church members.\n<\/p><p>\nCONSTITUTION DIVINELY INSPIRED\n<\/p><p>\nAgain, we teach that the Constitution of the United States as it came to us from the founders\nof this republic is a divinely inspired document. From a declaration of belief as found in\nSection 134 of The Doctrine and Covenants, and approved by unanimous vote of an assembly\nof the Church held in Kirtland, August 1835, I make the following quotes:\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and\nthat he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making\nlaws and administering them, for the good and safety of society.\nWe believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are\nframed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise of\nconscience, the right and control of property, and the protection of life.\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates\nto enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer the law in equity\nand justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people if a\nrepublic, or the will of the sovereign\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12750\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12750)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12750)\">D&amp;C 134:1-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFurther, we also support the statements in the Declaration of Independence that all\nmen are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among\nthese are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights,\ngovernments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent\nof the governed . . .\n<\/p><p>\nIn the light of the foregoing statements. I am sure that all Latter-day Saints must believe that\ntheir religion imposes on them the sacred obligation of trying to be good citizens of the\ncountry under whose flag they live. In this country&mdash;the United States this obligation, among\nother things, entails the duty to vote in elections for public officers. And for whom should\nthey vote? Obviously for those capable people who, they believe, will be true, if elected, to\ntheir oaths of office; those who will uphold the Constitution of the United States and the laws\nmade in harmony with it. To do this is a duty that every loyal citizen of this country should\nfeel honor-bound to discharge. The safety and perpetuity of our constitutional form of\ngovernment demands it, so historians tell us.\n<\/p><p>\nCRITICAL ELECTIONS\n<\/p><p>\nAs I view the situation, the national elections in 1950 and 1952 will be among the most\ncritical and far-reaching in effects this country has had in a century. Powerful forces are being\norganized and heavily financed to defeat in these elections all candidates who voted for or\nsupport the Taft-Hartley labor law. If this movement is successful, misguided leaders of\nsome organized groups will dominate the Congress of the United States, the White House, and\nevery other office of the government, the functions of which would help to bring into\nexistence a welfare state&mdash;that is, one which would operate according to the principles of\nsocialism. Not that these leaders favor such a state, but the things they demand would\ninevitably bring it about, so wise men say. The result would be that our free enterprise\nsystem, the system that has operated in this country from its beginning, the one that has\nenabled it to become the marvel and the wonder of the modern world for the variety and\nmagnitude of its ingenious productive capacity, this system would rather quickly be destroyed,\nso history teaches. Otherwise the monopoly of selfish labor leaders must be broken. Freedom\nand personal  liberty&mdash;the pride and boast of America, the achievement of centuries of human\nsacrifice and bloody struggle are in great danger due to the rise of\nthis destructive movement, engineered and directed by smart and misguided leaders in whose\nminds and hearts right, fairness, and justice apparently are given little or no consideration.\nTheir followers apparently have had confidence in their leaders and have accepted as true the\nfalse and misleading statements and claims of certain men relative to the provisions of the\nTaft-Hartley labor law. So in the minds of many workers this law is oppressive, unfair,\nunjust, and robs workers of their rightful gains, made under the provisions of the repealed\nWagner labor act.\n<\/p><p>\nPROVISIONS OF TAFT-HARTLEY LAW\n<\/p><p>\nBut let me ask how many of these workers and other people have ever read the Taft-Hartley\nlaw and fully understand what its provisions are? My understanding is that this law was\ndesigned to protect the rights and freedom of employees and employers alike, and make\nunions and corporations equally responsible before the law for their contracts, obligations, etc.\nWhat right-minded citizen would have any other kind of law? In any case, two-thirds of the\nmembers of each branch of the United States Congress believe the Taft-Hartley bill would be\nat least a fairly good law, for they passed it over the president's veto. Is this not significant in\nthe light of the fact that many members of his party voted to override the veto?\n<\/p><p>\nBut the question of whether this is a good or bad law has been, and is being, hotly debated.\nTo make this law function more equitably it needs amendments, it is said. If so, let these be\nmade. But in this situation what should the voters of the country do? From my point of view\nthe right to vote imposes on everyone who has this right the obligation to make a full, fair,\nand unprejudiced study of the issues involved in an election, and then support candidates who\nstand for the principles and measures that the voter sincerely and honestly believes will be for\nthe best good of all the people and therefore for the best interests of the country as a whole.\nIf selfishness, greed, unrighteous motives, and ignoble ambition shall dominate in our\nelections, the freedom that has been the pride and glory of America will vanish&mdash;many people\nwill be practically enslaved, as is the case in Russia today&mdash;so historians predict.\n<\/p><p>\nDESIRE TO GET MORE\n<\/p><p>\nBut the outlook is none too encouraging, for unjustifiable and insatiable selfishness has\nalready made deep inroads into the economy of this country and is still unsatisfied. The desire\nto get more and more for less and less, spurred on by some politicians, has been growing\nstronger and stronger among different groups of people, especially among labor unions.\n<\/p><p>\nAt this point let me quote from an article in the March, 1949, number of the <i>Reader's Digest<\/i>\nwhich was written by E. T. Leech, editor, <i>The Pittsburg Press<\/i>, as follows:\n<\/p><p>\nThis country&mdash;indeed, the whole world&mdash;is being swept by an epidemic of\nthe 'gimmes.' Nearly everybody wants to be given something at the expense of\nsomebody else. This epidemic grows out of a belief that government can somehow\nprovide aid and security for its people, no matter what the cost and how far in\ndebt it already is.\n<\/p><p>\nThe more government provides, the more is expected of it. One of the penalties\nof government assistance is a widespread lowering of the sense of responsibility.\nIndividual stamina and self-determination go down at a time when public expenses\nare going up. This parallel development has destroyed other nations. It enabled a\nfew thousand barbarians to overthrow the mighty Roman Empire. The Romans\ncame to depend on the state for food, shelter and entertainment. In their eagerness\nfor free security at state expense, they became so insecure they lost everything.\n<\/p><p>\nA state is just a large number of individuals. In the end, it is subject to the same\nlimitations as the individual; it pays the same penalties for bad management. Take\ndebt, for example. The U. S. Government owes over 250 billion dollars&mdash;more\nthan $6000 for every American family. Other political subdivisions&mdash;states, cities,\ncounties, school districts&mdash;owe 20 billions.\n<\/p><p>\nAll of them are under terrific pressure to provide more services and greater\nbenefits. All are having to boost taxes and borrow money to pour out to a\nnever-satisfied public.\n<\/p><p>\nThe popular idea is that these funds can be obtained from the rich and the big\ncorporations&mdash;so that the majority of people can have the benefits without paying\nthe cost. But nobody gets anything for nothing. Everybody shares the debt.\nEverybody pays taxes&mdash;direct or indirect.\n<\/p><p>\nThere aren't enough rich people to enable the government to finance itself at their\nexpense. If government took all the wealth of corporations, it wouldn't put the\ncountry on a sound financial keel. But it would put the corporations out of\nbusiness and workers out of jobs. Meanwhile, all that the big companies pay to\ngovernment becomes a part of the cost of the goods they produce&mdash;an important\nfactor in the cost of living for everybody.\n<\/p><p>\nOnly wider realization of these basic facts can stop the tragedy that must\neventually happen if the 'give-everything-to-everybody' theory continues\nunchecked.\n<\/p><p>\nPENSION PLANS\n<\/p><p>\nAs an example of this \"gimmes\" craze, let us look at the demands certain officials are now\nmaking on several large corporations. They demand something new&mdash;insurance policies and\nlife pensions, ranging from $100 to $150 monthly, both to be paid entirely by the\nemployers&mdash;absolutely something for nothing. Who would provide the money for these\nbenefits? The public, of course, those who buy the goods and services the companies sell.\nWhen cost of production goes up, prices rise. The experience of the past four years definitely\nproves this. But many of these company employees already get top wages&mdash;wages much\nhigher than are generally paid employees and other workers engaged in ordinary commercial\nand other enterprises. Is there anything fair, right, or just in asking these other workers to\nprovide free benefits for more highly paid company employees?\n<\/p><p>\nIt might be said, however, that the policy of providing retirement benefits on a fifty-fifty plan\nis now current among teachers, federal civil service employees, and others&mdash;the employer and\nemployee each paying half. This is considered a reasonable plan. The\none in which the employer pays all is wrong in principle, bad as an example, injurious for\nemployee and employer alike, even though some corporations pension their officers free of\ncost to the latter&mdash;an unwise and wrong practice that should be abandoned.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is true, of course, that employees of corporations are generally organized in powerful\nunions to which truculent politicians bow and scrape and give support. The unions back up\ntheir demands by strikes and picket lines through which it is so dangerous to pass that other\nworkers do not venture. Thus production stops, and the innocent public suffer. Is this not a\nhold-up game exactly in principle like that played by the bank robber? But our laws make the\nlatter a grave crime while the former is befriended by truculent officials and politicians who\nhave an eye on the source from which votes come. The situation appears to be getting very\ncritical. Some group leaders apparently have the country by the throat and still are demanding\nthe repeal of restrictions that limit their power. Unless this power is still further limited this\ncountry will be absolutely under the domination of these men.\n<\/p><p>\nCAMPAIGN OF EDUCATION\n<\/p><p>\nWhat can be done in the matter? Let a campaign for educating the public be vigorously\ncarried on for the purpose of inducing all voters to make a careful study of all pertinent\nfacts&mdash;not fancies and propaganda&mdash;relative to the \"gimmes\" craze. There are scholarly,\nexperienced experts who talk and write on the situation for the worthy purpose of giving the\ntruth to us. In our study let us go to them and avoid crackpots and propagandists even\ntruculent officials. I will trust an informed American public. I am sure that a vast number of\nmembers of organized groups are loyal American citizens and would vote against men and\nmeasures that by word and act would tend to destroy America's free enterprise system and\nthat would imperil the right of \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" to loyal Americans.\n<\/p><p>\nBut the situation, I repeat, is threatening, critical. The elections in 1950 and 1952 will\nundoubtedly decide whether we shall have in America freedom or a monopoly controlled by\ngroup bosses&mdash;freedom under fair, right, and just laws impartially administered, or slavery\nunder the dictatorship of these misguided bosses. By all means let this be the dominant issue.\nOther issues, though highly important, can wait on the determination of this one. Is not the\nRepublic worth saving? Who doubts it?\n<\/p><p>\nSUPPORT OF CONSTITUTION\n<\/p><p>\nWhy do I speak of these things? Because our religion, as I understand it, requires us to stand\nfor the divinely inspired Constitution of the United States and to refuse support of all\ncandidates and measures that would bring about a condition foreign to the spirit of\nthat instrument and that would turn our government and country over\nto the control and dictates of autocratic bosses, whoever they may be.\n<\/p><p>\nOur religion teaches without reservation the fatherhood of God and the universal brotherhood\nof man, and that we should love our fellow men as we love ourselves. We are all enjoined to\ndo this. All my life I have been in full sympathy with those who toil, those who earn their\nbread by the sweat of their brow\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23557\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23557)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23557)\">Gen. 3:19<\/a><\/span>).\nFor more than seventy years I have been one of them. I\nlove the honest toiler. I ask no more of him than I ask of myself&mdash;which is&mdash;try sincerely to\nlive the Golden Rule (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34270\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34270)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34270)\">Matt. 7:12<\/a><\/span>)\nin all our relations with our fellow men. What more can we rightfully ask of anyone?\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that the Lord will give us all a desire, and the wisdom and the courage to do as he\nwould have us do relative to these and all other matters that concern us and the welfare of our\ncountry, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
