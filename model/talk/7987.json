In May, after weeks of valiantly struggling to overcome her injuries, she slipped into eternity. Her loss has been profound. She and I were married in the Salt Lake Temple on October\u00a07, 1948. Tomorrow would have been our 65th wedding anniversary. She was the love of my life, my trusted confidant, and my closest friend. To say that I miss her does not begin to convey the depth of my feelings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-will-not-fail-thee-nor-forsake-thee.p6\" class=\"\">This conference marks 50 years since I was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles by President David\u00a0O. McKay. Through all these years I have felt nothing but the full and complete support of my sweet companion. Countless are the sacrifices she made so that I could fulfill my calling. Never did I hear a word of complaint from her as I was often required to spend days and sometimes weeks away from her and from our children. She was an angel, indeed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-will-not-fail-thee-nor-forsake-thee.p7\" class=\"\">I wish to express my thanks, as well as those of my family, for the tremendous outpouring of love which has come to us since Frances\u2019s passing. Hundreds of cards and letters were sent from around the world expressing admiration for her and condolences to our family. We received dozens of beautiful floral arrangements. We are grateful for the numerous contributions which have been offered in her name to the General Missionary Fund of the Church. On behalf of those of us whom she left behind, I express deep gratitude for your kind and heartfelt expressions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-will-not-fail-thee-nor-forsake-thee.p8\" class=\"\">Of utmost comfort to me during this tender time of parting have been my testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the knowledge I have that my dear Frances lives still. I know that our separation is temporary. We were sealed in the house of God by one having authority to bind on earth and in heaven. I know that we will be reunited one day and will never again be separated. This is the knowledge that sustains me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-will-not-fail-thee-nor-forsake-thee.p9\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, it may be safely assumed that no person has ever lived entirely free of suffering and sorrow, nor has there ever been a period in human history that did not have its full share of turmoil and misery.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-will-not-fail-thee-nor-forsake-thee.p10\" class=\"\">When the pathway of life takes a cruel turn, there is the temptation to ask the question \u201cWhy me?\u201d At times there appears to be no light at the end of the tunnel, no sunrise to end the night\u2019s darkness.

I cannot begin to measure all of the heartache and sorrow I have witnessed as I have visited with those who are dealing with grief, experiencing illness, facing divorce, struggling with a wayward son or daughter, or suffering the consequences of sin. The list could go on and on, for there are countless problems which can befall us. To single out one example is difficult, and yet whenever I think of challenges, my thoughts turn to Brother Brems, one of my boyhood Sunday School teachers. He was a faithful member of the Church, a man with a heart of gold. He and his wife, Sadie, had eight children, many of whom were the same ages as those in our family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-will-not-fail-thee-nor-forsake-thee.p20\" class=\"\">After Frances and I were married and moved from the ward, we saw Brother and Sister Brems and members of their family at weddings and funerals, as well as at ward reunions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-will-not-fail-thee-nor-forsake-thee.p21\" class=\"\">In 1968, Brother Brems lost his wife, Sadie.

She explained that her grandfather had reached his 105th birthday. She said, \u201cHe lives in a small care center but meets with his entire family each Sunday, where he delivers a gospel lesson.\u201d She continued, \u201cThis past Sunday, Grandpa announced to us, \u2018My dears, I am going to die this week. Will you please call Tommy Monson.

I had not seen him for a while. I could not speak to him, for he had lost his hearing. I could not write a message for him to read, because he had lost his sight. I was told that the family communicated with him by taking the finger of his right hand and then tracing on the palm of his left hand the name of the person visiting. Any message had to be conveyed in this same way. I followed the procedure by taking his finger and spelling T-O-M-M-Y M-O-N-S-O-N, the name by which he had always known me. Brother Brems became excited and, taking my hands, placed them on his head. I knew his desire was to receive a priesthood blessing. The driver who had taken me to the care center joined me as we placed our hands on the head of Brother Brems and provided the desired blessing. Afterward, tears streamed from his sightless eyes. He grasped our hands in gratitude. Although he had not heard the blessing we had given him, the Spirit was strong, and I believe he was inspired to know we had provided the blessing which he needed. This sweet man could no longer see. He could no longer hear. He was confined night and day to a small room in a care center. And yet the smile on his face and the words he spoke touched my heart. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cMy Heavenly Father has been so good to me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-will-not-fail-thee-nor-forsake-thee.p24\" class=\"\">Within a week, just as Brother Brems had predicted, he passed away.

We know that there are times when we will experience heartbreaking sorrow, when we will grieve, and when we may be tested to our limits. However, such difficulties allow us to change for the better, to rebuild our lives in the way our Heavenly Father teaches us, and to become something different from what we were\u2014better than we were, more understanding than we were, more empathetic than we were, with stronger testimonies than we had before.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-will-not-fail-thee-nor-forsake-thee.p26\" class=\"\">This should be our purpose\u2014to persevere and endure, yes, but also to become more spiritually refined as we make our way through sunshine and sorrow.
