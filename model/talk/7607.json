Well do I remember that some years ago, members holding the Aaronic Priesthood would eagerly look forward to an annual outing commemorating the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood. By the busload the young men of our stake journeyed 90 miles (145\u00a0km) north to the Clarkston Cemetery, where we viewed the grave of Martin Harris, one of the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon. While surrounding the beautiful granite shaft which marks the grave, a high councilor would present background concerning the life of Martin Harris, read from the Book of Mormon his testimony, and then bear his own witness to the truth. The young men listened with rapt attention, touched the granite marker, and pondered the words they had heard and the feelings they had felt.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p31\" class=\"\">At a park in Logan, lunch was enjoyed. The group of young men would then lie down on the lawn at the Logan temple and gaze upward at its lofty spires. Often beautiful white clouds would hurry past the spires, moved along by a gentle breeze. The purpose of temples was taught. Covenants and promises became much more than words. The desire to be worthy to enter those temple doors entered those youthful hearts. Heaven was very close.

The living conditions were primitive, the work lonely, their task immense. A mission had not at that time been established in Poland. The assignment given the Fusseks was to prepare the way, that a mission could be established so that other missionaries could be called to serve, people could be taught, converts could be baptized, branches could be established, and chapels could be erected.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p38\" class=\"\">Did Elder and Sister Fussek despair because of the enormity of their assignment?

I would like to share part of it with you tonight, since it illustrates the strength of the priesthood in one who learned what he should learn, who did what he should do, and who always tried to be what he should be. I shall read excerpts of that letter from my friend Theron\u00a0W. Borup, who passed away three years ago at the age of 90:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p52\" class=\"\">\u201cAt the age of eight, when I was baptized and received the Holy Ghost, I was much impressed about being good and able to have the Holy Ghost to be a help throughout my life. I was told that the Holy Ghost associated only in good company and that when evil entered our lives, he would leave. Not knowing when I would need his promptings and guidance, I tried to so live that I would not lose this gift. On one occasion it saved my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p53\" class=\"\">\u201cDuring World War II, I was an engineer-gunner in a B-24 bomber fighting in the South Pacific. \u2026 One day there was an announcement that the longest bombing flight ever made would be attempted to knock out an oil refinery. The promptings of the Spirit told me I would be assigned on this flight but that I would not lose my life. At the time I was the president of the LDS group.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p54\" class=\"\">\u201cThe combat was ferocious as we flew over Borneo. Our plane was hit by attacking planes and soon burst into flames, and the pilot told us to prepare to jump. I went out last. We were shot at by enemy pilots as we floated down. I had trouble inflating my life raft. Bobbing up and down in the water, I began to drown and passed out. I came to momentarily and cried, \u2018God save me!\u2019 \u2026 Again I tried inflating the life raft and this time was successful. With just enough air in it to keep me afloat, I rolled over on top of it, too exhausted to move.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p55\" class=\"\">\u201cFor three days we floated about in enemy territory with ships all about us and planes overhead. Why they couldn\u2019t see a yellow group of rafts on blue water is a mystery,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA storm came up, and waves thirty feet high almost tore our rafts apart. Three days went by with no food or water. The others asked me if I prayed. I answered that I did pray and we would indeed be rescued. That evening we saw our submarine that was there to rescue us, but it passed by. The next morning it did [the same. We knew] this was the last day [it would] be in the area. Then came the promptings of the Holy Ghost. \u2018You have the priesthood. Command the sub to pick you up.\u2019 Silently I prayed, \u2018In the name of Jesus Christ, and by the power of the priesthood, turn about and pick us up.\u2019 In a few minutes, they were alongside of us. When on deck, the captain \u2026 said, \u2018I don\u2019t know how we ever found you, for we were not even looking for you.\u2019 <span class=\"emphasis\">I <\/span>knew.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote13-02211_000_022\">13<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Personal correspondence; emphasis added.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/to-learn-to-do-to-be.p56\" class=\"\">I leave with you my testimony that this work in which we are engaged is true.
