In the floods which we have experienced in this area, there has been an unexcelled expression of neighborliness and Christian service. A woman who was not a member of the Church was interviewed on television and said, \u201cI am not a Mormon, but I have come to know who my bishop is.\u201d She went on to speak with unrestrained appreciation for her neighbors, who, almost entirely Latter-day Saints, had been as generous in their help toward her as they had been in their help toward one another. There is a stake not far from here where the members of each ward undertook the repair or replacement of a home damaged or lost in the flood. Hundreds of thousands of sandbags were filled and put in place. There were, of course, those not of the Church doing likewise, but all concerned have spoken with high praise for the Church organization which was able to muster forces so rapidly and so effectively.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/god-grant-us-faith.p19\" class=\"\">Help in very substantial quantities was sent to the people of Tonga, following a wild typhoon that ripped apart homes and farms.

For the benefit of any listening who may not be members of the Church, I should explain that a temple occupies a unique and peculiar place in our theology. It is not a house of public worship, of which we now have many thousands across the world. Temples, on the other hand, are dedicated as special houses of God, in which are performed some of the most sacred and elevating ordinances associated with the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/god-grant-us-faith.p25\" class=\"\">In June we dedicated a new temple in Atlanta, Georgia. This was the culmination of a dream that began a century and more ago when, in the days of the poverty of our people, missionaries were first sent to the southern states. A few accepted their testimony, but many more rose in bitterness against them. These early missionaries endured much persecution. Some were stripped and beaten; some were murdered by hateful enemies. But with faith they persevered. Eventually, thousands upon thousands joined the Church, and today the work is strong and growing in that beautiful part of the nation where we now have hundreds of faithful congregations of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/god-grant-us-faith.p26\" class=\"\">On the occasion of the Atlanta Temple dedication, the testimonies of the people\u2014those spoken and those expressed in tears of gratitude\u2014together with their songs of thanksgiving, all bore witness to the strength of their faith and their love for God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/god-grant-us-faith.p27\" class=\"\">In August we were in Samoa and Tonga for temple dedications. Again our hearts were lifted by the outpouring of the Christlike love we experienced and witnessed among the wonderful Saints of Polynesia. Through ancient prophets the Lord promised that in the latter days he would remember his people upon the isles of the sea. We have witnessed a marvelous fulfillment of these promises where today, among these loving and gracious people, we have scores of congregations, strong and flourishing schools to bless them with the benefits of education, and now beautiful temples of the Lord in which they may receive blessings to be found nowhere else.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/god-grant-us-faith.p28\" class=\"\">Only a fortnight ago we were in Santiago, Chile, for the dedication of another beautiful temple. For me it was a miracle to be with more than 15,000 Latter-day Saints who assembled for these dedicatory services which extended over a period of three days. The nation of Chile is 2,700 miles long, and our faithful people gathered from such distant cities as Arica in the far north and Punta Arenas in the far south to rejoice over the marvelous blessing that had come to them in the erection and dedication of this sacred house of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/god-grant-us-faith.p29\" class=\"\">Among them were Brother and Sister Ricardo Garcia, the first to be baptized when missionaries were sent to Chile in 1956.

Most are high school students who meet five days each week for a seminary class at 6:15 in the morning, which is held in a Church building near the school under the direction of a dedicated and able teacher. On my way home from Chile, I met in Detroit with another group of these students at 6:15 in the morning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/god-grant-us-faith.p32\" class=\"\">These are bright and gifted and attractive youth.

They are familiar with the word of God as it has come through modern revelation. They are students who are acquiring both secular and religious education, learning by study and also by faith.
