A red Irish Setter dog crouched nearby, intently watching the squirrel. Each time the squirrel ran up the tree out of sight, the dog would slowly creep towards the tree. The squirrel paid little attention as the dog crept closer and closer, patiently biding its time. People watching this entertaining drama unfold knew what could happen, but they did nothing, until in a flash, the dog\u2014catching the squirrel unaware\u2014had it in the grip of his sharp teeth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/successful-living-of-gospel-principles.p13\" class=\"\">The people then rushed forward in horror, forcing the dog\u2019s mouth open to rescue the squirrel.
