There is a marvelous spirit which permeates the general priesthood meeting of the Church. This spirit emanates from the Conference Center and enters every building where the sons of God assemble. We have surely felt that spirit tonight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/see-others-as-they-may-become.p5\" class=\"\">Some years ago, before this beautiful Conference Center was built, a visitor to Temple Square in Salt Lake City attended a general conference session in the Tabernacle. He listened to the messages of the Brethren. He paid attention to the prayers. He heard the beautiful music by the Tabernacle Choir. He marveled at the grandeur of the magnificent Tabernacle organ. When the meeting had ended he was heard to say, \u201cI would give everything I possess if I knew that what those speakers said today was true.\u201d In essence he was saying, \u201cI wish that I had a testimony of the gospel.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/see-others-as-they-may-become.p6\" class=\"\">There is absolutely nothing in this world that will provide more comfort and happiness than a testimony of the truth. Although to varying degrees, I believe every man or young man here tonight has a testimony. If you feel that you do not yet have the depth of testimony you would wish, I admonish you to work to achieve such a testimony. If it is strong and deep, labor to keep it that way. How blessed we are to have a knowledge of the truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/see-others-as-they-may-become.p7\" class=\"\">My message tonight, brethren, is that there are countless individuals who have little or no testimony right now, those who could and would receive such a testimony if we would be willing to make the effort to share ours and to help them change. In some instances <span class=\"emphasis\">we<\/span> can provide the incentive for change. I mention first those who are members but who are not at present fully committed to the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/see-others-as-they-may-become.p8\" class=\"\">Many years ago, at an area conference held in Helsinki, Finland, I heard a powerful, memorable, and motivating message given in a mothers and daughters\u2019 session. I have not forgotten that message, though nearly 40 years have passed since I heard it. Among many truths the speaker discussed, she said that a woman needs to be told she is beautiful. She needs to be told she is valued. She needs to be told she is worthwhile.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/see-others-as-they-may-become.p9\" class=\"\">Brethren, I know that men are very much like women in this regard. We need to be told that we amount to something, that we are capable and worthwhile. We need to be given a chance to serve. For those members who have slipped from activity or who hold back and remain noncommittal, we can prayerfully seek for some way to reach them. Asking them to serve in some capacity may just be the incentive they need to return to full activity. But those leaders who could help in this regard are sometimes reluctant to do so. We need to bear in mind that people can change. They can put behind them bad habits. They can repent from transgressions. They can bear the priesthood worthily. And they can serve the Lord diligently. May I provide a few illustrations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/see-others-as-they-may-become.p10\" class=\"\">When I first became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, I had the opportunity to accompany President N.\u00a0Eldon Tanner, a counselor to President David\u00a0O. McKay, to a stake conference in Alberta, Canada. During the meeting, the stake president read the names of four brethren who had qualified to be ordained elders. These were men whom President Tanner knew, for at one time he had lived in that area. But President Tanner knew and remembered them as they once were and did not know that they had turned their lives around and had fully qualified to become elders.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/see-others-as-they-may-become.p11\" class=\"\">The stake president read the name of the first man and asked him to stand. President Tanner whispered to me, \u201cLook at him. I never thought he would make it.\u201d The stake president read the name of the second man, and he stood. President Tanner nudged me again and reported his astonishment. And so it was with all four of the brethren.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/see-others-as-they-may-become.p12\" class=\"\">After the meeting, President Tanner and I had the opportunity to congratulate these four brethren.

I felt inspired to call him as the branch president. I shall always remember the day that I had an interview with him. I told him that the Lord had inspired me to call him to be the president of the branch. After much protest on his part, and much encouragement on the part of his wife, he indicated that he would serve. I ordained him a priest.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/see-others-as-they-may-become.p17\" class=\"\">It was the beginning of a new day for that man. His life was quickly put in order, and he assured me that he would live the commandments as he was expected to live them. In a few months he was ordained an elder.

This can be true of priesthood holders regardless of age. It is our responsibility to give them opportunities to live as they should. We can help them to overcome their shortcomings.

Leadville is situated at an altitude of over 10,000 feet (3,000 m). I remember that particular meeting because of the high altitude, but I also remember it for what took place that evening.

He told of a missionary who had been the most successful missionary whom he had met in all of the interviews he had conducted. He said that as he interviewed that missionary, he said to him, \u201cI suppose that all of the people whom you baptized came into the Church by way of referrals.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/see-others-as-they-may-become.p29\" class=\"\">The young man answered, \u201cNo, we found them all by tracting.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/see-others-as-they-may-become.p30\" class=\"\">Brother Tanner asked him what was different about his approach\u2014why he had such phenomenal success when others didn\u2019t.

He said that if he knocked on the door and saw a man smoking a cigar and dressed in old clothes and seemingly uninterested in anything\u2014particularly religion\u2014the missionary would picture in his own mind what that man would look like under a different set of circumstances. In his mind he would look at him as clean-shaven and wearing a white shirt and white trousers. And the missionary could see himself leading that man into the waters of baptism. He said, \u201cWhen I look at someone that way, I have the capacity to bear my testimony to him in a way that can touch his heart.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/see-others-as-they-may-become.p31\" class=\"\">We have the responsibility to look at our friends, our associates, our neighbors this way.
