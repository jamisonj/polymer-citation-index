There were twenty of them, including several as young as fourteen with tattoos on their arms, and all had had minor scrapes with the law, ranging from break-ins to shoplifting and assault. They arrived by bus and strutted cockily into the prison confines. Three hours later they walked out timidly\u2014some shaking and near tears.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/obeying-the-right-voice.p5\" class=\"\">Their change in attitude came after their \u201cteachers\u201d gave them firsthand information about prison life. In the vilest of language, and with frequent threats of violence (although never carried out), the class members were transformed from fidgeting, squirming, disinterested youths to a spellbound, captive audience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/obeying-the-right-voice.p6\" class=\"\">Let me repeat some of the words of the \u201cinstructors\u201d which brought about this change.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/obeying-the-right-voice.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m 45 years old now and I know I\u2019m never going to see the streets again,\u201d said a convicted murderer. \u201cWe\u2019re all dying to get out and you guys are pounding on the doors, saying, \u2018Let us in.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/obeying-the-right-voice.p8\" class=\"\">Another statement: \u201cThe Hollywood image of prison doesn\u2019t tell you about gang rapes and suicides.

The difference lies in who is telling us and what they are wanting us to do. Therein lies the difference between happiness and unhappiness, eternal life with God or some lesser final judgment. The difference is in <span class=\"emphasis\">obedience<\/span> to the right voice and to the right principle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/obeying-the-right-voice.p11\" class=\"\">Consider with me some things a man needs for happiness. Since all of you are members of the church of Jesus Christ and hold the priesthood, we can talk about your particular needs, for you already have some of the prerequisites for a happy life. You are most blessed to hold the priesthood of God. You know who you are, why you are upon the earth, and what you must do to be successful and happy and to enjoy salvation and exaltation\u2014to prove yourselves by doing all things which the Lord God shall command. Many men in the world today would find the happiness they are seeking if they had that knowledge. <span class=\"emphasis\">Cherish it, brethren.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/obeying-the-right-voice.p12\" class=\"\">Now, in addition to knowing that he is a child of God, that he holds the priesthood\u2014the power to act in God\u2019s name\u2014a man needs companionship. What a tremendous source of strength it is to belong to a great brotherhood of priesthood holders where all are engaged in works of righteousness to help build the kingdom of God. But in order to enjoy full fellowship, a man must observe the rules. There are certain requirements to be met and certain rules to obey:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/obeying-the-right-voice.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cWe believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul\u2014We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6947\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6947)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6947)\">A of F 1:13<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/obeying-the-right-voice.p14\" class=\"\">Another thing a man needs is the love and companionship of family and friends. This too must be <span class=\"emphasis\">earned<\/span> by compliance with or <span class=\"emphasis\">obedience<\/span> to certain rules of behavior. You young men should be kind and considerate of the girls you choose for friends, girls who love the Lord and are preparing themselves to be mothers of the spirit children of God. You must be worthy of them by good, clean living and by obeying the commandments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/obeying-the-right-voice.p15\" class=\"\">Men who are married should be thoughtful and kind to their wives and children and never use their priesthood unrighteously. It is appalling to read of the wife and child abuse that is far too prevalent, even in our Latter-day Saint families. Someone wrote a letter the other day to the editor of a local newspaper to express shock that in a predominantly Mormon community, where family life is stressed, there should be so many referrals of child abuse. Surely we should follow the Savior\u2019s example in showing love for our wives and children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/obeying-the-right-voice.p16\" class=\"\">Also, a man finds happiness through his chosen vocation.

Be at the right place at the right time. Maintain a degree of humility. Develop an inner drive and a competitive desire to excel rather than just get along.

In every case there has been a violation of some moral code or disobedience to law. All too often there is little or no remorse. In addition, there are too many who have little regard for human life. Some criminals today even go on lecture tours or star in movies at great financial gain. This is most appalling indeed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/obeying-the-right-voice.p21\" class=\"\">A recent news story told of a man who was released from prison after serving a sentence for a robbery that he did not commit.

Love your children, let them know that you love them; but remember that it is no favor to a child to let him do things he should not do. I have seen the results of many surveys and know from personal experience that children want some direction and control in their lives and want to live up to the expectations of those who are responsible for directing their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/obeying-the-right-voice.p25\" class=\"\">The laws of God and the laws of nature and the laws of the land are made for the benefit of man\u2014for his comfort, enjoyment, safety, and well-being\u2014and it is up to the individual to learn these laws and to determine whether or not he will enjoy these benefits by obeying the laws and by keeping the commandments. To be happy and successful we must obey the laws and regulations pertaining to our activities. These laws will function either to our joy and well-being or to our detriment and sorrow, according to our actions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/obeying-the-right-voice.p26\" class=\"\">How often do you hear people say they don\u2019t want to be told what to do?

Elder Richard G.

At a meeting I was sent to direct, I found that one of the professors who had counseled me against going on a mission was in a significantly lesser program position than I.
