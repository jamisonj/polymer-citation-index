Like most of you, my being \u201cfound\u201d started with two faithful missionaries. In the year 1913, in Copenhagen, Denmark, Elders C. Earl Anhder and Robert H. Sorenson taught my grandparents the gospel of Jesus Christ and baptized them. My parents taught me the importance of hard work, honesty, and integrity. However, in one short generation we became lost to activity in the Church and a knowledge of the gospel. Looking back, I recall, at a very young age, my playmates inviting me to Primary. My first Church experience was built around Primary friendships.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/if-christ-had-my-opportunities.p13\" class=\"\">As a boy several months shy of my 12th birthday, one Saturday afternoon I answered a knock at my front door. Several of my friends\u2014deacons dressed in white shirts and ties\u2014sought me out to come to my very first priesthood meeting. Our leader walked beside me as we made our way down the hill to the Tabernacle on Temple Square. That was April general conference priesthood session.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/if-christ-had-my-opportunities.p14\" class=\"\">Lloyd Bennett was my Scoutmaster. Very often on a Saturday afternoon he would pick me up and take me to the Scout office to buy needed badges and supplies. As we rode, we talked. He became a trusted friend.
