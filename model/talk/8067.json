For as long as I have been a member, I have served in many ways. Like Brother Udine Falabella, father of Elder Enrique\u00a0R. Falabella, used to say, \u201cHe who serves in some thing is good for something; he who serves in no thing is good for nothing.\u201d These are words that we need to keep in our minds and in our hearts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">As I have sought guidance during my service, I have found comfort in remembering that the Savior focuses on the individual and the family. His love and tender attention to the individual have taught me that He recognizes the great worth of each of Heavenly Father\u2019s children and that it is essential for us to ensure that each individual is ministered to and strengthened by the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">In the scriptures we read:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">\u201cRemember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God.\u00a0\u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">\u201cAnd if it so be that you should labor <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> your days \u2026 and bring, <span class=\"emphasis\">save it be one<\/span> soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10911_000_039\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130410\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130410)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130410)\">Doctrine and Covenants 18:10, 15<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">Every soul is of great worth to God, for we are His children and we have the potential to become as He is.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-10911_000_039\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See Guide to the Scriptures, \u201cSoul\u201d; scriptures.lds.org.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">The love of Jesus Christ must be our guide if we are to become aware of the needs of those we can help in some way.

Monson is a great example of this principle. In January of 2005, he was presiding over a priesthood leadership conference in Puerto Rico when he demonstrated how the Savior and His servants render service through personal ministry. At the conclusion of that wonderful meeting, President Monson began to greet all the priesthood leaders in attendance. Suddenly, he noticed that one of them was watching everything from afar, off by himself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">President Monson walked away from the group, toward that brother, and spoke to him. With emotion, Jos\u00e9\u00a0R. Zayas told him it was a miracle that he had approached him and an answer to the prayers that he and his wife, Yolanda, had offered before the meeting. He told President Monson that his daughter was in very poor health and that he had with him a letter from his wife that she wanted delivered to President Monson. Brother Zayas had told his wife that it would be impossible since President Monson would be too busy. President Monson listened to the story and asked for the letter, which he read silently. Then he put it in his suit pocket and told Brother Zayas that he would take care of their request.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">In this way, that family was touched by our Lord, Jesus Christ, through His servant. I believe the words of the Savior in the parable of the good Samaritan apply to us: \u201cGo, and do thou likewise.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-10911_000_039\">4<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130411\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130411)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130411)\">Luke 10:37<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">On September 21, 1998, Hurricane Georges hit Puerto Rico, causing extensive damage. Sister Martinez, our five children, and I managed to survive that great storm and its hurricane-force winds by staying in our home. However, we went two weeks without running water and without power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">When our supply of water ran out, obtaining more was difficult. I will never forget the brethren who ministered to us by providing that precious liquid, nor will I forget the loving way the sisters also served us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">Germ\u00e1n Col\u00f3n came to our house with a large plastic water container in a pickup truck. He told us he was doing it because, in his words, \u201cI know you have little children who need water.\u201d A couple of days later, Brothers Noel Mu\u00f1oz and Herminio G\u00f3mez loaded three large water tanks onto a flatbed truck. They showed up at our house unexpectedly and filled every available water bottle with drinking water, also inviting our neighbors to fill theirs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">Our prayers were answered by their personal ministries. The faces of those three brethren reflected the love that Jesus Christ has for us, and their service\u2014in other words, their personal ministry\u2014brought much more than drinking water into our lives. To every son or daughter of God, knowing that people are interested in and watching out for his or her welfare is essential.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">I testify to you that Heavenly Father and our Lord, Jesus Christ, know us individually and personally. For that reason, They provide what we need so we will have the opportunity to reach our divine potential. Along the road, They place people who will help us. Then, as we become instruments in Their hands, we are able to serve and help those They show to us by revelation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">In this way, the Lord Jesus Christ will reach all of Heavenly Father\u2019s children. The Good Shepherd will gather all His sheep. He will do so one by one as they make good use of their moral agency\u2014after hearing the voice of His servants and receiving their ministrations. Then they will recognize His voice, and they will follow Him. Such personal ministry is integral to keeping our baptismal covenants.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/our-personal-ministries.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">Likewise, being a good example of a disciple of Jesus Christ is our best letter of introduction to those with whom we can share His gospel.
