Some are born with physical or mental disabilities that cause personal suffering for them and struggles for those who love and care for them.

Indeed, because of Their all-encompassing love, our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, hear and suitably answer the prayers of all who seek Them in faith. As the Apostle Paul wrote, \u201cWe trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131175\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131175)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131175)\">1\u00a0Timothy 4:10<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/strengthened-by-the-atonement-of-jesus-christ.p53\" class=\"\" id=\"p53\">I know these things to be true. Our Savior\u2019s Atonement does more than assure us of immortality by a universal resurrection and give us\u00a0the opportunity to be cleansed from sin by repentance and baptism. His Atonement also provides\u00a0the opportunity to call upon Him who has experienced all of our mortal infirmities to give us the strength to bear the burdens of mortality. He knows of our anguish, and He is there for us. Like the good Samaritan, when He finds us wounded at the wayside, He will bind up our wounds and care for us (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"131176\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131176)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131176)\">Luke 10:34<\/a><\/span>). The healing and strengthening power of Jesus Christ and His Atonement is for all of us who will ask.
