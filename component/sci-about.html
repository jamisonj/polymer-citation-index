            <h2 class="self-center section">Overview</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the LDS Scripture Citation Index.  This index, found on the
            right side of your browser window, links from scriptures to the general
            conference talks, <i>Journal of Discourses</i> speeches, and writings in
            <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i> that cite those
            scriptures.&nbsp; So, for example, suppose you want to know who has cited
            1&nbsp;Ne.&nbsp;3:7 in general conference; tap on the First Nephi button
            followed by the 1&nbsp;Ne.&nbsp;3 button; there you'll find the answer.&nbsp;
            Who has quoted Matt.&nbsp;5:48?&nbsp; Use the New Testament index to find out.</p>

            <p>The panel on the left side of your browser lets you read the scriptures, including
            the King James Version and Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, the Book of Mormon,
            Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.  This is not the official
            LDS version of the standard works.  Go to <a href="http://lds.org/scriptures">LDS.org/scriptures</a>
            for the official publication.  Among the differences between this version and the Church's official
            version are that we do not include their footnotes, chapter summaries, and study helps
            such as the Bible Dictionary and Topical Guide.</p>

            <p>We have indexed the scriptures cited by speakers in LDS General Conference
            between 1942 and the present, and those cited by speakers recorded in the
            <i>Journal of Discourses</i> between 1839 and 1886.&nbsp; The citations in
            <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i> come from the special edition,
            <i>Scriptural Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, edited by Richard C.
            Galbraith and published by Deseret Book in 1993 (ISBN 0875796478).</p>

            <p>To begin, click on one of the books and chapters in the index and you'll see
            a list of references for verses in that chapter.&nbsp; A reference looks like
            this: <b>2 Pet. 1:4</b>.  When you select the <b>2 Pet. 1:4</b> item, you will see
            a list of citations for 2 Peter chapter 1 verse 4.  Citations occur in three forms.

            <p><b>1. General Conference:</b></p>
            <!-- NEEDSWORK: replace this with the component we create to show a talk link -->
            <div class="list">
                <ul class="referencesblock"><li><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="refcounter"><div
                    class="reference referencewatch referencelisten" style="width: 302px;">2006&ndash;A:114, James E. Faust</div><div

            </div>
            <p>&ldquo;2006&rdquo; is the year of the conference, &ldquo;A&rdquo; means April (or &ldquo;O&rdquo; for October),
            &ldquo;114&rdquo; is the page number in the <i>Ensign</i> (1971&ndash;present) or <i>Conference Reports</i> (1942&ndash;1970).
            &ldquo;James E. Faust&rdquo; is the speaker name, and the talk title appears in smaller
            text on the second line.  The icons labeled Watch and Listen take you to LDS.org for a video or audio
            presentation of the talk.  Audio and video are available for more recent conference talks, but not for
            older talks.</p>

            <p><b>2. Journal of Discourses:</b></p>
            <!-- NEEDSWORK: replace this with the component we create to show a Journal of Discourses link -->
            <div class="list">

                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>&ldquo;10&rdquo; means volume 10 of the <i>Journal of Discourses</i>, &ldquo;194&rdquo;
            is the page number, &ldquo;a&rdquo; indicates the left column (or &ldquo;b&rdquo; for the
            right column), &ldquo;Brigham Young&rdquo; is the speaker name, and the discourse
            title appears in smaller text on the second line.</p>

            <p><b>3. Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith:</b></p>
            <!-- NEEDSWORK: replace this with the component we create to show a TPJS link -->
            <div class="list">
                <ul class="referencesblock">
                    <li><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="refcounter"><div
                        class="reference referencewatch referencelisten" style="width: 302px;">TPJS 163, Joseph Smith</div><div

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>&ldquo;163&rdquo; is the page number in <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>.</p>

            <p>In general conference talks, <i>Journal of Discourses</i>, and
            <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>,
            synchronization arrows (<img src="../images/sync_17@2x.png" width="22" height="17">)
            appear to the left of each scriptural reference.  Clicking on these arrows
            will synchronize the citation index to display all other occurrences
            of that scripture.</p>

            <p>In <i>Journal of Discourses</i> talks, pages and columns are separated
            by yellow (left column, <u>a</u>) or blue (right column, <u>b</u>) markers.
            Within each marker are two icons.  The left icon
            (<img src="../images/pdf_17.png" width="14" height="17">)
            brings up a PDF copy of the printed page; the right icon
            (<img src="../images/hbll_17.png" width="14" height="17">)
            brings up the BYU Library digital scan of the original.</p>

            <h2 class="self-center section">How to Search</h2>
            This web site uses the open-source Lucene search engine, so queries use the Lucene
            syntax, which is a lot like Google's.  Here are few sample queries you might try:</p>
            <table class="search">
                <tr><th>Search Terms</th><th>Finds Documents &hellip;</th></tr>
                <tr><td>angels stand sentinels</td><td>Finds documents containing
                        any combination of these words.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>+angels +stand +sentinels</td><td>Finds documents containing
                        all three words.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>-angels +sentinels</td><td>Finds documents containing
                        &ldquo;sentinels&rdquo; but not &ldquo;angels&rdquo;.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>&ldquo;angels sentinels&rdquo;~10</td><td>Finds documents where
                        &ldquo;sentinels&rdquo; is separated from &ldquo;angels&rdquo;
                        by at most 10 words.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>&ldquo;angels who stand&rdquo;</td><td>Finds documents containing
                        the exact phrase &ldquo;angels who stand&rdquo;.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>+Uchtdorf +hope</td><td>Finds all talks from President Uchtdorf
                        including the word &ldquo;hope&rdquo;.  Note that this actually
                        finds all documents that include the words &ldquo;Uchtdorf&rdquo;
                        and &ldquo;hope&rdquo;, but most often documents containing the
                        word &ldquo;Uchtdorf&rdquo; are his talks.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>angel*s</td><td>Finds documents containing any word starting with
                        &ldquo;angel&rdquo; and ending with &ldquo;s&rdquo; (e.g.,
                        &ldquo;angels&rdquo;, &ldquo;Angeles&rdquo;). The <b>*</b> wildcard
                        matches any combination of 0 or more letters.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>s?nd</td><td>Finds documents containing any 4-letter word starting
                        with &ldquo;s&rdquo; and ending with &ldquo;nd&rdquo; (e.g.,
                        &ldquo;sand&rdquo;, &ldquo;send&rdquo;). The <b>?</b> wildcard
                        matches exactly one letter.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>Searches are case insensitive. The <b>*</b> wildcard may not appear as the first letter of a search
            term, and both <b>*</b> and <b>?</b> wildcards may not be used in phrase and proximity searches.
            For example, the queries &ldquo;angel*s stand&rdquo;~5
            and &ldquo;s?nd here&rdquo; both will produce no results.</p>

            <p>Our search facility lets you search either the talks (including <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>,
            <i>Journal of Discourses</i>, and talks from General Conference since 1942) or the scriptures.  When searching
            talks, by default we sort the results according to relevance, meaning that talks that use the search terms
            most appear earlier in the results list.  You can change this to sort by date by unchecking the box next
            to "Sort by Relevance", and the results list will be sorted by date (most recent talk first).  You can
            also limit the search to a specific speaker and/or to a range of years, and you can choose which sets of
            talks to search (i.e. General Conference, <i>Journal of Discourses</i>, or <i>Teachings</i>).</p>

            <p>When searching scriptures, the default order for the results list is by order within the standard works
            (<i>Old Testament</i>, <i>New Testament</i>, <i>Book of Mormon</i>, <i>Doctrine and Covenants</i>, and
            <i>Pearl of Great Price</i>).  If you check the box next to "Sort by Relevance", the results list will be
            presented in order of relevance, meaning verses that have search terms as a higher percentage of the verse
            will appear earlier in the results.  You can also choose which specific volumes to search.  Selecting "Joseph
            Smith Translation" tells the system to search for JST verses that are footnoted in the LDS edition of the
            Bible.  However, if you deselect Old Testament and New Testament but select "Joseph Smith Translation", then
            the system will search all verses of the JST, not just the LDS footnoted verses.</p>

            <h2 class="self-center section">History</h2>
            <p>The LDS Scripture Citation index was first created in paper form by Richard Galbraith
            while serving as a faculty member at BYU (now emeritus).  The index was made into a web site
            and corresponding mobile apps by Stephen Liddle, also a BYU faculty member.  We've had help
            from many great BYU students through the years working on various aspects of this project.
            We appreciate the help of our research assistants,
            particularly Brad Humphery, Jeremy Knudsen, Allan Bond, Will Jensen, James Anderson,
            Dan King, Thomas Packer, Rosie Liddle Sadler, and James Delorey, who have been instrumental in building the 
            database and programming elements of this site.&nbsp; Brandon Petersen is the graphics designer
            who created the art work shown at the top of this panel.  We also gratefully 
            acknowledge funding provided by the

                canceled due to an epidemic of Asian flu in the United States.&nbsp; Elder

                Also, in our index, page numbers for conference addresses between 1942 and 1970
                reference the Conference Reports due to the scarcity of Improvement Era magazines.
