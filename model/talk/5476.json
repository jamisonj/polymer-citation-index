Nineteen years ago, after my being set apart by the Quorum of the Twelve in the temple as an assistant to the Twelve Apostles, Elder LeGrand Richards gave me two pieces of wisdom that have come to me over and over in the past fifty-some-odd hours that I have known of this call. First was, \u201cOh, to be a boy and have your whole life ahead of you.\u201d I was forty-two years of age. I am now sixty-one and am once again a boy. There are men sitting on this stand who have been Apostles and in the First Presidency for half my age.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-unique-message-of-jesus-christ.p4\" class=\"\">The second gem of wisdom that Elder LeGrand Richards gave me was that each time a new assignment in the Church came to him, it was like the shaking of an oak tree: when the tree shook, an acorn would fall and be planted, allowing him a new beginning in that assignment. \u201cYou know, my life has been like a great oak tree. From a tiny acorn, I would grow a great oak tree.\u201d Then he said, \u201cI did it in business, and the oak tree shook. An acorn came down, and they sent me out as a mission president. Then I grew another oak tree; they sent me out a second time as a mission president, and then a third.\u201d Then he talked of being a Presiding Bishop. And each time the oak tree would shake, an acorn would be planted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-unique-message-of-jesus-christ.p5\" class=\"\">At this time, I understand the oak tree has shaken. An acorn has been planted; it is a new beginning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-unique-message-of-jesus-christ.p6\" class=\"\">I express gratitude, my brothers and sisters, for the strength which comes through your faith and prayers. I am in need of your prayers at this time of my calling. To be an Apostle of the Lord, I am finding, is a process\u2014a process of repentance and humility, to look inward as we\u2019ve been instructed and ask for forgiveness and strength to be what I should be. Unfortunately, I am not a perfect man, and infallibility does not come with the call. Therefore, I must ask for forgiveness from Heavenly Father for those things which I have done which are less than perfect and ask forgiveness of anyone I might have offended knowingly or unknowingly because of my personality or style.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-unique-message-of-jesus-christ.p7\" class=\"\">The strength which will come through your prayers will be invaluable to what I need to do to forge the spiritual strength required to have my voice and my testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ penetrate the hearts of those who will hear.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-unique-message-of-jesus-christ.p8\" class=\"\">I express my appreciation to my parents, my dear brother who has passed away, and my sister for their loving example. I am grateful for the many teachers, and the priesthood leaders who work week after week, teaching us as youth to love the Lord. I wish, also, to express appreciation and my deep love for my wife, children, and grandchildren. I have been privileged to work among the finest Brethren that this earth can have in the Quorum of the Seventy\u2014working together and forging our testimonies to further the Lord\u2019s work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-unique-message-of-jesus-christ.p9\" class=\"\">In the closing of this chapter of my stewardship as the Presiding Bishop, I wish to welcome and sustain Bishop Bateman as the new Presiding Bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and let him know of the marvelous experiences that he will have in his calling.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-unique-message-of-jesus-christ.p10\" class=\"\">I love the four Counselors who have served with me, Elder Eyring, Elder Pace, Bishop Burton, and Bishop Edgley. They are deeply spiritual and truly devoted men whose love for the Lord has been an example to me. I would also like to express thanks and appreciation to the loyal staff in the Presiding Bishopric\u2019s office, both at Church headquarters and around the world. My expression of appreciation would not be complete without communicating my thanks for the faithful talents and labors of the Saints around the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-unique-message-of-jesus-christ.p11\" class=\"\">We have such faithful members of the Church. I have known of the tithes and offerings and the freewill offerings that have led to welfare and humanitarian efforts. This is a marvelous work and a marvelous Church with magnificent members.
