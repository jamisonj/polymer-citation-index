If we had the wisdom and faith to utilize the quorum as the Lord envisions it, we would be magnified before Him, and every member of the Church would be blessed.

John\u2019s influence upon his quorum was profound, and yet he never played a football game, nor went camping with them, nor danced, nor did any of the usual teenage activities. It was his faith and commitment to the Church that touched his quorum members. And something else\u2014John provided his quorum with an opportunity to serve with love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/to-honor-the-priesthood.p26\" class=\"\">When John was a deacon, he wanted to pass the sacrament. One boy was assigned to push his wheelchair while John held the tray on his lap.

His quorum found a solution. They placed his wheelchair next to the sacrament table. One would break the bread, then kneel for him, by the wheelchair, and hold a microphone while John pronounced those sacred words. To do this for their brother soon became an honor for each one in the quorum.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/to-honor-the-priesthood.p28\" class=\"\">They enthusiastically followed his leadership as first assistant in the priests quorum.
