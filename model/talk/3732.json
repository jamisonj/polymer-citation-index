After a sweet message of thanks and appreciation, came an expression of concern about the responsibilities she would now encounter being on her own. Up until now she felt she had lived a sheltered life and had relied on her family to give her direction and strength. She was beginning to realize life is hard!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/faith-the-force-of-life.p5\" class=\"\">My daughter\u2019s note made me think of the encounters I\u2019ve had during the past several months with many people of the Church who seem to be asking, \u201cHow do I deal with the difficult challenges of life?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/faith-the-force-of-life.p6\" class=\"\">Life is hard. It is a challenge. At every age life presents trials to bear and difficulties to overcome. Growing up is hard. There are often the heartaches of feeling wronged or rejected. Pursuing an education can press us to our financial, emotional, and intellectual limits. Serving a mission is not easy. It requires total dedication, spiritually and physically. The problems accompanying marriage, rearing a family, earning a living, or coping with illness, old age, and death are realities of life which we are required to meet, but with which we may be unprepared or unwilling to deal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/faith-the-force-of-life.p7\" class=\"\">We will be able to face and solve these challenges more willingly and courageously when we understand that such obstacles are encountered as a natural part of living.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/faith-the-force-of-life.p8\" class=\"\">C.

We may feel that life is cruel and unfair to us, that we would like to retreat into our own shelter and never have to venture forth into the world. To do so, however, would be to deny ourselves the opportunities for growth which life and its experiences are designed to bring to us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/faith-the-force-of-life.p23\" class=\"\">The Lord has made available to us a power which will turn these challenges into opportunities, a power which will enable us to understand the Apostle Peter\u2019s declaration that such trials of our faith are indeed more precious than gold.

One young lady held up an illustration in her Book of Mormon, painted by Arnold Friberg. It depicted the two thousand sons of Helaman known as the \u201cstripling soldiers.\u201d (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"9377\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9377)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9377)\">Alma 53:22<\/a><\/span>.)

When their fathers were converted to the gospel, the fathers covenanted with the Lord that they would never again take up arms. But eventually their homes were threatened by hostile armies to the extent that the fathers would have to choose to fight or die.

To obtain employment, he found it necessary to persist and to prove himself.
