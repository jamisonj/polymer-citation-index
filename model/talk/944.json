Hinckley<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Gordon B. Hinckley, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1958, pp. 123-125<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brethren and sisters, I am reminded of a statement made by my first missionary\ncompanion when I received a letter of transfer to the European Mission office. After I had\nread it, I turned it over to him.  He read it, and then said: \"Well, you must have helped an old\nlady across the street in the preexistence.  This recognition has not come because of anything\nyou've done here.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHumbly, I seek the blessings of the Lord.  I am overwhelmed with a sense of inadequacy.  I\nfeel shaken, and if what I say is largely in the nature of personal testimony, I hope you will\nforgive me.\n<\/p><p>\nSince President McKay spoke with me late last evening I have been thinking about the road\nthat led here.  I know that I have not come that road alone, and I feel very grateful for the\nmany men and women&mdash;the great and good men who are here today, and the small and\nobscure, but, wonderful people, many of whose names I do not remember&mdash;who have helped\nme.  It is the same with each of us in the Church. No man proceeds alone. We grow\naccording to the help given us by those who teach us and lead us.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been marvelously fortunate and greatly blessed.  I have had a wonderful opportunity in\nworking closely with the Brethren&mdash;all of those who are on this stand, and many who have\nsat here in years past and who are gone. I have had a sure conviction that President McKay is\na prophet of the Lord since the day he was sustained as the President of this Church, and I\nhave had many experiences which have confirmed that conviction.\n<\/p><p>\nI had the great opportunity of being with him at the Swiss Temple, and as I saw those people\ngathered from ten nations to participate in the temple ordinances; as I saw elderly people from\nbehind the Iron Curtain who had lost their families in the wars that had washed over them,\nand witnessed the expressions of joy and tears of gladness which came from their hearts as a\nresult of the opportunities that had been given them; as I saw young husbands and wives with\ntheir families&mdash;their bright and beautiful children&mdash;and saw those families united in an\neternal relationship, I knew with a certainty even beyond what I had known before that this\nman was inspired and directed of the Lord to bring these priceless blessings\ninto the lives of those men and women of faith gathered from the nations of Europe.\n<\/p><p>\nI do not know why under the blessing of Providence I have had the marvelous association\nwhich I have had with President Richards. In 1935 when I was released from my mission,\nElder Joseph F. Merrill of the Council of the Twelve, who was my mission president, asked\nthat I meet with the First Presidency to tell them of some conditions in the European\nmissions.  Following that interview President McKay assigned me to work under the\nsupervision of Brother Richards, and for almost a quarter of a century I have worked under\nhis direction and have been tutored by him.  I have partaken of his wisdom&mdash;his great\nwisdom&mdash;and his kindness and graciousness. I shall ever be in his debt, and I want him to\nknow of my love and appreciation for him.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Clark has been my ever-ready friend and adviser. I do not know how to say thanks\nenough to him. And to all of these Brethren whom I have come to love, and who have been\nso generous and good to me, I am deeply grateful.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been touched by the mission presidents with whom I have worked. As I have known\ntheir stories, the great sacrifices which they have made to go into the world, the devotion with\nwhich they labor, the manner in which they give of themselves, I have been humbled.  I have\nbeen inspired by the missionaries with whom I have had association. I have seen them as they\nhave gone out in all kinds of weather, late and soon, doing their work and bearing testimony,\noften at great sacrifice, and bringing a marvelous harvest of souls into the kingdom of God. I\nhave been touched by their parents, with many of whom I have talked.  There are still many\nwidows in this Church who wash and iron, who sweep and empty wastebaskets to keep sons\nand daughters in the mission field, and who would mortgage all they have to give whatever\nmight be felt necessary to make more effective the work of a son or daughter in the mission\nfield.\n<\/p><p>\nI have thought, as has Brother Tuttle, of my teachers of the Primary, the Sunday School, and\nthe MIA, and of the Aaronic Priesthood leaders who helped me along when I was a noisy\nboy, and who exercised patience and forbearance.  I do not remember many of the specific\nlessons they taught, but somehow there was born in my heart a conviction concerning the\ntruth of this work.\n<\/p><p>\nI shall always be grateful to the bishop who recommended me for a mission, for my\ncompanions in the field, to the humble men and women of faith among whom I labored; to\nBrother George D. Pyper of the Sunday School, who invited me to serve on the general\nboard; to my stake president who invited me to become his counselor.  To Brother Harold B.\nLee I feel particularly indebted for a blessing which he gave me when he set me apart as a\nstake president. I shall never forget the language and spirit of that blessing.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, in conclusion, I should like to express my appreciation to my father. He lies critically ill\nin the hospital.  If I feel any selfish satisfaction in this honor, it is the satisfaction that comes\nfrom the realization that one of his sons has been found worthy of the confidence of the\nBrethren.  And if I feel any regret, it is that, unless the Lord rules to the contrary, he will not\nknow of this in mortality because of the condition in which he lies today.\n<\/p><p>\nNo son ever had a better father. He was busy in the Church&mdash;for twenty-five years he was in\nthe stake presidency and fulfilled many other responsibilities&mdash;but he never forced his views\nupon us and never compelled us to participate. He never touched one of his children.  But by\nsome inspired psychology he planted in us a faith, a love for the restored gospel, and, I think,\na desire to do the right thing.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like also to express appreciation to my marvelous and faithful mother.  She died three\nyears before I went on a mission. I received my call in the days of depression, and money\nwas scarce, and the mission to which I went was then the most costly in the Church. But we\nfound that she, through the years, had banked some of her small change and set up, as it\nwere, a trust fund so that her boys might go on missions regardless of any\neconomic catastrophe that might hit the family.\n<\/p><p>\nI would also like to express appreciation for the wonderful women who have come into our\nhome and for my own beloved companion and our five children.\n<\/p><p>\nI say these things for two reasons: first, because I am grateful to all who have helped me\nalong the way, and secondly, because I would like to make the point that all of us, in our\nvarious situations, are the result, largely, of the lives that touch ours; and that as teachers and\nofficers in the Church we affect for good or ill all who come under our direction according to\nour diligence in meeting our responsibilities.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was Emerson, I think, who was asked what book had had the greatest influence upon his\nlife, and he said he could no more remember the books he had read than he could remember\nthe meals he had eaten, but they had made him. Likewise, all of us are largely the products of\nthe lives which touch upon our lives, and today I feel profoundly grateful for all who have\ntouched mine.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, in conclusion, on this sixth day of April, significant under the revelations of the Lord\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13613\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13613)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13613)\">D&amp;C 20:1<\/a><\/span>), I,\ntoo, would like to bear testimony that I know that God lives, that Jesus is our Redeemer, the\nOnly Begotten of the Father in the flesh, the Savior of mankind who gave his life to atone for\nour sins; that Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet of God, the prophet of this dispensation; that\nthe Lord's work is here and is real and under his direction; and that President David O.\nMcKay stands, as did the prophet of this dispensation, to lead the kingdom of God, as the\nstone which was cut out of the mountain without hands, which should roll forth and fill the\nearth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13635\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13635)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13635)\">D&amp;C 65:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us, you and me, to live up to the testimonies which we carry in our hearts, I\nhumbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
