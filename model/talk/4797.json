The publication bore the title, <span class=\"emphasis\">Windows to the World.<\/span> Each page contained a framed picture of a well-known and beautiful site, accompanied by a well-written description which made one desire to visit all of the locations shown. The Matterhorn in Switzerland, the Alps of New Zealand, even the Taj Mahal of India\u2014all seemed to suggest to the reader the desirability of an immediate visit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p4\" class=\"\">Windows are wonderful. They serve as a frame on which we might focus our attention. They provide a glimpse of God\u2019s creations. The azure blue sky, the billowy, white clouds, the verdant green forest all are as framed pictures in the memory of the mind. Windows also reveal the approach of a friend, a gathering storm, a magnificent sunset\u2014even the passing parade of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p5\" class=\"\">Windows welcome light to our lives and bring joy to our souls.

Ever shall I remember a visit to the home of President Hugh B. Brown. It was graduation day at Brigham Young University. He was to conduct the exercises, and I was to deliver the commencement address. I drove to President Brown\u2019s home and escorted him to my car. Before we could drive away, however, he said to me, \u201cWait just a few minutes. My wife, Zina, will come to the front window.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p7\" class=\"\">I glanced at the window, noted that the curtain had parted, and saw Zina Brown sitting in her wheelchair, affectionately waving a small, white handkerchief toward the gaze of her smiling husband. President Brown reached into his jacket pocket, retrieved a white handkerchief, and began to wave it gently, much to the delight of his wife. We then inched away from the curb and commenced the journey to Provo.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cWhat is the significance of the white-handkerchief waving?\u201d I asked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p9\" class=\"\">He replied, \u201cZina and I have followed that custom since we were first married.

I reflected on an experience in my life, one that had a happier ending.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p22\" class=\"\">Each time I would visit an older widow whom I had known for many years and whose bishop I had been, my heart grieved at her utter loneliness. A favorite son of hers lived many miles away, and for years he had not visited Mother. Mattie spent long hours in a lonely vigil at her front window. Behind a frayed and frequently opened curtain, the disappointed mother would say to herself, \u201cDick will come; Dick will come.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p23\" class=\"\">But Dick didn\u2019t come. The years passed by one after another. Then, like a ray of sunshine, Church activity came into the life of Dick. He journeyed to Salt Lake to visit with me. He telephoned upon his arrival and, with excitement, reported the change in his life. He asked if I had time to see him if he were to come directly to my office. My response was one of gladness. However, I said, \u201cDick, visit your mother first, and then come to see me.\u201d He gladly complied with my request.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p24\" class=\"\">Before he could get to my office, there came a phone call from Mattie, his mother. From a joyful heart came words punctuated by tears: \u201cTom, I knew Dick would come. I told you he would. I saw him through the window.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p25\" class=\"\">Years later at Mattie\u2019s funeral, Dick and I spoke tenderly of that experience.

Mr. Norris determined to build a plant in an area of extreme poverty. The neighborhood was predominantly composed of a minority race\u2014unmarried women with children, uneducated, uncared-for, but needing help. These women became the work force in the production of high-tech computers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p49\" class=\"\">I had the privilege to be hosted by Mr. Norris and to be given a tour of his new facility. I was impressed with the employment provided\u2014but more impressed with the company nursery, which occupied a wing of the building. Here, while their mothers worked, children received schooling, including proficiency with computers. Since most of the children did not have fathers and grandfathers who cared, retired grandfathers in the community were invited to have lunch with them. The children were benefited, and the grandfathers had a special blessing brought into their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p50\" class=\"\">As a result of Mr. Norris\u2019s dream, the chain of poverty was broken. Children learned to earn. It was as though William Norris had personally blessed the life of each worker. Through the window provided by Mr. Norris\u2014even love in action\u2014I saw demonstrated the philosophical and practical truth: The bottom line of living is giving.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p51\" class=\"\">As we go about our daily lives, we discover countless opportunities to follow the example of the Savior.

However, there is one picture that always hangs on the wall which I face when seated behind my desk. It is a constant reminder of Him whom I serve, for it is a picture of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. When confronted with a vexing problem or difficult decision, I always gaze at that picture of the Master and silently ask myself the question, \u201cWhat would He have me do?\u201d No longer does doubt linger, nor does indecision prevail. The way to go is clear, and the pathway before me beckons.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p53\" class=\"\">Some months back I sat in my office chair reading the daily mail. I opened a letter from Martha Sharp of Wellsville, Utah, and read her entreaty seeking a blessing for her grown son, Steven, who was a patient at University Hospital in Salt Lake City. She described Steven\u2019s spiritual and physical needs and the likelihood that he would suffer the amputation of his foot. Her tears were felt in each word, and her feelings of love marked every sentence. Hers was a request which the Spirit simply did not allow me to delegate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p54\" class=\"\">When I entered Steven\u2019s hospital room that night, I saw a man who just seemed built to ride a horse. Sensing this, I began to chat with him about a Western adventure film I had seen recently. I described the beautiful horses ridden by the principal characters. A warm smile came over Steven\u2019s face. Not until that moment did I note on his nightstand a book he had been reading. It was the book from which the film we had been discussing was made. Our conversation was warm and free from that point forward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p55\" class=\"\">In describing his condition, Steven commented, \u201cI hope they leave enough of my foot so that I can get it into a stirrup.\u201d I assured him we would remember his name when the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve met in the holy temple and that my wife and I would personally remember him in our prayers. I told him that he had a wonderful mother, who loved him and remembered him in his need, and a Heavenly Father who also loved and remembered him. Steven began to weep. A special spirit filled the room. A blessing was given, a heart cleansed, a memory of home and family rekindled, and a mother comforted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/windows.p56\" class=\"\">As I departed the hospital, situated high on the east bench of Salt Lake City, I gazed at the panoramic view of the valley before me.
