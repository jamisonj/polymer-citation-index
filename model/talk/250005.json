True, when the Lord speaketh He does not reckon time as we do. The time was, in the infancy of this Church, when our minds were so narrow compared to what they are now, that we looked for the speedy coming of our Lord, and the accomplishment of His great work before this time. But as our minds grew, and our ideas enlarged, we began to perceive that we were only children in our views and feelings, our ideas and expectations. We had the views, ideas and expectations of children; and we see how the Lord has enlarged Israel and expanded His work; and now we behold so much more to be accomplished than what has been accomplished, that we are apt in our minds to put off the day of the Lord a great way. The time was that we looked for one temple. The early revelations given to the Latter-day Saints predicted <span class=\"italic\">a<\/span> temple in Zion,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"86099\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 86099)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(86099)\">D&amp;C 57:3<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"87488\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 87488)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(87488)\">D&amp;C 84:3-5<\/a><\/span> and Zion in our minds at that time was a little place on the Missouri River in Jackson County, Western Missouri&#x2014;a town and a few surrounding villages, or a country, peradventure it may be as large as a county. When we first heard the fullness of the Gospel preached by  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"31a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0031.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;31a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9113\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>the first Elders, and read the revelations given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, our ideas of Zion were very limited. But as our minds began to grow and expand, why we began to look upon Zion as a great people, and the Stakes of Zion as numerous, and the area of the country to be inhabited by the people of Zion as this great American continent, or at least such portions of it as the Lord should consecrate for the gathering of His people. We ceased to set bounds to Zion and her Stakes. We began also to cease to think about a single temple in one certain place. Seeing the different Stakes of Zion that were being organized we perceived the idea, possibly, of as many temples. Having had one spot pointed out in the revelations for the temple in Jackson County,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"86100\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 86100)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(86100)\">D&amp;C 57:3<\/a><\/span> our minds expanded so that in a short time we were building another temple in a Stake of Zion in Kirtland, Ohio. A little while afterwards we were laying the foundation of a temple in Far West, Missouri, and driven before our enemies; from that place we next laid the foundation and built up a temple unto the Lord in Nauvoo. When we located in the mountains and laid the foundation of a temple in Salt Lake City, who of us had an idea that before it should be completed we would be administering in a temple in St. George, and another in Logan, and another in Manti, and who conceives the idea today, that by the time these are completed and the Saints have officiated in them, we will be scattered over the American continent, building temples in a hundred other places? All this comes within the range of possibility, nay, probability, almost amounting to certainty. One of my brethren behind me here, who understands these things, and who can speak <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"31b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0031.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;31b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9113\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> knowingly in regard to them, says, that we may put it down as a certainty, that by and by, there will be hundreds of these temples throughout the land. Our minds are beginning to comprehend the object and purpose of the temples of our God. We realize that they are places where the Lord bestows the keys of life and salvation pertaining to the everlasting Priesthood, and opens the door of redemption and salvation unto our dead. We begin to comprehend a little of the vision shown to Ezekiel, as recorded in the 37th chapter of his book. Ezekiel, while under the influence of the Spirit of the Lord, was set down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones. He explored the valley, saw there were very many bones, and, lo, they were very dry. The Lord commanded him to prophesy concerning them, and he prophesied, saying: &#x201C;O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. * * * And the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"60817\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 60817)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(60817)\">Ezek. 37:1-11<\/a><\/span> Now, these were not the prophets and saints and righteous dead who had been partakers of the blessings of the Gospel and of the Priesthood, while in the flesh, but were those who had passed off in a day of darkness, and in their lost condition said to one another, and said in their hearts, &#x201C;Our  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"32a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0032.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;32a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9112\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>bones are dried, and <span class=\"italic\">our hope is lost<\/span>: we are cut off for our parts.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"60843\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 60843)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(60843)\">Ezek. 37:11<\/a><\/span> But lo! the plan of salvation for the dead is revealed.

As long as there is one soul (of all the sons and daughters of Adam that have been born on this earth) that has not had an opportunity of receiving and obeying the Gospel; as long as there is one soul that is in a condition to be saved and that can be reached by this plan of salvation, so long will the Latter-day Saints be engaged in this work. But what I was going to bring before your minds was this: Shall we expect that the Lord Jesus is going to delay His coming in the midst of His people, until all this great work shall have been accomplished? By no means. I do not understand that He has ever intimated anything of this kind. Nor need we wait in our faith and in our expectations till all these great and glorious things shall have been accomplished on the earth before the Prophet Joseph Smith shall come unto us again.

The Lord was satisfied with his labors here. He lived long enough to endow his brethren with full authority to carry on the work that he had begun on the earth. He took his departure behind the veil. The Lord suffered his enemies to destroy him in the flesh, to take away his life, and he was made an offering&#x2014;what shall I say? an offering for sin. Not in the sense in which the Savior was offered, but he was made a martyr for the truth and his blood was shed to attest the testimony that he bore to the world. He entered upon another short mission. Where? Why, unto his brethren of the house of Israel, and as many of the Gentiles as will receive his testimony, behind the veil. The mission of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, between his death and resurrection was a similar mission, but a very short one. It lasted only three days. While his body lay in the tomb his spirit visited the spirits in prison, turned the key and opened the door of their prison house, and offered unto them the Gospel of salvation.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"77994\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 77994)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(77994)\">1 Pet. 3:18-20<\/a><\/span> How many of them were prepared to avail themselves of it at that time?

Smith, Don Carlos Smith&#x2014;all the first Elders of this Church and the Presidents of all the early quorums, and a vast company of the members of their quorums. All these and many more are laboring in the spirit world preparing the spirits thereof to receive the benefits and blessings which are now about to be offered to them in the temples of God. In other words, &#x201C;a ticket of leave&#x201D; is about to be sent to them to the effect that their friends on the earth have officiated in their behalf, have complied with the ordinances which are appointed for their redemption, which will enable them to advance into a higher sphere, to walk upon a higher plane, to enter a higher class where they can be further instructed and prepared for a glorious resurrection. And as fast as this work is accomplished&#x2014;and it is nigh at hand, it is now even at our doors&#x2014;there will be another step made in advance; there will be another mission undertaken. The next mission will be to come and prepare the way in Zion, and in her Stakes, and in the temples of our God for turning the key of the resurrection of the dead, to bring forth those that are asleep, and to exalt them among the Gods. And who will be first and foremost? Why, he whom God has chosen and placed first and foremost to hold the keys of this last dispensation. How long will it be? It is not given to me to say the month, the day, or the hour; but it is given unto me to say that that time is nigh at hand.

And the Lord Jesus will appear and show Himself unto His servants in His temple in holy places, to counsel and instruct and direct. He will appear in the glory of His Father, in His resurrected body, among those who can endure His presence and glory. And all this I expect long before He will waste away and destroy the wicked from off the face of the earth. True, we have, in our limited understandings, perhaps imagined, many of us, that this glorious resurrection was to come upon us, and upon the whole world suddenly, like the rising of the sun. But you must remember the sun does not rise the same hour and the same moment upon all the earth. It is twenty-four hours in rising and twenty-four hours in setting. So with the resurrection.
