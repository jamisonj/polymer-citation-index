I will use a short scripture phrase that helps me visualize the Savior\u2019s mercy. It is the phrase \u201carms of safety\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"117472\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117472)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117472)\">Alma 34:16<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Secure in His Arms<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/arms-of-safety.p7\" class=\"\">A family had been taking pictures on a lookout point of the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. They heard screams and ran to find that a two-year-old girl had fallen through a railing to a ledge about 35 feet (11\u00a0m) below. The little one tried to climb back up, but her movements caused her to slip even farther until she was 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) from a dangerous 200-foot (61-m) drop.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/arms-of-safety.p8\" class=\"\">A 19-year-old young man named Ian saw where she was and, using his emergency-response training, knew how to handle the situation. These are his words: \u201c\u2018Immediately, it all came at me, and I just knew what I had to do. I set down my camera and went up the trail a little ways where it wasn\u2019t as steep, climbed over the rail, scrambled down a bunch of rocks and through brush, and found her.\u2019 Holding her in his arms for an hour, Ian waited until emergency teams could drop down with ropes\u201d to rescue them (\u201cSave Her!\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">New Era,<\/span> Sept. 2007, 6).

When we were baptized and received the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, we received two ordinances that introduce us to the arms of safety.

Oaks has testified that there is a spiritual cleansing or healing associated with the sacrament: \u201cThe sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is a renewal of the covenants and blessings of baptism. We are commanded to repent of our sins and come to the Lord with a broken heart and a contrite spirit and partake of the sacrament. In the partaking of the bread, we witness that we are willing to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and always remember Him and keep His commandments. When we comply with this covenant, the Lord renews the cleansing effect of our baptism. We are made clean and can always have His Spirit to be with us\u201d (\u201cSpecial Witnesses of Christ,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Apr. 2001, 14; <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Apr. 2001, 13).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Implications for Aaronic Priesthood Holders<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/arms-of-safety.p20\" class=\"\">To help members more fully receive that cleansing, or the arms of safety, those who hold keys to authorize and those who administer the sacrament should ensure that general guidelines in Church handbooks concerning the preparation, blessing, and passing of the sacrament are followed. Each priesthood holder should remember that he is acting on behalf of the Lord and be reverent and dignified. Generally speaking, our youth are exemplary. However, in the administration of the sacrament, occasionally we see a disturbing drift towards too much informality and casualness in dress and appearance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/arms-of-safety.p21\" class=\"\">Young men, before going to church, will you please pause before a mirror one more time and ask yourself if every aspect of your appearance is in order?
