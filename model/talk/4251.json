A solemn assembly grants to members the right to participate in the principle of common consent, instituted by revelation, authorizing members to sustain those called to official positions. Individual histories and personal accounts of this historic conference will be a highlight throughout our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord.p5\" class=\"\">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints proclaims to the world that this church is a restoration of Christ\u2019s church. A restoration was necessary because prophets and Apostles, who were the foundation of the Lord\u2019s original church, were put to death or otherwise taken. The Church today is built on a foundation of prophets and Apostles, with Jesus Christ as its chief cornerstone. It is therefore not a reformation, a revision, a reorganization, or a mere sect. It is the Church of Jesus Christ restored in these latter days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord.p6\" class=\"\">A distinguishing feature of the Church is the claim to continuous revelation from the Lord\u2014\u201cthe making known of divine truth by communications from its heavens.\u201d (James E. Talmage, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Articles of Faith,<\/span> 12th ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1924, p. 296.) Today, the Lord\u2019s Church is guided by the same relationship with Deity that existed in previous dispensations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord.p7\" class=\"\">This claim is not made lightly. I know there is revelation, as I am a witness to sacred things also experienced by others who administer His work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord.p8\" class=\"\">The principle of revelation by the Holy Ghost is a fundamental principle of the Lord\u2019s Church. Prophets of God receive revelation by this process. Individual members of the Church may also receive revelation to confirm truth. The Prophet Joseph Smith told us that \u201cno man can receive the Holy Ghost without receiving revelation.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> sel.

The revelation states that the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is a body equal in authority to the First Presidency. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18501\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18501)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18501)\">D&amp;C 107:24<\/a><\/span>.) That means that when the President of the Church dies, the First Presidency is dissolved and the Quorum of the Twelve automatically becomes the presiding body of the Church. That pattern was established with the death of the Church\u2019s first President, Joseph Smith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord.p15\" class=\"\">Following the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum in 1844, the Quorum of the Twelve, with Brigham Young as quorum president, presided over the Church for the next 3 1\/2 years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord.p16\" class=\"\">Then, on the banks of the Missouri River in Winter Quarters on December 5, 1847, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles met in council at the home of Orson Hyde. Each of the twelve Apostles expressed his views regarding the matter of reorganizing the First Presidency. Present in that meeting was Ezra T. Benson, great-grandfather of President Ezra Taft Benson. On that occasion, Brigham Young, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, was unanimously sustained by members of that body as President of the Church. He selected Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards as counselors. This action created a new First Presidency, which was later sustained by the unanimous vote of the Saints at a general conference of the Church held December 24, 1847, in a log tabernacle constructed at Winter Quarters by the Saints for this special conference. This action was later ratified by members of the Church at conferences in Iowa, Salt Lake City, and the British Isles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord.p17\" class=\"\">This divinely revealed procedure for installing a new First Presidency of the Church\u2014revelation from the Lord and sustaining by the people\u2014has been followed to our present day.

After much fasting and prayer, and the seeking of personal revelation to know the mind and will of God, it was confirmed to our souls who should be called\u2014even Ezra Taft Benson. This I know! With that heavenly confirmation to each of those present, Ezra Taft Benson was ordained and set apart on Sunday, November 10, 1985, as prophet, seer, and revelator, and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord.p22\" class=\"\">What kind of preparation had the Lord given to this servant whom we will sustain as God\u2019s prophet, seer, and revelator?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord.p23\" class=\"\">He was reared on a small farm in Whitney, Idaho, the eldest of eleven children.

Our Heavenly Father is always near. You can reach out and receive His aid through prayer.\u201d On many occasions, our beloved prophet has stated: \u201c[This is] prized above any other advice I have ever received. It has become an integral part of me, an anchor, a constant source of strength.\u201d (Frederick W.

He was assigned to give assistance to members of the Church in Europe who had been devastated by World War II. He witnessed the ravages of war.

He said, \u201cI assure you I know the source of the success which attended our labors. \u2026 It would [have been impossible] \u2026 to accomplish the mission \u2026 without the directing power of the Almighty.\u201d (in Conference Report, Apr. 1947, p. 152.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord.p33\" class=\"\">For eight years he served in the cabinet of the president of the United States. Before the first Cabinet meeting, then-Secretary Benson suggested to President-elect Eisenhower that they commence with prayer. President Eisenhower spoke of the weight of responsibility on the new administration and the need for divine guidance, then called on the Secretary of Agriculture to open the meeting with prayer. That practice continued throughout the Eisenhower administration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord.p34\" class=\"\">As secretary of agriculture, he met with world leaders and traveled to most parts of the world. That experience also found him threatened by whirlwinds of the politically ambitious. But seeking strength from the Almighty, as he had done so often in the past, he stood firm in principle and survived efforts to bring about a more politically expedient course of action. Today, the name of Ezra Taft Benson is synonymous with integrity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord.p35\" class=\"\">In things that matter most, President Benson has few peers. I know he loves the Lord and depends upon Him for strength, inspiration, and direction. He loves all our Father\u2019s children everywhere and will go to extraordinary lengths to respond to their spiritual and temporal needs. He loves people of all faiths, of all creeds, of all colors, and of differing philosophies. I know I can speak for all of my Brethren of the General Authorities in saying that we have felt of his love and concern for each of us and for our families and loved ones. We wholeheartedly reciprocate that love to President and Sister Benson and their family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord.p36\" class=\"\">President Benson loves his family and keeps in constant touch with them\u2014his six children (all faithful in the Church), thirty-four grandchildren, and twenty great-grandchildren.
