Contrast that with the 30 years since 1980, during which 115 temples were built and dedicated. With the announcement yesterday of 3 new temples, there are additionally 26 temples either under construction or in preconstruction stages. These numbers will continue to grow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-holy-temple-a-beacon-to-the-world.p11\" class=\"\">The goal President Joseph\u00a0F.

Many years ago I read of a group of over a hundred members who left Manaus, located in the heart of the Amazon rain forest, to travel to what was then the closest temple, located in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2014nearly 2,500 miles (4,000 km) from Manaus. Those faithful Saints journeyed by boat for four days on the Amazon River and its tributaries. After completing this journey by water, they boarded buses for another three days of travel\u2014over bumpy roads, with very little to eat, and with nowhere comfortable to sleep. After seven days and nights, they arrived at the temple in S\u00e3o Paulo, where ordinances eternal in nature were performed. Of course their return journey was just as difficult. However, they had received the ordinances and blessings of the temple, and although their purses were empty, they themselves were filled with the spirit of the temple and with gratitude for the blessings they had received.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-09605_000_034\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Vilson Felipe Santiago and Linda Ritchie Archibald, \u201cFrom Amazon Basin to Temple,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Church News,<\/span> Mar. 13, 1993, 6.]<\/span><\/sup> Now, many years later, our members in Manaus are rejoicing as they watch their own temple take shape on the banks of the Rio Negro.

The entire family except for one daughter joined the Church in the early 1960s, when missionaries came to their island, located about 100 miles (160 km) south of Tahiti. Soon they began to desire the blessings of an eternal family sealing in the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-holy-temple-a-beacon-to-the-world.p15\" class=\"\">At that time the nearest temple to the Mou Tham family was the Hamilton New Zealand Temple, more than 2,500 miles (4,000 km) to the southwest, accessible only by expensive airplane travel. The large Mou Tham family, which eked out a meager living on a small plantation, had no money for airplane fare, nor was there any opportunity for employment on their Pacific island. So Brother Mou Tham and his son G\u00e9rard made the difficult decision to travel 3,000 miles (4,800 km) to work in New Caledonia, where another son was already employed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-holy-temple-a-beacon-to-the-world.p16\" class=\"\">The three Mou Tham men labored for four years. Brother Mou Tham alone returned home only once during that time, for the marriage of a daughter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-holy-temple-a-beacon-to-the-world.p17\" class=\"\">After four years, Brother Mou Tham and his sons had saved enough money to take the family to the New Zealand Temple. All who were members went except for one daughter who was expecting a baby. They were sealed for time and eternity, an indescribable and joyful experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-holy-temple-a-beacon-to-the-world.p18\" class=\"\">Brother Mou Tham returned from the temple directly to New Caledonia, where he worked for two more years to pay for the passage of the one daughter who had not been at the temple with them\u2014a married daughter and her child and husband.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-holy-temple-a-beacon-to-the-world.p19\" class=\"\">In their later years Brother and Sister Mou Tham desired to serve in the temple. By that time the Papeete Tahiti Temple had been constructed and dedicated, and they served four missions there.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-09605_000_034\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See C.\u00a0Jay Larson, \u201cTemple Moments: Impossible Desire,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Church News,<\/span> Mar. 16, 1996, 16.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-holy-temple-a-beacon-to-the-world.p20\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, temples are more than stone and mortar.

The Saints at the time were impoverished, and yet the Lord had commanded that a temple be built, so build it they did. Wrote Elder Heber\u00a0C. Kimball of the experience, \u201cThe Lord only knows the scenes of poverty, tribulation and distress which we passed through to accomplish it.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-09605_000_034\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Heber\u00a0C.

Kimball<\/span> (1945), 67.]<\/span><\/sup> And then, after all that had been painstakingly completed, the Saints were forced to leave Ohio and their beloved temple. They eventually found refuge\u2014although it would be temporary\u2014on the banks of the Mississippi River in the state of Illinois. They named their settlement Nauvoo, and willing to give their all once again and with their faith intact, they erected another temple to their God. Persecutions raged, however, and with the Nauvoo Temple barely completed, they were driven from their homes once again, seeking refuge in a desert.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-holy-temple-a-beacon-to-the-world.p22\" class=\"\">The struggle and the sacrifice began once again as they labored for 40 years to erect the Salt Lake Temple, which stands majestically on the block just south of those of us who are here today in the Conference Center.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-holy-temple-a-beacon-to-the-world.p23\" class=\"\">Some degree of sacrifice has ever been associated with temple building and with temple attendance.

Those who understand the eternal blessings which come from the temple know that no sacrifice is too great, no price too heavy, no struggle too difficult in order to receive those blessings. There are never too many miles to travel, too many obstacles to overcome, or too much discomfort to endure. They understand that the saving ordinances received in the temple that permit us to someday return to our Heavenly Father in an eternal family relationship and to be endowed with blessings and power from on high are worth every sacrifice and every effort.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-holy-temple-a-beacon-to-the-world.p25\" class=\"\">Today most of us do not have to suffer great hardships in order to attend the temple. Eighty-five percent of the membership of the Church now live within 200 miles (320 km) of a temple, and for a great many of us, that distance is much shorter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-holy-temple-a-beacon-to-the-world.p26\" class=\"\">If you have been to the temple for yourselves and if you live within relatively close proximity to a temple, your sacrifice could be setting aside the time in your busy lives to visit the temple regularly. There is much to be done in our temples in behalf of those who wait beyond the veil. As we do the work for them, we will know that we have accomplished what they cannot do for themselves. President Joseph\u00a0F. Smith, in a mighty declaration, stated, \u201cThrough our efforts in their behalf their chains of bondage will fall from them, and the darkness surrounding them will clear away, that light may shine upon them and they shall hear in the spirit world of the work that has been done for them by their children here, and will rejoice with you in your performance of these duties.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-09605_000_034\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph\u00a0F.

Your sacrifice may be bringing your life into compliance with what is required to receive a recommend, perhaps by forsaking long-held habits which disqualify you. It may be having the faith and the discipline to pay your tithing. Whatever it is, qualify to enter the temple of God. Secure a temple recommend and regard it as a precious possession, for such it is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-holy-temple-a-beacon-to-the-world.p29\" class=\"\">Until you have entered the house of the Lord and have received all the blessings which await you there, you have not obtained everything the Church has to offer.
