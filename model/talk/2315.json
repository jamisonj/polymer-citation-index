Jesus, being aware of this treachery, sat at the table with the Twelve. He said sorrowfully: \u201cVerily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36246\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36246)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36246)\">Matt. 26:21<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/and-always-remember-him.p5\" class=\"\">After they had eaten, Jesus blessed the bread and wine and in a simple but impressive manner instituted the sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/and-always-remember-him.p6\" class=\"\">A beautiful, inspirational discourse was then delivered by the Savior, who concluded the sermon with a prayer. Before they left the guest chamber in the building, a hymn or psalm was sung. Then Jesus and the 11 apostles departed. Judas had previously left the group to meet the enemies of Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/and-always-remember-him.p7\" class=\"\">Jesus and his associates passed through one of the several gates in the wall of Jerusalem, crossed over the brook called Cedron, and entered an olive orchard, known as Gethsemane, on the slope of Mount Olivet. This was a favorite meeting place for the Lord and his apostles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/and-always-remember-him.p8\" class=\"\">Entering the garden, Jesus asked eight of the apostles to remain behind; then with Peter, James, and John, he went a short distance, where he requested them to wait and watch. Going on alone a little ways, he knelt and prayed to his Father, saying: \u201cO my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me [but then came this beautiful lesson]; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36247\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36247)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36247)\">Matt. 26:39<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/and-always-remember-him.p9\" class=\"\">Three times he prayed, and we read: \u201cAnd being in agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31878\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31878)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31878)\">Luke 22:44<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/and-always-remember-him.p10\" class=\"\">Elder James E. Talmage, a member of the Twelve in our dispensation, made this observation: \u201cChrist\u2019s agony in the garden is unfathomable to the finite mind, both as to intensity and cause. The thought that He suffered through fear of death is untenable. Death to Him was preliminary to resurrection and triumphal return to the Father from whom He had come, and to a state of glory even beyond what He had before possessed; and, moreover, it was within His power to lay down His life voluntarily.\u201d Then Elder Talmage testifies: \u201cIn some manner, actual and terribly real, though to man incomprehensible, the Savior took upon Himself the burden of the sins of mankind from Adam to the end of the world.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Jesus the Christ, <\/span>p. 613.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/and-always-remember-him.p11\" class=\"\">Following the Savior\u2019s crucifixion and resurrection came the long dark night of the apostasy. Finally the heavens were reopened and the voice of the Lord was heard again on the earth. The gospel and priesthood were restored, and the church of Jesus Christ was reestablished in these latter days. Then from the Lord came this admonition to the members of the Church: \u201cAnd that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16097\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16097)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16097)\">D&amp;C 59:9<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/and-always-remember-him.p12\" class=\"\">And then the Lord further instructed: \u201cIt is expedient that the Church meet together often to partake of bread and wine in the remembrance of the Lord Jesus.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16050\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16050)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16050)\">D&amp;C 20:75<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/and-always-remember-him.p13\" class=\"\">In these words was the sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper authorized in our day, the dispensation of the fulness of times. The bread and water, duly consecrated by prayer, become emblems of the Lord\u2019s body and blood, to be partaken of reverently and in remembrance of him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/and-always-remember-him.p14\" class=\"\">The sacrament is a sacred and solemn service. As we partake of the sacrament, we make covenants with the Lord. This is not unusual, because Latter-day Saints are a covenant-making people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/and-always-remember-him.p15\" class=\"\">There are few set prayers in the Church, and the sacramental prayers, which came from the Lord by revelation, are two of them.

And if we do these things, we are then in a position to realize the meaningful promise: \u201cthat we may always have his Spirit to be with us.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/and-always-remember-him.p31\" class=\"\">What a wonderful blessing it would be if we could always have the Spirit of the Savior in our lives to guide and direct us!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/and-always-remember-him.p32\" class=\"\">While Wilford Woodruff was crossing the ocean on his final mission to Great Britain, he testified that the martyred Prophet, Joseph Smith, and his brother Hyrum appeared to him in his cabin aboard the ship. The vessel had been caught in a terrible storm, which had abated as a result of the prayers of the brethren. Hear Brother Woodruff\u2019s own words of what happened: \u201cThe night following [the storm] Joseph and Hyrum visited me, and the Prophet laid before me a great many things.
