One wonders how many persons have admired their beauty, how many picnics have been enjoyed in their welcome shade, how many generations of song birds have filled the air with music while capering among the outstretched and luxuriant branches.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p6\" class=\"\">The patriarchal elms are now dead. Their demise was not the result of old age, the recurring drought, nor the strong winds which occasionally lash the area. Their destroyer is much more harmless in appearance, yet deadly in result. We know the culprit as the bark beetle, carrier of the fatal Dutch elm disease. This malady has destroyed vast elm forests throughout Europe and America. Its march of death continues unabated. All efforts at control have failed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p7\" class=\"\">Dutch elm disease usually begins with a wilting of the younger leaves in the upper part of the tree. Later the lower branches become infected. In about midsummer most of the leaves turn yellow, curl, and drop off. Life ebbs. Death approaches. A forest is consumed. The bark beetle has taken its terrible toll.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p8\" class=\"\">How like the elm is man. From a minute seed, and in accordance with a divine plan, we grow, are nurtured, and mature. The bright sunlight of heaven, the rich blessings of earth are ours. In our private forest of family and friends, life is richly rewarding and abundantly beautiful. Then suddenly, there appears before us in this generation a sinister and diabolical enemy\u2014pornography. Like the bark beetle it too is the carrier of a deadly disease. I shall name it \u201cpernicious permissiveness.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p9\" class=\"\">At first we scarcely realize we have been infected. We laugh and make light-hearted comment concerning the off-color story or the clever cartoon. With evangelical zeal we protect the so-called rights of those who would contaminate with smut and destroy all that is precious and sacred. The beetle of pornography is doing his deadly task\u2014undercutting our will, destroying our immunity, and stifling that upward reach within each of us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p10\" class=\"\">Can this actually be true? Surely this matter of pernicious permissiveness is not so serious. What are the facts? Let\u2019s look! Let\u2019s listen! Then let\u2019s act!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p11\" class=\"\">Pornography, the carrier, is big business. It is Mafia-spawned. It is contagious. It is addicting. In a study last year, the FBI estimated that Americans spent 2.4 billion dollars on hard-core pornography. Other estimates reach as high as 4 billion\u2014a fortune siphoned away from noble use and diverted to a devilish purpose!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p12\" class=\"\">Apathy toward pornography stems mostly from a widespread public attitude that it is a victimless crime and that police resources are better used in other areas. Many state and local ordinances are ineffective, sentences are light, and the huge financial rewards far outweigh the risks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p13\" class=\"\">The FBI points out that pornography may have a direct relationship to sex crimes. \u201cIn one large western city,\u201d an agency report states, \u201cthe vice squad advised that 72 percent of the individuals arrested for rape and child-related sexual offenses had in their possession some type of pornographic material.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p14\" class=\"\">Some publishers and printers prostitute their presses by printing millions of pieces of pornography each day. No expense is spared. The finest of paper, the spectrum of full color combine to produce a product certain to be read, then read again. Nor are the movie producer, the television programmer, or the entertainer free from taint. Gone are the restraints of yesteryear. So-called realism is the quest.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p15\" class=\"\">One of the leading box office stars of today lamented: \u201cThe boundaries of permissiveness have been extended to the limit. The last film I did was filthy. I thought it was filthy when I read the script, and I still think it\u2019s filthy; but the studio tried it out at a Friday night sneak preview and the audience screamed its approval.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p16\" class=\"\">Another star declared, \u201cMovie makers, like publishers, are in the business to make money, and they make money by giving the public what it wants.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p17\" class=\"\">Some persons struggle to differentiate between what they term \u201csoft-core\u201d and \u201chard-core\u201d pornography. Actually, one leads to another. How applicable is Alexander Pope\u2019s classic, \u201cEssay on Man\u201d:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p18\" class=\"\">Vice is a monster of so frightful mien As to be hated needs but to be seen; Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face, We first endure, then pity, then embrace.

Some are particularly scarred by its insidious touch.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p20\" class=\"\">Come with me for a moment to a place portrayed in song\u2014dear to the heart of America\u2014New York City\u2019s world-famous landmark of Broadway and Forty-fifth Street. There, standing so forlornly alone on a tiny island surrounded by bustling traffic, is a heroic-size statue of Father Francis P. Duffy, well-known chaplain of the Fighting Sixty-ninth of World War I fame. He wears the uniform of the battlefield. He carries a canteen to relieve the physical distress of the wounded and a Bible to bring spiritual comfort to the dying.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p21\" class=\"\">As we gaze at this splendid statue, there courses through memory\u2019s corridors such melodies of the period as \u201cOver There,\u201d \u201cKeep the Home Fires Burning,\u201d and \u201cGive My Regards to Broadway.\u201d Were those fallen warriors who knew the song and remembered with affection Broadway and Forty-fifth Street to return and stand with us at the side of Father Duffy\u2019s statue, what sight would meet their eyes and ours? On every hand are massage parlors, sex shops, X-rated movies\u2014the neon-lighted signs flashing their facade of allure. The statue of Father Francis P. Duffy stands surrounded by sin, engulfed by evil. The pornography beetle has just about destroyed this area. He moves relentlessly closer to your city, your neighborhood, and your family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p22\" class=\"\">An ominous warning was voiced by Laurence M.

I don\u2019t think our civilization will die that way. I think it will die when we no longer care. Arnold Toynbee has pointed out that 19 of 21 civilizations have died from within and not by conquest from without. There were no bands playing and flags waving when these civilizations decayed. It happened slowly, in the quiet and the dark when no one was aware.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p24\" class=\"\">Just this month I read a review of a new movie. The leading actress told the reporter that she objected initially to the script and the part she was to play. The role portrayed her as the sexual companion of a fourteen-year-old boy. She commented: \u201cAt first I said, \u2018No way will I agree to such a scene.\u2019 Then I was given the assurance that the boy\u2019s mother would be present during all intimate scenes, so I agreed.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p25\" class=\"\">I ask: Would a mother stand by \u201cwatching,\u201d were her son embraced by a cobra?

May I suggest three specific steps in our battle plan:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/pornography-the-deadly-carrier.p31\" class=\"\">First, a return to righteousness. An understanding of who we are and what God expects us to become will prompt us to pray\u2014as individuals and as families.
