Presidents of the Church called members on missions with no warning beforehand. I feel the same way today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-answers-will-come.p4\" class=\"\">It\u2019s a long way from Switzerland to this stand in Salt Lake City. I had to cross many borders. I had to ask for a visa, for permission to enter this country. But I found out that wherever I had to cross a border or had to talk with people, the people were friendly. That\u2019s exactly what I need in my assignment\u2014friends. I have some sitting behind me. I have some sitting before me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-answers-will-come.p5\" class=\"\">I\u2019m really happy to be here and to serve. I don\u2019t know at the moment all the questions I will be asked or how I will find solutions for them. But I know that I will get an answer when I work on it and pray about it. If I do that, I know I will be blessed in all I do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-answers-will-come.p6\" class=\"\">I am very thankful for my priesthood leaders, my parents, my sisters, my brethren, my teachers in Sunday School\u2014all who have given me the strength to fulfill the assignments I get in my life. Hopefully, I can serve so that our Lord will be pleased. I am very thankful to the First Presidency for this privilege\u2014for calling me to be a General Authority. I leave you my testimony that I know that our Lord lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph Smith is a true prophet. This I say in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
