I have been deeply impressed and strengthened by the prayers, the music, and the spoken word.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p4\" class=\"\">We have prayed that the Spirit of the Lord would be with us, and our prayers have been answered. Prayer plays a vital part in our worship, our religious thinking, and our daily lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p5\" class=\"\">In the time allotted to me today I would like to further consider with you the importance of prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p6\" class=\"\">Implanted in the heart of every person, regardless of his or her race or color, is the desire to worship, in some manner, a divine being. The Prophet Joseph Smith observed that \u201cit is the first principle of the gospel to know for a certainty the character of God, and to know that we may converse with Him as one man converses with another. \u2026\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Documentary History of the Church, <\/span>vol. 6, p. 305.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p7\" class=\"\">With the knowledge that we can converse with God as one man converses with another, we also understand that we not only have a divine spark within us, but that we are actually spirit children of our Father in heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p8\" class=\"\">Prayer, being the primary method of communication between God and man, plays an important part in practically every religion, whether Christian or otherwise. This is particularly true in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p9\" class=\"\">Prayer opened the heavens to the Prophet Joseph Smith and thus opened the dispensation of the fulness of times. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is truly a monument to prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p10\" class=\"\">I am most grateful to the Prophet Joseph Smith for his simple belief in prayer.

Prayer has been a great blessing to me and to my family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p14\" class=\"\">The Lord has repeatedly told us to pray always and that he will pour out his Spirit upon us and bless us greatly.

I have frequently contemplated what \u201cpray always\u201d really means and how this injunction can be effectively applied in our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p15\" class=\"\">Brigham Young, in his realistic manner, stated: \u201cYou know that it is one peculiarity of our faith and religion never to ask the Lord to do a thing without being willing to help him all that we are able; and then the Lord will do the rest.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses, <\/span>vol. 5, p. 293.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cPlease, Lord, help me to help myself.\u201d I am convinced that this prayer for increased personal powers\u2014spiritual strength, greater inspiration, and greater confidence\u2014is one that God always answers.

Let me suggest a few examples:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p18\" class=\"\">As we pray for wisdom and knowledge, our part can be to study and apply ourselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p19\" class=\"\">As we ask for health and strength of body and of mind, we can supplement prayer by living the Word of Wisdom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p20\" class=\"\">As we ask for protection, our part could well be to use good judgment, such as driving carefully, if we are traveling by car.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p21\" class=\"\">When we pray for inspiration, we should live close to the Lord by keeping his commandments.

Make a decision and then ask the Lord if your decision is right; if so, you will receive a burning of your bosom or a good feeling; if not, you will receive a stupor of thought or a questionable feeling. Then whatever the feeling you receive, have the courage to follow it. This is doing your part.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p23\" class=\"\">The question is frequently asked, What should one pray for? Well, prayer being the soul\u2019s sincere desire, uttered or unexpressed, pray for your righteous desires. But never forget that whatever our prayers are, we can supplement our heavenly request with some positive action on our part.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p24\" class=\"\">We members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who make prayer a part of our lives, sometimes fail to recognize that many honest souls throughout the world are wondering how to pray, when to pray, and where to pray.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p25\" class=\"\">Let\u2019s consider for a moment how to pray. The Savior told us how when he said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cAfter this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cThy kingdom come.

Our prayers should simply be our soul\u2019s sincere desire. In our church worship there are only three set prayers: the baptismal and two sacramental prayers. We are also directed to close all of our prayers to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p32\" class=\"\">Now, when to pray: Generally, I think we might say that we should pray in secret, with our families, and in worship meetings and public assemblies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p33\" class=\"\">Secret prayer should have a place in every person\u2019s life. Again the Savior gave us the pattern when he said: \u201c\u2026 when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36128\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36128)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36128)\">Matt. 6:6<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p34\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph Smith, speaking on this subject, stated: \u201cWe would say to the brethren, seek to know God in your closets, call upon him in the fields. Follow the directions of the Book of Mormon, and pray over, and for your families, your cattle, your flocks, your herds, your corn, and all things that you possess; ask the blessing of God upon all your labors, and everything that you engage in.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">DHC, <\/span>vol. 5, p. 31.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p35\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph Smith here amplifies the admonition to pray always. Now with reference to family prayer: This should be a part of our daily worship. It should express our appreciation to our Father in heaven for our many blessings as well as our love for him. Here we should ask for our daily needs, as the Savior did in the Lord\u2019s Prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p36\" class=\"\">The holding of family prayer is a powerful influence for good in every home where it is a regular practice. Morning and evening prayers, as well as the blessing on our food, bring us a sense of unity in our family as well as a closeness to our Father in heaven. Family prayer is indeed a stabilizing influence in our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p37\" class=\"\">President John Taylor asked the Saints, \u201cDo you have [family] prayers in your family? \u2026 And when you do, do you go through the operation like the guiding of a piece of machinery, or do you bow in meekness and with a sincere desire to seek the blessing of God upon you and your household? That is the way that we ought to do, and cultivate a spirit of devotion and trust in God, dedicating ourselves to him, and seeking his blessings.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">JD, <\/span>vol. 21, p. 118.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-importance-of-prayer.p38\" class=\"\">Now regarding public prayers: Public prayers are a part of our worship services and many other public gatherings.
