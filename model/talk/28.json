I have read the Book of Mormon, studied it,\nand rejoiced in the teachings thereof. I have rejoiced in reading and studying the book of\nDoctrine and Covenants, and also the Pearl of Great Price. I recommend these books to many honest souls\nasking questions about them. These books constitute a library, one of the greatest libraries in\nthe world, because It sets forth the truth, and calls attention to the wages of evil, and warns\nagainst the evil.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many interesting and instructive stories and principles in these good books. If we\nwill follow the teachings thereof closely through our lives, we will reach a safe journey's end.\n<\/p><p>\nI was reading the other day, from the book of Alma, who was the son of Alma. I think likely\nyou would be interested if I read some, this afternoon from the character of Alma the Second.\n<\/p><p>\nThis Alma, the Second, was addressing himself to his son Helaman. This is where the story\nbegins, and very soon has an ending.\n<\/p><p>\nMy son, give ear to my words; for I swear unto you, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the\ncommandments of God ye shall prosper in the land.\n<\/p><p>\nI would that ye should do as I have done, in remembering the captivity of our fathers; for\nthey were in bondage, and none could deliver them except it was the God of Abraham, and\nthe God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and he surely did deliver them in their afflictions.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and therefore I beseech of thee\nthat thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; for I do know that whosoever shall put their\ntrust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall\nbe lifted up at the last day.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I would not that ye think that I know of myself&mdash;not of the temporal but of the spiritual,\nnot of the carnal mind but of God.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, behold, I say unto you, if I had not been born of God I should not have known these\nthings; but God has, by the mouth of his holy angel, made these things known unto me, not\nof any worthiness of myself;\n<\/p><p>\nFor I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the church of God; but behold,\nGod sent his holy angel to stop us by the way.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd behold, he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and the whole earth did\ntremble beneath our feet; and we all fell to the earth, for the fear of the Lord came upon us.\n<\/p><p>\nBut behold, the voice said unto me: Arise. And I arose and stood up, and beheld the angel.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no more to destroy the church\nof God.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for the space of three days and three\nnights that I could not open my mouth, neither had I the use of my limbs.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did not\nhear them; for when I heard the words&mdash;If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to\ndestroy the church of God&mdash;I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I\nshould be destroyed, that I fell to the earth and I did hear no more.\n<\/p><p>\nBut I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree\nand racked with all my sins.\n<\/p><p>\nYea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of\nhell: yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy\ncommandments.\n<\/p><p>\nYea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather, led them away unto destruction; yea,\nand in fine so great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence\nof my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.\n<\/p><p>\nOh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might\nnot be brought to stand in the presence of my God, to be judged of my deeds.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned\nsoul.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the\nmemory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto\nthe people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of\nthe world.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son\nof God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the\neverlasting chains of death.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, behold, when I thought this I could remember my pains no more; yea I was\nharrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as\nexceeding as was my pain!\n<\/p><p>\nYea, I say unto you, my son, that then could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my\npains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so\nexquisite and sweet as was my joy.\n<\/p><p>\nYea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded\nwith numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea,\nand my soul did long to be there.\n<\/p><p>\nBut behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I stood upon my feet, and did\nmanifest unto the people that I had been born of God.\n<\/p><p>\nYea, and from that time even until now I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring\nsouls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did\ntaste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.\n<\/p><p>\nYea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth give me exceeding great joy in the fruit of\nmy labors;\n<\/p><p>\nFor because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold, many have been born of\nGod, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they\ndo know of these things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I\nhave is of God.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I have been supported under trials and trouble of every kind, yea, and in all manner of\nafflictions: yea, God has delivered me from prison, and from bonds, and from death; yea, and\nI do put my trust in him, and he will still deliver me.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I know that he will raise me up at the last day, to dwell with him in glory; yea, and I\nwill praise him forever, for he has brought our fathers out of Egypt, and he has swallowed up\nthe Egyptians in the Red Sea; and he led them by his power into the promised land; yea, and\nhe has delivered them out of bondage and captivity from time to time\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8806\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8806)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8806)\">Alma 36:1-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren, this is a remarkable case. It shows the love and mercy of God that was shown\nto this man when he repented of his sins. God took mercy upon him and forgave him of his\nsins, and he accomplished a mighty work among his people, and he became high priest in the\nChurch.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless you, my brethren. This large audience is a great sight, but I must not\nlinger as there are others yet to speak.\n<\/p><p>\nPeace be with you. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
