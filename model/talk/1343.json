Romney, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1964, pp. 122-126<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI would like to say a few things this afternoon about revelation, which underlies all that God\nhas done in the earth with his children. I invite you to join your prayers with mine that while\nI speak, you and I may both enjoy the spirit of inspiration. That we do so is imperative,\nbecause to talk about revelation without the spirit of inspiration would be futile.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>God Communicates with Men<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFirst, as to the Principle:\n<\/p><p>\nPrayer is the means by which men communicate with God. Revelation is the means by which\nGod communicates with men. Revelation is indispensable to an understanding of the gospel of\nJesus Christ. The very nature of the gospel is such that without the active and constant\noperation of the principle of revelation, it could not be understood nor could it be had.\n<\/p><p>\nThe gospel deals with total truth&mdash;\". . . knowledge of things as they are, as they were, and as\nthey are to come\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14458\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14458)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14458)\">D&amp;C 93:24<\/a><\/span>).\nSuch truth is not to be had through man's ordinary learning\nprocesses. His sensory powers are calculated and adapted to deal only with\nthe things of this earth. Without revelation, man's intellect is wholly inadequate for the\ndiscovery of the ultimate truth with which the gospel deals.\n<\/p><p>\nPaul spoke of this to the Corinthians when he said:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in\ndemonstration of the Spirit and of power:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For what man [continues Paul] knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is\nin him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"380\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 380)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(380)\">1 Cor. 2:4-5,11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Opens the Mind and the Spirit<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe principle of revelation is the key which opens the mind and spirit of man to an\nunderstanding of the gospel. There is no other key to such knowledge. Thinkers have\nphilosophized; poets have dreamed; and scientists have experimented; but only God speaks\nwith a sure knowledge of all truth.\n<\/p><p>\nSome years ago I listened to a lecturer who argued long and deviously and came to the\nconclusion that there was no such thing as religious knowledge. Within his premises, he was\nright. He had no religious knowledge, and he could not obtain any because he had ruled out\nrevelation.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my witness to you, however, that by the power of God, truth concerning the eternal\nverities with which the gospel deals has been in the past, is now being, and will in the future\ncontinue to be communicated to men from heaven by revelation. \"Revelation\" is the\n\"governing law of conduct\"&mdash;the age-old established rule of action or principle by which God\ncommunes with men.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Man Must be Born Again<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow a word as to the Nature of Revelation:\n<\/p><p>\nSince revelation is by nature spiritual man, to receive it, must be spiritually born again. You\nwill recall how earnestly Jesus sought to put this point over to Nicodemus, repeatedly telling\nhim that except a man be born again, he could neither see nor enter the kingdom of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28108\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28108)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28108)\">John 3:3-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMan is a dual being. He is composed of a spirit and a body. His body came into being with\nhis entrance into this world of mortality. His spirit as an individual person was begotten unto\nGod in the spirit world. Through a long period of growth and development, each person's\nspirit came to know God and spiritual things, including the gospel, obedience to which is a\nprerequisite to attaining eternal life. Men, however, enter mortality spiritually blind. Never in\nthis life do they recover memory of pre-mortal spiritual things. What they here learn of them\nmust be revealed anew.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"To see if they will do . . .\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOne of God's purposes in granting men mortal life is that they might be tested \". . . to see if\nthey will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them . . . they who\nkeep their second estate [meaning this mortal estate] shall have glory added upon their heads\nfor ever and ever\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7234\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7234)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7234)\">Abr. 3:25-26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSince attaining this glory is conditioned upon obedience to the laws and ordinances of the\ngospel, and since men come into life ignorant of these principles and ordinances, justice\ndemands that they be given opportunity to learn about them. God, being not only just but\nmerciful, provided revelation as the means by which man might be so advised.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Moral Agency<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord also saw to it that men were so constituted that by the proper exercise of their\nmoral agency with which he also endowed them, it would be natural for them to respond to\nrevelation. Otherwise, it would not be just to hold them accountable for their failure to\nrespond thereto.\n<\/p><p>\nI know the scriptures say that \"the natural man is an enemy to God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40328\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40328)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40328)\">Mosiah 3:19<\/a><\/span>). And\nso he is when he rejects the promptings of the Spirit and follows the lusts of the flesh. But he\nis not an enemy to God when he follows the promptings of the Spirit.\n<\/p><p>\nI firmly believe that notwithstanding the fact that men, as an incident to mortality, are cast out\nfrom the presence of God and deprived of past memories, there still persists in the spirit of\nevery human soul a residuum from his preexistent spiritual life which instinctively responds to\nthe voice of the Spirit of Christ until and unless inhibited by the free agency of the individual.\nIf I had time, I could cite many authorities on this point.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Manifestations of Revelation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow, as to the Manifestations of Revelation:\n<\/p><p>\nRevelation comes to men in an unlimited number of ways. Three separate mediums are\nmentioned in the first recorded account of revelation&mdash;the spoken word, the visitation of\nangels, and the power of the Holy Ghost. As a consequence of his transgression Adam was\ncast out from God's presence. But he was not forsaken. As he and Eve toiled and prayed, \". .\n. they heard the voice of the Lord from the way toward the Garden of Eden\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39221\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39221)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39221)\">Moses 5:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39223\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39223)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39223)\">Moses 5:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Holy Ghost<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"And in that day the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam, which beareth record of the Father and the\nSon\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39225\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39225)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39225)\">Moses 5:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe spoken word has been heard on many occasions. Moses heard it from the burning bush;\nSamuel in the temple. The Nephites heard the voice of the unseen Jesus.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Visitations of Angels<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAs to the visitation of angels, we have many examples. One which moves me as much as any\nis the record in the third chapter of Ether of the appearance of Jesus in his spirit body to the\nbrother of Jared.\n<\/p><p>\nYou will remember how, as Alma was traveling from Ammonihah to Aaron, an angel\nappeared to him and said, referring to the time of Alma's conversion, \"I am the same angel\nthat appeared to you before\" (see\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9042\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9042)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9042)\">Alma 8:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe read in the 110th section of the Doctrine and Covenants about the visitation to the\nProphet and Oliver of Moses, Elias, and Elijah\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14490\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14490)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14490)\">D&amp;C 110:11-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Unspoken Word<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnother manifestation of revelation is the unspoken word, a good illustration of which is\ngiven us by Enos. He says: \". . . while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of\nthe Lord came into my mind again, saying\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21488\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21488)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21488)\">Enos 1:10<\/a><\/span>).\nThen he tells us what the voice of\nthe Lord put in his mind. This is a very common means of revelation. It comes into one's\nmind in words and sentences. With this medium of revelation I am personally well\nacquainted.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Impelling Impulse<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnother medium is an impelling impulse of the nature received by the Prophet when he read\nJames 1:5 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26170\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26170)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26170)\">James 1:5<\/a><\/span>).\n\"Never [said he] did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart\nof man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every\nfeeling of my heart\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30449\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30449)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30449)\">JS&mdash;H 1:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Dreams<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnother means is dreams&mdash;Jacob's ladder, for example, Joseph's dream of the sheaves,\nPharaoh's dream of the lean and fat years. There were Nebuchadnezzar's dream, Daniel's\ndream, Lehi's dream. Joseph, the husband of Mary, was warned in a dream to take Mary and\nJesus into Egypt.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Visions<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnother medium of revelation is visions. You know about Nephi's vision, the Prophet's great\nvision recorded in the 76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, and President Joseph F.\nSmith's vision of work for the dead in the spirit world.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Flashes of Ideas<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFlashes of ideas that come into one's mind represent another type or manifestation of\nrevelation. Listen to this statement of the Prophet Joseph:\n<\/p><p>\n\"A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation; for instance,\nwhen you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas, so\nthat by noticing it, you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon; (i.e.) those things that were\npresented unto your minds by the Spirit of God, will come to pass; and thus by learning the\nSpirit of God and understanding it, you may grow into the principle of revelation, until you\nbecome perfect in Christ Jesus.\" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>, p. 151.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Study it out\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the most familiar types of revelation is the one which the Lord took so much pains to\nteach to Oliver Cowdery. The lesson begins in the 6th and 8th sections of the Doctrine and\nCovenants and concludes it in the 9th section. Oliver wanted to translate, and the Lord finally\ngave his consent. But Oliver didn't translate because he didn't work hard enough. When he\ncomplained about it, the Lord said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Do not murmur, my son, for it is wisdom in me that I have dealt with you after this manner.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when\nyou took no thought save it was to ask me.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Ask if it be right . . .\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me\nif it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore,\nyou shall feel that it is right.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14365\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14365)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14365)\">D&amp;C 9:6-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the kind of revelation we can all live by. One need not make serious mistakes in life.\nSuch can be avoided by following this formula. It will guide us in all our activities if we will\nbecome sensitive to it.\n<\/p><p>\nThe foregoing are but some of the means of revelation.\n<\/p><p>\nIn connection with this principle of revelation, the Prophet Joseph Smith further said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"We consider that God has created man with a mind capable of instruction, and a faculty\nwhich may be enlarged in proportion to the heed and diligence given to the light\ncommunicated from heaven to the intellect . . . the nearer man approaches perfection, the\nclearer are his views, and the greater his enjoyments, till he has overcome the evils of his life\nand lost every desire for sin; and like the ancients, arrives at that point of faith where he is\nwrapped in the power and glory of his maker, and is caught up to dwell with Him\"\n(<i>DHC<\/i> 2:8.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Great Exemplar<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn qualifying to receive revelation, as in all righteousness, Jesus is our great exemplar. He so\nqualified himself that he received through revelation \"a fullness of the glory of the Father\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14455\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14455)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14455)\">D&amp;C 93:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWith respect to this point, John the Beloved bore this witness:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I beheld his glory, as the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I, John, saw that he received not of the fullness at the first . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fullness . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I, John, bear record that he received a fullness of the glory of the Father\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14454\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14454)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14454)\">D&amp;C 93:11-13,16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Keep Commandments<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTo me, among the most inspiring passages of all scripture is the comment of Jesus on this\ntestimony of John's, which, as you will remember, was dictated to the Prophet by the Savior.\nAfter quoting John's testimony, Jesus said to the Prophet Joseph Smith:\n<\/p><p>\n\"I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and know how to worship, and know\nwhat you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive\nof his fullness.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fullness, and be glorified in me\nas I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14456\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14456)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14456)\">D&amp;C 93:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow this is Christ's promise to the Prophet, and it is his promise to us.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . no man receiveth a fullness unless he keepeth his commandments.\n<\/p><p>\n\"He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and\nknoweth all things\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14460\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14460)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14460)\">D&amp;C 93:27-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Receive Light and Truth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe receive a little revelation; we obey it; we receive a little more, obey it, and repeat the\ncycle over and over again.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the pattern by which the promise of the first paragraph of this great revelation may be\nobtained. As you now listen to this promise, let your souls be filled with hope.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and\ncometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my\ncommandments, shall see my face and know that I am\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14452\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14452)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14452)\">D&amp;C 93:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn these remarks I have, as you of course have noted, omitted any reference to revelation in\nconnection with the great advances of science in our age. This I have done deliberately. I\nknow that all men live and learn by the light of the Spirit of Christ; I know that all progress\nin science and other fields of secular learning is made possible by the light of Christ. I do not,\nhowever, think that our distinctive message about revelation lies in such fields of learning but\nrather in the field of religion.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"God Has Opened the Heavens\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOur message is that we are living in the great and last dispensation of the gospel of Jesus\nChrist; that God has opened the heavens anew; that by direct revelation through the means we\nhave been considering, he has revealed himself, restored his gospel, set up his Church with\npower and authority to preach the gospel and administer the saving ordinances thereof; and\nthat he is now, today, continuing to direct by revelation his great program for the blessing and\nthe salvation of the human race.\n<\/p><p>\nOur great mission is to declare this message with such simple clarity and inspired conviction\nthat men of all lands will hearken, investigate, and prayerfully seek until, through personal\nrevelation to themselves, they obtain a saving witness for themselves. That we may\nsuccessfully discharge this mission, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
