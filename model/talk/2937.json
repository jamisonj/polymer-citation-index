The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is fast becoming a worldwide church. Congregations of Saints are now, or soon will be, strong enough to support and sustain their members no matter where they reside. Temples are being built wherever the need justifies. We can foresee many temples in South America in process of time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/come-let-israel-build-zion.p45\" class=\"\">Stakes of Zion are also being organized at the ends of the earth. In this connection, let us ponder these truths: A stake of Zion is a part of Zion. You cannot create a stake of Zion without creating a part of Zion. Zion is the pure in heart; we gain purity of heart by baptism and by obedience. A stake has geographical boundaries. To create a stake is like founding a City of Holiness. Every stake on earth is the gathering place for the lost sheep of Israel who live in its area.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/come-let-israel-build-zion.p46\" class=\"\">The gathering place for Peruvians is in the stakes of Zion in Peru, or in the places which soon will become stakes. The gathering place for Chileans is in Chile; for Bolivians it is in Bolivia; for Koreans it is in Korea; and so it goes through all the length and breadth of the earth. Scattered Israel in every nation is called to gather to the fold of Christ, to the stakes of Zion, as such are established in their nations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/come-let-israel-build-zion.p47\" class=\"\">Isaiah prophesied that the Lord \u201cshall cause them that come of Jacob to take root; Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.\u201d The Lord\u2019s promise is: \u201cYe shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25495\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25495)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25495)\">Isa. 27:6, 12<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/come-let-israel-build-zion.p48\" class=\"\">That is to say\u2014Israel shall be gathered one by one, family by family, unto the stakes of Zion established in all parts of the earth so that the whole earth shall be blessed with the fruits of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/come-let-israel-build-zion.p49\" class=\"\">This then is the counsel of the Brethren: Build up Zion, but build it up in the area where God has given you birth and nationality.

But Zion is not yet perfected in any of these places.
