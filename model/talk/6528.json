My program of study was very demanding, leaving me little free time. One Sunday in church the ward Primary president approached me and asked if I might substitute as a Primary teacher for two weeks. Primary was then held on a weekday afternoon, and I knew it would be difficult to find room in my schedule to teach the class. But after some hesitation, I agreed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/building-the-kingdom.p5\" class=\"\">The appointed day came to teach Primary. That afternoon I was in the university library, absorbed in a book on international politics. The subject I was studying seemed somehow more important than the upcoming Primary class. Consequently, I procrastinated until just 30 minutes before the class was to begin to review the lesson I was to teach. Then I walked from the library down to our ward chapel on the edge of campus. My reluctant attitude must have slowed my steps, for I arrived a few minutes late. As I stepped to the door of the Primary room, the children were just beginning to sing the opening hymn. It was a song I had never heard before, a song whose melody and message touched me deeply:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">As I have loved you,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Love one another.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">This new commandment:<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Love one another.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">By this shall men know<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Ye are my disciples,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">If ye have love<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">One to another.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/building-the-kingdom.p14\" class=\"\">(\u201cLove One Another,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 308)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/building-the-kingdom.p15\" class=\"\">As I stood there, transfixed in the doorway, the Spirit bore witness that I was looking at the most important class taking place in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/building-the-kingdom.p16\" class=\"\">Back at the university in dozens of classrooms and laboratories, dedicated scholars were pursuing answers to the world\u2019s problems. Yet valuable though such efforts may have been, the university did not and could not hold the ultimate answers to the problems of a troubled world. Here before me was the Lord\u2019s answer: the quiet building up of His kingdom on earth by the teaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ. What was taking place in Primary that day was a small part of a divinely revealed plan for the salvation of a fallen world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/building-the-kingdom.p17\" class=\"\">In October 1831, the Lord in reference to the Restoration declared, \u201cThe keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11136\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11136)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11136)\">D&amp;C 65:2<\/a><\/span>). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that kingdom whose destiny it is to fill the whole earth. In the miraculous wisdom of the Almighty, the building up of God\u2019s kingdom in the latter days will take place by means as plain and simple as what I witnessed in Primary that day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/building-the-kingdom.p18\" class=\"\">We rejoice to hear of temples being reared in every quarter of the earth and of far-flung nations opening their doors to the gospel. Built upon a foundation of apostles and prophets, the Lord\u2019s Church is being taken to the whole world by missionaries called to proclaim His word. Sometimes, perhaps, we may be inclined to see the building of the kingdom as something that takes place beyond the horizon, far away from our own branch or ward. In truth, the Church advances both by outward expansion and by inward refinement. \u201cFor Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her stakes must be strengthened\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11153\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11153)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11153)\">D&amp;C 82:14<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/building-the-kingdom.p19\" class=\"\">We do not have to be called to serve far from home, nor do we have to hold a prominent place in the Church or in the world to build up the Lord\u2019s kingdom. We build it in our own hearts as we cultivate the Spirit of God in our lives. We build it within our families by instilling faith in our children. And we build it through the organization of the Church as we magnify our callings and share the gospel with neighbors and friends.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/building-the-kingdom.p20\" class=\"\">As our missionaries labor in fields ready for harvest, others labor in fields at home to strengthen the kingdom in the ward and community where they reside. From its earliest days, the Lord\u2019s Church has been built up by ordinary people who magnified their callings in humility and devotion. It does not matter to what office we are called to serve, only that we act \u201cin all diligence\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11196\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11196)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11196)\">D&amp;C 107:99<\/a><\/span>).

More than anywhere else, it is within the family, in the quiet sanctuary of the home, that generations unite in building the kingdom of God. The rearing of children is a divine work. The First Presidency has called on the parents of the Church to hold family home evening and family prayer, to study the gospel in the home, and to spend time with children in wholesome activities. As fathers and mothers teach their children the eternal truths once taught to them, they pass on the torch of truth to yet another generation, and the kingdom waxes stronger.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">We are watchers of a beacon<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Whose light must never die.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/building-the-kingdom.p24\" class=\"\">(\u201cFor the Strength of the Hills,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 35)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/building-the-kingdom.p25\" class=\"\">When I was growing up, my father often led our family in gospel discussions around the dinner table.
