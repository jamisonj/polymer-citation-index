In 1831\nin a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord promised that the fulness of his\ngospel would be restored and that the voice of warning should be unto all people; that his\nChurch would be established and that power would be given to his servants to bring it forth\nout of obscurity and out of darkness\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14235\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14235)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14235)\">D&amp;C 1:30<\/a><\/span>), that his disciples should go forth and that none should\nstay them (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14233\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14233)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14233)\">D&amp;C 1:4-5<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;all of this to bring to pass the\nimmortality and eternal life of man which is the\nwork and glory of God (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39169\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39169)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39169)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn order for man to obtain eternal life and exaltation in God's kingdom, he must accept the\ngospel of Jesus Christ. This is an eternal principle. Thus we recognize that the gospel plan has\nbeen and is for all of God's children.\n<\/p><p>\nHowever, many Christians believe that the gospel plan dates only from the Savior's ministry\nin the flesh, but we know that the gospel was understood by the spirits which were with our\nFather in heaven before the world was formed or organized.\n<\/p><p>\nThen on this earth the gospel was taught to Father Adam, and he taught the Lord's\ncommandments to his children. Enoch understood the gospel, and through faithfulness the\nSaints of the city of Enoch were translated.\n<\/p><p>\nOther great men including Noah, Melchizedek, Abraham, and Moses understood the gospel\nplan and taught it to ancient Israel.\n<\/p><p>\nJohn the Baptist opened the Dispensation of the Meridian of Time by preaching in the\nwilderness, and he told of the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nThrough the personal ministry of Jesus and his apostles, the gospel was taught and The\nChurch of Jesus Christ established on the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my great privilege to bear witness humbly that Jesus is the Christ, the only begotten of\nthe Father in the flesh, our Redeemer and Savior, and the only name under heaven given\namong men whereby we may be saved (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7918\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7918)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7918)\">Acts 4:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA falling away from the Savior's teachings was predicted, and I testify that this did occur.\nThis great apostasy made necessary the restoration of the gospel plan and the authority to act\nin the name of God.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Joseph Smith, the boy Prophet, went into the woods in the spring of 1820 and asked\nGod, \"Which of all the sects is right and which shall I join?\" he said, \"I was answered that I\nmust join none of them, for they were all wrong&mdash;that they teach for doctrine the\ncommandments of men, having a form of godliness but they deny the power thereof\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30438\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30438)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30438)\">JS&mdash;H 1:18-19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis apostasy necessitated the establishment of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints, and Joseph Smith was selected to be the prophet through whom the Lord\nre-established his Church.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord set April 6, 1830, as the date that his Church should be organized on this\nearth&mdash;just 133 years ago yesterday. It was organized by six persons at the home of Peter Whitmer,\nSen., in upper New York state. The members began to share their message with their friends\nand their neighbors, and the Church enjoyed rapid growth.\n<\/p><p>\nAt the same place the next Sunday, Oliver Cowdery commenced the public ministry of the\nChurch by giving the first gospel sermon in a public meeting called for that purpose. After the\nmeeting, six were baptized, and seven more were baptized a week later.\n<\/p><p>\nAbout thirty members of the Church participated in the first conference held about sixty days\nlater on June 9, 1830 (<i>DHC<\/i> 1:77,84). Eleven more were baptized after that conference.\nThe Prophet Joseph had been told that the voice of warning should be unto all people by the\nmouths of the Lord's disciples and that none should stay them.\n<\/p><p>\nOliver Cowdery, Parley P. Pratt, Peter Whitmer, Jun., and others were sent out as missionaries\nin the fall of 1830. They met Sidney Rigdon in Ohio, and after a brief but prayerful\ninvestigation, Sidney Rigdon received a testimony that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God,\nand that the authority to act in the name of God had been restored. He asked to be baptized\nand was baptized. Shortly thereafter, he held a group meeting in which he warned his\nneighbors and bore his testimony that the gospel had been restored.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the Kirtland area at this time several group meetings were held, and seventeen more were\nbaptized.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, Joseph Smith was indeed one of the great prophets of all time and through him the Lord\nwas performing \"A great and marvelous work . . . among the children of men\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14242\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14242)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14242)\">D&amp;C 11:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure he remembered the words of the Savior, \"He that loveth father or mother more than\nme is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of\nme\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35254\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35254)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35254)\">Matt. 10:37<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen in February 1835, in accordance with divine revelation, the Quorum of the Twelve were\ncalled.\n<\/p><p>\nThe apostles are special witnesses of Christ and hold the keys of the foreign ministry of the\nChurch. Accordingly, seven of the Twelve set out for England in the late summer of 1839\nwithout purse or scrip, and leaving their families destitute of many of the comforts of life.\n<\/p><p>\nAbout a year later, in the spring of 1841, just before leaving for home Brigham Young wrote\nin his journal, \"It truly seemed a miracle to look upon the contrast between our landing and\ndeparting from Liverpool. We landed in the spring of 1840 as strangers in a strange land and\npenniless. But through the mercy of God we had gained many friends, established churches in\nalmost every noted town and city in the Kingdom of Great Britain, baptized between seven\nand eight thousand souls, printed 5,000 Books of Mormon, 2,500 volumes of the Millennial\nStar and 50,000 tracts and emigrated to Zion 1,000 souls, established a permanent shipping\nagency which will be a great blessing to the saints and have sown in the hearts of many\nthousands the seeds of eternal truth, which shall bring forth fruit to the honor and glory of\nGod, and yet we have lacked nothing to eat, drink or wear&mdash;in all these things I\nacknowledge the hand of God.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThus, in such beginnings, the gospel message was being taken to the peoples of the earth, and\nprophecy fulfilled.\n<\/p><p>\nApproximately ninety years later at the centennial conference held in Salt Lake City on April\n6, 1930, President Heber J. Grant reported that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints had a living membership of 700,000 souls, 104 stakes, twenty-nine missions, and 2,226\nmissionaries. Convert baptisms in 1929 amounted to 6,511.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now&mdash;today&mdash;as in earlier days, missionaries are leaving their families, comfortable\nhomes, and worldly interests behind and are going forth with the same dedication to build the\nkingdom of God. They also recall the promise of the Savior&mdash;\". . . There is no man that hath\nleft house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,\n<\/p><p>\n\"Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life\neverlasting\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31599\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31599)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31599)\">Luke 18:29-30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nRecently it was reported that the living membership of the Church now totals two million\nsouls, the 374th stake has been organized, and there are now seventy-one missions and\napproximately 12,000 missionaries. As instruments in the hands of the Lord in 1962, the\nmissionaries taught and baptized 115,834 souls. In the hearts of millions more the seeds were\nsown which will bring forth a great harvest in the years ahead.\n<\/p><p>\nTo you who are not members but would like to know more about the Church, we invite you\nto attend one of our church services or ask a member to have the missionaries discuss the\ndoctrine of the Church with you or communicate with the missionaries or the Church directly.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior's injunction to \"feed my sheep\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28103\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28103)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28103)\">John 21:17<\/a><\/span>) has been and is being carried out.\n<\/p><p>\nSister Richards and I have recently returned from the missions on the east\ncoast, and we bring greetings from the missionaries to their families and friends. There are\nnow twenty stakes on the east coast with over 2,000 missionaries in the eight missions. The\nfield is white and is being harvested there. Convert baptisms continue to increase.\n<\/p><p>\nRemember the Lord has said, \". . . the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the\nmouths of my disciples . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And they shall go forth and none shall stay them\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14234\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14234)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14234)\">D&amp;C 1:4-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOur missionaries are going forth and none shall stay them. Our proselyting program is based\nupon, \"every member sharing the gospel with his neighbor.\" Our Prophet David O. McKay\nhas counseled, \"Every member a missionary.\" As a result today, many thousands of members\nare responding by living exemplary lives; by asking the golden questions; by holding group\nmeetings in their homes; and by taking their friends and neighbors with them to attend church\nservices and activities. This type of sharing is \"Every Member a Missionary\" in action.\n<\/p><p>\nAt this conference several stake presidents and bishops have told me of the group meetings\nthey are holding in their homes and the convert baptisms that are resulting therefrom. As we\nleaders set the pattern, every member will be a missionary. And each member should be\nmindful of his responsibilities and opportunities to spread the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nI love and support our great prophet. He is indeed one of the great missionaries of all time.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, the purposes of the Lord are being accomplished today, and prophecy is being fulfilled.\nThe Spirit of the Lord is being poured out on our Father's children, and the gospel is rolling\nforth in order to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39170\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39170)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39170)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay the kingdom of God continue to go forth that the kingdom of heaven may come\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14281\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14281)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14281)\">D&amp;C 65:6<\/a><\/span>), I pray\nin the name of Jesus Christ.
