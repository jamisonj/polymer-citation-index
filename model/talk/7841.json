And that reality, thanks to the technology of our times, is changing so fast we can barely keep up with it\u2014if we do at all.

My brothers and sisters, I declare to you, however, that there is <span class=\"emphasis\">nothing<\/span> which can bring more joy into our lives or more peace to our souls than the Spirit which can come to us as we follow the Savior and keep the commandments. That Spirit cannot be present at the kinds of activities in which so much of the world participates. The Apostle Paul declared the truth: \u201cThe natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-09611_000_033\">4<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122629\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122629)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122629)\">1\u00a0Corinthians 2:14<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> The term <span class=\"emphasis\">natural man<\/span> can refer to any of us if we allow ourselves to be so.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p27\" class=\"\">We must be vigilant in a world which has moved so far from that which is spiritual. It is essential that we reject anything that does not conform to our standards, refusing in the process to surrender that which we desire most: eternal life in the kingdom of God. The storms will still beat at our doors from time to time, for they are an inescapable part of our existence in mortality. We, however, will be far better equipped to deal with them, to learn from them, and to overcome them if we have the gospel at our core and the love of the Savior in our hearts. The prophet Isaiah declared, \u201cThe work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-09611_000_033\">5<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122630\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122630)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122630)\">Isaiah 32:17<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p28\" class=\"\">As a means of being <span class=\"emphasis\">in<\/span> the world but not being <span class=\"emphasis\">of<\/span> the world, it is necessary that we communicate with our Heavenly Father through prayer.

I had worked hard to earn some money and had managed to save five dollars. This was during the Great Depression, when five dollars was a substantial sum of money\u2014especially for a boy of 12. I gave all my coins, which totaled five dollars, to my father, and he gave me in return a five-dollar bill. I know there was something specific I planned to purchase with the five dollars, although all these years later I can\u2019t recall what it was. I just remember how important that money was to me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p32\" class=\"\">At the time, we did not own a washing machine, so my mother would send to the laundry each week our clothes which needed to be washed. After a couple of days, a load of what we called \u201cwet wash\u201d would be returned to us, and Mother would hang the items on our clothesline out back to dry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p33\" class=\"\">I had tucked my five-dollar bill in the pocket of my jeans. As you can probably guess, my jeans were sent to the laundry with the money still in the pocket. When I realized what had happened, I was sick with worry. I knew that pockets were routinely checked at the laundry prior to washing. If my money was not discovered and taken during that process, I knew it was almost certain the money would be dislodged during washing and would be claimed by a laundry worker who would have no idea to whom the money should be returned, even if he had the inclination to do so. The chances of getting back my five dollars were extremely remote\u2014a fact which my dear mother confirmed when I told her I had left the money in my pocket.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p34\" class=\"\">I wanted that money; I needed that money; I had worked very hard to earn that money. I realized there was only one thing I could do. In my extremity I turned to my Father in Heaven and pleaded with Him to keep my money safe in that pocket somehow until our wet wash came back.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p35\" class=\"\">Two very long days later, when I knew it was about time for the delivery truck to bring our wash, I sat by the window, waiting. As the truck pulled up to the curb, my heart was pounding. As soon as the wet clothes were in the house, I grabbed my jeans and ran to my bedroom. I reached into the pocket with trembling hands. When I didn\u2019t find anything immediately, I thought all was lost. And then my fingers touched that wet five-dollar bill. As I pulled it from the pocket, relief flooded over me. I offered a heartfelt prayer of gratitude to my Father in Heaven, for I knew that He had answered my prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p36\" class=\"\">Since that time of long ago, I have had countless prayers answered. Not a day has gone by that I have not communicated with my Father in Heaven through prayer. It is a relationship I cherish\u2014one I would literally be lost without. If you do not now have such a relationship with your Father in Heaven, I urge you to work toward that goal. As you do so, you will be entitled to His inspiration and guidance in your life\u2014necessities for each of us if we are to survive spiritually during our sojourn here on earth. Such inspiration and guidance are gifts He freely gives if we but seek them. What treasures they are!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p37\" class=\"\">I am always humbled and grateful when my Heavenly Father communicates with me through His inspiration. I have learned to recognize it, to trust it, and to follow it. Time and time again I have been the recipient of such inspiration. One rather dramatic experience took place in August of 1987 during the dedication of the Frankfurt Germany Temple. President Ezra Taft Benson had been with us for the first day or two of the dedication but had returned home, and so it became my opportunity to conduct the remaining sessions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p38\" class=\"\">On Saturday we had a session for our Dutch members who were in the Frankfurt Temple district. I was well acquainted with one of our outstanding leaders from the Netherlands, Brother Peter Mourik. Just prior to the session, I had the distinct impression that Brother Mourik should be called upon to speak to his fellow Dutch members during the session and that, in fact, he should be the first speaker. Not having seen him in the temple that morning, I passed a note to Elder Carlos\u00a0E. Asay, our Area President, asking whether Peter Mourik was in attendance at the session. Just prior to standing up to begin the session, I received a note back from Elder Asay indicating that Brother Mourik was actually <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> in attendance, that he was involved elsewhere, and that he was planning to attend the dedicatory session in the temple the following day with the servicemen stakes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p39\" class=\"\">As I stood at the pulpit to welcome the people and to outline the program, I received unmistakable inspiration once again that I was to announce Peter Mourik as the first speaker. This was counter to all my instincts, for I had just heard from Elder Asay that Brother Mourik was definitely <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> in the temple. Trusting in the inspiration, however, I announced the choir presentation and the prayer and then indicated that our first speaker would be Brother Peter Mourik.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p40\" class=\"\">As I returned to my seat, I glanced toward Elder Asay; I saw on his face a look of alarm. He later told me that when I had announced Brother Mourik as the first speaker, he couldn\u2019t believe his ears. He said he knew that I had received his note and that I indeed had read it, and he couldn\u2019t fathom why I would then announce Brother Mourik as a speaker, knowing he wasn\u2019t anywhere in the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p41\" class=\"\">During the time all of this was taking place, Peter Mourik was in a meeting at the area offices in Porthstrasse. As his meeting was going forward, he suddenly turned to Elder Thomas\u00a0A. Hawkes Jr., who was then the regional representative, and asked, \u201cHow fast can you get me to the temple?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p42\" class=\"\">Elder Hawkes, who was known to drive rather rapidly in his small sports car, answered, \u201cI can have you there in 10 minutes! But why do you need to go to the temple?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p43\" class=\"\">Brother Mourik admitted he did not know why he needed to go to the temple but that he knew he had to get there. The two of them set out for the temple immediately.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p44\" class=\"\">During the magnificent choir number, I glanced around, thinking that at any moment I would see Peter Mourik. I did not. Remarkably, however, I felt no alarm. I had a sweet, undeniable assurance that all would be well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p45\" class=\"\">Brother Mourik entered the front door of the temple just as the opening prayer was concluding, still not knowing why he was there. As he hurried down the hall, he saw my image on the monitor and heard me announce, \u201cWe will now hear from Brother Peter Mourik.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p46\" class=\"\">To the astonishment of Elder Asay, Peter Mourik immediately walked into the room and took his place at the podium.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/stand-in-holy-places.p47\" class=\"\">Following the session, Brother Mourik and I discussed that which had taken place prior to his opportunity to speak. I have pondered the inspiration which came that day not only to me but also to Peter Mourik. That remarkable experience has provided an undeniable witness to me of the importance of being worthy to receive such inspiration and then trusting it\u2014and following it\u2014when it comes.
