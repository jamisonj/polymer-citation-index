For when we thus sustain these men it means more than the mere lifting of our hands, or at least should do so. It means the sustaining of these men by our faith and by our prayers, and so far as works are required, by our works, and when we thus vote and thus act, there is a power and an influence accompanying such action <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"55b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0055.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;55b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9473\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> as we have performed this afternoon, that are felt by those in whose favor we vote: they feel strengthened, and God our Eternal Father seals His blessing, or causes it to descend upon those who are voted for, and there is a spirit that rests down upon them from that time forward, so long as they are faithful and are thus sustained, that manifests itself unto all with whom they are brought in contact. Let this congregation lift up their hands to sever a man from the Church, and no matter how high he may be in authority, no matter what Priesthood he bears, no matter how great and mighty he may have been in the Church and in the ministry&#x2014;let this congregation for just cause lift up their hands against any such man and how quickly the effect is felt, how quickly that man is stripped of his power and of his influence, and of that spirit and those gifts which have been conspicuous in his labors previous to such action, or while he was in good  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"56a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0056.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;56a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9472\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>standing and in fellowship with God and his brethren and sisters. We have seen numerous illustrations of this in our history. Name after name might be mentioned of men who have been bright stars in the firmament, who have been stripped&#x2014;by their own conduct to begin with, and afterwards by the action of the Saints of God upon their case&#x2014;of that luster, of that brightness, and of that glory that seemed to attend their ministrations. And while this is the case with those who have transgressed when the Saints of God act upon their cases, so it is, on the contrary, with those who are sustained in their ministry, and in their Priesthood, and in their calling by the united, uplifted hands of the Saints of God in conference assembled, as we have done this afternoon. Men may sneer at the Latter-day Saints, and say this is but an empty form, and that it is all prearranged. Men may say what they please about this. It is prearranged according to the spirit and mind of God, so far as that can be ascertained. When men are chosen for office, the Spirit of God is sought for by those who have the right to select, and if there be doubt upon certain points men are not chosen; but when they are chosen and the mind of the Lord is sought for to know whether it will be agreeable to Him that they receive this office, or that they should act in those positions, and when they are thus selected and thus submitted, as I have said, to the Conference, then if they themselves live so as to have the Spirit of God with them, they will be clothed with it, and when they seek to magnify their office God will magnify them before the people and will show them, and the people that they are indeed His chosen servants, and that their ministrations <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"56b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0056.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;56b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9472\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> are acceptable unto Him, that He confirms them by the outpouring of His Spirit and the bestowal of His gifts. It is a remarkable fact in this age of unbelief, in this age of doubt, in this age of darkness, in this age when men pride themselves upon there being no revelation, and no knowledge from God&#x2014;I say it is a remarkable fact that in this age such as we now live in, and such as we are familiar with, God, in the history of this people is accompanying His labors, and the labors to which He assigns His servants, with the ancient power, with the ancient manifestations, and with the ancient confirmations by gifts and by mighty signs and works that He causes His servants to accomplish. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n162\"> When Moses was about to depart, God required of him that he should lay his hands upon another man to take his place to act as the leader of the people of Israel. He laid his hands upon Joshua, and a portion of that spirit and power that had attended the ministrations of Moses in the midst of Israel was immediately manifested through Joshua,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"54904\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 54904)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(54904)\">Num. 27:18-23<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"55278\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55278)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55278)\">Deut. 34:9<\/a><\/span> and God confirmed the selection and impressed upon the people by the signs and the mighty works which Joshua accomplished that he was indeed God's chosen servant. He magnified him in the midst of the people; he was enabled to perform mighty works, and the people, if they had had any doubts whatever, had those doubts removed by those manifestations of power. You remember how the Lord showed in the sight of all Israel that Joshua was His inspired and chosen servant, for under his direction the children of Israel crossed the river Jordan dry shod.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"55288\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55288)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55288)\">Josh. 3:7-17<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"55293\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55293)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55293)\">Josh. 4:1-24<\/a><\/span> It was at the time of high water in the river Jordan; but the Jordan was stayed in its onward course, its waters stopped running,  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"57a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0057.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;57a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9471\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>and the whole hosts of Israel, by the direction of this servant of God, passed over dry shod. In this manner God showed unto His people that He had indeed chosen this man to be His servant. And so it has been in the entire history of God's dealings with His people. He has not left them without a testimony. He has not left them to proclaim His word unaccompanied by His power. They have not been left to argue for themselves, to plead for themselves, to protest in the ears of the people that they were the servants of God, and to constantly contend for their rights as leaders of the people of God. But in every instance when He chose a man to be His servant, He accompanied that choice by the manifestations of His power, by the outpouring of His spirit, and His gifts, so that every honest soul, every humble man and woman who sought the Lord, might know for themselves that those men were His chosen ones. A most striking illustration of this suggests itself to my mind now. It occurred at the time the children of Israel desired a king.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"55417\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55417)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55417)\">1 Sam. 8:1-22<\/a><\/span> The Lord was displeased with them for this.

This young man was following peaceful pursuits. Though he had been chosen a king, he had not seemed to assume kingly dignity, he had gone about his business; but when the crisis arose, when there was a necessity for someone to step forward and take the leading position, then the spirit of that position to which he had been anointed, and to which he had been chosen by the voice of God, by the act of His Prophet, and by the approbation of the people, rested upon him,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"55438\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55438)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55438)\">1 Sam. 11:6<\/a><\/span> and he emerged from his obscurity and arose in their midst a king, a leader in very deed and in truth. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n166\"> And so it was, you remember, in the case of Elisha. When Elijah was about to be taken to heaven, the spirit of prophecy seemed to rest upon all the prophets. The sons of the prophets came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, &#x201C;Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"55752\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55752)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55752)\">2 Kgs. 2:1-7<\/a><\/span> At a former time he had been plowing in the field, with twelve yoke of oxen, when Elijah came along, and Elisha dropped his work and followed the prophet of God.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"55739\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55739)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55739)\">1 Kgs. 19:19-21<\/a><\/span> Afterwards, when Elijah's departure drew near, he said unto Elisha, &#x201C;Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.

A great and a mighty prophet was he; so great and so mighty, that it is related of him that after his death a band of Moabites came into the land. The people of Israel were burying a man. While in this act, they became frightened at seeing a band of men, and cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha; and when the man was let down and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood upon his feet.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"55840\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55840)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55840)\">2 Kgs. 13:20-21<\/a><\/span> He was a mighty prophet, and he received those gifts and this power from God, which He bestows upon all those who receive the everlasting Priesthood, and who seek to magnify it in the spirit thereof. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n167\"> Read, too, of the transformation that occurred when Jesus laid His hands upon His apostles. The lowly, the ignorant, and the unlettered fishermen were transformed into mighty men, men of power, men of influence, men who had communication with the heavens, unto whom God revealed His mind and will, and through whom He performed mighty works. These men previously were obscure men, men of humble lives, fishermen, probably one of the lowest occupations that men followed in those days, as it is in  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"59a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0059.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;59a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9469\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>our day. It is a lowly occupation is that of a fisherman. It is not one that brings great wealth; it does not bring men into public notice; it gives them no opportunity for distinction; but these men were men whose lives were hid with God.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"75608\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 75608)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(75608)\">Col. 3:3<\/a><\/span> These were Princes in disguise, men who had been chosen, like their Lord and Master, according to my view, before the foundations of the earth were laid, to be His companions in the flesh, and like Him they were born in lowly and obscure circumstances. But when He chose them, when their hearts were touched by the great truths He taught, and they came forward, in obedience to His authority, to cast their lot with Him, then the power of God descended upon them; they performed mighty works, and while they lived upon the earth the Holy Ghost was their companion, and their fame has come down to us embalmed, it may be said, through the ages that have transpired, through the ignorance, and the gloom, and the darkness, and the apostasy that have since taken place&#x2014;their names have come down to us from our ancestors, and the most glorious edifices and structures that the world know anything of, are dedicated to their memories. God made them mighty in the midst of the children of men. And so it was with all the prophets. When God made promises unto them they received them. But they did not receive these things without exertion on their part, without their seeking industriously to magnify that Priesthood which had been bestowed upon them. The spirit and power of God will rest upon a man if he listens to it. It will impel him to action. If he cherishes it, it will be his constant companion. It will be with him in times when he will need it, and when he does <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"59b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0059.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;59b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9469\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> need it, if he magnifies his calling, the spirit and power of the Almighty&#x2014;that spirit and power and those gifts which belong to his particular office&#x2014;will rest upon him, and he will be made equal to every emergency, to every trial, and will come off victorious. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n169\"> How was it with the Prophet Joseph Smith? Whose origin could be more lowly in a land like ours than his, springing from the humblest ranks of life, of parents that were not distinguished, or of any family that was known particularly, bearing a name more common than any other name in our language. Yet this man, because God had chosen him, manifested extraordinary power. Those who saw him, those who listened to him, those who witnessed his acts, know how mighty he was in the midst of his fellow men, and how mightily God wrought through him. God chose and ordained him. He gave unto him His everlasting Priesthood. He gave unto him the full authority to organize His Church. He did so&#x2014;organized this Church, the most glorious fabric that ever was established upon the face of the earth; because it is God's Church: it is the Church of Jesus Christ, unparalleled by anything else. No other organization approaches to it in perfection; nothing lacking, every detail, beautiful, harmonious, symmetrical, leaving nothing to be desired. Such is the Church and such the organization that the Prophet Joseph was the means in the hands of God of restoring once more to the earth. The plan, the pattern, had been lost entirely. The officers that formerly filled the Church were withdrawn. The Priesthood that they held was taken back to God, and the men who bore it also were taken from the earth. There had,  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"60a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0060.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;60a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9468\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>therefore, to be a complete restoration. It could only come from the God of heaven, and Joseph, inspired of God, was the means through which the restoration was made&#x2014;Joseph, a youth, obscure, illiterate in some respects&#x2014;that is, he was not what men would call learned, but afterwards, through industry and perseverance, became learned, and if he had lived, he would undoubtedly have become one of the most learned of men through the gifts God gave him. The progress he made when he did live was very remarkable. By his faith, and inspired of God, he laid the foundation of this work, and not only did this, but he laid his hands upon other men and they partook of the same spirit and influence that rested upon him. They were able to drink at the same fountain, which God, through him, had opened up for them to drink at. They could go to that fountain, and partake of its holy influence, and their eyes were opened and their minds were illuminated by the power of God. They were able also to go forth in the power which He had restored, and thus once more among men was witnessed the mighty gifts that were characteristic of bygone ages, when God had a Priesthood on the earth, when He had prophets and apostles, and mighty men whom He clothed with a portion of His Spirit and power. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n171\"> And when Joseph was taken, how was it then? Were the people left without some man or men to stand up in their midst to declare to them the counsel of their Almighty Father? No: the Lord did not leave His people without a shepherd. He had anticipated the dreadful tragedy which would rob us of His anointed one; rob us, the Church of Christ, of our Prophet and Patriarch. He <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"60b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0060.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;60b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9468\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> had anticipated this, and previous to this horrid tragedy, He inspired His servant Joseph to call other men, upon whom He bestowed all the keys, all the authority, all the blessings, all the knowledge so far as endowments were concerned, so far as the power to go unto God and ask Him in the name of Jesus, and obtain His mind and will, was concerned. He bestowed upon these men the same gifts, and blessings, and graces, he had received; so that there was a body of men with all the authority, a body of prophets with all the gifts of seers and revelators&#x2014;a body of men left instead of one man&#x2014;a body of men were endowed with this power when Joseph was taken, and the earth was not robbed of that Priesthood which God had sent His angels from heaven to restore once more to the children of men, and to act on the earth in the plenitude of its power. There was no more need, therefore, for angelic visitation to restore it. It was not taken back to God by the slaying of the Prophet and Patriarch, but remained with mortal man here on the earth. And, then, when the question arose as to who should lead Israel, notwithstanding Sidney Rigdon stood up in the congregation of the Saints, and plead for the leadership of the people, the spirit and power of the Almighty descended upon the man whom God had chosen to hold the keys. In the midst of all Israel, in the face of the entire congregation of believers and unbelievers, God clothed His servant with such power and in such a manner that every man that had the least portion of the spirit of God, and every woman, knew by the manifestations of that spirit, and by the outpouring of the gift of God upon that man, that he was the chosen one, and that upon him rested the  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"61a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0061.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;61a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9467\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>authority, and the power, and the gifts that had been borne by the Prophet Joseph during his lifetime.

I have no doubt of it, never had any. I knew it before anything was heard or anything was said.

There is no room for jealousy in regard to the possession of this gift in the breast of a servant of God. The only feeling that it ought to produce in the breast of a faithful man is one of thankfulness, one of thanksgiving to God that others share in this blessing, that others can partake of this power, that others have received of this glorious gift from our Father in Heaven. There is no room for jealousy, therefore, in such cases. Let every man press forward humbly and obediently in the path of exaltation, in the path that leads to God. Let every man press forward. He need not be afraid that any Latter-day Saint will impede his progress. Let every man speak and act and do as though he were a servant of God, as he is, as a son of God; let him do this and rejoice in it. At the same time let him be careful not to be lifted up in pride, not forgetting who he is, but obedient to constituted authority, that authority which God has placed in His Church, and, then, if he does not forget these things, there is nothing to prevent his onward progress. If he be an Elder, if he should have the gifts and power that an Apostle should have, who will be jealous? Certainly no servant of God. If he be a Deacon, and he has gifts from God, through faithfulness, that belong to an office higher than his own, is there anyone who will not rejoice in it, or anyone who will retard him or throw obstructions in his way? God forbid that there should be. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n179\"> Now, in connection with this subject, a man a few days ago&#x2014;it suggests itself to my mind and I will speak upon it&#x2014;brought a communication addressed to President Tay<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"63b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0063.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;63b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9465\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>lor and his Counselors, and we read it.

More injurious ideas and practices than these cannot be introduced among a people to lead them to destruction, and I wish to warn you before sitting down, in regard to this. Do not seek for those who have peepstones, for soothsayers, and for those who profess to be able to counteract the influence of witchcraft. They who say so, seek to play upon your fears, they seek to take advantage of superstitious fears, and seek to use them for their own advantage and bring those who will listen to them in bondage to an influence and spirit that is as foreign to the spirit of God as hell is foreign to heaven. Any man who professes to have this authority, to have this power, and to use power outside of that which the Priesthood authorizes, is a man that should not be listened to; his claims are false, and his methods are from beneath and not from God. And I say to all of you, witchcraft you may defy if you live as you should do&#x2014;defy it, not in a spirit of defiance, not in a spirit to bring evil influences upon you, but in the power and strength of our Father and God. No evil influence of that kind, if you live as you should do, can have power over you; you are entrenched in the power of God, in the spirit and gifts of God; you are entrenched round about so that none of these wicked influences can have power over you.
