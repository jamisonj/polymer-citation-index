Sill<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Sterling W. Sill, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1954, pp. 118-119<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI here have been a number of circumstances that have combined themselves together this\nmorning to produce in my heart great humility, accompanied by a feeling of inadequacy to\ndischarge properly the responsibilities of this appointment.  I pray that I might receive the\nnecessary strength to fulfil those obligations.  I am grateful for the confidence of the brethren\nwho are responsible for this appointment.  I also appreciate very much your sustaining vote.  I\npromise the General Authorities of the Church, as well as the general Church membership,\nand Him whose name the Church bears, that I will do the very best I can.\n<\/p><p>\nMany times I have prayed to my Father in heaven that he would help me to do my work.  I\nhope that I may pray more and more effectively that I may help him to do his work, and by\nthat means express to him the appreciation that I feel for all of the blessings of my life.\n<\/p><p>\nI am very grateful for my wife and family.  I am grateful for my parents, grandparents, and\ngreat-grandparents. As my great-grandfather marched with the Mormon Battalion to assist in\nthe war with Mexico, my great-grandma marched with her little family across the plains to\nestablish herself and her posterity in this valley.  The wagon containing her earthly\npossessions was drawn by a team of oxen. Before reaching her destination one of the oxen\ndied.  My great-grandmother lifted the yoke of the fallen oxen to her own shoulders and\ncontinued the march. I pray that I may draw from her strength and determination.\n<\/p><p>\nI appreciate the great opportunity of being a part of this Church, both for what it has meant to\nme in the past, and for what it will mean in the future. The real worth of a man is not in\nhimself alone, but in what he stands for.  It is an inspiring thing to me that the most humble\nof us may stand for the most important things.  Joseph Smith was great because of what he\nstood for.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Joseph Smith arose from his knees, after his first vision, and walked across the fields to\nhis father's house, and went into the kitchen where his mother was working, and leaning\nagainst the fireplace for support, said in substance, \"Mother, I have seen God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30336\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30336)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30336)\">JS&mdash;H 1:20<\/a><\/span>), at that instant\nhe did not know a bit more surely than I know or than you know that it is right to be honest,\nthat it is right to be virtuous, and that all the other principles for which this Church stands are\nright.  It is right to spend our strength in the service of our Father in heaven to help to bring\nabout his purposes.\n<\/p><p>\nThe great psychologist, William James, said that the greatest use of life is to spend it for\nsomething that outlasts it.\n<\/p><p>\nIn a Sunday School class which I visited recently I heard a Sunday School teacher recount\nthat thrilling story of creation, that \"God created man in his own image\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23607\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23607)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23607)\">Gen. 1:27<\/a><\/span>), and I found myself\nwishing that I might have been there to have witnessed this great beginning, and then it\noccurred to me, as it has occurred many times since, that the creation of man is not something\nthat was finished and done with in the Garden of Eden.  The creation of man is still going on,\nand in a very real sense each of us is a creator&mdash;that is, the attitudes, the enthusiasms, the\nfaith, the determination to serve God, that are so important to our eternal exaltation, are\nbeing currently within us and in others.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is more important to build a great character than to build a great skyscraper.  We know that\nthe worth of souls is great, but mostly we are not great for what we are, we are great or what\nwe may become, and it is my hope and prayer in my own behalf that I may develop those\nqualities that will enable me to accomplish the duties of this assignment as is expected of me\nby my Father in heaven and those who preside over me in the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the blessings of our Father in heaven be with us that we may understand our\nopportunities, I pray in Jesus name.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
