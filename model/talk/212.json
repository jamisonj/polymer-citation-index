This I shall do\nduring the few minutes I occupy.\n<\/p><p>\nA PRACTICAL RELIGION\n<\/p><p>\nWe teach that our religion is a very practical one and, being a way of life, touches every\nphase of our daily living. We believe with the Apostle James that faith without works is dead.\nWe also believe with the Apostle Paul that \". . . by grace are ye saved through faith; and that\nnot of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\" Some\nreaders seem to stop here, but let us read the next verse which says:\n<\/p><p>\nFor we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before\nordained that we should walk in them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21605\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21605)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21605)\">Eph. 2:8-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis statement of Paul's is in harmony with that made by Jesus in his great Sermon on the\nMount, when he said:\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,\nshall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father, which is in\nheaven (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33967\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33967)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33967)\">Matt. 7:20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Apostle Paul also wrote, as you also know, these words:\n<\/p><p>\nKnow ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any\nman defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which\ntemple ye are (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124)\">1 Cor. 3:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA LAW OF HEALTH\n<\/p><p>\nAs a means of preserving our bodies from certain types of defilement (destruction) the Lord\ngave to the Church in its very beginning, and to the human family generally, what has been\nproperly called a law of health, better known among us as the Word of Wisdom. Qualified\nspecialists in the field of science and medicine have said that food and drinks are the things\nthat have more to do with bodily health than any other ordinary factor. So in recent years the\nscience of dietetics&mdash;the science and art of feeding&mdash;has come into prominence and is based\nupon an immense amount of experimentation and research. The health of the individual and\nthe health of the people in mass are extremely important, not only to the individuals\nthemselves but also to the public. Hence civil governments, private humanitarian\norganizations, the Church, etc., are vitally concerned with problems of health.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my purpose now, however, to make some remarks relative to only one of the many\nproblems in the big field of things that affect human health. In section eighty-nine of the\nD&amp;C we find a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith in February 1833, less than\nthree years after the organization of the Church\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12162\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12162)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12162)\">D&amp;C 89:1-21<\/a><\/span>),\nin which abstinence from wine, strong drinks,\ntobacco, and hot drinks is enjoined, because they are not good for man. By hot drinks was\nmeant primarily tea and coffee, though subsequent researches found that any drinks at high\ntemperatures, such as hot water and soups, are harmful. The ideas voiced in the Word of\nWisdom were expressed in words having the meaning current at the time. In those days hot\ndrinks were commonly understood to be tea and coffee. The Church now interprets the words,\nwine and strong drinks, as meaning all alcoholic beverages, of which there are many varieties.\n<\/p><p>\nIn passing, it may be well to remark that the revelation on the Word of Wisdom was given at\na time when scientific men knew but little, if anything, about basic facts of the science of\ndietetics. Since those days, and within the last fifty years, a vast amount of research has been\ndone, and that pertinent to matters spoken of in the Word of Wisdom is confirmatory of the\ntruths therein revealed. This fact should give joy and satisfaction to all Saints, for it is\nirrefutable testimony of the divinity of that great document. Time will not permit me now to\ngo into detail concerning this testimony. I repeat, however, that a multitude of scientifically\ndiscovered facts support the Word of Wisdom, and, so far as I know, none refute it.\n<\/p><p>\nMISLEADING ADVERTISEMENTS\n<\/p><p>\nAmong these is the irrefutable fact that liquor and tobacco are not good for man. Science,\nexperience, and revelation are in agreement on this statement. Then, why do people continue\nto use liquor and tobacco? Ask Satan, he knows. Satan is a deceiver, the father of lies, the\ninspiration of avaricious men engaged in promoting evils and cunning designs calculated to\nmislead the people, particularly the youth, into habits of drinking and smoking. To this end\nhuge sums of money are continually spent in advertising propaganda material, much of it\nhoneycombed with misleading and partially or wholly falsifying statements. A few years\nbefore the great global war began, an able investigator found that more than sixty million\ndollars was spent annually in the United States for advertising cigarettes and alcoholic\nbeverages. Since all of us have some idea of the power of money, is it any wonder that\npublicity agencies that accept liquor and tobacco advertisements, such as newspapers,\nmagazines, and radios, are opposed to prohibition?\n<\/p><p>\nLet me say here that smoking and drinking in this country have become so general that the\nenormous sum of ten and one-half billion dollars was spent during 1944 for liquor and\ntobacco, so it was authoritatively reported.\n<\/p><p>\nI have just said that science, experience, and revelation agree that liquor and tobacco are not\ngood for man. Let me specify a little.\n<\/p><p>\nINJURIOUS EFFECTS OF TOBACCO\n<\/p><p>\nConcerning the use of tobacco, it affects injuriously the heart and circulatory system, the\nlungs and respiratory system, the brain and mental powers, the nervous system, the kidneys\nand elimination organs, the muscular system, etc., thus weakening the body with the result\nthat it is less resistant to diseases of various kinds. Recently there came from the press a new\nbook relative to tobacco and its effects written by Dr. Frank Leighton Wood, entitled\n<i>What You Should Know About Tobacco<\/i>. Dr. Irving Fisher of Yale University wrote a foreword for\nthe book in which he said:\n<\/p><p>\nThe tobacco problem has for years engaged my attention, both as to its economic and hygienic\naspects. As treasurer of the Committee for the Scientific Study of the Tobacco Problem and as\nchairman of the Hygienic Reference Board of the Life Extension Institute, which has\ncontributed more perhaps than any other agency toward solving the basic problem of tobacco,\nI have had unusual opportunities to become familiar with this many-sided problem. . . The\nevidence now exists sufficient to show that no one who smokes can achieve the best of which\nhe or she is capable, whether this be a foot race, a price fight, a golf game, tightrope walking,\na rifle score, bombing the Reich, writing, speaking, singing,\nacting, performing on a violin, piano, or typewriter, attainment of health, strength, endurance,\nworking power, beauty, glamour, or any other excellence on which men and women set their\nhearts. Prize fighters and acrobats know this. It is time that those ambitious in all other lines\nof work should learn it.\n<\/p><p>\nRelative to the effect on the muscular system I give this illustration found in the 1938 edition\nof the standard book <i>How to Live<\/i> by Fisher and Emerson:\n<\/p><p>\nSome years ago Dr. W. P. Lombard, professor of physiology in the University of Michigan,\nconducted a series of observations for the purpose of determining the influence of smoking\nupon muscular work. He reported: \"The record of these successive observations shows that the\neffects of one cigar of moderate strength was to lessen the work of which the subject was\ncapable from seventy-five foot-pounds to fifteen foot-pounds, the number of times that the\nweight could be lifted being reduced from eighty-six to twelve, over eighty percent. These\nfigures indicate how seriously tobacco cuts down one's strength and endurance!\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn his book, after pointing out many deleterious effects of the use of tobacco, Dr. Wood says:\n<\/p><p>\nThere is an aspect of the tobacco habit which, to some, is more important than its effect on\nlife itself. A large number of people, including many doctors, are quite indifferent concerning\ntheir health or the possibility of dying prematurely. When confronted with facts concerning\nthe life-shortening effects of tobacco or other habit-forming drugs, they may accept them but,\nin a spirit of bravado, may add that they would rather live their fifty years than exist for one\nhundred. In saying this they assume that the smoker lives a more happy, contented, and useful\nlife than the nonsmoker. But does he? In the following chapters we shall show that, on the\naverage, not only does the smoker die at a much earlier age than the nonsmoker but that he is\nmore often afflicted with painful and disabling diseases of long duration and that in addition\nto this, he experiences various minor ills, such as annoying coughs, hoarseness, rawness of the\nthroat, heartburn, shortness of breath, and many other disagreeable symptoms or diseases\nwhich are peculiar to those who use tobacco in any form. We shall show that he cannot excel\nin sports, as most people already know; that he will be handicapped in acquiring an education\nand for this reason may be likewise handicapped in satisfying his other aspirations in life. We\nshall show that even his character may be unfavorably affected. . . . We shall show that girls\nand boys and men and women who begin to smoke with the avowed intention of smoking in\nmoderation and quitting the habit when they find that it is becoming harmful to them, nearly\nalways smoke to a great excess and seldom quit the habit. No one can be at his best if he uses\ntobacco any more than the boxer, the runner, or the ball player can, for the use of this drug\ninterferes with the blood supply, not only of the heart muscles but of every organ and part of\nthe body, including the brain, the liver, the stomach, and the reproductive organs, as we shall\nshow.\n<\/p><p>\nThe use of tobacco shortens life. This fact was demonstrated satisfactorily to the whole\nscientific world on the appearance of a report by Dr. Raymond Pearl of Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, published in the journal Science, March 4, 1938. Dr. Pearl and his associates made\ncomplete life tables on 6,813 white men between the ages of thirty to seventy. He divided this\ngroup into three&mdash;2,095 nonusers of tobacco; 2,814 moderate smokers; 1,905 heavy smokers.\nHe found that between the ages of thirty and seventy the heavy smoker died, on an average,\nten years younger than nonsmokers; that moderate smokers, on an average, also died from one\nto five years sooner. And as I have already quoted, smokers are less free from bodily ailments\nthan are nonsmokers. So I repeat, the fact is that smokers die earlier than nonsmokers.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I quote a few words from the late Dr. A. L. Warner, who devoted a long life to the\nstudy of the evil effects upon the mind, body, and character of tobacco and was widely known\nfor his writings on the subject? He wrote:\n<\/p><p>\nA large majority of the young men of the United States have used tobacco. We are breeding a\nrace of tobacco degenerates. The children inherit the narcotic craving from tobacco-using\nancestors, making them as they grow older, easy addicts to tobacco, liquor, and other dope.\nJuvenile crime, vice, and degeneracy, steadily increase with the increased use of tobacco. The\naverage age of crime in the United States has come down in sixteen years from age\ntwenty-eight to nineteen.\n<\/p><p>\nExtremely regrettable as it is, young women in the last few years have taken up smoking and\nthe habit is rapidly growing among them. From an article written by Alonzo L. Baker,\nassociate editor of the magazine <i>Good Health<\/i>, and entitled \"Should Women Smoke?\" I make\na few quotations as follows:\n<\/p><p>\nHere are two facts that should be borne in mind by every girl and woman in America:\n<\/p><p>\n1. Tobacco harms women more physically than it does men.\n<\/p><p>\n2. Tobacco does more damage to the race through mothers than through fathers.\n<\/p><p>\nNaming some bad effects, he continues:\n<\/p><p>\nA vital question is the effect of tobacco in pregnancy. These two facts are indisputable: (1)\nNicotine is one of the few substances that passes through the placenta to the fetus; (2)\nNicotine passes to the infant in its mother's milk. In view of the virulence of the poison that\nnicotine is, damage both to the unborn child and to the nursing child is inevitable when he is\nnicotinized before and after birth. . . The smoking habit has become widespread among\nwomen of recent years only in America. Preliminary reports . . . thus far made indicate that\nthe number of still-births and premature children born to habitually smoking mothers is\nmarkedly higher than for mothers who are abstainers from tobacco. . . .Just cause for alarm is\nthe rapidly growing number of girls who form the tobacco habit before they have come to\nphysical maturity. Smoking on the part of girls during their teen years is nothing less than a\ntragedy, for those are the years when nicotine does its greatest damage to the growing nerve\nand glandular systems of the female body.\n<\/p><p>\nDr. D. H. Kress, another well-known objector to smoking, wrote on this particular point\nsaying:\n<\/p><p>\nFor both man and wife to be addicted to smoke inhalation is destructive of everything that is\ngood. Children born to such a pair had better never been born; . . . anything that is injurious\nto the child after its birth is equally injurious to it before its birth when indulged in by the\npregnant mother.\n<\/p><p>\nUnited States Surgeon General Hugh S. Cummings once wrote:\n<\/p><p>\nWhen women generally contract the smoking habit (as they are now doing) the entire nation\nwill suffer. The physical tone of the whole nation will be lowered. This is one of the most\nevil influences in American life today. The habit harms a woman more than it does a man.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Charles W. Eliot of Harvard University once in talking to his freshman class on the\nsubject of tobacco gave the following advice:\n<\/p><p>\nMy dear freshmen, I want you to remember that tobacco in any form destroys the brain, and\nyou have none to spare.\n<\/p><p>\nALCOHOL A CURSE\n<\/p><p>\nTime will not permit my saying much relative to liquor. It is perhaps unnecessary to do so\nsince the effects of drinking are more or less widely known. However, I ask your indulgence\nwhile I give two or three quotations from keen observers.\n<i>The Journal of the American Medical Association<\/i> said:\n<\/p><p>\nAlcohol is a poison inherently, absolutely, essentially; in a drop or in a gallon, in all\nquantities and in every quantity, it is a poison. Plainly the quantity cannot effect its chemical\nconstitution.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd from the eloquent pen of the late keen-minded Robert G. Ingersoll, who knew how to\ndescribe alcohol in all its hellish effects on humanity, I give the following:\n<\/p><p>\nAlcohol is the blood of the gambler, the inspiration of the burglar, the stimulus of the\nhighwayman, and the support of the midnight incendiary. It suggests the lie and countenances\nthe liar, condones the thief, and esteems the blasphemer. It violates obligation, reverences\nfraud, turns love to hate, scorns virtue and innocence. It incites the father to butcher his\nhelpless offspring, and the child to sharpen the patricidal ax.\n<\/p><p>\nAlcohol burns up men, consumes women, destroys life, curses God, and despises heaven. It\nsuborns witnesses, nurses perversity, defiles the jury box, and stains the judicial ermine. It\nbribes voters, disqualifies votes, corrupts elections, pollutes our institutions, endangers the\ngovernment, degrades the citizen, debases the legislature, dishonors the statesman, and disarms\nthe patriot. It brings shame, not honor; terror, not safety; despair, not hope; misery, not\nhappiness; and, with the malevolence of a fiend, calmly surveys the frightful desolation, and\nreveling in havoc, poisons felicity, destroys peace and ruins morals, wipes out national honor,\ncurses the world, and laughs at the ruin it has wrought. It does that and more. It murders the\nsoul; it is the sum of all villainy, the father of all crime, the mother of all abominations, the\ndevil's best friend, and God's worst enemy.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd from the inspired voice of the Church&mdash;that of the First Presidency&mdash;the following was\nsaid three years ago in this conference:\n<\/p><p>\nDrink brings cruelty into the home; it walks arm in arm with poverty; its companions are\ndisease and plague; it puts chastity to flight; it knows neither honesty nor fair dealing; it is a\ntotal stranger to truth; it drowns consciousness, it is the bodyguard of evil; it curses all who\ntouch it.\n<\/p><p>\nDrink has brought more woe and misery, broken more hearts, wrecked more homes,\ncommitted more crimes, filled more coffins than all the wars the world has suffered.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, in accordance with the divine will, the Church stands absolutely and continuously\nopposed to smoking and to the consumption of all kinds of alcoholic beverages. It persistently\ncalls to its members and to all others to abstain from the use of these body, mind, and soul\ndestroying poisons. May the Lord give us all the desire and the strength to do so, I pray in\nthe name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
