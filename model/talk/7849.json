We have felt the Spirit of the Lord in rich abundance these past two days as our hearts have been touched and our testimonies of this divine work have been strengthened. We express thanks to each one who has participated, including those Brethren offering prayers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/until-we-meet-again.p5\" class=\"\">We are all here because we love the Lord and want to serve Him.

May we ever be found doing the work of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/until-we-meet-again.p15\" class=\"\">May heaven\u2019s blessings be with you.

May God give us the strength and the ability and the determination to play our part well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/until-we-meet-again.p18\" class=\"\">I bear my testimony to you that this work is true, that our Savior lives, and that He guides and directs His Church here upon the earth. I leave with you my witness and my testimony that God our Eternal Father lives and loves us. He is indeed our Father, and He is personal and real. May we realize and understand how close to us He is willing to come, how far He is willing to go to help us, how much He loves us, and how much He does and is willing to do for us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/until-we-meet-again.p19\" class=\"\">May He bless you.
