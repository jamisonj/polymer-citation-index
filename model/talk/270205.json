Thousands have felt the influence of its terrible power and baneful\n  effects. Long pilgrimages have been undertaken, penances endured, and pain, misery and ruin have\n  followed in their train; nations have been convulsed, kingdoms overthrown, provinces laid waste,\n  and blood, carnage and desolation are habiliments in which it has been clothed.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"wideEllipse\">* * *<\/p>\n\n  <div class=\"topic \">The Spirit of God the Spirit of Knowledge<\/div>\n  <p class=\"std\">As we have noticed before, the great difficulty lies in the ignorance of the nature of spirits, of\n  the laws by which they are governed, and the signs by which they may be known; if it requires the\n  Spirit of God to know the things of God;<span class=\"footRef\">4<\/span> and the spirit of the devil can only be unmasked through\n  that medium, then it follows as a natural consequence that unless some person or persons have a\n  communication, or revelation from God, unfolding to them the operation of the spirit, they must\n  eternally remain ignorant of these principles; for I contend that if one man cannot understand these\n  things but by the Spirit of God,<span class=\"footRef\">5<\/span> ten thousand men cannot; it is alike out of the reach of the wisdom\n  of the learned,<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> the tongue of the eloquent, the power of the mighty.
