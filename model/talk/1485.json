Eldon Tanner, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1966, pp. 133-139<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nPresident McKay, my beloved colleagues, brothers and sisters, and all you in this great\nconference today and who are listening in, it is with a deep feeling of humility that I stand\nbefore you in this great conference today and participate with you as we commemorate the\ndeath and resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God.\n<\/p><p>\nThe inspiring talks we have heard and the lovely music to which we have listened and the\nbeautiful spirit that has pervaded this whole conference, I am sure, have touched our hearts\nand helped us to appreciate the great significance and sacredness of this occasion that we are\ncommemorating today. The most important and most significant of all events that have\nhappened in the history and life of mankind are the birth, life, death, and resurrection of our\nLord and Savior, Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten of God the Eternal Father.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Scriptures the source of knowledge of Him<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in\nhim should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28236\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28236)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28236)\">John 3:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe scriptures give us an accurate and dramatic account of how Christ went about doing\ngood, healing the sick, making the blind to see and the lame to walk, how he was persecuted,\ntried, and sentenced to death; how he was betrayed; the agony he suffered before he was\nactually hanged on the cross. Yet in spite of all persecution and suffering, he said as he was\nhanged on the cross: \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31686\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31686)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31686)\">Luke 23:34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd his last words before he died were: \"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31691\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31691)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31691)\">Luke 23:46<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs the women, through their love, came seeking Jesus at the tomb, the most glorious of all\nmessages was given to them by the angel who said: \"He is not here: for he is risen, as he\nsaid\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35668\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35668)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35668)\">Matt. 28:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen we have the irrefutable testimonies of Peter and John and the other apostles and many\nothers who saw him and talked to him after his resurrection and were instructed by him, both\nin the Old World and on this the American continent.\n<\/p><p>\nI say to the world as the late President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., said in his closing words to a\nlarge group of business leaders at a dinner given in his honor in New York City: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For us Christians he is the Christ, the Only Begotten Son of the Living God, the Creator\nunder God, of the earth, the Redeemer of the world, our Savior, the First Fruits of the\nResurrection (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"447\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 447)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(447)\">1 Cor. 15:20<\/a><\/span>),\nwhich comes to all born into this earth, believer and unbeliever alike, the only\nname under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8000\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8000)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8000)\">Acts 4:12<\/a><\/span>).\"\n(J. Reuben Clark, Jr., <i>Behold the Lamb of God<\/i>, p. viii.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>We testify that He lives<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nToday, while we in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, together with millions of\nothers throughout the world, believe in God the Eternal Father and in his Son, Jesus Christ,\nand in the Holy Ghost (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6826\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6826)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6826)\">A of F 1:1<\/a><\/span>),\nthere are those who are trying to convince the world that God is dead.\nSome claim to be Christians, yet atheists, and claim that God died in Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nThis theory is not new, but it is more serious and probably worthy of our attention because\nthe argument is originating within Christendom and is being argued by intellectuals,\ntheologians teachers of the seminaries in universities, ministers, and bishops who preach it\nfrom the pulpit and perpetrate it in books and magazines.\n<\/p><p>\nThe seriousness of the claim that God is dead is also emphasized by conditions in the colleges\nin America today. In Cornell University's Value Study, the researchers found <i>little or no<\/i>\n<i>evidence of absolute conviction or adherence,<\/i> and ended by calling <i>student belief \"secular religion.\"<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nIn the <i>Weekly Religious Review<\/i>, we read: \"It is a serious theological matter, though not\nwithout its comical aspects, all of a sudden seminary professors are popping up in every\ncountry, it seems, saying: 'We simply must stop believing in God.' Faith, they say, wagging\ntheir heads at their students is no longer possible.\" (<i>Weekly Religious Review<\/i>, No. 266,\nNovember 19, 1965, p. 1.)\n<\/p><p>\nIt is significant to note that many of America's colleges were originally founded by religious\ngroups for religious purposes. During most of the nineteenth century they were centers of\nreligious activity, but in this century there has been a radical shift toward religious neutralism\namong academic leaders. Thus the student of traditional faith may discover that his cherished\nconvictions are ignored, dismissed, and silenced or questioned by another standard of belief.\nTheir decline in a secular environment, intellectually and morally, is rapid and not\ninfrequently disastrous.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Church's system of education<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn order to help our students meet this trend, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nhas the policy of establishing seminaries and institutes near every high school and university\nwhere there are sufficient of our students to justify it. I would encourage parents to have their\nchildren attend schools where these facilities are available. These people who profess and\npromote the \"God is dead\" theory say that it is old-fashioned to believe in God and warn that\nunless Christians bring their faith into line with modern knowledge, Christian faith itself will\nbe abandoned. Can you think of anything more abhorrent than to claim that we should seek to\nmake God acceptable to man rather than to try to bring man back to God?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Seek Him and find Him\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe promise given by God to Israel as found in Deuteronomy is worthy of our very careful\nattention: \n<\/p><p>\n\"But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him\nwith all thy heart and with all thy soul.\n<\/p><p>\n\"When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days,\nif thou turn to the Lord thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . he will not forsake thee\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21258\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21258)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21258)\">Deut. 4:29-31<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhen you read the prayer offered by Jesus Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, as he left his\nthree apostles, \"and he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my\nFather, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35664\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35664)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35664)\">Matt. 26:39<\/a><\/span>),\nis there any doubt in your mind that he was talking to his Father, that he knew\nGod lived?\n<\/p><p>\nThen as he reported to his Father in that beautiful prayer recorded in John 17: \"These words\nspake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy\nSon, that thy Son also may glorify thee: \n<\/p><p>\n\"As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as\nthou hast given him.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"This is life eternal . . .\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom\nthou hast sent.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with\nthee before the world was\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28297\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28297)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28297)\">John 17:1-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nCan anyone believe in Christ, accept his words, and doubt that God lives, that he stands ready\nto hear and answer prayers, and that he is the Father of Jesus Christ?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The testimony of the Prophet<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nLet us consider Joseph Smith's own words as he tells of his experience when he went to God\nin prayer after reading in James: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth\nto all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26186\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26186)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26186)\">James 1:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph says: \"At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and\nconfusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the\ndetermination to ask of God, concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom,\nand would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.\n<\/p><p>\n\"So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make\nthe attempt\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30481\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30481)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30481)\">JS&mdash;H 1:13-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs a result of this earnest and sincere prayer, he had a visitation that gave further evidence in\nthis dispensation of the reality of the Father and the Son. He records: \"When the light rested\nupon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing\nabove me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to\nthe other&mdash;<i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!<\/i>\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30485\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30485)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30485)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn spite of all these examples of the force of prayer, much doubt seems to exist in the world\ntoday; therefore, it is evident that somewhere along the line the churches have lost touch with\nthe twentieth century. Could this be because they have lost touch with God and have been led\nby blind guides? If so, there is good reason, as all seem to agree, why the old forms must be\nchanged and for us to return to God.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Acknowledge God and return to Him<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTo help us understand how prevalent this need is and how important it is for all people\nindividually to acknowledge and return to God, I should like to refer to one source of\nevidence that might be helpful.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Prayer and communion with Him<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the last decade, an average of about 10,000 young men have been acting full-time in a\nreligious peace corps throughout the world. They are our Mormon missionaries. They spend a\ngood part of every day in person to person contact with all the world's culture&mdash;the\nchurched, the unchurched, the high and the low, the Christian and the non-Christian. They\nmeet millions of people in their homes and in makeshift settings, at which time they discuss\nGod and prayer.\n<\/p><p>\nAs these missionaries kneel with their new-found friends in prayer and teach them to pray,\nthey pour out their hearts to the Lord in all humility. They find that prayer has become as\nmeaningless to many people as the purpose of life has become meaningless. They find that\nfew pray in any satisfying or in any effective way. They find that very few have any form of\nfamily prayer. It is appalling to find how few people feel that they are really praying to a\nliving God or have any clear expectation of what the result might be. In fact, if they believe\nin God, they admit they believe in a kind of God and in a kind of religiousness, but to\nactually talk to God is foreign to them.\n<\/p><p>\nMany say: \"Praying is listening to music or responding to nature.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOthers say: \"I have my own kind of prayer.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd still others say: \"Prayer at its best is just silence&mdash;seeking nothing, expecting nothing.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe most difficult problem the missionaries have is to get the people whom they are trying to\nteach to kneel down and actually pray with them. This attitude toward prayer is clearly\npointed out in a report of a recent survey of one of the outstanding centers of religion in the\nUnited States.\n<\/p><p>\nAll of the students here are preparing either for teaching or ministerial careers in religion. The\nsurvey showed that only 9 percent of them reported having any significant prayer life. The\nothers said \"None\" or \"Almost none,\" yet all said they were deeply religious and cared to help\nothers become so.\n<\/p><p>\nIf these cases are typical, one <i>must<\/i> come to the conclusion that the world has reached the\npoint at which they think of God, whatever God is, as a kind of being who makes prayer\nmeaningless, or something to which one cannot go for guidance, strength, and comfort.\n<\/p><p>\nThese Mormon missionaries of whom I spoke have had some very outstanding and\nencouraging experiences with those who have learned to pray to a living God. They have seen\nhundreds of thousands of them come alive to reality.\n<\/p><p>\nOne outstanding businessman, when asked how he happened to become interested in the\nChurch, said to me personally: \"When I knelt with those boys and heard them pray, I knew\nthat they knew to whom they were speaking.\" He went on to say that as he became interested,\nhe too began to pray to a living God and proved without doubt the statement of Moroni\ntherein he said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye should ask God, the\nEternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true, and if ye shall ask with a\nsincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you,\nby the power of the Holy Ghost\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38334\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38334)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38334)\">Moro. 10:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNothing can bring a greater feeling of joy and peace and satisfaction and security to us than\nto know that God is present and interested in us. This changes the outlook and the lives of the\npeople when they have discovered or rediscovered that prayer is a vital, vibrant link. Then\ntheir lives become meaningful, and the change is evident to all.\n<\/p><p>\nAs these people who now know through prayer that God lives try to explain their attitude\ntoward prayer before they met the missionaries, it brings us to one conclusion, and that is that\nmen were deadened toward God, and not that God is dead. Until they are conscious of a\nliving God to whom they can go, the gospel means very little to them.\n<\/p><p>\nThe issue, then, becomes quite clear; that it is not what kind of God man can believe in, but\nwhat kind of man does the living God reach. One able theologian makes this profound\nstatement: \n<\/p><p>\nIt may be that the funeral that is now being held in some churches is not for a God who had\ndied, but for a God who was never alive, whom it was blasphemy to worship, and is now\nfolly to mourn. Before such a God one can pray himself to death&mdash;in vain.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Worship Him<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFor those who have been worshiping an unknown God (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8014\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8014)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8014)\">Acts 17:23<\/a><\/span>),\nor idols of some kind or other, the\ncrumbling of these gods or idols may be a good thing, providing the worshipers can see\nbeyond the idols. It may be that our cultures in the twentieth century are so sick and tired of\nfalse prophets that many are not interested in or capable of listening to true ones and, in fact,\nnot capable of acknowledging that there ever were true prophets. Therefore, they feel no\nrelationship to God and no need of calling on him. This in itself is a most serious situation\nindeed.\n<\/p><p>\nThere surely can be no real comfort in what is called an atheistic religion. Imagine a religion\nin which one can only think of a God who is formless, faceless, and heartless, who makes no\ndemands, who has no consequences, who takes no role in any of the real battles of life except\n(as some kind of metaphysical Atlas) to provide the ground of battle.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat can a man expect of God, or how can he expect God to reach him, if he is convinced\nthat the only proof of God's reality is his total absence or if he has a hundred reasons why\ndivine revelation, if it came, would not be divine and not be revelation?\n<\/p><p>\nIn referring to these conditions in the world today, the eloquent Rabbi Abraham Joshua\nHeschel says: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I speak as a person who is often afraid and terribly alarmed lest God has turned away from\nus in disgust and even deprived us of the power to understand his word. Some of us are like\npatients in the state of final agony, who scream in delirium: The doctor is dead! The doctor is\ndead!\" (<i>Union Theological Seminary Quarterly<\/i>, January 1966.)\n<\/p><p>\nIn order for life to have a purpose, and for us to know where we came from and why we are\nhere and what our future might hold, it is necessary that we be willing to admit the possibility\nthat God does exist, that his absence is not his will, but our lack of will or our unwillingness\nto reach, to listen, and to respond.\n<\/p><p>\nAll down through the ages the prophets have borne testimony that they have talked with God,\nthat they have received instructions and been led by him. This applies to prophets in varying\nconditions, in different countries, and at different times, including our own. Also, hundreds of\nthousands of individuals scattered throughout the world today can and do bear testimony that\ntheir prayers have been answered in many ways.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Family worship in the home<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a beautiful sight and experience and what a great privilege and blessing it is for a\nfamily to kneel down together in family prayer and talk to God, knowing that he is there, that\nhe will hear and answer their prayers. The value of such a prayer and the influence it has on\nthe individuals who kneel in that prayer, from the father and mother to the youngest child,\ncannot be measured.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember so well as we knelt in family prayer how Father used to talk to the Lord as one\nman would talk to another, how he expressed his gratitude for his blessings, and how he\nprayed for the welfare of his family, and how he pled for wisdom and knowledge and courage\nand strength for all of us to do the right.\n<\/p><p>\nHe who made us wants us to succeed and stands ready to answer the call. As the Lord said,\n\"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto\nyou\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35563\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35563)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35563)\">Matt. 7:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBut as President McKay said at October conference, you must knock, you must ask, and you\nmust seek. The question as to whom can the Lord reach may be answered in the following\ndescription given by a young man of a prayer offered by another man. He said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I had heard men and women pray [before] . . . from the most ignorant, both as to letters and\nintellect, to the most learned and eloquent, but never until then had I heard a man address his\nMaker as though He was present listening as a kind father would listen to the sorrows of a\ndutiful child. [He] was at that time unlearned, but that prayer . . . to my humble mind,\npartook of the learning and eloquence of heaven. There was no ostentation, no raising of the\nvoice as by enthusiasm, but a plain conversational tone, as a man would address a present\nfriend. It appeared to me as though, in case the veil were taken away, I could see the Lord\nstanding facing His humblest of all servants I had ever seen. Whether this was really the case\nI cannot say; but one thing I can say, it was the crowning, so to speak, of all the prayers I\never heard.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis is a description of Joseph Smith by Daniel Tyler, then in his teens, on hearing Joseph,\nage 30, in Kirtland, Ohio (<i>The Juvenile Instructor<\/i>, Vol. 27, pp. 127-8).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Believe all who testify of Him<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nProphets, whether in ancient or modern times, prayed to a God who was alive. For them he is\nalive and present. He acts, he moves, he informs, he intervenes. He transmits knowledge and\npower. He is not just ultimate, he is intimate. He is a person. He is a jealous God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22761\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22761)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22761)\">Ex. 20:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to bear my personal testimony to everyone under the sound of my voice today\nthat I know as I know I live that God lives, that he does hear and answer prayers. When as\nmembers of the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve we meet in the temple and join in\nprayer, he who is mouth actually speaks to the Lord, expressing our gratitude, our concern,\nasking for strength and wisdom and inspiration. And I wish to bear testimony that I have seen\nthese prayers answered many times.\n<\/p><p>\nI know of no greater blessing that I enjoy than to know that I can go to God the Eternal\nFather in humble prayer, knowing that he is there as a living, personal God. I appeal to all of\nyou who have any doubt in your mind that you accept the words of Jesus Christ himself and\nof the prophets of every dispensation who have said that God lives, that he is the Creator of\nmankind, in whose image we are made. Through accepting the gospel as given by Jesus\nChrist and in going to God in all humility, our prayers will be answered, our success will be\ngreater, our lives will be happier; and through the resurrection of Jesus Christ we may go\nforward confidently toward immortality and eternal lives into the presence of God the Eternal\nFather.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we all prepare ourselves for these blessings, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
