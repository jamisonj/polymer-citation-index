He exercised faith, and prayer, and deep humility, and out of it all he learned this great fact, as he himself expressed it:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cI have had so many evidences of His [God\u2019s] direction, so many instances when I have been controlled by some other power than my own will, that I cannot doubt that this power comes from above. \u2026 I am satisfied that, when the Almighty wants me to do, or not to do, a particular thing, he finds a way of letting me know it.\u201d (Ibid., p. 124.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p10\" class=\"\">Lincoln was convinced that, by and large, God controls the affairs of nations, and that when nations serve the Lord he blesses them; but when they do not, he withdraws his blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p11\" class=\"\">Said he:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cIt is the duty of Nations as well as of men to own their dependence upon the overruling power of God, to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon, and to recognize the sublime truth announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that \u2018those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord.\u2019\u201d (Ibid., p. 390\u201391.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p13\" class=\"\">With this in mind he also declared that nations, like individuals, are subject to punishments and chastisements at the hand of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p14\" class=\"\">He believed that the Civil War was one of the punishments God brought upon America because it tolerated slavery.

All we have to do is to trust the Almighty, and keep on obeying His orders and executing His will.\u201d (Ibid., p. 126.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cThat the Almighty \u2026 directly intervenes in human affairs, is one of the plainest statements in the Bible,\u201d the great Civil War leader declared. (Ibid., p. 124.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p19\" class=\"\">Lincoln had seen examples of this very thing as he studied the scriptures. In Deuteronomy, for instance, he read that God had promised the ancient Israelites, as they emerged from Egyptian bondage, that if they would obey the divine commandments, the Lord would make of them the greatest nation on earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p20\" class=\"\">Archaeologists and historians have fully demonstrated that there were some very great and advanced nations in antiquity; but God would make of the Twelve Tribes the greatest of them all!

They gazed upon their neighboring nations and envied them and wanted to be like them. They knew that those nations were evil and idolatrous, but they seemed to have an air of popularity about them; and therefore, the Israelites, blinded by selfishness and pride, still clamored to be like them. Eventually they were\u2014and went down to destruction as did those other nations. They apostatized from the principles God gave them to make them great. They failed to achieve their ultimate potential and suffered the bitter consequences of disobedience. It was a stupendous loss of a magnificent opportunity which could have changed the whole course of history.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p27\" class=\"\">The same principle held true in ancient America. Two nations occupied the Western Hemisphere. Both received commandments similar to those given to ancient Israel. Both were told that to prosper in this land they must serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ, or they would be swept off.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p28\" class=\"\">But neither nation had sufficient faith to keep the commandments. Both threw to the four winds an opportunity like that offered to ancient Israel\u2014to be mighty in the earth. Both fell into sin, and both were destroyed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p29\" class=\"\">Now what was it that Lincoln said? \u201cIt is the duty of Nations as well as of men to own their dependence upon the overruling power of God.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p30\" class=\"\">And what else did he say? \u201cThose nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p31\" class=\"\">That principle held true in the days of ancient Israel, it held true with the Jaredites and the Nephites, and it holds true today: <span class=\"emphasis\">only those nations are blessed whose God is the Lord!<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p32\" class=\"\">But Lincoln taught something else. He not only said that the blessings of God are limited to those nations who acknowledge Him, but that likewise, only those individual persons who serve the Lord receive His blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p33\" class=\"\">Remember that he said: It is the duty of both nations <span class=\"emphasis\">and individuals<\/span> to acknowledge their dependence upon the overruling power of God and that they should confess their sins in humble sorrow and seek mercy and forgiveness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p34\" class=\"\">What else did Lincoln say? Almost like a prophet he said: \u201cWe have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of heaven; \u2026 we have grown in number, wealth, and power as no other Nation has ever grown. <span class=\"emphasis\">But we have forgotten God.<\/span> [Italics added.] We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us, and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. \u2026 We have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God who made us.\u201d (Hill, p. 391.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p35\" class=\"\">And then Lincoln continued: \u201cIt behooves us, then, to humble ourselves before the offended power, to confess our \u2026 sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness.\u201d (Ibid.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p36\" class=\"\">Have we the courage to do what Lincoln said?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p37\" class=\"\">Heaven knows this world is filled with sin and corruption, with pride and arrogance, with selfishness, greed, and avarice.

He spoke also of the salt that loses its savor. Old Testament prophets spoke of a \u201csweet savor,\u201d too; but they also spoke of the savor \u201cthat stinketh,\u201d which is the ghastly stench of wickedness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p40\" class=\"\">Every nation is made up of its individual citizens.

Especially should every follower of Christ be as salt that provides a sweet savor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p42\" class=\"\">But we must remember the Lord\u2019s warning: \u201cIf the salt have lost his savor wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36428\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36428)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36428)\">Matt. 5:13<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p43\" class=\"\">And again, what was it Lincoln said? \u201cIf we do not do right, God will let us go on our own way to ruin.\u201d And that is true, for God will force no man to heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-savor-of-men.p44\" class=\"\">But the Lord was more forceful than was Lincoln, and declared that disobedience is an affront to Him.
