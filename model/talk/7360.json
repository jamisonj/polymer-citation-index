Since it is something that each of us has gone through, is going through, or will go through, there is scriptural suggestion that we can learn spiritual lessons if we can approach suffering, sorrow, or grief with a focus on Christ. Anciently Paul wrote that our suffering may give us an opportunity to know the Savior better. Paul wrote to the Romans:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/that-they-might-know-thee.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cThe Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/that-they-might-know-thee.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-26911_000_038\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"45402\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45402)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45402)\">Romans 8:16\u201317<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/that-they-might-know-thee.p10\" class=\"\">Now, lest anyone go looking for hardship and suffering, that is not what is taught. Rather, it is the attitude with which we approach our hardships and trials that allows us to know the Savior better. Experience teaches us that suffering is one of life\u2019s experiences that will come without seeking it. If I may use a personal example:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/that-they-might-know-thee.p11\" class=\"\">Some years ago when our first son was about a year old, I was the source of some seemingly unnecessary suffering. We were attending college, and one evening I had been playing with my boy on the floor. I left the room to study, and as I closed the door behind me he apparently reached for me, raising his hand up behind his head, and his finger went into the hinged side of the door. When I closed the door he suffered a rather severe injury to his finger.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/that-they-might-know-thee.p12\" class=\"\">We rushed him to the emergency room at the hospital, he was given a local anesthetic, and a doctor came in; he assured us that it could be repaired. Almost paradoxically, at that point the only thing my one-year-old wanted was to be held by his dad. As long as he could see me he resisted any efforts to bind him for the delicate surgery. When I left the room he calmed down, and the doctor was able to proceed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/that-they-might-know-thee.p13\" class=\"\">During the process I was anxious and would draw close to the open door and look around the corner to see how things were proceeding. Perhaps by some unseen sense, as I would peek noiselessly around the corner, which was located behind him and to the side, his head would come up and he would strain to see if I was there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/that-they-might-know-thee.p14\" class=\"\">On one of those occasions, as I saw him with his arm pinned out from his side\u2014his head arched, searching for his father\u2014the thought came to my mind of another Son, His arms stretched out, nailed to a cross, searching for His Father, and to my mind came the words, \u201cMy God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-26911_000_038\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"45326\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45326)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45326)\">Matthew 27:46<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> What was a very traumatic moment in my life suddenly became very sacred.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/that-they-might-know-thee.p15\" class=\"\">There is throughout the scriptures a line of men and women who always seemed to keep their focus on Christ\u2014people who, no matter what injury or injustice life dealt them, remained faithful and willing to endure. I speak of Abraham, dispossessed of the land of his inheritance and commanded to sacrifice Isaac; of Joseph, who was sold into slavery by his brothers, imprisoned for honoring virtue and chastity, and left to linger in jail because of a thoughtless servant; of Ruth, widowed young and left destitute, yet constant and loyal to her mother-in-law; of all three Nephis, both Almas, and of course the Prophet Joseph.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/that-they-might-know-thee.p16\" class=\"\">Particularly notable to me is Nephi\u2019s endurance.
