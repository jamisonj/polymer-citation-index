We allowed them to go. Then we started to get some things out of the car.

Some people came to try to help save her, but nothing could be done. Our youngest daughter had drowned.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/faith-in-adversity.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cThe moments that followed were extremely difficult, filled with anguish and pain for the loss of our youngest daughter.
