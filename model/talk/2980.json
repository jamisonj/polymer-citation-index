There is only one way to do this, and that is by being obedient to all the commandments of God. As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have voluntarily entered into holy covenants, promising to obey the Lord\u2019s commandments. Willing, righteous obedience leads to celestial life; indeed, there is no eternal progress without it. Yet obedience to the commandments of God seems to be one of man\u2019s most difficult challenges.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-blessings-of-righteous-obedience.p4\" class=\"\">Some people do not obey because they feel their free agency will be trampled upon if they consider themselves subservient to Church authorities or enter into binding ordinances.
