We remember that the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli. One evening as the boy slept, the Lord called him by name: \u201cSamuel.\u201d And he answered, \u201cHere am I.\u201d Thinking that Eli had called him, Samuel ran to him and repeated the declaration, \u201cHere am I.\u201d He was advised to return to his sleep.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-priesthood-in-action.p5\" class=\"\">Three times the voice of the Lord came to him, with the same response.

Years ago, before a temple was completed in South Africa, the Saints planning to visit a temple had to travel the long and costly route to London, England, or, later, to S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. When I visited South Africa, they, with all the strength of their hearts and souls, petitioned me to importune President Kimball to seek the heavenly inspiration to erect a temple in their country. I assured them this was a matter for the Lord and His prophet. They responded, \u201cWe have faith in you, Brother Monson. Please help us.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-priesthood-in-action.p11\" class=\"\">Upon returning to Salt Lake City, I discovered that a proposed temple for South Africa had already been approved and was to be announced immediately. When this occurred, I received a telegram from our members in South Africa. It read, \u201cThank you, Elder Monson.

I am certain that such has been the case with each of the Brethren who earlier today were sustained as new General Authorities. Let me share with you some marvelous lessons from the life of one of these Brethren, Jay E. Jensen, as recently reported in the <span class=\"emphasis\">Church News.<\/span> (8 Aug. 1992, pp. 6, 14.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-priesthood-in-action.p13\" class=\"\">Elder Jensen speaks of turning points in his life. His spiritual awakening began as a small boy growing up in Mapleton, Utah. His parents held family night long before it became a Church program. He recalled that his father read to him lessons from the Book of Mormon. His mother\u2019s deep love for books also had a favorable impact on her son. However, it was when he read for himself Joseph Smith\u2019s account of the First Vision that the witness of its truth became a reality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-priesthood-in-action.p14\" class=\"\">Upon graduation from high school, young Jay and his sweetheart, Lona, decided to get married and not wait for a call to serve a mission. \u201cIt nearly broke my father\u2019s heart,\u201d Elder Jensen related. \u201cMother told me that Dad just wept.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-priesthood-in-action.p15\" class=\"\">Two weeks later, and before wedding plans were finalized, Jay and Lona attended a sacrament meeting where a returned missionary reported his mission. The Spirit touched their hearts. They concluded to postpone marriage. Jay arose, went to the bishop\u2019s office, and reported for missionary service. The rest is history. Jay served in the Spanish-American Mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-priesthood-in-action.p16\" class=\"\">Lona moved to California for employment and served a stake mission. Upon the completion of Jay\u2019s mission, they were married in the Manti Temple. Elder Jensen\u2019s father lived long enough to see his son serve an honorable mission and marry in the temple. Sister Jensen has often said that sending her husband-to-be on a mission was the hardest thing she ever did, but that it was the most rewarding. \u201cI would never do it differently. We could never have been as happy otherwise.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-priesthood-in-action.p17\" class=\"\">Today, Jay and Lona serve in Guatemala.

It pertains to family history and temple work. During the period between 1860 and 1865, this region literally became saturated with the blood of America\u2019s youth as soldiers by the hundreds of thousands perished. Even today, the earth here and there reveals a timeworn uniform button, a belt buckle, a spent bullet. But what of the men who fell while in the flower of their youth? Many had never married. Who was to do their temple work? Were they forever to be denied the blessings of eternal ordinances?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-priesthood-in-action.p21\" class=\"\">William D. Taylor, a Canadian with no ties to either side of the conflict that raged so long ago, found himself, together with wife and family, living in the old South and suddenly filled with a compelling interest in those who died while so young in years.

It brings me joy unparalleled to anything I have ever known. It\u2019s hard to put my feelings into words.

He wrote: \u201cOn Saturday afternoon our Aaronic Priesthood young men and their leaders assembled at the temple to perform the baptism work for the fallen soldiers. What a marvelous sight it was to see these young Aaronic Priesthood brethren being baptized by their own priesthood leaders. In almost every case, when the young brother had finished his 14\u201315 names, he would turn and embrace his leader and shed a few tears of joy. What an example of true priesthood love and service! I had the experience of being a witness at the font and gained firsthand knowledge of this and, in a few cases, the undeniable witness of the Spirit that those young soldiers who had died had accepted the baptisms that were being performed in their behalf by our Aaronic Priesthood brethren.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-priesthood-in-action.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cWe wrote down the name of each soldier who was baptized that glorious day, so that the young men could have a brief history of the soldiers for whom they were baptized.

The challenge is to be ready to serve. On August 24 Hurricane Andrew slammed into the Florida coast south of Miami. Wind gusts exceeded two hundred miles per hour. It became the most costly disaster in United States history. Eighty-seven thousand homes were destroyed, leaving 150,000 homeless. Damages are estimated at 30 billion dollars. One hundred seventy-eight member homes were damaged, with forty-six of them destroyed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-priesthood-in-action.p35\" class=\"\">A spearhead unit was deployed from the Church welfare facility in Atlanta before the storm hit, and it arrived at its appointed location just as the winds abated.

Three large waves of member volunteers, numbering over five thousand, labored shoulder to shoulder with disaster-stricken residents, helping to repair three thousand homes, a Jewish synagogue, a Pentecostal church, and two schools. Forty-six missionaries from the Florida Ft. Lauderdale Mission worked full time for more than two weeks unloading supply trucks, serving as interpreters, providing security and traffic control, and assisting with repairs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-priesthood-in-action.p37\" class=\"\">Time will permit but a glance at several heartwarming accounts pertaining to this tremendous example of the priesthood in action.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>One morning a call was received at the Kendall chapel.
