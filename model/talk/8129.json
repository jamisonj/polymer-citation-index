He was baptized at age 21, the first member of the Church in his family. His faith burned brightly, and he immediately began preparing to serve a mission. Sadly, Aroldo\u2019s mother was diagnosed with cancer. Three months later, only days before she died, she spoke to Aroldo of her greatest concern: There were no relatives to help. Aroldo would need to take full responsibility for his two younger sisters and his younger brother. He solemnly made this promise to his dying mother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/faith-is-not-by-chance-but-by-choice.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">By day he worked in a bank, and at night he attended the university. He continued to keep his baptismal covenants, but his hopes for a full-time mission were gone. His mission would be caring for his family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/faith-is-not-by-chance-but-by-choice.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">Months later while preparing a sacrament meeting talk, Aroldo studied the words that Samuel reprovingly spoke to King Saul: \u201cTo obey,\u201d he read, \u201cis better than [to] sacrifice.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote10-12461_000_027\">10<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131185\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131185)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131185)\">1\u00a0Samuel 15:22<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Aroldo received the seemingly impossible impression that he needed to obey the prophet\u2019s call to serve a mission.

At age 23, he received his mission call. He told his brother how much to withdraw each month from his account for the family. Aroldo still did not have enough money to pay the full cost of his mission and the living expenses for his brother and sisters, but with faith he entered the MTC. A week later he received the first of many blessings. The bank that had employed Elder Cavalcante unexpectedly doubled the money he was to receive as he concluded his work. This miracle, along with others, provided the needed income for his mission and his family during his absence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/faith-is-not-by-chance-but-by-choice.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">Twenty years later, Brother Cavalcante is now serving as the president of the Recife Brazil Boa Viagem Stake.

There is much more to the story of Aroldo Cavalcante\u2019s commitment to his mother to care for his sisters and brother. During the years following his mother\u2019s death, he would openly refer to his brother and sisters as his \u201cchildren.\u201d During his mission, his letters and calls on Christmas and Mother\u2019s Day often addressed the individual challenges of each family member.

During the years following his mother\u2019s death, he would openly refer to his brother and sisters as his \u201cchildren.\u201d During his mission, his letters and calls on Christmas and Mother\u2019s Day often addressed the individual challenges of each family member. Through great sacrifice after his mission, Aroldo took financial responsibility for their education and the mission of his brother.
