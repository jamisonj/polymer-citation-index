And to see such unstained innocence neglected\nor abused, or exposed to evil or unwholesome influence, or warped by bad example, or by\nfalse teaching&mdash;or by failure to teach&mdash;is a sobering concern.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many who have responsibility for teaching children: parents, teachers, friends,\nanyone who in any way enters their lives, including the makers and promoters of products, of\npolicies; creators of entertainment, and the whole community, publicly and privately. And\nchildren in their innocence have a right to be protected from exploitation and from evil\ninfluence.\n<\/p><p>\nAs to teachers, the following is cited from a significant source: \"The personal influence of the\nteacher, in molding the character of the pupils, is the most important element in their\neducation . . . In morals, a teacher cannot teach what he is not. If he <i>talks<\/i> what he is not, it\nwere better not said, for his life talks more forcibly and is sooner believed, both by children\nand adults\" (W. M. Welch, <i>How to Organize, Classify and Teach a Country School<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>\nAlways we must remember that the teacher teaches himself. As Henry Adams said it: \"A\nteacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops\"\n(<i>The Education of Henry Adams<\/i>, ch. 20).\n<\/p><p>\nPeople who speak of their private lives as a thing apart from their professions would well\nremember this sentence from Stanford University's Dr. David Starr Jordan: \"There is no real\nexcellence in all this world,\" he said, \"which can be separated from right living\"\n(<i>The University and the Common Man<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Patronizing the cheap or trashy side<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow a comment on another question that concerns the whole community: It would be well if\nyoung people, parents, and all others who are concerned with decency would not patronize\nanything that tends to lower people's lives or lead their minds down to the cheap or trashy or\nharmful or suggestive side.\n<\/p><p>\nQuite apart from the personal effect on the one who partakes of a\nharmful product, or who witnesses an immoral or suggestive or obscene picture or play\n(through whatever medium it may be presented), we well would remember that whenever we\npatronize an immoral or unclean performance, or use a harmful or unwholesome product, we\nare helping to make evil profitable. Whatever other motives there may be, immoral\nentertainment or unwholesome products are produced to make money. And as a people, as\nparents, as citizens of a great, beloved land, we ought to be committed to the principle of not\nmaking evil profitable. The more profitable it is, the more evil will be offered.\n<\/p><p>\nOne might well wonder about the term \"adult entertainment.\" Could it be that something\nunclean or immoral which is not fit for children is wholesome for adults? Is \"adult evil\"\nacceptable? How consistent is it to have a double standard?\n<\/p><p>\nOr how would anyone be so shortsighted as to partake of that which would impair his\nphysical or mental or spiritual capacity, and say to himself, \"It's not good for children, but\nit's all right for me\"?\n<\/p><p>\nIf the content of a magazine encourages loose morals and low-mindedness and permissive,\ndegrading attitudes and practices, should we buy it? Should we read it? Should we have it\naround the home?\n<\/p><p>\nIf a book is filthy, should we buy it? Should we read it? \". . . books,\" said Thomas Carlyle,\n\"are like men's souls\" (<i>Inaugural Address<\/i>, Edinburgh, 1866).\n<\/p><p>\nShould we keep a television or radio presentation exposed to viewing or listening if it is one\nof crudeness or brutish violence or indecent suggestion&mdash;or even if it is simply trashy or\ntrivial?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Unless virtue guide us,\" said William Penn, \". . . our choice must be wrong\"\n(<i>Some Fruits of Solitude: Temporal Happiness<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe commandments of God have not been repealed. The laws of cause and consequence are\nstill in force.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Honest and wise men needed<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe creators of community influence and environment and example&mdash;which is all of\nus&mdash;would well remember the words of our Savior concerning whosoever \"shall offend one of\nthese little ones\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35939\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35939)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35939)\">Matt. 18:6<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;or\nolder ones&mdash;or whosoever devotes his life to the production or\npromotion or support of mind-corroding, soul-destroying evil in any of its forms.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Liberty,\" said Horace Greeley, \"cannot be established without morality, nor morality without\nfaith.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and good men and wise men ye\nshould observe to uphold\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15428\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15428)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15428)\">D&amp;C 98:10<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;and\nthis would seem to suggest that qualified\nand able and courageous people should prepare themselves and make themselves available for\npublic and civic service, and not be indifferent or complacent or resigned to sitting on the\nsidelines.  Even at personal sacrifice there ought to be a sufficient number who will make\nthemselves available for public service.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Obligations of parents<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow what of our obligations as parents? We cannot safely leave the teaching and molding of\nour children to chance. We cannot altogether count on others to teach our children. The first\nresponsibility is ours. We must build our own internal strength.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is more and more evidence that the basic attitudes and capacity and character of\nchildren are molded at a very early age. \"No curious scientist,\" said an eminent authority,\n\"ever had as great curiosity as a youngster from eighteen months to three years of age,\" all of\nwhich confirms the importance of implanting the truths of life early&mdash;and always.\n<\/p><p>\n\"My life is my message,\" said Mahatma Gandhi. It is so with each of us. The impressions of\nwhat we are and do and feel and believe and live and teach are carried over to our children. If\nwe depart from principles, may we reasonably expect our children not to depart?\n<\/p><p>\nMany a parent who has criticized sacred things or principles he should support wonders why\nhis children later depart further from principles.\n<\/p><p>\nThose who follow bad examples don't always know where to stop, and parents who indulge\nthemselves \"in moderation\" may have children who indulge themselves to excess.\n<\/p><p>\nThere should be no double standard. Constantly others are learning from us, feeling from us,\nreasoning their course of conduct from our course of conduct. And if we get a little over the\nline, our children, our young people, may get a long way over the line.\n<\/p><p>\nWithin the week I have read this comment from a neighboring country: \"It is not the\npoliceman's responsibility . . . to substitute for the family. Respect for law . . . begins with respect\nfor parents . . . respect for the rights and privacy of brothers and sisters and of playmates.\"\n(<i>The Royal Bank of Canada Monthly Letter<\/i>, January and March, 1969.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>World no better than its homes<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"Law itself,\" said Samuel Smiles, \"is but the reflex of homes.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis world will be no better than its homes. This country, this community, this Church, will\nbe no better than the strength and effectiveness of our homes and families.\n<\/p><p>\nExample and love and sheer goodness of life do more for children than can be calculated.\n<\/p><p>\nThe integrity and effectiveness and affection of the home and family are first.\n<\/p><p>\nIn a well-known work, Dostoyevsky had this to say: \"The soul is healed by being with\nchildren.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHealed, yes&mdash;and also searched. Perhaps we are never more open to penetrating scrutiny than\nwhen the eyes of a child are upon us. And so often we underestimate their understanding. \nChildren have a way of seeing inside. And our teaching must be more than talking. \"[Boys]\nknow truth from counterfeit as quick as the chemist does,\" said Emerson. \"They detect\nweakness in your eye and behavior . . . before you open your mouth\" (Emerson,\n<i>Compensation<\/i>)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Innocence of children<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nDon't try to hide your heart from a child. They come here clean and sweet and teachable,\nfrom the Father of us all. Innocent they come, and innocent they are, until environment or\nexample is otherwise.\n<\/p><p>\nOne can scarcely conceive of corruption or cruelty to children.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The child's grief throbs against its little heart as heavily as the man's sorrow,\" said Edwin\nChapin.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I love these little people,\" said Charles Dickens, \"and it is not a slight thing, when they, who\nare so fresh from God, love us.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Be ever gentle with the children God has given you,\" pleaded Elihu Burritt. \"Watch over\nthem constantly; reprove them earnestly, but not in anger.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"The first duty to children is to make them happy.&mdash;If you have not made them so, you have\nwronged them.&mdash;No other good they may get can make up for that.\" (Charles Buxton,\nEnglish author.)\n<\/p><p>\nTo quote a sentence from Arnold Glasow: \"The best thing to spend on children&mdash;is your\ntime.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe need more mothers at home&mdash;and fathers. We need more faithful observance of home\nevenings&mdash;more unity and faithfulness in marriage, and devotion to duty, and happiness at\nhome.\n<\/p><p>\nWe need to feed the minds of our children when they are most receptive.\n<\/p><p>\nWe need to give them happy, wholesome memories.\n<\/p><p>\nSometimes when you have said something to a child you didn't intend to say, or were more\nsevere than the situation called for, have you ever gone back and looked at that same\nyoungster when he was asleep, and felt terribly humble and terribly small? And, with a little\nextra moisture in your eyes, have you ever uttered a fervent prayer that you would be the kind\nof parent you ought to be?\n<\/p><p>\nO how sweetly, how often we have heard them sing: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I am a child of God,<br \/>\n     And He has sent me here,<br \/>\n     Has given me an earthly home<br \/>\n     With parents kind and dear.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Lead me, guide me, walk beside me,<br \/>\n     Help me find the way.<br \/>\n     Teach me all that I must do<br \/>\n     To live with Him some-day.\"\n<\/p><p>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &mdash;Naomi W. Randall\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Learn and live gospel<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nParents, learn the gospel; live it. Be a living sermon in the home.
