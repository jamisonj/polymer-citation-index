The servants of God whose writings have been handed down to us in the book called the Bible, were all blessed in their day and generation with some foresight in regard to the last great dispensation of God's mercy to man. The Spirit of God opened up to them views concerning the great latter-day work, which God should perform, in which He would consummate His purposes, in which He would perfect His work, in regard to the people of this earth. And they were strengthened in the performance of the duties devolving upon them by glimpses of the latter-day glory. They were called to pass through very trying circumstances. As the Apostle Paul says: <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"203b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD24\/JoD24_0203.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;203b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8557\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> &#x201C;They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"77098\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 77098)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(77098)\">Heb. 11:37-38<\/a><\/span> Generally speaking, the prophets of God were rejected by the majority of the children of men. By the spirit of prophecy which rested upon them, they could perceive how small would be the impressions which they would be able to make upon the people who lived in their day, and they saw also that although they might be able to accomplish some good in the name of the Lord, yet the adversary would come in like a flood, so to speak, and overwhelm the influences which they were able to bring to bear. They saw that the work which they were engaged in could  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"204a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD24\/JoD24_0204.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;204a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8556\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>not continue, but for a little while. But they looked down to the last days when the kingdom of God should be established on the earth, when it should not be prevailed against nor be overcome, but should remain and continue to grow and increase and spread forth, until its influence should extend to the uttermost parts of the earth, until all things should be subdued unto the Lord, until the wicked should be destroyed, until misrule and tyranny and oppression and falsehood and false doctrine and the powers of evil should be banished from the earth, and the light of God should stream forth to lighten every land, and the kingdoms of this world would become the kingdoms of our God and His Christ,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"79513\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 79513)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(79513)\">Rev. 11:15<\/a><\/span> and He should rule from pole to pole and from shore to shore. In this they rejoiced exceedingly, and they were encouraged to perform the work entrusted to them, by the foresight that God gave to them of the great latter-day work. The Apostle Paul referred to this dispensation in these words: &#x201C;Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"74773\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 74773)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(74773)\">Eph. 1:9-10<\/a><\/span> By this we see that the Apostle Paul&#x2014;and he was imbued with the same spirit and understanding as his brethren of the Apostleship&#x2014;looked forward to another dispensation than that in which they labored, which is generally called the Christian dispensation, because it was introduced by Jesus who was the Christ.

They could not possibly have any, because there has been no communication from those individuals who alone had the right to give it, and wherein they have presumed to act in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost without authority, they must give an account when they appear before the bar of God.
