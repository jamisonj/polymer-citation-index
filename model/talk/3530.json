This counsel will apply to the immediate as well as to the extended family. The scriptural admonition outlining this charge is clear.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p5\" class=\"\">However, before going into the subject, I wish to build a threshold from which to enter these hallowed halls of family responsibility. As we walk through life, each of us becomes involved in a variety of interests and activities. Ofttimes, our judgment of their relative importance is subject to question. I fear that some of what we do is of little worth from an eternal perspective. In fact, some of our interests may even detract from what good we may otherwise accomplish. There are some basic, fundamental activities of life that are far more productive as preparatory steps for exaltation than many others with which we may busy ourselves. Some of our number have been known to be busily engaged in the \u201cthick of thin things.\u201d The Master undoubtedly was speaking of this group as he taught us with the parable of the ten virgins.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p6\" class=\"\">Here were ten believing members of the Church. They believed enough that they were going, as a body, to meet the Bridegroom. It appears that they were not wicked, as we think of that descriptive term. I assume they had spent their lives, to that point, in \u201cchurch activity\u201d; however, as in the parable, five of them had been doing things of more import than had the other five. Half of them had been involved during their lives in doing things of consequence\u2014in doing things that mattered most\u2014in preparing oil for their lamps.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p7\" class=\"\">In speaking of the foolish, the parable states, \u201cAnd while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36786\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36786)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36786)\">Matt. 25:10<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p8\" class=\"\">With this as a warning and the word of the Lord instructing us to be about more important things, I\u2019d like to remind us of the teachings of one of the great Book of Mormon prophets and missionaries, Alma.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p9\" class=\"\">In one of the most important declarations of what it means to be a true disciple of the Master, Alma describes in clarity and simplicity the covenant and responsibility of one who would enter the waters of baptism. We have all entered the water. We have made the covenant. In the eighteenth chapter of Mosiah, Alma describes the conduct of a true follower of the Savior, a true disciple. For he said, \u201cAnd now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another\u2019s burdens, that they may be light;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cYea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40487\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40487)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40487)\">Mosiah 18:8\u20139<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p11\" class=\"\">He has stated simply: If we are to be the Savior\u2019s disciples, if we are to become like him, then we must serve one another, then we must assume responsibility to help with one another\u2019s needs, then we must assist each other through the thorny pathways of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p12\" class=\"\">We have been taught in other scripture that no matter how great and significant our mortal accomplishments, no matter how much was accomplished under our hand\u2014as a bishop, a clerk, a president, a teacher, or a parent\u2014unless we learn to exhibit charity, we are nothing. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"697\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 697)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(697)\">1 Cor. 13:1\u20133<\/a><\/span>.) All our good deeds will not weigh in our favor if charity is lacking.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p13\" class=\"\">Charity is measured in several ways. Perhaps a supreme form of charity may be exhibited by one who withholds judgment of another\u2019s acts or conduct, remembering that there is only one who can look into the heart and know the intent\u2014and know the honest desires found therein. There is only one whose right it is to judge the success of another\u2019s journey through life. Uncalled-for judgments or prejudiced feelings keep many from displaying a truly charitable attitude or a willingness to help those in need, even those in our own family circle. A warning comes to us from King Benjamin, who said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cPerhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just\u2014<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cBut I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40482\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40482)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40482)\">Mosiah 4:16\u201318<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p17\" class=\"\">Are not our own family members entitled to every consideration as contained in this counsel? Too often, charity is extended to another when his actions or conduct are acceptable to us. The exhibition of charity to another must not be dependent on his performance. It should be given because of who we are\u2014not because of how we behave.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p18\" class=\"\">Now, with these thoughts in mind, let\u2019s remember again Alma\u2019s words as they describe the acts of a true disciple. He is one who is:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p19\" class=\"\">\u2014willing to bear another\u2019s burdens,<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p20\" class=\"\">\u2014willing to mourn with those that mourn,<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p21\" class=\"\">\u2014willing to comfort.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p22\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, of all the places where our charitable acts should shine forth, where our discipleship must rise above the weaknesses of self, the family is the most important place. There is no other setting that comes close in comparison. Yet many\u2014far too many\u2014are more charitable to others than to their own.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p23\" class=\"\">From the content of this message, I\u2019m sure you can tell we have great concern about the manner in which we, as families, are caring for the needs of each other. Much has been said from this pulpit about the responsibility we have to look after our own. The words are clear. We fear the understanding and application of these principles are not being followed as the Lord has prescribed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p24\" class=\"\">In his day, President Brigham Young said the following: \u201cEver since I have been in this Church I have never suffered a relative to be maintained by the Church. But some men and women cast their children and other relatives upon the Church. If one has an aged sister who cannot maintain herself, he passes her over to the Church; or if an aged father or mother, why, \u2018let the Church \u2026 take care of them and provide for them.\u2019 It is a disgrace to every man and woman that has sense enough to live, not to take care of their own relatives, their own poor, and plan for them.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 8:145.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p25\" class=\"\">Fearing that we may have strayed from some of the basic moorings, I would like to quote from the welfare handbook some of us used as bishops over twenty years ago:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p26\" class=\"\">\u201c<span class=\"emphasis\">Aid from Relatives:<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cObviously no person should become a charge upon the public [or the Church] when his relatives are able to care for him.

Food, clothing, and shelter seem uppermost in our minds. Well it is that many parents assist newly married children in their first years of learning to manage limited funds. Often brothers and sisters likewise assist each other. Many sons and daughters are offering much of a temporal nature to their aging parents and grandparents. And so it should be, and blessed will be those who so provide for their own.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/our-responsibility-to-care-for-our-own.p31\" class=\"\">Family needs, however, are not always physical. Often faith, forgiveness, encouragement, comfort, counsel, listening, teaching, moral support, examples of loving and caring, and a host of other experiences will see loved ones through a crisis\u2014and their crisis needs may last a lifetime.
