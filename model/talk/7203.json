I am profoundly grateful to know that regardless of any challenges that yet await us, there is hope and confidence in knowing that by keeping the covenants of the gospel, all of the momentary trials of life can be transcended. The scriptures teach us that all will eventually be well as we are faithful to our covenants. King Benjamin taught:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cBecause of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cTherefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44620\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44620)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44620)\">Mosiah 5:7\u20139<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p11\" class=\"\">Giving careful attention to covenant making is critical to our eternal salvation. Covenants are agreements we make with our Heavenly Father in which we commit our hearts, minds, and behavior to keeping the commandments defined by the Lord. As we are faithful in keeping our agreement, He covenants, or promises, to bless us, ultimately with all that He has.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p12\" class=\"\">In the Old Testament we are taught the Lord\u2019s covenant pattern in Noah\u2019s experience with a wicked world and the Lord\u2019s plan for cleansing the earth. Because of Noah\u2019s faithful, steadfast commitment, the Lord said to him:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cBut with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons\u2019 wives with thee. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd Noah did \u2026 all that the Lord commanded him\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44438\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44438)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44438)\">Gen. 6:18<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44440\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44440)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44440)\">Gen. 7:5<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p15\" class=\"\">After the floods were abated, they went forth out of the ark.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd Noah builded an altar unto the Lord. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd God spake unto Noah, and to his sons [who were] with him, saying,<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44441\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44441)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44441)\">Gen. 8:20<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44442\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44442)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44442)\">Gen. 9:8\u20139<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p19\" class=\"\">We too have entered into sacred covenants with the Lord that we might be preserved from the adversary. Just as in Noah\u2019s time, we live in a day of prophetic promise and fulfillment. In the past eight years, 71 new temples have been dedicated\u2014a feat, under the direction of the Lord\u2019s prophet, which may in some ways be like the building of the ark in Noah\u2019s day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p20\" class=\"\">Our living prophet, President Gordon B.

This sacrifice, regardless of how great or small, often determines how committed in mind and heart we are to be submissive to the will of our Heavenly Father. The pattern of sacrifice often includes a season of struggle where we must evaluate and weigh the consequences of our decisions. Choices may not always be clear or easy, so we struggle on. When we finally determine to rid ourselves of struggle and to sacrifice our will for the Lord\u2019s, we are lifted to a new level of understanding. This process is often more recognizable in our lives when we experience a significant tragedy or challenge.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p22\" class=\"\">Just a few weeks ago a young man, while at a Scout camp in the mountains east of Salt Lake City, was struck by lightning, which took his life. His parents, grief stricken and devastated at the sudden loss of their son, struggled quietly and asked why this happened. Because their hearts were submissive and their faith strong, there came a great outpouring of love from the Lord. In the midst of their grief came a quiet, tender resolve to accept without anger the outcome of this experience. With their acceptance came a larger vision of the purpose of life and a remembrance of the covenants that were in place. Though still filled with anguish from their sudden loss, they found themselves standing on a higher plane committed to hold even faster to their covenants and to live such that they might be assured of a joyful reunion with their son.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p23\" class=\"\">In this dispensation, covenant making has taken on a new perspective different from the days of Noah. We are not only responsible to make covenants for ourselves, but additionally we have been given the responsibility to search out our kindred dead and open the door for all who desire to make covenants and worthily receive the gospel ordinances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p24\" class=\"\">The work among those who lived previously is aggressively going forward with the forces of heaven commissioned by the Lord. In President Joseph F.

I can, with some confidence, report there is still available time in many temples to accommodate the counsel of the First Presidency to put aside some of our leisure time and devote more time to performing temple ordinances. I pray that we will be responsive to this invitation to come to the door of the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/gospel-covenants-bring-promised-blessings.p29\" class=\"\">I feel humbled at the opportunity to serve in this trusted calling and pray that I may act upon my covenants with the Lord and be submissive to the direction of the Spirit.

I express my love for the covenants and ordinances of the temple and commit to redouble my effort to participate in these holy houses of God. I know, as we make and keep sacred covenants, the Lord will bring us to His sacred presence.
