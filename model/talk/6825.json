It won\u2019t help anyone if we go over the edge with them, explaining through the roar of the falls all the way down that we really did know the Church was true and that the keys of the priesthood really were lodged there but we just didn\u2019t want to stifle anyone\u2019s freedom to think otherwise. No, we can hardly expect the children to get to shore safely if the parents don\u2019t seem to know where to anchor their own boat.

We can be reasonably active, meeting-going Latter-day Saints, but if we do not live lives of gospel integrity and convey to our children powerful heartfelt convictions regarding the truthfulness of the Restoration and the divine guidance of the Church from the First Vision to this very hour, then those children may, to our regret but not surprise, turn out <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> to be visibly active, meeting-going Latter-day Saints or sometimes anything close to it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-prayer-for-the-children.p16\" class=\"\">Not long ago Sister Holland and I met a fine young man who came in contact with us after he had been roaming around through the occult and sorting through a variety of Eastern religions, all in an attempt to find religious faith.
