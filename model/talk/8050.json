Each presents different challenges. How we learn to adjust to the changes which come along depends on the foundation on which we build. The gospel of our Lord and Savior provides a sure and solid foundation. It is constructed piece by piece as we gain knowledge of the Lord\u2019s eternal plan for His children. The Savior is the Master Teacher. We follow Him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/finding-lasting-peace-and-building-eternal-families.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">The scriptures testify of Him and provide an example of perfect righteousness for us to follow. I have shared with the body of the Church at a previous conference that I have a number of notebooks in which my mother had recorded material she was using to prepare her Relief Society lessons. The notes are as timely today as they were then. One of these was a quote written in 1908 by Charles Edward Jefferson on the character of Jesus Christ.

They come by wire and through the air into the very devices we have developed to educate and entertain us. The wheat and the tares have grown close together. A steward managing the field must, with all his or her power, nourish that which is good and make it so strong and beautiful the tares will have no appeal either to the eye or the ear.

During the course of a year, as we traveled around the Church on our assigned stake conference visits, we became very familiar with the content of the film. We could almost quote it by heart. The message has remained in my mind over all these years. The film was narrated by President Harold\u00a0B. Lee and gave an account of an occurrence in the home of his daughter. It goes something like this:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/finding-lasting-peace-and-building-eternal-families.p40\" class=\"\" id=\"p40\">One evening the mother of the home was frantically trying to finish bottling some fruit. Finally the children were ready for bed and were settled down. It was now time to get to the fruit. As she began to peel and pit the fruit, two little boys appeared in the kitchen and announced that they were ready for their bedtime prayers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/finding-lasting-peace-and-building-eternal-families.p41\" class=\"\" id=\"p41\">Not wanting to be interrupted, the mother said very quickly to the boys, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just say your prayers alone tonight, and Mother will just keep working on the fruit?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/finding-lasting-peace-and-building-eternal-families.p42\" class=\"\" id=\"p42\">The older of the two sons firmly planted his feet and asked, \u201cWhich is the most important, prayers or fruit?\u201d (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Harold\u00a0B.
