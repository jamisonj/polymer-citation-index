Things are happening in the world that are salutary and good. There are wars, yes. There is conflict, yes. But there also is much of peace among the nations of the earth. Something of tremendous significance is happening in the USSR and the People\u2019s Republic of China. There is growing freedom of expression and activity. A new openness is developing. I feel the spirit of Christ is brooding over the nations of the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cOf course there are problems, many and serious. We sorrow over the plague of drugs with its bitter harvest. We deplore the terrible scourge of pornography. We grieve over the wicked flood of immorality and abortion. We are concerned with the epidemic of infidelity, of divorce and broken homes. We are disturbed over the plight of the homeless and over stark hunger in many parts of the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cBut the remarkable thing is that so many people care. More than at any time in the history of the world, I believe, there are men and women by the tens of thousands who are reaching out with their strength and their substance to help those in distress. Modern science and medicine are doing wonders to alleviate pain and prolong life. There is greater fulfillment in the lives of millions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cConcerning our own work\u2014that is, the work of this church\u2014I feel even more optimistic.

I recalled an experience I had in January when I heard President Ronald Reagan give his farewell address to the people of this nation. He spoke of what had been achieved during the eight years of his presidency. As he spoke, I wondered what had happened in the Church during those eight years. I asked our record keepers for some statistics. You may be interested in a few highlights.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p12\" class=\"\">It so happens that during these same eight years I have served as a Counselor in the First Presidency and have had an opportunity to see the picture of the entire Church worldwide in its many activities and ramifications. Remarkable things have happened during this period. I do not speak in any sense of boasting. Nor do I claim any credit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p13\" class=\"\">Yesterday, Brother Michael Watson, secretary to the First Presidency, presented the 1988 statistical report of the Church. Let me draw on that for a moment, using some comparisons.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p14\" class=\"\">At the beginning of 1981, the membership of the Church stood at 4,600,000. At the close of 1988, the membership had reached 6,720,000, an increase of over two million from January 1, 1981, to January 1, 1989. The number of stakes increased during that period from 1,218 to 1,707, or approximately 500. The number of congregations increased from 12,591 to 16,558, or approximately 4,000 new wards and branches. The number of missions grew from 188 to 222. The number of political entities\u2014nations or territories\u2014in which we are working grew from 83 to 125. The number of temples more than doubled, from 19 to 41.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p15\" class=\"\">These are only statistics, but behind all of them are men and women, boys and girls. We are speaking of sons and daughters of God into whose lives has come greater knowledge and into whose hearts has come increased faith in the things of eternity. There has likewise been greatly increased consecration and dedication.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p16\" class=\"\">At the close of 1988, there were 36,132 missionaries in the field or under call. There were likewise thousands of volunteers serving in the Family History program, working in various Church offices, and teaching in our seminary system. The value of their consecrated time would run into the tens of millions of dollars.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p17\" class=\"\">The Church is moving forward because it is true. It is growing because there is a broadening love for that truth. It is growing because of a love for God, a love for the Savior, a love for neighbor, and a strengthening spirit of love in the homes of the people. It is this love which is the great constant in all of our work. It stems from that love which is divine:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29410\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29410)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29410)\">John 3:16<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p19\" class=\"\">I wish to say a few words about that love, that constant, never-failing quality that has the power to lift us above the evil, the conflict, and the trouble of the world in which we live.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p20\" class=\"\">When I was a boy, we lived on a farm in the summer. It was in the country, where the nights were dark. There were no streetlights or anything of the kind. My brother and I slept out-of-doors. On clear nights\u2014and most of those nights were clear and the air was clean\u2014we would lie on our backs and look at the myriads of stars in the heavens. We could identify some of the constellations and other stars as they were illustrated in our encyclopedia. Each night we would trace the Big Dipper, the handle and the cup, to find the North Star.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p21\" class=\"\">We came to know of the constancy of that star. As the earth turned, the others appeared to move through the night. But the North Star held its position in line with the axis of the earth. And so it had come to be known as the Polar Star, or the Polestar, or the Lodestar. Through centuries of time, mariners had used it to guide them in their journeys. They had reckoned their bearings by its constancy, thereby avoiding traveling in circles or in the wrong direction, as they moved across the wide, unmarked seas.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p22\" class=\"\">Because of those boyhood musings, the Polar Star came to mean something to me. I recognized it as a constant in the midst of change. It was something that could always be counted on, something that was dependable, an anchor in what otherwise appeared to be a moving and unstable firmament.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p23\" class=\"\">Love is like the Polar Star. In a changing world, it is a constant. It is of the very essence of the gospel. It is the security of the home. It is the safeguard of community life. It is a beacon of hope in a world of distress.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p24\" class=\"\">Back in 1984 we participated in the dedicatory services of the Sydney Australia Temple. There were many talks and much music and many prayers to open and close the various sessions. I confess I do not remember much of what was said or sung. But I have never forgotten the words spoken by a man who offered one of the opening prayers. He said, \u201cDear Father, we thank Thee that Thou hast loved us.\u201d These words, among the very many heard on those occasions, have fastened themselves upon my mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p25\" class=\"\">Great beyond comprehension is the love of God. He is our loving Eternal Father. Out of His love for us, He has given an eternal plan which, when followed, leads to exaltation in His kingdom. Out of His love for us, He sent His Firstborn into the world, who, out of His own divine love, gave Himself as a sacrifice for each of us. His was an incomparable gift of love to a world that largely spurned Him. He is our great exemplar. We should let love become the lodestar of our lives, with the absolute assurance that, because of the love of God our Eternal Father and His own beloved Son, our salvation from the bonds of death is sure and our opportunity for eternal exaltation is certain. Let that divine love, shed on us, be reflected from our lives onto others of our Father\u2019s children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p26\" class=\"\">As we look across the broad spectrum of humanity at the masses who walk in hunger and poverty and in whose lives are the constant afflictions of disease and misery, let us be generous with our substance to assist. We did a significant thing back in 1985 when we held two special fast days. In a great outpouring of love, our people contributed on those two days more than ten and a half million dollars to help in bridging the gap between life and death for uncounted starving and underprivileged people. The Church continues to have a program, a Hunger Fund, to which we may contribute with love-filled hearts to assist those not of our faith who are in misery in many parts of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p27\" class=\"\">Out of a sense of love for the less fortunate among our own, let us observe the law of the fast, going without a little food\u2014which we do not need\u2014and contributing the value thereof and even more to help those who are in desperate circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p28\" class=\"\">Let love become the lodestar of our lives. Surely we are a blessed people. We are blessed with the good things of earth, and we are blessed with the precious things of heaven. The holy priesthood is among us; its powers extend beyond the veil of death. In the sacred houses which we call temples, there is opportunity to do for others that which they cannot do for themselves. As surely as Christ offered Himself a vicarious sacrifice for <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> mankind, so we can engage in vicarious service in behalf of <span class=\"emphasis\">some<\/span> of mankind, thus affording them the opportunity to move forward on the road of immortality and eternal life. Great is this work of love which goes on in these holy houses. Legion are the men and women who, with total unselfishness, labor day and night in this work which speaks of divinity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/let-love-be-the-lodestar-of-your-life.p29\" class=\"\">Let love be the Polar Star of our lives in reaching out to those who need our strength.
