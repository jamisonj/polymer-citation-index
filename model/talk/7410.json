Her service and teachings as well as those of her counselors have blessed all of us. About this same hour 18 1\/2 years ago, I was standing near this pulpit waiting for the congregational singing to end, when I was to step forward and give my first general conference address. My anxiety at that moment must have been obvious. Elder L. Tom Perry, who was standing behind me, leaned forward and, in his positive and enthusiastic way, whispered in my ear. \u201cRelax,\u201d he said, \u201cwe haven\u2019t lost anyone at that pulpit in years!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remember-and-perish-not.p6\" class=\"\">Those encouraging words and the few minutes that followed in which I spoke for the first time to a worldwide audience of Latter-day Saints constitute a treasured memory for me. Like all of you, I am constantly accumulating a reservoir of memories which, when recalled, make up a very useful and often enjoyable part of my consciousness. And, despite resolutions I made as a young man never to weary others with reminiscing when I grew older, I now take great pleasure in sharing my own memories at almost every possible occasion. Today, however, I wish to speak of a more profound role of memory and remembering in the gospel of Jesus Christ than the passive recall and enjoyment of information.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remember-and-perish-not.p7\" class=\"\">If we pay close attention to the uses of the word <span class=\"emphasis\">remember<\/span> in the holy scriptures, we will recognize that remembering in the way God intends is a fundamental and saving principle of the gospel. This is so because prophetic admonitions to remember are frequently calls to action: to listen, to see, to do, to obey, to repent.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-00605_000_016\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"50249\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50249)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50249)\">2 Nephi 1:12<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"50278\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50278)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50278)\">Mosiah 6:3<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"50326\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50326)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50326)\">Helaman 5:14<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> When we remember in God\u2019s way, we overcome our human tendency simply to gird for the battle of life and actually engage in the battle itself, doing all in our power to resist temptation and avoid sinning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remember-and-perish-not.p8\" class=\"\">King Benjamin called for such active remembering from his people:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remember-and-perish-not.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remember-and-perish-not.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cBut this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish.

In response, assembled as we are today to remember and rededicate this historic Tabernacle, I suggest that the history of the Church of Jesus Christ and its people deserves our remembrance. The scriptures give the Church\u2019s history high priority. In fact, much of scripture is Church history. On the very day the Church was organized, God commanded Joseph Smith, \u201cBehold, there shall be a record kept among you.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-00605_000_016\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50409\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50409)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50409)\">D&amp;C 21:1<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Joseph acted on this command by appointing Oliver Cowdery, the second elder in the Church and his chief assistant, as the first Church historian. We keep records to help us remember, and a record of the Church\u2019s rise and progress has been kept from Oliver Cowdery\u2019s time to the present day. This extraordinary historical record reminds us that God has again opened the heavens and revealed truths that call our generation to action.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remember-and-perish-not.p12\" class=\"\">Of all that has been collected, preserved, and written by historians over those many years, nothing exemplifies the importance and power of the Church\u2019s history more than Joseph Smith\u2019s simple and honest story of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appearing to him in what our history books now call the First Vision. In words that generations of missionaries have committed to memory and shared with seekers of truth the world over, Joseph describes the miraculous way in which he received an answer to his question posed in prayer of which Church is right:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remember-and-perish-not.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cI saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remember-and-perish-not.p14\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other\u2014<span class=\"emphasis\">This is My Beloved Son.

Hinckley. We love his delightful sense of humor, but his sense of history is equally keen. Inspiring stories and anecdotes from our past punctuate his writings and sermons. As our living prophet, he consciously emphasizes the past and the future to help us live more righteously in the present. Because of his teachings, we understand that remembering enables us to see God\u2019s hand in our past, just as prophecy and faith assure us of God\u2019s hand in our future. President Hinckley reminds us how members of the early Church faced their challenges so we, through the grace of God, can more faithfully face our own. By keeping our past alive, he connects us to the people, places, and events that make up our spiritual heritage and, in so doing, motivates us to greater service, faith, and kindness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remember-and-perish-not.p17\" class=\"\">In an exemplary way President Hinckley also openly shares from his own personal and family histories. Scores of discouraged new missionaries have been comforted to learn that early in his own mission, President Hinckley was also discouraged and admitted as much to his father. He even courageously shared his father\u2019s brief response: \u201cDear Gordon, I have your recent letter. I have only one suggestion: forget yourself and go to work.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-00605_000_016\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[In Gordon B.
