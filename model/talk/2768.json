Many of these great reformers stated that their effort was to reassert the basic Christian teachings of the Bible\u2014but they acknowledged that they possessed no authority to administer the ordinances of the Church, or to reestablish the original church of Jesus Christ.

That restoration began in the United States of America in the 1820s through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who was chosen by the Lord and who, through personal manifestations from heavenly messengers, received pertinent records which contained the authentic record of early American peoples and God\u2019s dealings with them.

Our job is to learn and benefit from the past and to go forward in righteousness, keeping the commandments of God. In this connection the prophet Lehi said, \u201cWherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3953\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3953)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3953)\">2 Ne. 1:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/if-they-will-but-serve-the-god-of-the-land.p46\" class=\"\">As we pray daily to God for guidance, we should all make the same plea as George Washington did in his prayer for our country:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/if-they-will-but-serve-the-god-of-the-land.p47\" class=\"\">\u201cAlmighty God, who has given us this good land for our heritage, we humbly beseech Thee that we may always prove ourselves a people mindful of Thy favor and glad to do Thy will.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/if-they-will-but-serve-the-god-of-the-land.p48\" class=\"\">\u201cBless our land with honorable industry, sound learning and pure manners.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/if-they-will-but-serve-the-god-of-the-land.p49\" class=\"\">\u201cSave us from violence, discord and confusion; from pride and arrogancy, and from every evil way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/if-they-will-but-serve-the-god-of-the-land.p50\" class=\"\">\u201cDefend our liberties, and fashion into one united people the multitudes brought out of many kindreds and tongues.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/if-they-will-but-serve-the-god-of-the-land.p51\" class=\"\">\u201cEndue with the spirit of wisdom those whom in Thy name we entrust the authority of government, that there may be peace and justice at home, and that through obedience to Thy law, we may show forth Thy praise among the nations of the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/if-they-will-but-serve-the-god-of-the-land.p52\" class=\"\">\u201cIn the time of prosperity, fill our hearts with thankfulness, and in the day of trouble, suffer not our trust in Thee to fail.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/if-they-will-but-serve-the-god-of-the-land.p53\" class=\"\">\u201cAll of which we ask through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

Let me reiterate the message left with the Saints nearly sixty years ago at the general conference in April 1917 when Elder Anthony W. Ivins, after discussing religious liberty and the Constitution, said, \u201cI feel authorized to say, here this afternoon, that these liberties which have come to men, both religious and civil, have not been established by the Lord to be destroyed, but that they are here to remain until liberty shall prevail from the rivers to the ends of the earth, until God\u2019s kingdom shall be established among men, and his will done upon earth as it is done in heaven. Until the universal Fatherhood of God, and brotherhood of man shall be recognized, and the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of Christ, who shall reign as Prince of Peace.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Conference Reports,<\/span> April 1917, pp. 54\u201355.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/if-they-will-but-serve-the-god-of-the-land.p56\" class=\"\">And I bear testimony that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> the kingdom of God here upon the earth, with the Lord directing the work through our prophet, President Spencer W.

If you are active members of the Church you will know what they are. If you are not, may I invite you to avail yourselves of the opportunity to investigate and gain a knowledge and testimony for yourselves that the gospel in its fulness has been restored, with the authority to administer the ordinances thereof, and is here upon the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/if-they-will-but-serve-the-god-of-the-land.p57\" class=\"\">Only as we accept and live the teachings of the gospel can the destiny which God planned for America be realized and the world united in peace and brotherhood.
