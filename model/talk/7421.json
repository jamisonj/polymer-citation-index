In the temples of the Lord, couples are married for all eternity. But some marriages do not progress toward that ideal. Because \u201cof the hardness of [our] hearts,\u201d the Lord does not currently enforce the consequences of the celestial standard. He permits divorced persons to marry again without the stain of immorality specified in the higher law.

A married woman fled and obtained a divorce in another country, but her husband, who remained behind, is still married in the eyes of the Philippine law.

A broad-based international study of the levels of happiness before and after \u201cmajor life events\u201d found that, on average, persons are far more successful in recovering their level of happiness after the <span class=\"emphasis\">death<\/span> of a spouse than after a <span class=\"emphasis\">divorce.<\/span><sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-00605_000_027\">3<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[Richard E.

The best way to avoid <span class=\"emphasis\">divorce<\/span> from an unfaithful, abusive, or unsupportive spouse is to avoid <span class=\"emphasis\">marriage<\/span> to such a person. If you wish to marry well, inquire well. Associations through \u201changing out\u201d or exchanging information on the Internet are not a sufficient basis for marriage. There should be dating, followed by careful and thoughtful and thorough courtship. There should be ample opportunities to experience the prospective spouse\u2019s behavior in a variety of circumstances. Fianc\u00e9s should learn everything they can about the families with whom they will soon be joined in marriage. In all of this, we should realize that a good marriage does not require a perfect man or a perfect woman.
