It enlarges by making it possible for priesthood authority and blessings to be available for all of God\u2019s children. It limits by directing who will be given the authority of the priesthood, who will hold its offices, and how its rights and powers will be conferred. For example, a person who holds the priesthood is not able to confer his office or authority on another unless authorized by one who holds the keys. Without that authorization, the ordination would be invalid. This explains why a priesthood holder\u2014regardless of office\u2014cannot ordain a member of his family or administer the sacrament in his own home without authorization from the one who holds the appropriate keys.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-keys-and-authority-of-the-priesthood.p13\" class=\"\">With the exception of the sacred work that sisters do in the temple under the keys held by the temple president, which I will describe hereafter, only one who holds a priesthood office can officiate in a priesthood ordinance.

Finally and most important, I testify of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, whose priesthood this is and whose servants we are, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3> <li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote1-10905_000_31oaks\"><a name=\"1-10905_000_31oaks\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Linda\u00a0K.
