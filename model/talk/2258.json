I thought this might be of interest to the Aaronic Priesthood as well as others. First, I wish to explain how, following the death of the President of the Church, a new president is chosen, ordained, and set apart and the presidency is reorganized, following which they are sustained in a solemn assembly by the quorums of the priesthood and by those members of the Church present at general conference, as they were yesterday, and then by members throughout the Church in their stake conferences. Also, I shall refer to some of the authority, duties, and responsibilities of the President.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p19\" class=\"\">As you all know, three months ago our beloved President Joseph Fielding Smith was called home to his great reward and to other duties. He was certainly a true servant of the Lord and a prophet of God, who from his childhood lived to the best of his ability the teachings of the gospel and kept his covenants. He was a man without guile, and his passing was as near a translation as possible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p20\" class=\"\">The Thursday before his death he gave a powerful address to the seminar of the Regional Representatives and Mission Representatives assembled in Salt Lake City. Sunday, July 2, the day of his death, he attended his Sunday meetings in his ward and participated as usual. He returned home, and after his evening meal he sat in his favorite chair talking to his daughter and quietly passed from mortal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p21\" class=\"\">On the death of the President of the Church the First Presidency is disorganized, and the counselors take their places in the Quorum of the Twelve, which, according to revelation, assumes the responsibility of the presidency of the Church, because they hold the Holy Melchizedek Priesthood and are the next quorum in authority according to the Doctrine and Covenants. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"15970\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15970)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15970)\">D&amp;C 107:23\u201324<\/a><\/span>.) The Church, therefore, is never left without a presidency. The President of the Quorum naturally is the chief or executive officer, and the Twelve continue as the presidency of the Church until such time as the First Presidency is reorganized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p22\" class=\"\">While Joseph the Prophet was President of the Church, the Lord through him bestowed all of the keys of the priesthood upon the Quorum of the Twelve with equal authority with the First Presidency. Therefore, with that authority, following the death of Joseph the Prophet, the Twelve, with Brigham Young as President of the Quorum, presided over the Church for a number of years. Finally they were moved upon by the Holy Spirit to reorganize the First Presidency of the Church with Brigham Young as President and with Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards as his counselors. In reality this organization might have been effected within twenty-four hours after the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p23\" class=\"\">Upon the death of President Young, President John Taylor followed in similar measure the example of his predecessor, and it was some time before the presidency of the Church was reorganized with John Taylor as President, George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith as counselors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p24\" class=\"\">After the death of President Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, President of the Twelve, hesitated and allowed a little time to pass before the presidency was reorganized. When at last he became convinced it was his duty and was necessary in order to carry out the purposes of the Lord, he, with the Twelve, reorganized the presidency of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p25\" class=\"\">At that time he gave a solemn injunction to his fellow servants in relation to this. He desired it understood that in all future times if the President of the Church should die and thereby the First Presidency become disorganized, it would be the duty of the proper authorities of the Church to proceed at once, without any unnecessary delay, to reorganize the First Presidency, which procedure has since been followed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p26\" class=\"\">Therefore, on July 7, 1972, shortly after the passing of President Joseph Fielding Smith, President Lee as President of the Twelve called a meeting of all the Twelve to reorganize the First Presidency of the Church. At this meeting we called upon the Lord in solemn prayer. Then each member of the Twelve, starting with the junior member, was called by the President of the Quorum to express his feelings regarding the matter at hand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p27\" class=\"\">When it became President Kimball\u2019s turn to speak, he, at the conclusion of his remarks, nominated President Harold B. Lee as President of the Church, which motion was duly seconded and put to the Twelve, and carried unanimously. President Lee responded to the nomination and the action of the Twelve, accepting the high and holy calling. He then nominated, for the consideration of the Twelve, N. Eldon Tanner as first counselor and Marion G. Romney as second counselor. This was unanimously approved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p28\" class=\"\">President Spencer W. Kimball as senior member of the Twelve, was nominated and approved as President of the Quorum of the Twelve. Following this, President Kimball joined with other members of the Twelve as they placed their hands upon the head of President Lee and ordained him and set him apart as President of the Church and as Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, and Trustee-in-Trust for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. President Lee then set apart President Tanner and President Romney as his counselors and President Kimball as President of the Twelve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p29\" class=\"\">This being an election year in the United States, these activities point up quite clearly the contrast of choosing the president of the United States and other officials in government, and the way the Lord has directed his church leaders to be chosen and placed in office. I am most thankful unto the Lord for the signal privilege I have had of associating so closely with and laboring under and sustaining three of the prophets of God and to see how the Lord works through them. I humbly pray continually that I may serve in an acceptable manner unto the Lord and to them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p30\" class=\"\">Here I wish to express my deep appreciation and love for President Marion G. Romney. I have learned to love him and President Lee as I have never loved men before. And while I am speaking of love, I should like to express my love for the members of the Council of the Twelve and the other General Authorities, and for all members of the Church. In fact, I have a feeling of love for mankind, and I just hope and pray always that the Lord will make it possible for me to show that love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p31\" class=\"\">President Lee, I am sure, was chosen and foreordained to be a prophet of God and President of the Church. The Lord has certainly prepared him for this high and holy calling by giving him responsibilities in stakes, as director of the welfare program, and for more than thirty years as a member of the Council of the Twelve. President Lee has proven his faithfulness, dedication, and ability, as referred to by Brother Hinckley here tonight and by many of the speakers during our conference thus far. He has been chosen to preside over the Church in one of the most critical periods of time in the history of the world. He is a prophet of God and speaks the will of the Lord. President Joseph Fielding Smith made this astute observation at the solemn assembly where he was sustained as President of the Church:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cI desire to say that no man of himself can lead this church.
