They seem to be the adversary\u2019s prime targets for belittlement and destruction. In a society where marriage is often shunned, parenthood avoided, and families degraded, we have the responsibility to honor our marriages, nurture our children, and fortify our families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/marriage-and-family-our-sacred-responsibility.p6\" class=\"\">Honoring marriage requires that spouses render love, respect, and devotion to one another.

When a husband and a wife understand that the family is ordained of God and that marriage can be filled with promises and blessings extending into the eternities, separation and divorce would seldom be a consideration in the Latter-day Saint home. Couples would realize that the sacred ordinances and covenants made in the house of the Lord provide the means whereby they can return to the presence of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/marriage-and-family-our-sacred-responsibility.p10\" class=\"\">Parents have been given the sacred duty to \u201cbring \u2026 up [children] in the nurture \u2026 of the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43336\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43336)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43336)\">Eph. 6:4<\/a><\/span>). \u201cThe first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife\u201d (\u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Oct. 1998, 24; <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1995, 102).
