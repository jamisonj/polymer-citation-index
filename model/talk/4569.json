Over the past period of time it has been made very evident what I cannot do. Tell me and others in my situation what we can do.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/while-they-are-waiting.p4\" class=\"\">As I try to respond to this sincere plea from a good person, perhaps I am directing my suggestions only to a few, but they are a precious few. I would endeavor to instill hope instead of despair in those who temporarily have lost certain powers and privileges. Some of these people in this category dare not hope anymore for fear of being disappointed. May they and their families be helped with thoughts that will bring action, comfort, and a new sense of self-worth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/while-they-are-waiting.p5\" class=\"\">I recall vividly and with feeling this friend\u2019s additional request, \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me to be patient, loving, sweet, and understanding.

George Bernard Shaw once wrote, \u201cThe worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Devil\u2019s Disciple,<\/span> act 2). Indifference can be one of the most hurtful ways of behavior. Never should we in life allow ourselves to turn away, walk on the other side of the street, and pretend we didn\u2019t see, or prohibit involvement in accepted ways. We need to learn to love everyone, even those who are difficult.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/while-they-are-waiting.p9\" class=\"\">A warm handshake and a friendly smile can be wonderfully healing medicine. Conversely, how unwise we are when we declare, \u201cI\u2019ll never speak to him again.\u201d Never is a long time, and even those who have caused heartache or shame are not beyond ultimate repentance. Sometimes hurts to the heart are more damaging than physical blows. Yes, they may take longer to heal, but they will heal more quickly if we avoid bitterness and anger and practice forgiveness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/while-they-are-waiting.p10\" class=\"\">As we support the efforts of those who are trying to work through their challenges, we should be helpful, and will be if we can extend kindness, compassion, patience, and love.

Some suggestions can be made using two effective words: <span class=\"emphasis\">shun<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">participate.<\/span> <span class=\"emphasis\">Shun<\/span> means to avoid deliberately and especially consistently, to abhor.

Some need a person to listen; some may need a compliment or positive reinforcement. There is strength and satisfaction in becoming involved in family projects. Encourage family love by being approachable even when you feel you have reason to turn away. The first step back in seeking family acceptance is to change oneself for the better. It is true today, true yesterday, and will be true tomorrow that effective leadership can only be administered through love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">6.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"strong\">Participate in Church functions and meetings.<\/span> Accept opportunities to take appropriate assignments when given the opportunity.

When my wife was volunteering as a pink lady at one of our local hospitals, she noticed that some of the doctors in the area would encourage their patients who were depressed, sad, or emotionally ill to join the volunteer organization.
