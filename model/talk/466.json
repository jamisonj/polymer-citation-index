We would not have our\nBible; we would not have our Book of Mormon; and in our own day we would not have the\nDoctrine and Covenants, nor the Pearl of Great Price. You all know how valuable these books\nare, and the Lord preserved them that they might be a benefit to us in learning of His ways\nand in the keeping of His commandments.\n<\/p><p>\nWARD AND STAKE RECORDS\n<\/p><p>\nNow the Church has given instructions that records be kept in every ward and in every stake\nof Zion. We send out the blanks with definite instruction printed upon them as to the nature\nof the information which is to be gathered. We try to make it easy for the clerks. And I want\nto say that it is just as important, ordinarily so at least, to have a good, efficient clerk, as it is\nto have a good efficient president of a stake, one who has the desire and the ability to keep\nthe records.\n<\/p><p>\nThese records should be kept in duplicate and one copy sent in quarterly to the Historian's\nOffice and one filed in the stake. Records should be kept in the wards. The stake clerk should\nkeep a record of all events, taking from the ward records the material that is essential to place\nin the record of the stake.\n<\/p><p>\nAll recorders know, or should know, the nature of the recording that they ought to make.\n<\/p><p>\nHISTORICAL REPORTS\n<\/p><p>\nNow we have had a great deal of difficulty in getting these historical reports. Sixty-three\nstakes and two missions failed to send in reports for 1947 and 1948 and 1949. We have some\nstakes and some missions that have not reported for much longer periods of time, and yet\nthese are quarterly reports. We are under the necessity constantly of sending out letters asking\nfor these historical records to be sent in to us so that they may be filed and preserved\naccording to the commandments of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nCOMPLETENESS AND ACCURACY\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to call attention also, to the fact that, notwithstanding the information we ask for,\nthat many of these reports are not complete. Every name should be written in full. Clerks\nshould be appointed, or historians, in the wards and stakes who can write legibly so that their\nrecords can be read.\n<\/p><p>\nSome of them evidently do not read the instructions that are on these blanks. Many valuable\nmatters pertaining to the records are not included. We would like to call your attention to this.\nWe have been after you and some of you know that we are after you because we are writing\nconstantly, and some of the stakes have been busy and they have gone to work and have\ncomplied, although they have had to go back years to do it.\n<\/p><p>\nUP-TO-DATE RECORDS\n<\/p><p>\nToo many mistakes are made because information is not written at the time.\nEverything should be recorded as nearly at the time of the event as it is possible for it to be. I\nknow from my own experience that I cannot trust to my memory, and when things are\nneglected for any length of time mistakes are bound to enter into the records, in regard to\ncertain incidents and as to the time when matters have been performed.\n<\/p><p>\nNow brethren, will you look into these matters in your stakes and see that this record is kept\nup to date? This is the way we are keeping the record of the Church. It is most valuable; it is\nabsolutely necessary, and we ask you for your help, for your support in these matters, that we\nmay have our records up to date, kept neatly, written in permanent ink, or upon the typewriter\nwith a permanent ribbon, and in a manner that it can be preserved eternally.\n<\/p><p>\nI thank you for the opportunity of presenting this matter to you. May the Lord bless you all, I\npray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
