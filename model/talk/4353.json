We remember the experience of our beloved prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball. As a fourteen-year-old boy, he accepted the challenge of reading the Bible from cover to cover. Most of his reading was done by coal oil light in his attic bedroom. He read every night until he completed the 1,519 pages, which took him approximately a year; but he attained his goal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/to-the-young-women-of-the-church.p19\" class=\"\">Of the four great standard works of the Church\u2014the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price\u2014I would particularly urge you to read again and again the Book of Mormon and ponder and apply its teachings. The Book of Mormon was referred to by the Prophet Joseph Smith as \u201cthe most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man [and woman] would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 4:461).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/to-the-young-women-of-the-church.p20\" class=\"\">Young women, the Book of Mormon will change your life. It will fortify you against the evils of our day. It will bring a spirituality into your life that no other book will. It will be the most important book you will read in preparation for life\u2019s challenges. A young woman who knows and loves the Book of Mormon, who has read it several times, who has an abiding testimony of its truthfulness, and who applies its teachings will be able to stand against the wiles of the devil and will be a mighty tool in the hands of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/to-the-young-women-of-the-church.p21\" class=\"\">Further, I would encourage you, young sisters, as you approach your teenage years, to receive a patriarchal blessing.

Let the young men of your acquaintance know that you expect them to assume their missionary responsibilities, that you personally want them to serve in the mission field, because you know that\u2019s where the Lord wants them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/to-the-young-women-of-the-church.p35\" class=\"\">Avoid steady dating with a young man prior to the time of his mission call. If your relationship with him is more casual, then he can make that decision to serve more easily and also can concentrate his full energies on his missionary work instead of the girlfriend back home. And after he returns honorably from his mission, he will be a better husband and father and priesthood holder, having first served a full-time mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/to-the-young-women-of-the-church.p36\" class=\"\">There is no question that faithful Latter-day Saint young women can have a great impact for good in helping young men to magnify their priesthood and to motivate them to good works and to be their best selves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/to-the-young-women-of-the-church.p37\" class=\"\">Remember, young women, you may also have the opportunity to serve a full-time mission.
