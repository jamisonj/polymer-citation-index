His parents and others have tried to give him guidance with little success. Because of his choices, he has become separated from the truths that would help him. He has not cultivated faith in the Master nor in the power of prayer. His decisions are centered on what could quickly satisfy his cravings. He either ignores problems or lies about them. He has manipulated the generosity of parents and friends to attempt a quick fix to challenges. He does not evaluate the consequences of today\u2019s decisions on tomorrow\u2019s life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/to-be-free-of-heavy-burdens.p7\" class=\"\">As my heart sorrowed for him, I realized he does not see the world as it really is\u2014a place of joy and happiness, of true friendships where faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to His teachings invite the Holy Ghost to prompt correct decisions. He lives in an environment dominated by the influence of Satan. He has not followed sound counsel, because in his world he cannot see how it would possibly work for him. This distorted view of life is reality to him. It was forged as he succumbed to the subtle temptations of \u201cGo ahead. Try it. Nobody will ever know. It\u2019s your life. Live it the way you want to. They can\u2019t force you.

He was carried on the crest of the wave of appetite and passion, oblivious to the consequences until the inevitable crushing encounter with the laws of God occurred. That produced pain, remorse, and regret. Then Satan provided other direction: \u201cThere is no way back. You might as well keep doing what you\u2019ve been doing. It\u2019s hopeless to try to change.\u201d Because of his sins, he cannot see a way out of his failures. He will not see the tools needed for a new life in his current environment. His tragic, confining world has been created by the violation of eternal law, motivated by desire for a quick response.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/to-be-free-of-heavy-burdens.p9\" class=\"\">Do you find yourself in a similar circumstance?

Under the influence of powerful emotions or stimulants you may have periods where there seems to be relief. Yet in the quiet moments of reflection that inevitably come, you realize that your life is not what you want it to be. You may publicly complain that your friends and even the Lord have abandoned you, but in times of sober reflection you realize it is you that have abandoned them. Oh, please, decide now to find the way back to the refreshing peace and joy that can replace the fleeting pleasures of sin and the subsequent agony and emptiness.

It is difficult, but it has an end, a glorious end with peace and refreshing forgiveness and the miracle of a new beginning. Confession of improper acts is an important step but that is not full repentance. Your bishop will carefully explain what you must do. I will mention two aspects of repentance that bring great healing power. One is found in this declaration of the Master:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/to-be-free-of-heavy-burdens.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cFor I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/to-be-free-of-heavy-burdens.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cNevertheless, he that repents and <span class=\"emphasis\">does the commandments of the Lord<\/span> shall be forgiven.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-22911_000_028\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11246\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11246)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11246)\">D&amp;C 1:31\u201332<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/to-be-free-of-heavy-burdens.p17\" class=\"\">That scripture emphasizes that the Lord cannot abide sin but He will forgive the repentant sinner because of His perfect love.
