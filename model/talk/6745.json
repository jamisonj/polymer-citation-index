He overcame death so that we can too. He has prepared a place for us in heaven with our Eternal Father.

She stays away from the evil influence and the unclean thing, and if it encroaches on her territory, she is as a lioness protecting her cubs. A fearless woman of faith has the courage to talk with her children about practices which would destroy them. They not only hear her discuss her commitment, but they see her commitment in her daily living\u2014in the way she dresses, what she reads and watches, how she spends her leisure time, what she loves and laughs at, whom she attracts, and how she acts at all times, in all things, and in all places. She has a certain style of her own that is attractive and joyful and bright and good. Our little girls and our young women can safely trust in her example. We pray that they too will be fearless as they seek out and promote that which is uplifting and happy and decent, for they are our future.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/a-woman-of-faith.p10\" class=\"\">Thank heaven for women of faith in our lives.
