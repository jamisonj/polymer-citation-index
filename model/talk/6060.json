Often others were present with him when revelations were received, and they bore witness of the Spirit and the outward manifestations that were present on these occasions. Typically, they spoke of a whiteness or a brightness that surrounded Joseph. For example, as the 76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants was given, Philo Dibble wrote that Joseph \u201cseemed to be dressed in an element of glorious white, and his face shone as if it were transparent.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-98905_000_016\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cEarly Scenes in Church History,\u201d in <span class=\"emphasis\">Four Faith Promoting Classics,<\/span> (1968), 81.]<\/span><\/sup> And Brigham Young testified that \u201cthose who were acquainted with [Joseph] knew when the Spirit of revelation was upon him, for his countenance wore an expression peculiar to himself while under that influence.

I have often said either Joseph Smith was the Lord\u2019s instrument by which the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness was accomplished, or he was not.

As he and Sidney Rigdon prayed to understand the resurrection of the just and the unjust, this glorious vision\u2014or actually a series of six visions\u2014burst upon them.

Of course, it should be noted that Joseph was instructed not to record everything that he saw in vision.

Anyone who sincerely wants to know can also have these truths confirmed to them by the same power of the Spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/marvelous-are-the-revelations-of-the-lord.p38\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, we need to embrace, study, and appreciate the revealed truths that are ours. We need to declare the gospel generously and kindly to all of our Father\u2019s children, that every soul might walk in the light and the truth of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. May the Lord bless each one of us with increased knowledge and testimony, and may we be open and receptive to the spirit of revelation as it has moved upon our prophets in the past, and as it will yet move upon the prophets in the future, is my humble prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-98905_000_016\"><a name=\"-98905_000_016\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-98905_000_016\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"30765\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30765)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30765)\">JS\u2014H 1:16\u201317<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-98905_000_016\"><a name=\"-98905_000_016\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-98905_000_016\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cEarly Scenes in Church History,\u201d in <span class=\"emphasis\">Four Faith Promoting Classics,<\/span> (1968), 81.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-98905_000_016\"><a name=\"-98905_000_016\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-98905_000_016\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 9:89.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-98905_000_016\"><a name=\"-98905_000_016\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-98905_000_016\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Autobiography of Parley P.
