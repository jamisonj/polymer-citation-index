Hunter, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1949, pp. 65-72<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nIt is indeed a sobering experience, my brethren and sisters, to occupy this position and to look\ninto the faces of this vast multitude of Latter-day Saints who have come here to worship the\nLord. I humbly trust and pray that the Spirit of the Lord will attend me in what I say this\nmorning.\n<\/p><p>\nI, like the other brethren who have spoken, have a testimony of this great work. I appreciate\nthe privilege I have of being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ. It is my one great\ndesire in life to serve the Lord to the best of my ability and always to do what he wants me\nto do.\n<\/p><p>\nIMMORTALITY OF MAN\n<\/p><p>\nDeep in the heart of practically every person who has lived in this world, God has implanted\na hope&mdash;yes, more than that&mdash;even a strong desire, that he will live on after death. The\nimmortality of man is an unusual concept. The study of ancient religions reveals the fact that\nany religion that was popular with its devotees and became a religion of prominence attained\nthat popularity and prominence as a result of assuring its members that following their sojourn\non this earth they would experience a happy, glorious, and blessed immortality. The same fact\nholds true today.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Father Adam and Eve were upon this earth, through his Only Begotten Son, God\nrevealed to them the gospel of Jesus Christ; and as one of the most important doctrines in that\ngospel he gave them the assurance that if they and their posterity would live in accordance\nwith all the teachings, doctrine, and ordinances revealed to them that some day they would be\nable to come back into his presence. There they would not only experience immortality but\nthey would also enjoy the great blessing of eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nThroughout the various ages when God has revealed gospel principles to his holy prophets, he\nhas always given them that one great idea that men will live on throughout the eternities.\n<\/p><p>\nA little over a hundred years ago when the gospel plan of salvation was being restored to the\nProphet Joseph Smith in our dispensation, the various Christian denominations held the\nconcept that men would live on after death, and yet their understanding of the unseen world\nwas very hazy and vague. They had little, if any, information regarding our pre-mortal life,\nand their post-mortal life concepts were very erroneous in many respects. It became necessary,\ntherefore, for our Father in heaven to reveal again to earth an abundance of knowledge\nrelative to the immortality of man and point out the pathway to follow in order to gain eternal\nlife. As a result of God's concern over his children, the Prophet Joseph Smith translated the\nBook of Mormon. It contains much doctrine pertaining especially to post-mortal life. He also\nreceived the wonderful revelations recorded in the D&amp;C. Section seventy-six is the greatest\nrevelation regarding post-mortal life to be found recorded in any book in the world. Joseph\nreceived the Pearl of Great Price in which we find much information on the council of the\ngods and our pre-mortal existence.\n<\/p><p>\nRESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST\n<\/p><p>\nWe not only have the teachings of the prophets and revelation regarding the immortality of\nman, but we have a lot of absolute evidence. The greatest of all evidence that you and I are\nimmortal, that we will live on after we leave this life, is the fact that Jesus Christ, following\nhis crucifixion, rose from the grave. He appeared to many people in and around Jerusalem,\nthereby establishing the fact that he was immortal and extending the promise to humanity that\nas he had risen from the grave so would all men.\n<\/p><p>\nWe read in the book of Matthew that at the time of the Savior's resurrection the graves of\nsaints who had lived godly lives while in mortality were opened, and they appeared to many\npeople in and around Jerusalem (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34316\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34316)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34316)\">Matt. 27:52-53<\/a><\/span>).\nThese saints could have been such characters as Father\nAbraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Noah, and the other holy prophets and their wives who\nbelonged to \"the Church of the Firstborn\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12705\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12705)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12705)\">D&amp;C 93:22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFollowing his resurrection, Jesus Christ also appeared to the Nephites who lived in this land.\nOn one of those occasions he told them to bring their records to him. As he read that record,\nhe asked them if Samuel the Lamanite had not prophesied that when Christ was resurrected\nthe graves of the ancient saints would be opened and that they would appear to these Nephite\npeople. He was informed that such had been the prophecies and that those prophecies have\nbeen fulfilled. Thereupon he instructed the Nephite historian to write that great prophecy and\nits fulfillment in their records (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5491\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5491)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5491)\">3 Ne. 23:6-13<\/a><\/span>)\nin order that you and I in the latter days might know for a\nsurety that we would live on after death; that we are immortal beings as well as mortal.\n<\/p><p>\nLATTER-DAY TESTIMONY\n<\/p><p>\nOver one hundred years ago Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith on several occasions.\nChrist was a resurrected, glorified celestialized God when he made those appearances.\nInterspersed among those visitations, other beings who had lived upon this earth in ancient\ndays appeared to the Prophet Joseph. Such persons as the Angel Moroni, Peter, James, and\nJohn, John the Baptist, Moses, Elias, Elijah, Michael, Raphael, and others visited Joseph\nSmith. Each appearance, of course, added testimony upon testimony regarding the immortality\nof man and the eternal life that the righteous ones who live upon this earth will eventually\nattain.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints we have a rather\ncomprehensive understanding of our pre-mortal life. We are taught that you and I are brothers\nand sisters; in fact, all the men, women, and children who have ever come into this world are\nbrothers and sisters, and they were all sons and daughters of God the Eternal Father and our\nEternal Mother in that celestial spirit realm before we came into mortality. We are taught that\nwe were born into that spirit realm as babies, and that we grew to maturity there, undergoing\nthe various experiences which were there for us prior to our coming to mortality. Also\nthrough revelation we have learned that the gods held a council preparatory to the peopling of\nthis earth in which the plans for mortality were discussed and proclaimed.\n<\/p><p>\nOUR DESTINATION\n<\/p><p>\nProbably of all the human beings who have lived upon this earth, at least a vast majority of\nthem have asked this question of themselves: \"Where do we go when we die?\" I would say to\nall Latter-day Saints on this occasion that the place to which you and I go when we die will\nbe determined, to a great extent, upon how we live while we are here&mdash;I mean our ultimate\ndestination, the goal that we are striving for. We have the true plan of salvation, the gospel of\nJesus Christ, with all the ordinances of the gospel, all the teachings, including the Holy\nPriesthood after the Order of the Son of God. All of these things which are necessary to bring\nus back into the presence of God and exalt us in celestial glory are ours. We know, therefore,\nwhat will be our destination as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints if\nwe will live by every word that comes from the mouth of God. On the other hand, with all\nthe power, priesthood, ordinances, doctrines, opportunities, and blessings that are ours, we\nalso know that if we sin sufficiently, we have the power to condemn ourselves to the greatest\nof depths, even to cast our souls down to hell. The prophets have proclaimed that where much\nis given much is required at our hands.\n<\/p><p>\nTo the Latter-day Saints death is not such a serious thing. It doesn't make a lot of difference\nhow long we live in this world. The thing which is of vital importance, however, to you and\nme is how we live. Are we prepared to meet the. Eternal Father and his Only Begotten Son?\nIf death should come upon us any minute, are we prepared to go into the other world and\neventually come into the celestial kingdom of God? That should be your goal and that should\nbe my goal. We should live such a clean and pure life each day, rendering obedience to all\nthe principles and ordinances of the gospel to such an extent that we would be ready to die\nwhenever death comes upon us.\n<\/p><p>\nSPIRIT WORLD\n<\/p><p>\nEvery person who dies will go into a world known as the spirit world. Those who have lived\nrighteous lives here in mortality will find there a paradise, a heaven, a place of peace, of joy,\nof opportunities, of progression. On the other hand, those who have lived wicked lives will\nfind themselves in the spirit world somewhat as if they were in prison. In fact, the prophets\nspeak of that world as a prison. We read in Second Peter that at the time the Savior's body\nlay in the tomb, his spirit went to the spirit world and opened the doors of the gospel to those\nwho were drowned in the flood at Noah's time\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2239\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2239)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2239)\">1 Pet. 3:18-20<\/a><\/span>).\nThose people had been detained from hearing\nthe gospel, being in prison during that long period of time of more than two thousand years.\n<\/p><p>\nSome people that I have talked to have the concept that when they die that suddenly, their\nsins will all be washed away, and they will become white and glorious, pure and clean, in\nsomewhat of an automatic or miraculous way. Such is not the case. According to the ancient\nprophets, especially the Book of Mormon, sustained by modern revelation, when we die, if we\nare filthy, we are filthy still\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3503\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3503)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3503)\">2 Ne. 9:16<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37954\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37954)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37954)\">Morm. 9:14<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12687\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12687)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12687)\">D&amp;C 88:35,102<\/a><\/span>).\nThe fact that we die doesn't change us one iota. You and I are\ndual personages, possessing a spirit body which dwells in a physical body. Death is the\nseparation of that spiritual body from the physical body. All of our good deeds, our bad\ndeeds; the knowledge we have attained; our habits, our evil and good inclinations, are resident\nin the spirit. The spirit personage contains the personality, or, in other words, the spirit is the\nreal individual. Having an understanding of this doctrine, therefore, we know that when we\ndie we take with us to the other world exactly what we have made of ourselves while living\nin mortality. There is only one way that I know whereby you and I can purify ourselves, and\nthat one way is through repentance. The things that we should repent of here in mortality will\nprobably be easier to repent of now instead of putting them off until we go to the other world\nand have to overcome those handicaps at that time; and so I would say, \"today is the day to\nprepare to meet God. Permit me to quote the words of an ancient Nephite prophet on that\nsubject:\n<\/p><p>\nFor behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this\nlife is the day for men, to perform their labors.\n<\/p><p>\n. . . if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness\nwherein there can be no labor performed\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8885\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8885)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8885)\">Alma 34:32-33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA PROBATIONARY STATE\n<\/p><p>\nEvery person after he or she leaves this life will stay in the spirit world a certain length of\ntime in order to continue to prepare himself to come into the presence of God. In that spirit\nworld there is a lot of activity. The gospel of Jesus Christ is being taught to those who have\nnot received the plan of salvation here in mortality, and especially to those who previously\nhave not had opportunity. When those people in the spirit world have received the gospel, the\ntemple work that mortals do for them consummates the work for their acceptance of Jesus\nChrist and the plan of salvation there in the spirit world. The spirit world, then, is another\nprobationary state in order that the sons and daughters of God who will, might prepare\nthemselves to meet him.\n<\/p><p>\nUNIVERSAL RESURRECTION\n<\/p><p>\nFollowing our sojourn in the spirit world comes the resurrection. There will be a universal\nresurrection of every man, woman, and child. Just as we all die, so must we all rise from the\ngrave. Amulek declared:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . I say unto you that this mortal body is raised to an immortal body, that is from death,\neven from the first death unto life, that they can die no more; their spirits uniting with their\nbodies, never to be divided; thus the whole becoming spiritual and immortal, that they can no\nmore see corruption (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8870\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8870)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8870)\">Alma 11:45<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJesus Christ came into the world and died for the sins of the world. He broke the bands of\ndeath and was resurrected, being the first fruits of the resurrection. He set into operation the\nlaw of resurrection and thereby gave as a free gift to every man, woman, and child,\nresurrection, or, in other words, immortality. Thus we will all, the wicked as well as the\nrighteous, enjoy immortality.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE GREAT JUDGMENT\n<\/p><p>\nFollowing the resurrection comes the great judgment. Every person who has lived and shall\nlive in this world&mdash;every man, woman, and child&mdash;shall stand before the judgment seat\njudgment seat of God to answer for the life he or she lived here in mortality, and also to\nanswer for the life lived in the spirit world.\n<\/p><p>\nAlma, that great Nephite prophet, was preaching this doctrine one day to his people. He\nexplained to them that every man, woman, and child, \"both bond and free . . . both the\nwicked and the righteous\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8869\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8869)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8869)\">Alma 11:44<\/a><\/span>),\nwould be resurrected and required to stand before the judgment\nseat of God. There they would be held accountable for the lives they lived while in mortality,\nfor every act they committed, yea for every word they spoke, and for every thought that they\nthought. You and I are responsible beings, accountable for the things that we think. To quote:\n<\/p><p>\nFor our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we shall not be found\nspotless; and our thoughts will condemn us\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8871\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8871)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8871)\">Alma 12:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAlma also explained on that occasion that God would divide the people into two groups. He\nwould look upon the members of one group and smile. They are the righteous. He would\nproclaim to them that they could enter into his presence. Great would be their joy. And then\nhe would look upon those who composed the other group, and they should be so ashamed\nbecause of the lives they had lived in mortality that they would cry to the mountains to come\ndown and hide them from the presence of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8872\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8872)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8872)\">Alma 12:14-15<\/a><\/span>).\nBut such would not be the case. They would\nhave to stay in his presence while being judged, and every knee would bow and every tongue\nwould confess that he was the Christ; that his judgments were true and just\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40232\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40232)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40232)\">Mosiah 27:31<\/a><\/span>). And then they\nwould hear the voice of God tell them to depart from him because of the sinful lives that they\nhad lived. This is the group spoken of in the scripture, declaring that they would weep and\nwail and gnash their teeth because they had lost the great blessing of celestial and eternal life\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8889\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8889)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8889)\">Alma 40:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHREE DEGREES OF GLORY\n<\/p><p>\nFollowing the judgment, according to modern revelation, a vast majority of the inhabitants of\nthis earth will be assigned to one or another of three kingdoms, worlds, or degrees of glory.\nThese are termed the telestial, the terrestrial, and the celestial. The law by which we are\nquickened at the time of resurrection will determine the world to which we shall be assigned.\nLet us hear the word of the Lord on that subject:\n<\/p><p>\nFor notwithstanding they die, they also shall rise again, a spiritual body.\n<\/p><p>\nThey who are of a celestial spirit shall receive the same body which was a natural body; even\nye shall receive your bodies, and your glory shall be that glory by which your bodies are\nquickened.\n<\/p><p>\nYe who are quickened by a portion of the celestial glory shall then receive of the same, even\na fulness.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd they who are quickened by a portion of the terrestrial glory shall then receive of the\nsame, even a fulness.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd also they who are quickened by a portion of the telestial glory shall then receive of the\nsame, even a fulness.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd they who remain shall also be quickened; nevertheless, they shall return again to their\nown place, to enjoy that which they are willing to receive, because they were not willing to\nenjoy that which they might have received\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12686\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12686)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12686)\">D&amp;C 88:27-32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nCELESTIAL GLORY\n<\/p><p>\nTo the Latter-day Saints our interests lie in the celestial glory. In fact, we don't have much\ninterest in the other two degrees because we are assured through revelation that those who go\nto the celestial degree of glory and receive exaltation are members of the Church of the\nFirstborn (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12671\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12671)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12671)\">D&amp;C 76:54,94<\/a><\/span>)\nwho have lived by every word that has come from the mouth of God, being humble,\nand faithful in all of their activities here in life. We are heirs, therefore, of celestial glory. The\ngateway into celestial glory is faith, repentance, baptism, and confirmation; and then, of\ncourse, as the Saints enter the kingdom of God by compliance with the foregoing\nrequirements, they make their calling and election sure by rendering obedience to all the\nordinances and doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ from day to day throughout the entire\ncourse of this mortal life. These are they who shall dwell in the presence of God.\n<\/p><p>\nEXALTATION\n<\/p><p>\nIn the celestial degree of glory there are three kingdoms or three degrees. The highest of these\nconstitutes those who receive exaltation or eternal life. They are they who live the law of the\npriesthood or the new and everlasting covenant of marriage, known as celestial marriage. The\nLatter-day Saints, as well as the people throughout the various ages of the world who have\nbelonged to the true Church of Jesus Christ, who have been married by the power of the\npriesthood and have obeyed all the priesthood covenants that they have entered into, having\nlived in accordance with all the teachings of the gospel, these are they who shall be exalted in\nthe celestial realm. The Lord has given his law on this doctrine as follows:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the\nnew and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by\nhim who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power and the keys of this priesthood;\n[and if they commit no sin to break that seal]; . . . they shall pass by the angels and the gods,\nwhich are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their\nheads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.\n<\/p><p>\nThen shall they be gods\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12746\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12746)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12746)\">D&amp;C 132:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith explained that this continuation of \"the seeds\" forever and ever,\nmeant the power of procreation; in other words, the power to beget spirit children on the same\nprinciple as we were born to our Heavenly Parents, God the Eternal Father and our Eternal\nMother. Therefore, a man cannot receive the highest exaltation without a woman, his wife,\nnor can a woman be exalted without her husband\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"176\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 176)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(176)\">1 Cor. 11:11<\/a><\/span>).\nThat is the fulness of the gospel of Jesus\nChrist, the plan of salvation. Eternal life is the greatest gift that God has in store for those\nwho love him and keep his commandments\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12596\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12596)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12596)\">D&amp;C 14:7<\/a><\/span>),\nand you and I know how it can be attained.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the celestial degree of glory there are two other divisions. They are occupied by angels of\nGod. These angels are the ones who did not abide by the law of celestial marriage; however;\nthey accepted Christ and lived good lives, but they did not accept all the gospel ordinances.\nThis is the word of the Lord on that subject:\n<\/p><p>\nFor these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain\nseparately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity; and from\nhenceforth are not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12743\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12743)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12743)\">D&amp;C 132:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nETERNAL LIFE\n<\/p><p>\nMy brethren and sisters, where do we go when we die? As Latter-day Saints we hope someday\nto go not only to the celestial degree of glory but also to receive exaltation in his\nkingdom, i.e., to receive eternal life. If we accept all the ordinances of the gospel of Jesus\nChrist and obey all of the teachings of the gospel; if we abide by the law of celestial\nmarriage; if we pay our tithes and offerings to the Lord; if we are clean and pure in thought\nand habit, thereby keeping our bodies as temples of God, clean and pure as he wants us to do;\nif we live virtuously and in every way serve him, then at the great judgment day we will hear\nthe voice of God say to us, words to this effect: \"Well done, my beloved servants. You were\nfaithful in the few, small things that I gave you to do in mortality, you may, therefore, now\ncome into my presence.\" And to continue to paraphrase the D&amp;C, \"Then shall they pass by\nthe angels and gods who are stationed there to their exaltation\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12744\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12744)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12744)\">D&amp;C 132:19<\/a><\/span>), and they shall become priests\nand kings to the Most High God. They shall become as he is.\" In other words, they shall have\neternal life. Then shall the oath and covenant of the priesthood be brought into effect which\nyou and I have made, each of us who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood. All that God has will\nbe ours (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12681\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12681)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12681)\">D&amp;C 84:38<\/a><\/span>).\nHe will share with us.\n<\/p><p>\nMay this be the lot of the Latter-day Saints, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
