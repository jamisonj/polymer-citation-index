Our 13th article of faith says that we believe in being honest and true [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7073\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7073)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7073)\">A of F 1:13<\/a><\/span>].<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/stand-true-and-faithful.p21\" class=\"\">We believe in being true. How very important it is to be true to ourselves. Each of us has a thing we call conscience. We know the difference between right and wrong. We do not have to be instructed concerning what is good and what is evil. I think we know that. We know when we have done the wrong thing, and we suffer pangs of conscience. We know when we have done the right thing, and we experience a sense of happiness. To be true to ourselves means being an example of righteous living in all situations and circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/stand-true-and-faithful.p22\" class=\"\">Being true to ourselves means being honest. It means being honest in school. We cannot afford to cheat or do anything of that kind. Suppose that you needed a life-saving operation. You would not want that operation performed by a surgeon who had cheated in medical school, would you? Of course not. We go to school to learn and to equip ourselves for the work which we will do in the future. It is imperative that we take advantage of the opportunity to learn. The Lord has said concerning us of this Church that He expects us to study and learn. I know of no other church that has scripture instructing its people to pursue secular knowledge as well as spiritual knowledge.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/stand-true-and-faithful.p23\" class=\"\">I urge each of you young women to get all of the schooling you can get. You will need it for the world into which you will move. Life is becoming so exceedingly competitive. Experts say that the average man or woman, during his or her working career, can expect to have at least five different jobs. The world is changing, and it is so very important that we equip ourselves to move with that change. But there is a bright side to all of this. No other generation in all of history has offered women so many opportunities. Your first objective should be a happy marriage, sealed in the temple of the Lord, and followed by the rearing of a good family. Education can better equip you for the realization of those ideals.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/stand-true-and-faithful.p24\" class=\"\">Be honest in your lives. As a Latter-day Saint you cannot do shoplifting or anything of the kind. It was said a long time ago that honesty is the best policy. The finger of the Lord wrote on tablets of stone: \u201cThou shalt not steal. \u2026 Thou shalt not covet\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23060\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23060)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23060)\">Ex. 20:15, 17<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/stand-true-and-faithful.p25\" class=\"\">We must be true to ourselves in matters of personal virtue. You and I as members of this Church cannot become involved in immorality. The Lord has said by way of commandment, \u201cLet virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20651\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20651)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20651)\">D&amp;C 121:45<\/a><\/span>). He is saying to us that we cannot even think about immoral matters. Why? Because evil thoughts lead to evil deeds. Then He has said that if we will let virtue garnish our thoughts, we shall stand with confidence in the presence of God. Think of that. He goes on to say the Holy Ghost shall be our constant companion. Our dominion shall be an everlasting dominion. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20652\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20652)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20652)\">D&amp;C 121:45\u201346<\/a><\/span>.)

We live in a world where temptation is constantly being thrown at us, particularly at you young people. It is on television. It is in magazines. It is in books. It is on videos which are readily available. Stay away from these things. They will only hurt you. When it comes to the moral law, you know what is expected of you. If you find yourself slipping under the pressure of circumstances, discipline yourselves. Stop before it is too late. You will be forever grateful that you did.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/stand-true-and-faithful.p27\" class=\"\">Be true to yourselves and the best you have within you.

Contrary to what you may think, an immoral act of any kind will only lower your self-esteem. Be true to yourselves, and your respect for yourself will increase. Know that yours is a divine birthright. Cultivate a good opinion of yourselves. Others may make cutting remarks concerning you. This is only a sign of their ignorance and not of your qualities. Walk with that dignity which is becoming a young woman who is a daughter of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/stand-true-and-faithful.p29\" class=\"\">Do not become involved in illegal drugs.

The use of illegal drugs could place a terrible handicap not only upon you, but also upon your children. I do not hesitate to say that if you tamper with these things, you will regret it.

Regrettably there are a few parents who act in a way that does serious injustice to their children. But these cases are relatively few. No one has a greater interest in your welfare, in your happiness, in your future than do your mothers and fathers. They are of a prior generation. That is true. But they were once the age that you are now. Your problems are not substantially different from what theirs were. If they occasionally place restrictions on you, it is because they see danger down the road. Listen to them. What they ask you to do may not be to your liking. But you will be much happier if you do it. Your mother is your best friend. Never forget that. She gave you life. She cared for you, nurtured you, nursed you when you were sick, and looked after your every need. Listen to her now. Talk with her candidly and confidentially. You will find that she will keep your confidence and that her wisdom will prove to be wonderful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/stand-true-and-faithful.p34\" class=\"\">Many of you are descended from pioneers in this Church.

You, each of you, may have that opportunity of going to the Lord\u2019s holy house, there to be baptized in behalf of someone who is helpless to go forward in the world beyond without the service you can give. That individual might have been a woman of great power and influence when she was upon the earth. But without the ordinance of baptism she is stopped in her eternal progress. Yours is the opportunity to free her. What an unselfish and wonderful thing this is. You, through a little effort, can become the one to unlock the gate which will permit that individual to move forward on the way of immortality and eternal life. There is not another organization in all the world that offers you this opportunity. It affords the means by which to give the most unselfish kind of service.

This work is so much the stronger because of you. Whenever you step over the line in an immoral act or in doing any other evil thing, the Church is that much weaker because of what you have done.

Pray about the situation, talk with your parents if you can, and talk with your bishop. You will find that he will listen and do so with confidentiality. He will help you. We all stand ready to help you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/stand-true-and-faithful.p56\" class=\"\">Repentance is one of the first principles of the gospel.
