My great-grandmother was a ward Relief Society president for 33 years. I have been married to both the stake and ward Relief Society president! Both the same woman! Our eldest daughter now serves as ward Relief Society president. One of our daughters-in-law is a stake Relief Society president. As my dear Ruth faithfully attended Relief Society over the years, our home and family was blessed with more of spirituality and peace. Things seemed to go smoother because of the spiritual enrichment she received. I feel well schooled in the benefits of Relief Society.

But it does include building faith by testimony and example. It includes teaching the doctrines of salvation. It includes following the Savior\u2019s example of love for all mankind. It includes ministering to others, for, as the Prophet Joseph said when the Relief Society was organized, \u201cThis is a charitable Society, and according to your natures; it is natural for females to have feelings of charity and benevolence.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-96911_000_036\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings,<\/span> 226.]<\/span><\/sup> \u201cLet the weight of your innocence, kindness and affection be felt \u2026 ; not war, not jangle, not contradiction, or dispute, but meekness, love, purity\u2014these are the things that should magnify you in the eyes of all good men.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-96911_000_036\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings,<\/span> 227.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-grand-key-words-for-the-relief-society.p10\" class=\"\">This charge to the women of the Church carries a promise.

This gift is unique to your womanhood. Men are not so richly endowed with these gifts. The highest expression of this gift is motherhood, but it is also manifested in many other ways. One of these is the great intuition enjoyed by women. One of our faithful ward Relief Society presidents recalls a prompting she had:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-grand-key-words-for-the-relief-society.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cWhile attending my meetings, I had a strong feeling that I should check on an inactive sister in my ward. My first thought was, \u2018I\u2019m in charge; I can\u2019t leave.\u2019 But then I thought, \u2018What would Christ do?\u2019 Of course He would leave the meeting and go to His lost sheep. So I went. As I arrived at this sister\u2019s home, I told her, \u2018I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here, but are you okay?\u2019 She said she was fine. But I persisted. If the Lord had sent me, I knew I couldn\u2019t just leave.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-grand-key-words-for-the-relief-society.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cShe invited me in, and I found out on that Easter Sunday that her husband had left her earlier that week. Her children had been wondering where their daddy was. And she prayed for help for the first time in a long while. We were then able to get her family involved, and our bishop and his counselor came and helped mend the crisis so that the family got back together again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-grand-key-words-for-the-relief-society.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cThis experience taught me the importance of listening to the Spirit and following the promptings when they come.

One of them was a nearly blind sister who crossed a busy street with a hot dinner on a tray. Another sister volunteered to help clean her apartment. Seeing our friend\u2019s reluctance, she countered, \u201cHow else can I show you that I love you?\u201d Another sister who helped with grocery shopping saw the bright side of our friend\u2019s accident as she pointed out, \u201cThis opportunity has brought us close to each other again!\u201d These sisters all had the vision of the work the Savior had in mind for them to do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-grand-key-words-for-the-relief-society.p17\" class=\"\">Since the very beginning, much of the strength of the Church has come through the service, faith, and devotion of the faithful women of the Church. As the noble daughters of God, the sisters over the years have stood firm and true in the spirit of faith. My wife\u2019s mother, Elizabeth Hamilton Wright, had seven children and was pregnant with her eighth child when her husband was called on a mission. She was left with the responsibility of the family and, with the help of one hired man, seeing that 16 cows were milked every day, that the garden was planted and harvested, the berries picked, and the family taken care of. She was a woman of deep faith and love of the Lord. Her faith never wavered all of the days of her life. It gave her strength to do the work which the Savior had for her to do and to meet the needs of her growing family even in her husband\u2019s absence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-grand-key-words-for-the-relief-society.p18\" class=\"\">Sisters, your counsel and advice and input are needed in the Church. For many years I have been privileged to sit in the Welfare Executive Committee meetings with Sister Elaine Jack and with Sister Jack have enjoyed the presence and contribution of Sister Chieko Okazaki and Sister Aileen Clyde in the General Welfare meetings. Their wisdom is great and their contribution is vital. Their ideas and thoughts are so very much needed and appreciated.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-grand-key-words-for-the-relief-society.p19\" class=\"\">You sisters who sit in the ward and stake councils should feel free to share your special wisdom and experience in those councils.

We are mindful of your many challenges, which are often overwhelming and exhausting in this unsettled world. These challenges come in many forms to each of you. There is usually not enough money to make ends meet. Some sisters struggle with health problems. Some do not have spiritual well-being all of the time. Others are diminished by age or other infirmities. You mothers deal with tremendous challenges in meeting the needs of diverse personalities in your families. This is particularly true of single mothers. Some suffer because of wayward children or grandchildren. Others care for disabled members of the family. Others grieve over losses such as the death of a loved one. Some find themselves in a condition of loneliness. Amidst all of this, constant, subtle voices would divert you from your divine destiny.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-grand-key-words-for-the-relief-society.p21\" class=\"\">Despite all of this, greater blessings are coming to women than ever before. In my lifetime, the drudgery of caring for a home and family has been greatly reduced. I remember my grandmother\u2019s old washboard, which was used to scrub clothes by hand. She cooked hot meals winter and summer on a wood-burning stove. I remember the coming of electricity to our small town and all of the marvelous advantages that it brought. Women now have never had greater opportunities for education and travel. But in the eternal scheme of things, your role is infinitely more vital, and it carries the promise of spiritual blessings greater than these temporal blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-grand-key-words-for-the-relief-society.p22\" class=\"\">Part of the problem is for us to live the eternal principles faithfully every day.

Often they became tired, hungry, or even bored because the meetings were geared to an adult level. Sometimes I wondered if it was worth the effort. I seldom felt spiritually fed because I was trying so hard to help my children be reverent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-grand-key-words-for-the-relief-society.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cLooking back now, I can see that those early Church experiences for my children were the beginnings of a firm foundation upon which they could continue to build. Because they were there each week, they gradually learned the importance of the sacrament; they learned to listen, to be reverent, to recognize the sweet feelings of the Spirit; and their testimonies began to blossom. I recognize that this is a unique and precious time for us when our children are small and need our guidance. Now my children are grown I can clearly see that my constant, repetitive efforts were worthwhile.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-96911_000_036\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[From personal files.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-grand-key-words-for-the-relief-society.p25\" class=\"\">To meet the challenges of the eternal every day, every sister will be strengthened by daily communion with our Heavenly Father through prayer.
