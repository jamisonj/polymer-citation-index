The pioneer theme so dominates the occasion and our thinking that we can\nscarcely be expected to do other than speak about it. So I propose to address myself to the\nsubject, \"What did the pioneers bring?\"\n<\/p><p>\nPURPOSE OF MORMON PIONEERS IN SETTLING THE WEST\n<\/p><p>\nPioneer movements for reclamation of new territory were not uncommon in America a\nhundred years ago. Land was the most commonly accepted form of wealth, and the\navailability of new lands made their quest a dominant pursuit of the people.\nColonization had built America, and the extension of her frontiers was a general enterprise.\n<\/p><p>\nThere were, it is true, many unusual circumstances attending the pioneer settlement which we\nnow commemorate. The distance from established communities covered by the migration and\nthe penetration into unexplored and forbidding country were much greater than those of\naverage advances. The number of people moved and colonized was exceptionally large; the\nterritory sought to be included in the project was vast; the expulsion of the people from their\nhomes and their cruel and intolerant treatment in a free democratic country would serve to\ngive character to this migration. The continued persecution of the people after their settlement\nhere and the adverse attitude of their government were unusual items. All these circumstances\nmight well serve to focus attention upon the pioneer movement of 1847 as being unusual and\ndistinctive among comparable undertakings of frontier peoples of our country; but, in my\nopinion, these conditions, of themselves, do not adequately account for the historical\nplacement of the Mormon colonization of the West in the number one position among all\npioneer movements and conquests in America, certainly from the standpoint of resources\navailable and results achieved.\n<\/p><p>\nTo understand the pioneers and their accomplishments, we must examine their motives.\nHerein we shall find the difference between them and other pioneers and frontiersmen of our\ncountry. They came for freedom and peace as others have done. They came to make homes\nfor themselves as others have done. They came to worship God and practice their religion to\nthe satisfaction of their consciences, as others have done; but here is one thing they came for\nwhich, so far as I know, has no counterpart in any other pioneer movement: They came with\nthe avowed purpose of establishing a society so that they would be able to take back to the\ncivilization from which they had fled, yes, even to their persecutors, the principles of life and\nconduct which were the source of their own inspiration, cohesion, success, and happiness. I do\nnot mean to say that missionary efforts have not been undertaken by other groups, but for\npure Christlike altruism in purpose and deed, I place the founders of this commonwealth on\nthe very summit of all Christian endeavor.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was ingrained in their very beings that their greatest blessings would come in blessing\nothers. They knew they had a message that was a boon to mankind; they knew they were\nunder obligation to propagate that message among the peoples of the world; and they never\nfor one moment lost sight of that obligation and their endeavor to fulfil it. In the processes of\nsubduing a most stubborn country, with all its discouragements, disappointments, and\nexactions of time, energy, patience, and courage, they never ceased to give liberally of their\nhard-earned substance and their limited man power in carrying abroad the\nsacred principles which dominated their lives. The early companies of immigrants in their\nlong marches across the prairies met countermarches of missionaries toiling back over the\nsame hard road they had so recently trod with the same determination, equal expectancy and\nhope, and ofttimes comparable sacrifice as when they undertook the long trek to the West.\nThus the pioneers came and went back as no other people have ever done, and their\ndescendants have kept up the process for a century of time.\n<\/p><p>\nBELIEF IN ANCIENT PROPHECY\n<\/p><p>\nWhat was the compelling force which drove them to such superhuman exertion and such\nwidespread sacrifices? Strange as it may seem, it was their literal acceptance of an ancient\nprophecy revivified by modern revelation:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . It shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house\nshall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the\nhills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come\nye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of\nJacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of\nZion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25048\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25048)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25048)\">Isa. 2:2-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nEvery pioneer believed that prophecy with his whole heart. He saw the vision of its fulfilment\nin all his labors, trials, and privations. He wanted a home with comfort for his family, of\ncourse. He wanted a good society and prosperity, but all these were subordinate to the\nfulfilment of this prophecy&mdash;the establishment of Zion.\n<\/p><p>\nWe all rejoice in the general high esteem accorded Brigham Young as a master colonizer,\nstatesman, and empire builder. He is fully entitled to this acclaim from his fellow men, but\nnot many outside his own followers have understood the real secret of his success. It is true\nthat he was practical, far-sighted, and adept at organization, but those who know the inner\nforces behind his accomplishments will tell you that his power was spiritual, rather than\ntemporal. The unity so essential to the cooperative effort of the people was a spiritual unity,\narising out of a universal conviction of the sacred nature of the cause they espoused and a\ncommon acceptance of the responsibilities it entailed. In all of Brigham Young's work and\nministry there was another in spirit always at his side, always supporting him and inspiring\nhim, whose guidance and direction he ever acknowledged. That was his predecessor, Joseph\nSmith, the earthly founder of the cause he represented, the inspirer of the people through\nwhom their destiny had been revealed. Brigham never forgot and never ignored Joseph;\nneither did the people. They fought with all their strength to carry out the mission he had put\nupon them. That mission was both temporal and spiritual but predominantly spiritual.\n<\/p><p>\nINDUSTRY, EDUCATION, LOYALTY BROUGHT BY THE PIONEERS\n<\/p><p>\nWhat then did the pioneers bring? They brought industry in a measure that has seldom been\nequaled. They taught and practiced the gospel of work as the foundation for success and\nhappiness. That gospel was perhaps more widely accepted in their day than it is today,\nunfortunately. They demonstrated its efficacy, and their demonstration stands today as an\nexample and incentive to the world.\n<\/p><p>\nThey brought education and a love for the artistic and beautiful. Not many of them were\nscholarly. Their opportunities for learning had been very meager, but they had within them an\ninnate yearning for truth, which, after all, is the real basis for education. It was an integral\npart of their conception of the purpose of life to develop intelligence and acquire knowledge.\nIntelligence was invested with the highest possible attributes, proclaimed to be the very glory\nof God (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12384\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12384)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12384)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span>).\nIt was but natural, therefore, that education and its cultural, refining influences should\nreceive their ardent support. The education which they fostered was not narrow and restricted\nas some education is. It was directed toward the acquisition of knowledge in all phases of life\nand the universe; and it did one thing which, unfortunately, modern education does not always\ndo&mdash;it did not subordinate the quality of intelligence essential to comprehend the things of the\nspirit to the order of intelligence necessary for the acquisition of other facts. With this lofty\nconcept of intelligence came a deep-seated love of the beautiful which is the foundation for\ncreative art, as well as for artistic appreciation. This love of beauty did not always find\ntangible expression, but it prompted many worth-while and sometimes outstanding endeavors\nin architecture, music, drama, and other cultural projects. It was undoubtedly this deep love\nfor learning and truth which has been responsible in succeeding generations for the high\nposition our state has attained in the field of literacy and education and in the percentage of\nits population who have won recognition in scientific and other fields of learning. I believe\nthat Utah has been among the foremost, if not first, of all the states in the Union in these\nrespects.\n<\/p><p>\nThey brought with them a high order of loyalty and a great capacity for firm devotion to the\ncause they espoused. We can scarcely estimate what this meant to the success of their\nenterprises. In the main they were rugged individuals, free men, many of whose immediate\nancestors had fought for liberty; yet they were willing and eager to consecrate themselves and\nall they had to the cause which brought them here&mdash;the cause they loved. Theirs was the type\nof unselfish devotion which makes for the success of great causes in the world. Without that\ndevotion no leadership, however competent, could have succeeded.\n<\/p><p>\nWISDOM AN OUTSTANDING QUALITY OF THE PIONEERS\n<\/p><p>\nI come now to the greatest thing of all which the pioneers brought with them, and that I\ncharacterize as wisdom, wisdom about the important things in life. The really vital and\nfundamental aspects of our lives and living may be classified under very few headings. I think\nabout four would be sufficient&mdash;the body, character, the family, and the social order. If\neverything were all right with these four items, the world would be in good order, and\nwisdom about these things is and always has been the greatest need of mankind. The pioneers\nbrought with them this much required wisdom. It was not of their own making. It was given\nto them before they came here. In fact, it was not of any man's making, for it was the\nwisdom of the ages bequeathed to them by Divine Providence.\n<\/p><p>\nFirst, consider the body of man. Everyone wants a sound body. Not all are willing to take the\nsteps to secure it. The pioneers brought a new concept of the body which invested it with\nsacred significance. They taught that the body is the earthly tabernacle wherein the spirit of\nman, the literal child of God, is housed and that the body cannot be defiled or polluted or\notherwise abused by taking into it poisons and deleterious substances without offering affront\nto God whose spirit dwells therein. In this concept infractions of the laws of health are\nattended not only with physical penalties, but with spiritual consequences as well. There is a\ndouble duty to preserve the wholesomeness of the body; and, for guidance in this duty, they\nbrought with them a code of health rules, which, although given more than one hundred years\nago, have had the sanction and the corroboration of scientific researches never even thought\nof at the time of their origin. Here was wisdom about the body, and the contributions coming\nto the people from that wisdom are immeasurable.\n<\/p><p>\nSecond&mdash;character or personality, if you will. I see but little difference. I define character as\nthe sum total of all the attributes incorporated into the structure of a man's life, and the\ncomplexion of his character is determined by the preponderance of good or bad qualities.\nNow the wisdom which came about character was not new. It was very old, but it had a new\nand very special emphasis. It taught not only that man is the child of God, of the most noble\nlineage but that he is destined also, if he lives for it, to be associated with his Heavenly\nFather in carrying forth his eternal works in all time to come. Could there be a higher\nincentive for worthy living and character, with no uncertainty as to the criteria upon which all\nelections and choices should be made? I know of nothing more stimulating to the attainment\nof high character in men and women than a clear concept of their divine origin and eternal\ndestiny.\n<\/p><p>\nNext&mdash;the family. What a world of joy and sorrow and tragedy and bliss that word spells for\nus! It fills the pages of countless books. It is the subject of articles, orations, debates, and\ncontroversies of legislation and judicial decision, and right today I notice a\nmagazine writer who questions the necessity of the institution and mildly predicts its\nextinction in the not-too-distant future. What was the wisdom the pioneers brought about the\nfamily? Why, they invested it with the noblest and most exalted attributes which have ever\ncome to it in all the history of the world. They taught that it is not only a basic unit for happy\nlife and progress here on this earth but that it constitutes also the very foundation of our hope\nfor supreme exaltation in the celestial kingdom of our God. Indeed, the heaven we seek is\nlittle more than the projection of our homes into eternity. How at variance with these lofty\nconcepts of home and family are the tragic evils in domestic life today&mdash;divorce, broken\nhomes, neglected, wayward children more to be pitied than abused because of the\ndisintegration of family life. In my thinking this very disintegration has been responsible in no\nsmall measure for the growth of the disorders and \"isms\" in government and society which\nhave so plagued the world and which today constitute our greatest menace. Oh, if the wisdom\nwhich these humble pioneers brought could only find application in the families of the world\nwhat a boon it would be to the comfort and the happiness and the progress of humanity.\n<\/p><p>\nLastly, the social order by which I mean to include the art of men's living together\ncomfortably and in peace. The wise contribution which the pioneers brought on this altogether\nimportant aspect of life can be told in a single word&mdash;brotherhood. They taught, in the most\nrealistic way, the concept of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and peoples belonging to the\nfamily of God. They taught fraternity but not without paternity. The whole doctrine of\nChristian relationship, altruism, and service may be summed up in the designation, \"my\nbrother,\" \"my sister.\" They believed a hundred years ago that the only substantial hope for\nuniversal peace lay in the extension of this doctrine of brotherhood throughout the world.\nMany others in times gone by and at the present have proclaimed this doctrine. I am grateful\nthat it is so. I hope their proclamation will help, but I confess to some skepticism when I see\nthe reception this doctrine gets. Some months ago I heard an address over the radio from an\neminent divine, the Archbishop of Canterbury, speaking from Philadelphia. Brotherhood and\npeace was his subject. I was pleased to hear him make the declaration that there was little\nchance for the establishment of brotherhood without recognition of the Fatherhood of God. I\nread an account of his speech in the public press the next day after it was given, and a few\nweeks later I read another account of it in a magazine. In neither account was there any\nmention whatever of this declaration which I regarded as the most important and vital thing in\nhis speech. What the world needs for composition of its difficulties and the establishment of a\nlasting peace is not merely a so-called spiritual brotherhood which makes a fine sounding\nphrase, but also a brotherhood of the sons of God in this earth translated in terms of mutual,\npractical helpfulness.\n<\/p><p>\nThat was the wisdom about the social order and peace which the pioneers brought and\ndemonstrated when they came to this land.\n<\/p><p>\nAll of my fellow members of the Church will readily understand that these wise contributions\nof which I speak and many more were but principles of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ\nwhich had been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith but a short time prior to the event\nwhich we commemorate this year. It was because of the pioneers' implicit faith in this\ntranscendent message of life and truth that they established the Lord's house in \"the top of the\nmountains\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25045\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25045)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25045)\">Isa. 2:2<\/a><\/span>).\nIt was a great thing to set up a commonwealth and transform a desert into cities,\ntowns, and villages with the homes, schools, and facilities we now enjoy. It was a vastly\ngreater accomplishment to establish the kingdom of God and send forth from Zion that\nsalutary message of hope and faith and divine, eternal wisdom to all mankind. This was the\nreal heritage our noble pioneers brought with them and left to us and our friends who have\ncome to join us in this lovely land which we call the Zion of our Lord. It is the most precious\ngift in life. God help us to prize it, to live it and to spread it, I humbly pray, in the name of\nJesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
