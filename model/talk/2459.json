The story was titled \u201cThe Evolution of a Delinquent.\u201d After rehearsing the many serious involvements the boy had had with the law, the reporter posed the question, \u201cWhat twisted paths of childhood lead to the tortuous road of delinquency?\u201d Interviews with the boy\u2019s neighbors began to supply at least part of the answer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/mother-catch-the-vision-of-your-call.p4\" class=\"\">One neighbor lady said, \u201cI try not to think of him the way he is now, but how he was when he came to our home and played with our children years ago.\u201d Tears filled her eyes as she recalled one afternoon when the young boy, then a small child, rushed to her home after his father had picked him up at a day nursery. As the little boy held on to her hand, she asked, \u201cWhy do you always come running to our house when you come home from the nursery?\u201d The tot replied sorrowfully, \u201cBecause there is no mommy at my house.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/mother-catch-the-vision-of-your-call.p5\" class=\"\">The woman said that this answer almost broke her heart. There was a mommy at his house and a father also, but many times the children were left at home alone to care for themselves. Often the children would go to the neighbors\u2019 homes because there was not light and companionship at their own home. They were afraid of the dark. This was not just a darkness that fades with the morning sunlight. You see, there is a darkness that comes when there is no mother there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/mother-catch-the-vision-of-your-call.p6\" class=\"\">Throughout my life I have seen the influence for good which dedicated mothers have had in their homes. Because of this, I should like to present my thoughts today in hopes of giving encouragement, strength, and guidance to those of your number who are confused and wondering about the importance of their call in the Lord\u2019s eternal plan.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/mother-catch-the-vision-of-your-call.p7\" class=\"\">President David O. McKay put it beautifully when he said, speaking of mothers, \u201cThis ability and willingness properly to rear children, the gift to love, and eagerness, yes, longing to express it in soul development, make motherhood the noblest office or calling in the world. She who can paint a masterpiece or write a book that will influence millions deserves the admiration and the plaudits of mankind; but she who rears successfully a family of healthy, beautiful sons and daughters, whose influence will be felt through generations to come, whose immortal souls will exert an influence throughout the ages long after paintings shall have faded, and books and statues shall have decayed or shall have been destroyed, deserves the highest honor that man can give, and the choicest blessings of God. In her high duty and service to humanity, endowing with immortality eternal spirits, she is co-partner with the Creator himself.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Ideals,<\/span> Salt Lake City: <span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era, <\/span>1953, pp. 453\u201354.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/mother-catch-the-vision-of-your-call.p8\" class=\"\">One of the great tragedies of our day is the confusion in the minds of some which would cause mothers to go to work in the marketplace. Satan, that master of deceit, would have us believe that when we have problems with our children, the answer may be a nicer home in a finer neighborhood, that they might have their own bedroom, or better quality clothes, and maybe their own car. Satan would have us believe that money or the things money can buy are more important in the home than mother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/mother-catch-the-vision-of-your-call.p9\" class=\"\">Now there are some mothers with school-age children who are the breadwinners of their family and they must work; they are the exception. Fathers and mothers, before you decide you need a second income and that mother must go to work out of the home, may I plead with you: first go to the Lord in prayer and receive his divine approbation. Be sure he says yes. Mothers with children and teenagers at home, before you go out of your homes to work, please <span class=\"emphasis\">count the cost<\/span> as carefully as you count the profit. Earning a few dollars more for luxuries cloaked in the masquerade of necessity\u2014or a so-called opportunity for self-development of talents in the business world, a chance to get away from the mundane responsibilities of the home\u2014these are all satanic substitutes for clear thinking. They are counterfeit thoughts that subvert the responsibilities of motherhood. As you count the costs of mother working out of the home, please consider the following:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/mother-catch-the-vision-of-your-call.p10\" class=\"\">\u2014A mother gone when her children need her most or one who is too tired from a day spent in employment. Far better for a boy or girl to go to school in last year\u2019s shirts or hand-me-down dresses that are clean even though not in the height of fashion and come home to find mother there, than for a boy or girl to go to school in finer and newer clothes and come home to a new TV or a baby-sitter because Mother is away working.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/mother-catch-the-vision-of-your-call.p11\" class=\"\">I like the poem of Esther H.
