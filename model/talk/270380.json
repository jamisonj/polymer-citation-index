C. Hodge returning from Carthage. He reported to Hyrum what he had heard in\n  Carthage, told him what his feelings were and said, &ldquo;Brother Hyrum, you are now clear, and if it was\n  my duty to counsel you, I would say, do not go another foot, for they say they will kill you, if you\n  go to Carthage,&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">3<\/span> but as other persons gathered around, nothing further was said.
