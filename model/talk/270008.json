A number of the brethren, at this conference, arose and stated\n        that they were willing to testify to the world that they knew that the revelations received by the Prophet\n        were of the Lord. In due time the revelations were compiled by the Prophet, and at a conference held\n        November 12, 1831, the revelations were received with thanksgiving. Oliver Cowdery, John Whitmer and\n        William W. Phelps, were appointed to review the revelations for printing, and Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer\n        were appointed to carry them to Missouri where the printing was to be done. These brethren were\n        &ldquo;dedicated and consecrated with the sacred writings and all they have entrusted to their care to the\n        Lord.&rdquo; The publication was commenced by William W. Phelps and Co. in Jackson County, Missouri, but\n        before the work was completed the press and type were destroyed by a mob, July 20, 1833, and only a few of\n        the printed forms were preserved; these were bound and used by those fortunate enough to secure them in the\n        uncompleted condition as the <i>Book of Commandments.<\/i> Later, in the year 1835, the\n        revelations, now greatly increased in number, were again compiled and ordered printed as\n        <i>The Doctrine and Covenants.<\/i> This first edition, prepared under the care of the\n        Prophet Joseph Smith, contained 254 pages and was printed by Frederick G. Williams and Co. in Kirtland, Ohio.\n        The revelations ranged over a period from 1828 to 1834. Seven Lectures on Faith, which had been given before\n        the School of the Elders in Kirtland were also added to the volume, not as revelations, but as stated by the\n        brethren at that time &ldquo;as profitable for doctrine.&rdquo; In this book there also appeared two articles\n        written by Oliver Cowdery, one on <i>Marriage,<\/i> and the other on <i>Governments and\n        Laws in General.<\/i> These were ordered printed in the volume with the revelations, but it should be\n        remembered this was done in the absence and without the approval of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who with\n        President Frederick G. Williams was in Michigan at the time this action was taken. Hence these articles are\n        not, as some have supposed, revelations and were not so considered by the Church. It was on the occasion of\n        the acceptance of the revelations for publication, November 12, 1831, when the Prophet wrote in his journal\n        the comment on the value of the revelations.<\/p>\n    \n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
