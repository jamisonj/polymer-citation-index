[{"Verse":"0","Text":"<i>Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet to Sidney Rigdon, Parley P.  Pratt, and Leman Copley, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 1831. HC 1:167\u2013169.  (Some historical sources give the date of this revelation as May 1831.) Leman Copley had embraced the gospel, but still held to some of the teachings of the Shakers (United Society of Believers in Christ\u2019s Second Appearing) to which he had formerly belonged. Some of the beliefs of the Shakers were that Christ\u2019s second coming had already occurred and he had appeared in the form of a woman, Ann Lee; baptism by water was not considered essential; the eating of pork was specifically forbidden, and many did not eat any meat; and a celibate life was considered higher than marriage. In prefacing this revelation, the Prophet wrote, \u201cIn order to have a more perfect understanding on the subject, I inquired of the Lord, and received the following.\u201d The revelation refuted some of the basic concepts of the Shaker group. The aforementioned brethren took a copy of the revelation to the Shaker community (near Cleveland, Ohio) and read it to them in its entirety, but it was rejected.<\/i>"},{"Verse":"1","Text":"Hearken unto my word, my servants Sidney, and Parley, and Leman;
