I have visited half of the\nstakes of Zion, up to the present time, and should know half of this congregation, but I have\nonly been able to pick out about two dozen faces. As I walk amongst you, if you will just\npunch me one in the ribs I shall know I have been in your town.\n<\/p><p>\nAN INCIDENT ABOUT JUDGE ELIAS A. SMITH\n<\/p><p>\nAs Brother Joseph Fielding spoke yesterday of the sanctity of work, I could not help thinking\nof Judge Elias A. Smith who celebrated his eighty-eighth birthday just about two weeks ago.\nThinking, of course, that a man eighty-eight years of age would be resting in his home, I\nwent over to his place, only to discover that he was at work, about two o'clock in the\nafternoon. So I wended my way down to his office, but he was so busy that he was unable to\nstop to have anyone congratulate him on his eighty-eighth birthday. The following day I met\nhim on the street and said, \"Judge, I went to your home and your office yesterday to wish you\nmany happy returns.\" \"Well,\" he said, \"I am a busy man.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Yes, I noted that. I couldn't get to see you in the office. I thought you would be home. I\ndidn't know you were working.\" \"Why,\" he said, \"working, earning my own way. I am so\nmuch happier doing that than I could possibly be in any other way.\" I wish a lot of folks\ncould follow Judge Elias A. Smith's way of life, and the way of life which our President has\nfollowed. Day before yesterday morning, down in back of the Church Office Building in his\ncar, sick and afflicted, our worthy President sat and signed the letters that he had dictated to\ngo out to different parts of the Church. He isn't too old to work, nor too\nsick, nor feeble to work. God bless him.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE KEEPING OF THE SABBATH\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Mark Petersen brought to my mind the words of our Savior:\n<\/p><p>\nBlessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of\nheaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all\nmanner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad; for great is\nyour reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33946\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33946)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33946)\">Matt. 5:10-12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then our President's message, speaking of the many commandments and reminding us of\nour responsibility as leaders, to keep the commandments of our Heavenly Father, made me\nthink of one commandment especially. As I have traveled about attending your conferences,\nof necessity I have had to travel on Sundays throughout the intermountain states, and I have\nseen men in the fields plowing, and hauling their hay, and putting their grain into the stacks. I\nhave seen lined up on this sacred Sabbath day many people in front of the moving picture\ntheatres waiting to purchase their tickets. I have noted crowds lined up at sporting events,\nbuying their tickets that they might go in and participate in that recreation upon this holy day.\nIt may surprise you when I say that my grandfather, George A. Smith, was one of the first\nmen to break the Sabbath day here in Utah. Being rather a practical sort of man, he felt that it\nwas just as necessary that hunger should be appeased as that we should lift the sheep out of\nthe pit upon the Sabbath day (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"33981\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33981)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33981)\">Matt. 12:11<\/a><\/span>),\nand according to his journal, on July 24th,\n1847, you remember, the Saints came down into the valley. Grandfather's diary records that:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . it was cloudy but quite warm. Potatoes were planted. I planted the first. At about two\no'clock President Brigham Young and his company came up all better. Water was let on the\nground on the twenty-fourth. Toward evening there was a slight shower. Sunday, July 25th, it\nwas clear and warm. Meetings commenced at half past ten. In the morning, I, in company\nwith some others, planted some corn, beans and peas. Meeting again at two p.m. That\nafternoon Brigham Young chastised me, directing that the brethren must not work on Sunday.\nHe said they would lose five times as much as they would gain by it. None were to hunt that\nday, and there should not any man dwell among us who would not observe these rules. They\nmight go and dwell wherever they pleased but they should not dwell amongst us.\n<\/p><p>\nGrandfather must have taken that lesson to heart after he had been plowing and planting seeds\nupon that Sunday morning, for he got into the soul of my father the great ideal that Sunday\nwas the Lord's day, the day that we should observe and rest and refrain from all types of\nwork.\n<\/p><p>\nWhile we had horses and our whitetop, we couldn't use them on the Sabbath\nday. I remember on one occasion when my brother, Winslow, and I went to our father and\nasked him if we might have the whitetop, he said, \"Boys, we must follow so-and-so's\nexample, and you can't take the horses and the wagon out.\" That afternoon we saw\nso-and-so's boys out in their whitetop, so the following Sunday we came to father and said,\n\"Father, may we take the whitetop out today?\" \"What did I tell you last Sunday, boys?\" \n\"Well, you said to follow so-and-so's example, and last Sunday we saw them out in their\nwhitetop.\" Father said, \"Well, we won't follow anybody's example. We will set one of our\nown. You can't have the whitetop.\"\n<\/p><p>\nADVICE FROM CHURCH LEADERS\n<\/p><p>\nSome years later, after Brigham Young had spoken about the Sabbath day he was again called\nupon to speak of it. Apparently they hadn't moved away, those who desired to break the\nSabbath, for he said, \"Now remember, my brethren, those who go skating, buggy riding, or on\nexcursions on the Sabbath day&mdash;and there is a great deal of this practice&mdash;are weak in the faith.\nGradually, little by little, the spirit of their religion leaks out of their hearts, their affections\nand in time they begin to see faults in their brethren, faults in the doctrines of the Church,\nfaults in the organization, and at last they leave the kingdom of God and go to destruction.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe felt very seriously about this subject, as have all of the men who have presided over this\nChurch. All of them have stressed this important matter. I think that perhaps the greatest and\nfinest expression was by President Grant when he said, \"The Lord's day is a holy day and not\na holiday. It has been set apart as a day of rest and worship, and we accept the Lord's day as\nthe first day of the week in accordance with the instructions given by the Prophet Joseph\nSmith. A sacred Sabbath begets reverence for God.\" And how essential that is. \"It is not\npleasing in his sight that the day be given over to pleasure-seeking in places of amusement or\nelsewhere. Sunday Schools and meetings have been so arranged that they meet the\nconvenience of the people and leave a considerable portion of the Sabbath day without\nChurch appointments. We earnestly appeal to the people to keep their appointments faithfully\nand to utilize that part of Sunday not appointed, for meetings in promoting family association\nin the home, with the purpose of stimulating and establishing greater home fealty, a closer\ncompanionship among parents and children; and more intimate relations among all kindred.\nWe believe it is unnecessary for families to go beyond their homes or those of their kindred\nfor the relaxation and associations which are proper for the Sabbath day, and we therefore\ndiscourage more traveling than is necessary for this purpose and attendance upon appointed\nmeetings. Let all unnecessary labor be suspended, and let no encouragement be given by\nmembers of the Church at places of amusement and recreation on the\nSabbath day. If Sunday is spent in our meetings and in our homes, great blessings will come\nto our families and to our communities.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSo I would appeal, my brethren, to you who are the presiding officers in the Church, that in\nyour actions nothing can be laid at your door that would cause anyone to start on that path of\ndesecrating the Sabbath day, and I would bring to your minds that message which was written\nby the finger of God upon tablets of stone:\n<\/p><p>\nRemember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:\nBut the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work,\nthou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor\nthy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea,\nand all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath\nday, and hallowed it (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22558\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22558)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22558)\">Ex. 20:8-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
