When I would go to Grandma and Grandpa Walker\u2019s home, I was greeted in the entry by a framed photo of the First Presidency of the Church. I remember it well. It seemed that they stood as sentinels, greeting all who entered.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/three-presiding-high-priests.p7\" class=\"\">The beautiful color photo was of President George Albert Smith with his counselors J.\u00a0Reuben Clark Jr. and David\u00a0O. McKay. The photo showed them standing together by a large world globe. I loved the picture. They were such handsome and dignified men; I knew them as the prophet of God and his counselors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/three-presiding-high-priests.p8\" class=\"\">That picture hanging in the front foyer of my grandparents\u2019 home had a powerful influence on me. I lived in the small prairie town of Raymond, where my grandparents lived. I could walk to their home, so I visited often. I remember frequently standing quietly alone in the foyer, reverently looking at that picture of the First Presidency. I remember thinking about why my grandparents thought it was so important to honor the First Presidency and have that picture prominently displayed in their home. All who entered would see it. Perhaps most importantly, for their children and grandchildren it was a constant reminder of what was deeply important in the hearts and lives of Grandma and Grandpa.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/three-presiding-high-priests.p9\" class=\"\">Years later I concluded that displaying the picture of the First Presidency was equivalent to Joshua\u2019s beautiful expression: \u201cChoose you this day whom ye will serve; \u2026 as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"51563\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51563)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51563)\">Joshua 24:15<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/three-presiding-high-priests.p10\" class=\"\">All who entered the home of James and Fannye Walker knew that written upon their hearts were the words \u201cAs for us and our house, we will serve the Lord.\u201d As their grandson, I knew it, and I have never forgotten it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/three-presiding-high-priests.p11\" class=\"\">As a boy I didn\u2019t understand so well the significance of there being three in the First Presidency rather than having one President. I knew, of course, that Jesus had selected Peter, James, and John, not just Peter. I knew that my father was one of three men in the bishopric, serving as a counselor to Bishop J.\u00a0O. Hicken. I knew my grandfather was the stake president and that he had two counselors who stood beside him (President John Allen and President Leslie Palmer).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/three-presiding-high-priests.p12\" class=\"\">In every case<span class=\"emphasis\">\u2014a presidency\u2014<\/span>not just consisting of one man as the leader but as three who led together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/three-presiding-high-priests.p13\" class=\"\">In Primary I had learned the Articles of Faith and grew to love them.

He told me I needed to go home and pray about who my counselors should be. He taught me that the Lord would help me decide. He did. I then learned about counselors, and I began to see why the Lord has His Church directed by presidencies, not just presidents. I loved my counselors in the deacons quorum, and we prayed and worked hard to help the boys in our quorum. Bishop Holt taught me the pattern of presidencies and taught me how a presidency should operate and function in the Lord\u2019s Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/three-presiding-high-priests.p25\" class=\"\">When I later served as president of other quorums, I already knew the importance of counselors, and I knew that the Lord would help me choose them\u2014just as my bishop had taught me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/three-presiding-high-priests.p26\" class=\"\">As a deacons quorum president and later as a bishop and stake president, I knew that whatever wisdom, understanding, or capacity I had, it would be magnified considerably when I included my counselors in any decision that needed to be made.
