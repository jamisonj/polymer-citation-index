The ward population was rather transient, which resulted in an accelerated rate of turnover with respect to the teachers in the Sunday School. As boys and girls we would just become acquainted with a particular teacher and grow to appreciate him or her when the Sunday School superintendent would visit the class and introduce a new teacher. Disappointment filled each heart, and a breakdown of discipline resulted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p28\" class=\"\">Prospective teachers, hearing of the unsavory reputation of our particular class, would graciously decline to serve or suggest the possibility of teaching a different class where the students were more manageable. We took delight in our newly found status and determined to live up to the fears of the faculty.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p29\" class=\"\">One Sunday morning, a lovely young lady accompanied the superintendent into the classroom and was presented to us as a teacher who requested the opportunity to teach us. We learned that she had been a missionary and loved young people. Her name was Lucy Gertsch. She was beautiful, soft-spoken, and interested in us. She asked each class member to introduce himself, and then she asked questions which gave her an understanding and insight into the background of each. She told us of her girlhood in Midway, Utah, and as she described that beautiful valley she made its beauty live within us and we desired to visit the green fields she loved so much.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p30\" class=\"\">When Lucy taught, she made the scriptures actually live. We became personally acquainted with Samuel, David, Jacob, Nephi, Joseph Smith, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Our gospel scholarship grew. Our deportment improved. Our love for Lucy Gertsch knew no bounds.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p31\" class=\"\">We undertook a project to save nickels and dimes for what was to be a gigantic Christmas party. Sister Gertsch kept a careful record of our progress. As boys with typical appetites we converted in our minds the monetary totals to cakes, cookies, pies, and ice cream. This was to be a glorious event. Never before had any of our teachers even suggested a social event like this was to be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p32\" class=\"\">The summer months faded into autumn. Autumn turned to winter. Our party goal had been achieved. The class had grown. A good spirit prevailed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p33\" class=\"\">None of us will forget that gray morning when our beloved teacher announced to us that the mother of one of our classmates had passed away. We thought of our own mothers and how much they meant to us. We felt sincere sorrow for Billy Devenport in his great loss.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p34\" class=\"\">The lesson this Sunday was from the book of Acts, chapter 20, verse 35 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43320\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43320)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43320)\">Acts 20:35<\/a><\/span>]: \u201cRemember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.\u201d At the conclusion of the presentation of a well-prepared lesson, Lucy Gertsch commented on the economic situation of Billy\u2019s family. These were Depression times, and money was scarce. With a twinkle in her eyes, she asked: \u201cHow would you like to follow this teaching of our Lord? How would you feel about taking our party fund and, as a class, giving it to the Devenports as an expression of our love?\u201d The decision was unanimous. We counted so carefully each penny and placed the total sum in a large envelope. A beautiful card was purchased and inscribed with our names.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p35\" class=\"\">This simple act of kindness welded us together as one. We learned through our own experience that it is indeed more blessed to give than to receive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p36\" class=\"\">The years have flown. The old chapel is gone, a victim of industrialization. The boys and girls who learned, who laughed, who grew under the direction of that inspired teacher of truth have never forgotten her love or her lessons. Her personal influence for good was contagious.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p37\" class=\"\">A General Authority whose personal influence was felt far and wide was the late President Spencer W.

He really made a difference in the lives of countless individuals.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p38\" class=\"\">When I was a bishop, the telephone rang one day, and the caller identified himself as Elder Spencer W. Kimball. He said, \u201cBishop Monson, in your ward is a trailer court, and in a little trailer in that court\u2014the smallest trailer of all\u2014is a sweet Navajo widow, Margaret Bird. Would you have your Relief Society president visit her and invite her to come to Relief Society and to participate with the sisters?\u201d We did. Margaret Bird came and found a warm welcome.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p39\" class=\"\">Elder Kimball called on another occasion. \u201cBishop Monson,\u201d he said, \u201cI have learned that there are two Samoan boys living in a downtown hotel. They\u2019re going to get in trouble. Will you make them members of your ward?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p40\" class=\"\">I found these two boys at midnight sitting on the steps of the hotel playing ukuleles and singing. They became members of our ward. Eventually, each of them married in the temple and served valiantly. Their influence for good was widespread.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p41\" class=\"\">When I was first called as a bishop, I discovered that our record for subscriptions to the <span class=\"emphasis\">Relief Society Magazine<\/span> in the Sixth-Seventh Ward had been at a low ebb. Prayerfully we analyzed the names of individuals whom we could call to be magazine representative. The inspiration dictated that Elizabeth Keachie should be given the assignment. As her bishop, I approached her with the task. She responded, \u201cBishop Monson, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p42\" class=\"\">Elizabeth Keachie was of Scottish descent, and when she replied, \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d one knew she indeed would. She and her sister-in-law, Helen Ivory\u2014neither more than five feet tall\u2014commenced to walk the ward, house by house, street by street, and block by block. The result was phenomenal. We had more subscriptions to the <span class=\"emphasis\">Relief Society Magazine<\/span> than had been recorded by all the other units of the stake combined.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p43\" class=\"\">I congratulated Elizabeth Keachie one Sunday evening and said to her, \u201cYour task is done.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p44\" class=\"\">She replied, \u201cNot yet, Bishop. There are two square blocks we have not yet covered.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p45\" class=\"\">When she told me which blocks they were, I said, \u201cOh, Sister Keachie, no one lives on those blocks. They are totally industrial.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p46\" class=\"\">\u201cJust the same,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll feel better if Nell and I go and check them ourselves.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p47\" class=\"\">On a rainy day, she and Nell covered those final two blocks. On the first one, she found no home, nor did she on the second. She and Sister Ivory paused, however, at a driveway which was muddy from a recent storm. Sister Keachie gazed about 100 feet (30 m) down the driveway, which was adjacent to a machine shop, and there noticed a garage. This was not a normal garage, however, in that there was a curtain at the window.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p48\" class=\"\">She turned to her companion and said, \u201cNell, shall we go and investigate?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p49\" class=\"\">The two sweet sisters then walked down the muddy driveway 40 feet (12 m) to a point where the entire view of the garage could be seen. Now they noticed a door which had been cut into the side of the garage, which door was unseen from the street. They also noticed that there was a chimney with smoke rising from it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p50\" class=\"\">Elizabeth Keachie knocked at the door. A man 68 years of age, William Ringwood, answered. They then presented their story concerning the need of every home having the <span class=\"emphasis\">Relief Society Magazine.<\/span> William Ringwood replied, \u201cYou\u2019d better ask my father.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p51\" class=\"\">Ninety-four-year-old Charles W.

He subscribed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p52\" class=\"\">Elizabeth Keachie reported to me the presence of these two men in our ward. When I requested their membership certificates from Church headquarters, I received a call from the Membership Department at the Presiding Bishopric\u2019s Office. The clerk said, \u201cAre you sure you have living in your ward Charles W. Ringwood?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p53\" class=\"\">I replied that I did, whereupon she reported that the membership certificate for him had remained in the \u201clost and unknown\u201d file of the Presiding Bishopric\u2019s Office for the previous 16 years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p54\" class=\"\">On Sunday morning Elizabeth Keachie and Nell Ivory brought to our priesthood meeting Charles and William Ringwood. This was the first time they had been inside a chapel for many years. Charles Ringwood was the oldest deacon I had ever met. His son was the oldest male member holding no priesthood I had ever met.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p55\" class=\"\">It became my opportunity to ordain Brother Charles Ringwood a teacher and then a priest and finally an elder. I shall never forget his interview with respect to seeking a temple recommend. He handed me a silver dollar, which he took from an old, worn leather coin purse and said, \u201cThis is my fast offering.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/your-personal-influence.p56\" class=\"\">I said, \u201cBrother Ringwood, you owe no fast offering.
