President John Taylor is quoted as saying:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cFurthermore, I have heard of some Bishops who have been seeking to cover up the iniquities of men; I tell them, in the name of God, they will have to bear them themselves, and meet that judgment; and I tell you that any man who tampers with iniquity, he will have to bear that iniquity, and if any of you want to partake of the sins of men, or uphold them, you will have to bear them. Do you hear it, you Bishops and you Presidents? God will require it at your hands. You are not placed in position to tamper with principles of righteousness, nor to cover up the infamies and corruptions of men.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Conference Report,<\/span> April 1880, p. 78.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p7\" class=\"\">I read further from George Q.

This is as eternal as is the soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p15\" class=\"\">One more thought: The president or the bishop makes the determination, and the counselors or the high council accept his determination or reject it. But they do not vote it in, as you would many ordinary things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p16\" class=\"\">Please remember these things when somebody comes before you who has broken the laws of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p17\" class=\"\">It is so easy to let our sympathies carry us out of proportion; and when a man has committed sin, he must suffer. It is an absolute requirement\u2014not by the bishop\u2014but it is a requirement by nature and by the very part of a man. This discipline is especially applicable to adults and married people and more especially to those who have been to the temple. They must understand that they cannot tamper with the holy laws of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p18\" class=\"\">Another matter that came to my attention the other day is a partial quote from Wilford Woodruff about Joseph Smith. Sometimes we find members who have an overdose of false pride. They want their way or they will quit. Have you ever seen anybody leave the ward and never \u201cdarken the door\u201d of the ward building again because of a little altercation perhaps with the bishop or with someone there?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cWe have no chance to be lifted up in the pride of our hearts,\u201d said the Prophet, \u201cwith regard to the position we occupy. If the President of the Church or either of his counselors or, if the apostles, or any other man, feels in his heart that God cannot do without him, and that he is especially important in order to carry on the work of the Lord, he stands upon slippery ground. I heard Joseph Smith say that Oliver Cowdery who was the second Apostle in this Church, said to him, \u2018If I leave this church, it will fall.\u2019 Said he, \u2018Oliver, you try it.\u2019 Oliver tried it. He fell; but the Kingdom of God did not. I have been acquainted with other Apostles in my day and time who felt that the Lord could not do without them, but the Lord got along with His work without them. I say to all men\u2014Jew and Gentile, great and small, rich and poor\u2014that the Lord Almighty has power within Himself and is not dependent upon any man to carry on His work, but when He does call men to do His work, they have to trust in Him.\u201d (Wilford Woodruff, \u201cDiscourse,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret Weekly,<\/span> Apr. 6, 1890, 40:559\u201360.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p20\" class=\"\">And now, my brethren of the priesthood, there is something very special about meeting together in this priesthood meeting time during each conference when the fathers and the sons are together and come from distances to hear the program of the conference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p21\" class=\"\">I see among you many fine young men and it pleases me greatly to see the budding of those who will before long be the fathers and the leaders, the bishops and the stake presidents, and the missionaries as well, on their way up.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p22\" class=\"\">I realize that before me are hundreds of young men, many of whom are deacons. I remember when I was a deacon. (It has been a long time ago, however.) I thought it was a great honor to be a deacon. My father was always considerate of my responsibilities and always permitted me to take the buggy and horse to gather fast offerings. My responsibility included that part of the town in which I lived, but it was quite a long walk to the homes, and a sack of flour or a bottle of fruit or vegetables or bread became quite heavy as it accumulated. So the buggy was very comfortable and functional. We have changed to cash in later days, but it was commodities in my day. It was a very great honor to do this service for my Heavenly Father; and though times have changed, when money is given generally instead of commodities, it is still a great honor to perform this service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p23\" class=\"\">I am a deacon. I am always proud that I am a deacon. When I see the Apostles march up to the stand in a solemn assembly to bless the sacrament, and others of the General Authorities step up to the sacrament tables to get the bread and the water and humbly pass it to all the people in the assembly and then return their emptied receptacles, I am very proud that I am a deacon, and a teacher, and a priest.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p24\" class=\"\">In our special meetings in the temple, when the Brethren of the General Authorities come up to the sacrament table to bless, then pass, the sacrament, then my heart beats more audibly again and I am grateful that I hold the sacred Aaronic Priesthood and have the privilege of taking care of the sacrament.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p25\" class=\"\">Then I remember it was Jesus Christ himself who broke the bread and blessed it and passed it to his Apostles. Then I am proud that I can do likewise. And I commend to you that which President Tanner has just said, and the other Brethren, about being worthy to pass the sacrament, and being reverent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p26\" class=\"\">For you fathers I should like to quote from an article by Walter MacPeek: \u201cBoys need lots of heroes like Lincoln and Washington. But they also need to have some heroes close by. They need to know some man of towering strength and basic integrity personally. They need to meet him on the street, to hike and camp with him, to see him close to home, every day, down-to-earth situations; to feel close enough to him to ask questions and to talk things over man-to-man with him.\u201d (Source unknown.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p27\" class=\"\">Now I hope that every father provides that kind of closeness to his son.

Your Heavenly Father has helped to provide a world for you and a life for you. It can be a notable one or it can be a casual one. That is up to you, and by the time you are 12 years of age or older, much is expected of you. You are not living in the life of luck; it is a life of pluck, a life of effort and planning. It is said that in the Jewish law a boy of 12 is given nearly adult status. I suppose that is the reason the Lord Jesus Christ remained at the temple when his family took him there, and he talked intelligently with the community leaders and the doctors and the leading people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/to-bear-the-priesthood-worthily.p29\" class=\"\">Now, with such a father who is devoted to his son, it is up to each son to begin to firm up a life that will be pleasing to his Heavenly Father, to his earthly father and mother, and to all the people with whom he comes in contact.

He was only 22 years of age when he received the gold plates and the great responsibility that came with them.
