To consecrate is to set apart or dedicate something as sacred, devoted to holy purposes. True success in this life comes in consecrating our lives\u2014that is, our time and choices\u2014to God\u2019s purposes (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120615\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120615)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120615)\">John 17:1, 4<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120616\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120616)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120616)\">D&amp;C 19:19<\/a><\/span>).

While Jesus is the only one to have led a sinless life, those who come unto Him and take His yoke upon them have claim on His grace, which will make them as He is, guiltless and spotless. With deep love the Lord encourages us in these words: \u201cRepent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120617\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120617)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120617)\">3\u00a0Nephi 27:20<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/reflections-on-a-consecrated-life.p14\" class=\"\">Consecration therefore means repentance. Stubbornness, rebellion, and rationalization must be abandoned, and in their place submission, a desire for correction, and acceptance of all that the Lord may require. This is what King Benjamin called putting off the natural man, yielding to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and becoming \u201ca saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120618\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120618)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120618)\">Mosiah 3:19<\/a><\/span>).

Beginning early in His life, Jesus was about His Father\u2019s business (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120620\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120620)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120620)\">Luke 2:48\u201349<\/a><\/span>). God Himself is glorified by His work of bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of His children (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120621\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120621)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120621)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>). We naturally desire to participate with Him in His work, and in so doing, we ought to recognize that all honest work is the work of God. In the words of Thomas Carlyle: \u201cAll true Work is sacred; in all true Work, were it but true hand-labour, there is something of divineness. Labour, wide as the Earth, has its summit in Heaven.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-09211_000_009\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Thomas Carlyle, <span class=\"emphasis\">Past and Present<\/span> (1843), 251.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/reflections-on-a-consecrated-life.p17\" class=\"\">God has designed this mortal existence to require nearly constant exertion. I recall the Prophet Joseph Smith\u2019s simple statement: \u201cBy continuous labor [we] were enabled to get a comfortable maintenance\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120622\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120622)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120622)\">Joseph Smith\u2014History 1:55<\/a><\/span>). By work we sustain and enrich life. It enables us to survive the disappointments and tragedies of the mortal experience. Hard-earned achievement brings a sense of self-worth. Work builds and refines character, creates beauty, and is the instrument of our service to one another and to God. A consecrated life is filled with work, sometimes repetitive, sometimes menial, sometimes unappreciated but always work that improves, orders, sustains, lifts, ministers, aspires.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/reflections-on-a-consecrated-life.p18\" class=\"\">Having spoken in praise of labor, I must also add a kind word for leisure. Just as honest toil gives rest its sweetness, wholesome recreation is the friend and steadying companion of work. Music, literature, art, dance, drama, athletics\u2014all can provide entertainment to enrich one\u2019s life and further consecrate it. At the same time, it hardly needs to be said that much of what passes for entertainment today is coarse, degrading, violent, mind-numbing, and time wasting. Ironically, it sometimes takes hard work to find wholesome leisure. When entertainment turns from virtue to vice, it becomes a destroyer of the consecrated life. \u201cWherefore, take heed \u2026 that ye do not judge that which is evil to be of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120623\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120623)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120623)\">Moroni 7:14<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/reflections-on-a-consecrated-life.p19\" class=\"\">A consecrated life respects the incomparable gift of one\u2019s physical body, a divine creation in the very image of God. A central purpose of the mortal experience is that each spirit should receive such a body and learn to exercise moral agency in a tabernacle of flesh. A physical body is also essential for exaltation, which comes only in the perfect combination of the physical and the spiritual, as we see in our beloved, resurrected Lord. In this fallen world, some lives will be painfully brief; some bodies will be malformed, broken, or barely adequate to maintain life; yet life will be long enough for each spirit, and each body will qualify for resurrection.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/reflections-on-a-consecrated-life.p20\" class=\"\">Those who believe that our bodies are nothing more than the result of evolutionary chance will feel no accountability to God or anyone else for what they do with or to their body.

They had a generally congenial relationship as business partners, but as they grew older and the next generation began to take part in the business, conflicts emerged. Finally, all parties decided it would be best to divide up the assets and go their separate ways. One of the two original partners devised a stratagem with his lawyers to secure for himself a significant financial advantage in the dissolution at the expense of the other partner and his sons. In a meeting of the parties, one of the sons complained about this unfair treatment and appealed to the honor and Christian beliefs of the first partner. \u201cYou know this is not right,\u201d he said. \u201cHow could you take advantage of someone this way, especially a brother in the same church?\u201d The first partner\u2019s lawyer retorted, \u201cOh, grow up!
