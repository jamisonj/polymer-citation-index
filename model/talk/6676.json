The essence of the story is a demonstration of trust in the promises of the Lord, and a source of joy and certainty for all those who believe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/some-basic-teachings-from-the-history-of-joseph-smith.p5\" class=\"\">I have been able to read it many times and in different circumstances. It impressed me as a child; it was a guide and source of strength when I was a teenager; I shared it with courage and enthusiasm as a young missionary; and even now it continues to fill me with astonishment and a deep sense of gratitude. Since Joseph Smith first recorded it, it remains as a blessing and a gift of faith, a legacy, for the sincere believer; it is an open invitation for those who look for the truth, and a permanent challenge to the unbeliever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/some-basic-teachings-from-the-history-of-joseph-smith.p6\" class=\"\">For those who are not yet members of the Church, I suggest you read the testimony of Joseph Smith with an open mind and real intent.
