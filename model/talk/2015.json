Our commission is to represent him. We are directed to preach his gospel, to perform the ordinances of salvation, to bless mankind, to heal the sick and perhaps perform miracles, to do what he would do if he were personally present\u2014and all this because we hold the holy priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/our-responsibilities-as-priesthood-holders.p8\" class=\"\">As the Lord\u2019s agents we are bound by his law to do what he wants us to do regardless of personal feelings or worldly enticements. Of ourselves we have no message of salvation, no doctrine that must be accepted, no power to baptize or ordain or marry for eternity. All these things come from the Lord, and anything we do with reference to them is the result of delegated authority.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/our-responsibilities-as-priesthood-holders.p9\" class=\"\">When we join the Church and receive the priesthood, we are expected to forsake many of the ways of the world and live as becometh saints. We are no longer to dress or speak or act or even think as others too often do. Many in the world use tea, coffee, tobacco, and liquor, and are involved in the use of drugs. Many profane and are vulgar and indecent, immoral and unclean in their lives, but all these things should be foreign to us. We are the saints of the Most High. We hold the holy priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/our-responsibilities-as-priesthood-holders.p10\" class=\"\">To ancient Israel, by the mouth of Moses, the Lord said: \u201c\u2026 if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/our-responsibilities-as-priesthood-holders.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22825\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22825)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22825)\">Ex. 19:5\u20136<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/our-responsibilities-as-priesthood-holders.p12\" class=\"\">This promise is ours also.
