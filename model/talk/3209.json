I speak particularly to you young men who live in the United States and Canada, the host nations from which the gospel is to go to other nations. While you reap the benefits of prosperity unprecedented in the history of mankind, do you ever think that one of the reasons the Lord sent you to earth under such favorable circumstances is that you could use your talents, education, and money to bless others with the gospel?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/this-is-a-day-of-sacrifice.p27\" class=\"\">Recently, while in South America to dedicate several countries and organize the first stakes in Bolivia and Paraguay, I visited the Missionary Training Center at Sao Paulo, Brazil. I was informed that most native South American young men who come to the training center do so at great sacrifice, having given their life\u2019s savings. Though the Missionary Department recommends that each young man bring at least six white shirts with him, most of these foreign-born missionaries, these sons of Lehi, bring one, possibly two. But they also bring to this service a great commitment and love for the Lord. And their blessings will exceed any sacrifice they have made. We can never get the Lord in debt to us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/this-is-a-day-of-sacrifice.p28\" class=\"\">Young men, this statement by President Kimball should be your personal motto: \u201cEvery LDS male who is worthy and able should fill a mission\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1974, p. 87). We ask you to make the sacrifice. We call it that because of want for a better name for it. It\u2019s an investment. Enlist in this, the greatest service in the world. Do not evade the responsibility. Do not conscientiously object. We invite you to join the army of 28,000 that is swelling in numbers each day. Your job will be to proclaim the message of the Restoration to the world. Know that you have our confidence and love. We expect you to perform that mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/this-is-a-day-of-sacrifice.p29\" class=\"\">Third: <span class=\"emphasis\">To sacrifice, solemnize your marriage in the house of the Lord.<\/span> While in South America, I was touched by the sacrifices made by many of our Saints to have their families sealed to them for eternity. I shed tears of gratitude as I heard some of the experiences recounted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/this-is-a-day-of-sacrifice.p30\" class=\"\">One of our stake presidents brought his family to the Sao Paulo Temple from Lima, Peru, normally a nine-day bus ride, but, because of bus strikes and other problems, the journey took them fourteen days of travel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/this-is-a-day-of-sacrifice.p31\" class=\"\">Upon their arrival at Sao Paulo, the family went to the first session they could, and the sealing ceremony was performed. Then they immediately prepared to leave. The temple president asked them if they were staying the night. The father replied that the family had to leave immediately since they did not have sufficient money for lodging and food. He said they would have to travel several days without food as it was. The family was then persuaded to stay the night and have breakfast before their departure. That represents the spirit of sacrifice of many of our Saints worldwide.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/this-is-a-day-of-sacrifice.p32\" class=\"\">Now, I want to speak frankly to you young men and young women of the Church. When you marry, your decision not only affects you, but your future children and generations after you. Every child born to Latter-day Saint parents deserves to be born <span class=\"emphasis\">under the covenant<\/span> of temple blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/this-is-a-day-of-sacrifice.p33\" class=\"\">May I now tell you about something most sacred? Picture in your mind a small room beautifully adorned\u2014something akin to a lovely living room. In the center is an altar, covered with velvet and lace. Chairs line the walls of the room, where just family and closest friends may observe. With family observing, and a priesthood man of God officiating, you will be asked to kneel at the altar opposite your companion. You will be given instructions, and a benediction will be pronounced upon you. Then you will be sealed together as husband and wife for time and all eternity. You are given the same promise that Adam, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob received. Let me read it to you from the Doctrine and Covenants. Essentially you will receive, as the Lord said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/this-is-a-day-of-sacrifice.p34\" class=\"\">\u201cYe shall come forth in the first resurrection; \u2026 and shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers \u2026 ; [Ye] shall pass by the angels, and the gods, \u2026 to [your] exaltation \u2026 , which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17319\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17319)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17319)\">D&amp;C 132:19<\/a><\/span>).

Obtain the testimony of the truth of these things before a romantic involvement can take root. Covenant with your Heavenly Father that you will do His will.

To most of us, a temple is easily accessible, perhaps so conveniently that the blessing is taken too casually. As with other matters of faithfulness in gospel living, being married the Lord\u2019s way takes a willingness to deny yourself ungodliness\u2014worldliness\u2014and a determination to do our Father\u2019s will. By this act of faith, we show our love to God and our regard for a posterity yet unborn. As our family is our greatest source of joy in this life, so it may well be in the eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/this-is-a-day-of-sacrifice.p38\" class=\"\">Fourth: <span class=\"emphasis\">To sacrifice, serve with your time and means to build the kingdom of God on earth.<\/span> The great law for spiritual happiness and progress was stated by the Master in these words:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/this-is-a-day-of-sacrifice.p39\" class=\"\">\u201cIf any man will come after me, <span class=\"emphasis\">let him deny himself,<\/span> and take up his cross, and follow me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/this-is-a-day-of-sacrifice.p40\" class=\"\">\u201cFor whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36652\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36652)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36652)\">Matt. 16:24\u201325<\/a><\/span>; italics added.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/this-is-a-day-of-sacrifice.p41\" class=\"\">Opportunities to lose oneself for the good of others present themselves daily: the mother who serves her children\u2019s needs; the father who gives his time for their instruction; parents who give up worldly pleasure for quality home life; children who care for their aged parents; home teaching service; visiting teaching; time for compassionate service; giving comfort to those who need strength; serving with diligence in Church callings; community and public service in the interest of preserving our freedoms; financial donations for tithes, fast offerings, support of missionaries, welfare, building and temple projects.
