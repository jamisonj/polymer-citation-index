Do you read them as though you stood in the place of the men who wrote them? If you do not feel thus, it is your privilege to do so, that you may be as familiar with the spirit and meaning of the written word of God as you are with your daily walk and conversation.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> comp.

It is a book of great passion and feeling. Let us take Brigham Young\u2019s advice and imagine we are standing in the place where Moroni, the last of the great Nephite prophets, stood. The assignment his father gave to him to complete the record, which was entrusted to his care, was very difficult. He must have been in a state of shock as he describes the total destruction of his people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/behold-the-lord-hath-shown-unto-me-great-and-marvelous-things.p6\" class=\"\">He must have felt compelled to describe how his people had been hunted by the Lamanites until they were all destroyed. In his feeling of loneliness, he reports that his father was among those who were killed. We sense that the only thing Moroni is living for is to complete the record, as he writes, \u201cTherefore I will write and hide up the records in the earth; and whither I go it mattereth not.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38097\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38097)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38097)\">Morm. 8:4<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/behold-the-lord-hath-shown-unto-me-great-and-marvelous-things.p7\" class=\"\">All he has is the faith that the Lord will preserve him long enough to complete the record and that someday it will be found by one chosen of the Lord. He realizes that the record will be a voice of warning to future generations of what occurs when nations like his own turn away from the teachings of the Lord. It is from the depths of his heart that Moroni cries out to those who will eventually receive the record. He wants to spare those who read his account the heartache and misery which comes from disobedience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/behold-the-lord-hath-shown-unto-me-great-and-marvelous-things.p8\" class=\"\">He writes first to the members of the Church and then to those who have not embraced the gospel of Jesus Christ. Moroni\u2019s last words to the members of the Church are written as a voice of warning. He writes as one who sees the history of his people repeating itself in the future.

They are honoring collective accomplishments, not individual achievements. It is noteworthy of what the citizens of Utah have been able to do together.

As a people, they have demonstrated an ability to overcome much of the divisiveness of special interests, uncontrolled individualism, and selfishness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/behold-the-lord-hath-shown-unto-me-great-and-marvelous-things.p19\" class=\"\">How I wish I could feel comfortable with all this special attention we are receiving.

After warning the believers, he pleads with the unbelievers.
