As Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, it is our duty to be watchmen on the tower, warning Church members to beware of false prophets and false teachers who lie in wait to ensnare and destroy faith and testimony.

Whenever you see a man rise up claiming to have received direct revelation from the Lord to the Church, independent of the order and channel of the Priesthood, you may set him down as an imposter\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Doctrine, <\/span>5th ed.

We often assume that such individuals are associated with small radical groups on the fringes of society. However, I reiterate: there are false prophets and false teachers who have or at least claim to have membership in the Church. There are those who, without authority, claim Church endorsement to their products and practices. Beware of such.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/beware-of-false-prophets-and-false-teachers.p17\" class=\"\">Yesterday, members of the Church sustained the First Presidency and members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators, with Gordon B.

The doctrines of eternal salvation are not unclear or uncertain, but rather they are consistent with revealed truths, both ancient and modern.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/beware-of-false-prophets-and-false-teachers.p19\" class=\"\">President Spencer W.

Beware of those who speak and publish in opposition to God\u2019s true prophets and who actively proselyte others with reckless disregard for the eternal well-being of those whom they seduce. Like Nehor and Korihor in the Book of Mormon, they rely on sophistry to deceive and entice others to their views.

They advocate a redefinition of morality to justify fornication, adultery, and homosexual relationships. Some openly champion the legalization of so-called same-gender marriages. To justify their rejection of God\u2019s immutable laws that protect the family, these false prophets and false teachers even attack the inspired proclamation on the family issued to the world in 1995 by the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/beware-of-false-prophets-and-false-teachers.p27\" class=\"\">Regardless of which particular false doctrines they teach, false prophets and false teachers are an inevitable part of the last days. \u201cFalse prophets,\u201d according to the Prophet Joseph Smith, \u201calways arise to oppose the true prophets\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> sel.
