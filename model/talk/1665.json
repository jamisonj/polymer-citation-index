Sill, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1968, pp. 136-138<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nIn Austria there is an interesting bridge spanning a beautiful river. As one crosses the bridge,\nhe passes 12 statues of Christ spaced a few paces apart. Each of these likenesses represents\nthe Master in his relationship to some occupational or special-interest group. As herders cross\nover this bridge with their flocks, they usually tarry for a few moments before that statue\npicturing Christ as the Good Shepherd. Farmers stop and meditate before the statue depicting\nhim as the sower. Fishermen stand in reverence before the representation of Christ stilling the\ntempest. And those travelers who are sick, either in body or in spirit, bow before the image of\nChrist the healer.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The great teacher<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nA wonderful uplift can come to a worshiper as he rethinks these inspiring thoughts with the\nknowledge that Christ understands his occupational as well as his personal problems. One of\nthe statues on the Austrian bridge represents the Great Teacher. Jesus was the greatest teacher\nbecause he looked with the clearest insight into human lives; and better than anyone else, he\nunderstood the effects of those common everyday events on which our success continues to\nturn. As the Great Teacher, he used the simple experiences of people to illustrate those\nprofound truths which still determine our accomplishment. As George A. Barton says: \n<\/p><p>\n\"He spake of lilies, vines and corn,<br \/>\n     The sparrow and the raven,<br \/>\n     And the words so natural yet so wise<br \/>\n     Were on men's hearts engraven.<br \/>\n     \"And yeast and bread and flax and cloth<br \/>\n     And eggs and fish and candles&mdash;<br \/>\n     See how the most familiar world<br \/>\n     He most divinely handles.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he presented his lessons with as much confidence to the wise men in the temple as to the\nunlearned fishermen working at their nets.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Help for businessman<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow just suppose that as we cross our own bridge of life, we utilize the various\nrepresentations of the Master to inspire us in the places of our own greatest need. A few years\nago an article was written about the Bible as \"The Book That Has Helped Most in Business.\"\nMost of the scientific books written 15 years ago are now out of date. While the Bible was\nwritten when the camel was our most modern means of communication, yet it is still the most\nhelpful book in creating our business success. And in our meditations we ought to stop before\nthe Master to absorb his honesty, his industry, his fairness, and his faith. What an upsurge our\neconomy would receive if we pruned out all of our unrighteousness and fully devoted\nourselves to those goals that he indicated were the most worthwhile.\n<\/p><p>\nBeginning in his youth, Jesus was engaged in that greatest of all enterprises which he\ncharacterized as \"my Father's business\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31731\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31731)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31731)\">Luke 2:49<\/a><\/span>). That is the business of building character, integrity,\nand eternal life into the lives of God's children. As Thomas Carlyle once pointed out, \"A\nman's religion is the most important thing about him. That is what he thinks about and\nbelieves in and works at and fights for and lives by.\" God has invited each of us to have as\nlarge a share as we desire in the affairs of this important family concern. And when we feel a\nlittle bit discouraged and are tempted to do less than our best, we might listen to this young\n\"businessman of the centuries\" as he went around saying to people, \"Be of good cheer.\" \"Be not afraid\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35831\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35831)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35831)\">Matt. 14:27<\/a><\/span>).\n\"Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31753\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31753)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31753)\">Luke 24:38<\/a><\/span>). \"Rejoice and be\nexceedingly glad\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15272\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15272)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15272)\">D&amp;C 128:22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Golden Rule (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35808\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35808)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35808)\">Matt. 7:12<\/a><\/span>), made up of 17 words, is probably the greatest formula for any business\nsuccess that has ever been known in the world. And as we pass along our own bridge of\naccomplishment, we might learn from Jesus about being a more responsible worker, a more\neffective planner, a wiser judge of our human values, and more dependable in our own\nself-discipline. One of the greatest of all business lessons is that \"man does not live by bread\nalone\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35763\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35763)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35763)\">Matt. 4:4<\/a><\/span>). We need a good dose of inspiration occasionally. We need to build up our faith and\nrecharge our love of life. But above all other interests, we need to learn to identify\neffectively. We must remember that we are the children of God, formed in his image,\nendowed with his attributes, and heirs to his glory. And we should be constantly reaffirming\nour destiny through our daily duties.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The great physician<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAs we cross this river of life, we need to stop occasionally before the representation of Christ,\nthe Great Physician. Each of us has an important occupational responsibility for his own\nhealth, and we can perform some of the greatest cures if we understand the possibilities of his\ncommand that says, \"Physician, heal thyself\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31735\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31735)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31735)\">Luke 4:23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe world is presently making itself sick by wrong thinking, and yet there is available to us a\ngreat power that is capable of making us well physically, mentally, morally, and socially.\nJesus gave his greatest success formula in just two words when he said, \"Follow me\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35818\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35818)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35818)\">Matt. 8:22<\/a><\/span>). And if\nwe pause before him long enough and meditate about him effectively enough, we can actually\nfollow him in his faith, in his righteousness, in his doctrines, and in his obedience to God.\n<\/p><p>\nChrist has some higher titles than those of physician or shepherd or businessman. He is also\nthe King of kings, and we must not repeat that ancient mistake when nineteen hundred years\nago one group announced their own downfall by proclaiming: \"We have no king but Caesar\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28477\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28477)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28477)\">John 19:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Christ of the latter days<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTo serve our own best interests we might erect upon the bridge of life a special representation\nto be designated as \"the Christ of the latter days.\" The scriptures tell us a great deal about\nChrist's occupational assignment for the cleansing of the earth, the destruction of the wicked,\nthe universal resurrection, the millennial reign, and the final renewal and glorification of the\nearth. The scriptures make clear that the miracles and wonders of the latter days will be\namong the most important events ever to take place.\n<\/p><p>\nMany people place a very serious handicap upon themselves when they think of Christ only in\nhis ancient settings of sowing and teaching and suffering. For in describing the Christ of the\nlatter days, the scripture says, \"Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the\nway before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the\nmessenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of\nhosts.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is\nlike a refiner's fire and like fuller's soap\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32803\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32803)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32803)\">Mal. 3:1-2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The second coming<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOn our bridge of life there should be a representation of the Christ who will come to cleanse\nthe earth of its sins. This has more than ordinary interest for us, inasmuch as the sins\nmentioned will be our own sins. Someone once painted a famous picture entitled \"Christ\nBefore Pilate.\" It represents Jesus being judged and condemned by the people of the world he\ncame to save. But someday another picture may be painted entitled \"Pilate Before Christ.\"\nThis will involve his second coming, when, with his mighty angels in flaming fire, he will\nreturn to judge the world and take \"vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not\nthe gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5050\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5050)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5050)\">2 Thes. 1:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAbout this event the apostle Paul said, \"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren,\nconcerning them which are asleep. . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For this we say unto you, by the word of the Lord, that . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the\narchangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to\nmeet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2748\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2748)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2748)\">1 Thes. 4:13-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a great day to look forward to, and what a disaster will involve those who are still\nunprepared. Even nineteen hundred years ago Jesus knew a great deal about our personal and\ncommunity needs. He looked forward to our day and was greatly concerned for our welfare.\nHe gave a comparative appraisal of our times when he said, \". . . as the days of [Noah] were,\nso shall also the coming of the Son of man be\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35867\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35867)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35867)\">Matt. 24:37<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Our primary concern<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThen he projected our greatest opportunity when he said, \"And this gospel of the kingdom\nshall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35864\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35864)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35864)\">Matt. 24:14<\/a><\/span>).\nIn the latter-day fulfillment of his own promise he has reestablished his Church\nand has revealed anew a fulness of his original doctrines, including the greatest of all truths,\nthat God lives and that the God of Genesis, the God of Sinai, and the God of Calvary is also\nthe God of the latter days.\n<\/p><p>\nAs we pass along the bridge of our lives, we ought to understand that our greatest latter-day\nneed is not for bigger industries or more oil wells or greater power plants or a more ample\ngold supply. Our most critical problems are not our population explosions or our projected\nfood shortages. Our primary concern should be centered in getting a sufficient love of God\nand truth enshrined in our hearts, that we will obey all of his commandments.\n<\/p><p>\nChrist is the Good Shepherd (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28435\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28435)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28435)\">John 10:14<\/a><\/span>) and the Great Teacher, but he is also the Savior of the\nworld. He is the rock of our eternal salvation. He is the Lord of truth, the Prince of Peace\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25350\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25350)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25350)\">Isa. 9:6<\/a><\/span>), the\nSon of God, and the giver of all good things. We must not forget that he is also the Christ of\nthe latter days, and as we meditate before him, may we be inspired to make the best and the\nmost of that great life which he has given us to live, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
