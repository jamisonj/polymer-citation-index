At that time, I was searching for answers to many questions that confused and troubled my spirit. The principles taught that night contained the answers my wife and I had searched for so anxiously.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-value-of-a-testimony.p4\" class=\"\">Our hearts rejoiced upon hearing the message of the restored gospel. But one special thing deeply affected our souls: the power of the testimonies of two representatives of the Lord. A marvelous feeling that we never before had experienced filled our hearts, certifying the truthfulness of the message. Our first visit to church was an edifying experience because of the Spirit there and the love those people showed us. The spirit of the messages and testimonies was confirmatory evidence that we had found the true church. The support of the missionaries, the successful fellowshipping efforts by the members, and our combined prayers and fasting gradually changed our worldly habits.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-value-of-a-testimony.p5\" class=\"\">With respect and reverence, we attended the meetings and activities, but we postponed baptism because of the fear of negative reactions from our extended families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-value-of-a-testimony.p6\" class=\"\">The events following showed us our complete lack of wisdom, and of this we repented. The district of Rio de Janeiro met in the Tijuca chapel for its quarterly conference. A strong spirit filled the hall from the first chords of the organ prelude.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-value-of-a-testimony.p7\" class=\"\">The inspired messages from the pulpit prepared our hearts for an unforgettable moment. President George A. Oakes of the Brazil North Mission, who presided in the conference, introduced Brother Val Carter, his mission counselor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-value-of-a-testimony.p8\" class=\"\">After quoting selected scriptures, President Carter invited the men to stand and sing \u201cI Need Thee Every Hour.\u201d After sharing his testimony of the mission of our Lord, Jesus Christ, President Carter declared his complete dependence on Christ for salvation and exaltation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-value-of-a-testimony.p9\" class=\"\">That experience deeply touched my heart and all my being. It was not possible to control my emotions. I could not imagine myself in tears, but the tears were indeed real. In that moment, the Holy Ghost reconfirmed the truthfulness of the things we already knew: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was the Lord\u2019s kingdom on earth, the road back to the celestial mansion of our Eternal Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-value-of-a-testimony.p10\" class=\"\">A miracle occurred in that moment, and our fears about baptism vanished. On July 2, 1972, my wife and I and our eldest son, Marcus, entered the fold through the gates of baptism.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-value-of-a-testimony.p11\" class=\"\">Through obedience to the laws of the gospel, fasting, and service, our Heavenly Father blessed us with power to overcome fear, challenges, and eventual adversities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-value-of-a-testimony.p12\" class=\"\">From our extended families, only one of my sisters, Ivette, has accepted the restored gospel and been baptized. Nevertheless, the remainder of the family highly respects the Church. The same miracle happened in our social and professional circles\u2014prejudice and misunderstanding eventually subsided, and some of our best friends have accepted baptism.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-value-of-a-testimony.p13\" class=\"\">To what must we attribute such miracles? To the strength and power of the testimonies of faithful Saints upon which I was temporarily dependent. This influence aroused me intellectually and spiritually, preparing my mind and heart to receive in fulness a personal confirmation of the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-value-of-a-testimony.p14\" class=\"\">But a testimony is not a work that is merely completed and concluded. Indeed, it is a process in continuous development.
