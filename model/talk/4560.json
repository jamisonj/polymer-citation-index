Our pioneer forefathers are good examples. They sang, \u201cGird up your loins; fresh courage take\u201d (\u201cCome, Come, Ye Saints,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 30). They feared no toil and no labor. Among them were Johan Andreas Jensen and his wife, Petra, who left their native Norway in 1863. Their family included six-week-old tiny twin daughters. As handcarts were pulled in their rugged journey, one of those little girls died along the way. The child who survived grew up to become my Grandmother Nelson!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/with-god-nothing-shall-be-impossible.p39\" class=\"\">There are pioneers in the Church today just as strong and courageous. Recently, I interviewed a married couple three days after their release as full-time missionaries in a large metropolis. \u201cWe are converts,\u201d they said. \u201cWe joined the Church ten years ago. Even though we just completed a mission, we want to go again! But this time, we would like to volunteer for a more difficult assignment. We want to teach and serve children of God who live in remote areas of the world!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/with-god-nothing-shall-be-impossible.p40\" class=\"\">As I countered with the grim realities of their request, they continued their expression of commitment. \u201cOur three children and their spouses will assist with our expenses. Two of those couples have joined the Church already, and the third is equally supportive. Please send us among humble people who love the Lord and desire to know that His Church has again been restored to the earth.\u201d Needless to say, their petition was gratefully heard, and now they have received their second call to missionary service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/with-god-nothing-shall-be-impossible.p41\" class=\"\">Strength and courage also characterize another couple. As faithful members of the Church, they had always upheld its doctrines, including the twelfth article of faith. When their country went to war, military conscription called the dutiful husband away from his wife before either had learned she was to bear their child. He was captured by enemy troops and taken as a prisoner of war. Months elapsed. Their baby came. Still no word to know whether the new father was alive. A year after his capture, he was permitted to write to his wife.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/with-god-nothing-shall-be-impossible.p42\" class=\"\">Meanwhile, though countries apart, they each remained faithful to covenants made at baptism. Even though clothed in prisoner\u2019s stripes and able to speak the language of his captors\u2019 country only in a limited way, he became Sunday School superintendent of the branch. He baptized four fellow prisoners during their confinement. Three years after the war ended, he returned home to his wife and a son he had never seen. Later, he served for ten years as the first stake president of his country. Now he is a member of the presidency of one of our temples! His wife stands faithfully beside him in the privilege of that sacred assignment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/with-god-nothing-shall-be-impossible.p43\" class=\"\">You who may be momentarily disheartened, remember, life is not meant to be easy.
