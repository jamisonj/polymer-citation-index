The divine\nwords and teachings of President McKay and all the brethren will remain with us, that we\nmay grow in wisdom and truth.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the brethren have referred to the noble servants who had the revelations of the Lord in the\ndays when the Prophet Joseph Smith lived, I think of an incident that I shall ever hold in my\nheart and mind. Having been called to preside over the Swiss-Austrian Mission many years\nago, I was sent to visit the University of Vienna. I was taken through the library, one of the\nlargest libraries of the world, and the attendant who was escorting me took down a book from\na shelf, and opening it, I read the title of it. It was the <i>Principia<\/i>, written by Sir Isaac Newton\nin the early part of the eighteenth century, and was known as the greatest scientific work of\nthe world. It was written in Latin, the universal language of science at the time, and was the\nmajor guide to the world's scientific thought. \"Newton died in peace,\" says one writer, \"and\nin the knowledge that the fathomless wonders of the universe had been given their shape and\ntheir motion by the sure hand of God.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhile I was looking at the <i>Principia<\/i>, my guide took from the shelf another book, which he\nsaid was a wonderful work of science. It was the volume on mathematics written by Apostle\nOrson Pratt. You may imagine my feelings as I read the title. The volume was published in\nLondon, and was used in the higher institutions of learning in Germany, Austria, and France.\nHere they had placed it at the side of the <i>Principia<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>\nI wish to say a few words of gratitude to President McKay and his counselors, and all the\nbrethren who have spoken to us. In these three days of meetings I am sure everyone feels that\nhe has been encouraged and strengthened by what he has heard. I shall not give to you this\nafternoon any prepared talk but merely express my gratitude for the divine teachings which\nhave come to me as I listened to the words of wisdom and truth.\n<\/p><p>\nAll of us have had our faith renewed, our testimonies strengthened, our spiritual selves\nquickened with divine light. Our paths have been made clearer before us, and we are now\nresolved to serve more diligently our Lord in righteousness. To refer to the beautiful messages\nof our Presidency and others, we believe all that God has revealed, and that he will yet reveal\nmany great and important truths pertaining to the Kingdom of God. The ideals of love, of\ngovernment, of intelligence, have been impressive, and we must contemplate these ideals with\nour best thoughts, each one of us; put them into practice&mdash;our missionaries especially&mdash;and\nour class leaders. Teachers must always remember that in speaking to people, they must\nconvince them that we are interested in the good and mighty things that they believe.\n<\/p><p>\nWe must in words and demeanor show always the dignity and authority of man, and talk of\nthe noble rank he holds among the works of God. We must act in the worthy power of pure\nthought and let our ideals prevail. Let us try more diligently to become cultivated men and\nwomen.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have been told to purify ourselves, to come closer to the perfect ideal which Jesus our\nRedeemer taught. The path is straight before us. We must love God; we must love our\nneighbor (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34808\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34808)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34808)\">Matt. 22:37-39<\/a><\/span>);\nwe must do unto others as we would have them do unto us\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34772\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34772)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34772)\">Matt. 7:12<\/a><\/span>). Our attention has been\ncalled to the Ten Commandments, the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord's Prayer, the birth and\nresurrection of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. We must have faith in mankind, and the divinity\nof man should be made known to our children. We must be more determined than ever to\nfulfil the great task expected of us, to make ourselves better, to make this a better world to\nlive in, and to bring mankind nearer to God. We have been taught that our salvation and the\nsalvation of all mankind is found in the true and everlasting gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Joseph Young, who was for many years President of the First Council of the\nSeventy, was chosen by the Prophet Joseph Smith to this important position. He said on one\noccasion in speaking of the quorums of Seventies: \n<\/p><p>\nThe most effective way to satisfy one's noble impulses is training one's intelligence, to\nhave a deep faith in Almighty God, and develop a love for Truth. We should give\nyears of study of good books, years of devotion in the search for Truth. The Gospel\ndemands this of brethren holding the priesthood of God.\n<\/p><p>\nIn his dedicatory prayer in the Kirtland Temple, we have the words of the Prophet Joseph\nSmith: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the\nbest books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13503\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13503)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13503)\">D&amp;C 88:118<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn this day and age of schools and colleges, what a wonderful saying this is.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us remember the words we have heard at this conference and make them a part of our\nlives, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
