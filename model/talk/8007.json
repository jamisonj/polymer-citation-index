Sure enough, turbulence came. It was really rough. Across the aisle and a couple of rows behind me, a terrified woman panicked. With each frightening drop and jarring bump, she screamed loudly. Her husband tried to comfort her but to no avail. Her hysterical shouts persisted until we passed through that zone of turbulence to a safe landing. During her period of anxiety, I felt sorry for her. Because faith is the antidote for fear, I silently wished that I could have strengthened her faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/let-your-faith-show.p7\" class=\"\">Later, as passengers were leaving the aircraft, this woman\u2019s husband spoke to me.
