It was organized by a prophet of God to help children learn and live the gospel of Jesus Christ with joy. Primary is important, and this will be a wonderful year as we celebrate. Most importantly, we\u2014your parents, leaders, and teachers\u2014honor you, the children. We love you. We rejoice in who you are and who you can become.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/show-you-know.p5\" class=\"\">You are a child of God. You have a loving Heavenly Father who hears and answers your prayers. He wants you to be worthy to return and live with Him someday. Knowing this can help you plan for your earthly and eternal future with a brightness of hope. As you look to the future, look far beyond tomorrow. The scriptures, the teachings of latter-day prophets, and even the Primary songs can help you understand and prepare to reach your eternal potential. Jesus Christ set the example for us of how to live worthy so we may return to the presence of our Heavenly Father. Each of you will have opportunities to learn about Jesus Christ and then follow Him in faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/show-you-know.p6\" class=\"\">We show we know how to follow Him by making and keeping baptismal covenants and by receiving and listening to the Holy Ghost.

At the last meet of the season, John\u2019s relay race was scheduled for Sunday. He remembered a family home evening lesson about making decisions in advance so it would be easier to do the right thing when the time came. John said: \u201cI had made the decision not to swim on Sunday before I joined my team. That made it easier for me to tell the coach that I couldn\u2019t swim the relay. I thought the coach would be mad at me. But at the end-of-the-year banquet, \u2026 he told the team how proud he was of me for having standards and then sticking to them.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-23905_000_043\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[John S.

The most important and sometimes the most difficult place to show kindness is in our own homes, to our parents and to our brothers and sisters.

When no one was looking, he put a bell on a string around his neck and pretended to be a bellboy as he helped with family jobs. When family members noticed things were done, he would just say, \u201cIt must be the bellboy.\u201d Mitch was a great help to us and also brought fun and delight to our family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/show-you-know.p14\" class=\"\">The boys and girls of whom I have spoken show they know by keeping the Sabbath day holy, obeying the Word of Wisdom, being modest in their dress, and being kind to friends and family.
