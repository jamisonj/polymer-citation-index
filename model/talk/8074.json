In the coming week the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles will meet with all the General Authorities and general auxiliary leaders, and the remaining sessions of our worldwide general conference will follow on the coming Saturday and Sunday. I am most grateful to President Thomas\u00a0S.

I am grateful for my grandmother who decades ago decided to take her family to a Mormon sacrament meeting. I am grateful for Sister Ewig, an elderly single German lady, whose name translates into English as \u201cSister Eternal.\u201d She was the one who extended this courageous and wonderful invitation to my grandmother. I am so very grateful for my mother, who led four children through the turmoil of World War II. I think also of my daughter, granddaughters, and future generations of faithful women who will one day follow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/general-womens-session\/living-the-gospel-joyful.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">And, of course, I am eternally grateful to my wife, Harriet, who enchanted me as a teen, bore the heaviest burdens of our young family as a mother, stands with me as a wife, and loves and cherishes our children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. She has been the strength in our home during both good times and bad.

They are divine counsel, based on eternal truths, given to bring \u201cpeace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-10911_000_047\">6<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130458\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130458)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130458)\">Doctrine and Covenants 59:23<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/general-womens-session\/living-the-gospel-joyful.p31\" class=\"\" id=\"p31\">So we have a choice.

Of course, it wasn\u2019t long before her children got sick as well. The task of caring for herself and her little ones alone was almost too much for the young mother. And, as a result, the normally spotless house became cluttered and messy. Dirty dishes piled up in the sink, and laundry piled up everywhere else.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/general-womens-session\/living-the-gospel-joyful.p40\" class=\"\" id=\"p40\">While she was struggling with crying children\u2014and wanting to cry herself\u2014a knock came at the door.

They noticed their sister\u2019s needs and put their many talents and their experience to work. They cleared up the chaos, brought light and clarity into the home, and called a friend to bring over some much-needed groceries.

Do you think your value to Him changes based on how many followers you have on Instagram or Pinterest? Do you think He wants you to worry or get depressed if some un-friend or un-follow you on Facebook or Twitter? Do you think outward attractiveness, your dress size, or popularity make the slightest difference in your worth to the One who created the universe?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/general-womens-session\/living-the-gospel-joyful.p58\" class=\"\" id=\"p58\">He loves you not only for who you are this very day but also for the person of glory and light you have the potential and the desire to become.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/general-womens-session\/living-the-gospel-joyful.p59\" class=\"\" id=\"p59\">More than you could ever imagine, He wants you to achieve your destiny\u2014to return to your heavenly home in honor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/general-womens-session\/living-the-gospel-joyful.p60\" class=\"\" id=\"p60\">I testify that the way to accomplish this is to place selfish desires and unworthy ambitions on the altar of sacrifice and service.
