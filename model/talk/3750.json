We know additional details about the Savior\u2019s role in the premortal existence before we came here: we have new information about His part in the creation of the world under the direction of our Father; we can identify Him as Jehovah of the Old Testament, communicating with the prophets of Israel. We have the Book of Mormon, which is another testament of Jesus Christ, which has great illuminating doctrines and information about the Savior. Our modern prophets have given revealed explanations, doctrines, light, and knowledge on the Christ as the Redeemer to whom we look for the remission of our sins. We have a wealth of information of tremendous value to all Christian churches. We do not diminish or tear down the faith others have in Christ, but seek only to share with them our additional knowledge of the Lamb, the Shepherd, the Holy One of Israel (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"41970\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41970)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41970)\">Ps. 71:22<\/a><\/span>)\u2014for their benefit and salvation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p4\" class=\"\">Like Nephi of old, \u201cwe believe in Christ, we \u2026 look forward with steadfastness unto Christ. \u2026 We are made alive in Christ because of our faith. \u2026 We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ. \u2026 We \u2026 look forward unto that life which is in Christ.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4061\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4061)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4061)\">2 Ne. 25:24\u201327<\/a><\/span>.) Can anyone doubt that we are Christians in the full sense of the word?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p5\" class=\"\">Some time ago, I was on an airplane over the Colombian jungle of South America. I had been telling my seat companion about the Church. At one point in my enthusiastic gospel conversation, my friend commented, \u201cYou Mormons have surely built a magnificent shrine at Joseph Smith\u2019s grave site.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p6\" class=\"\">In surprise, I exclaimed, \u201c<span class=\"emphasis\">What<\/span> shrine\u2014<span class=\"emphasis\">what<\/span> grave site?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p7\" class=\"\">He replied, \u201cWhy that tall building in Salt Lake City with the gold angel on top. Isn\u2019t that a mausoleum or a shrine of some kind where you worship your prophet?\u201d He was referring to the great Salt Lake Temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p8\" class=\"\">In dismay, I recognized his misunderstanding. No telling where it came from. I proceeded to correct the error, to the best of my ability.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p9\" class=\"\">I said to my friend, \u201cPlease allow me to explain that we definitely <span class=\"emphasis\">are<\/span> Christians\u2014we <span class=\"emphasis\">do<\/span> worship God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ, and we do <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> worship any prophet or any saint\u2014modern or of ancient times. We do not worship the Prophet Joseph Smith, although we love and honor him. But we never pray to him. In our doctrine, philosophy, and practice, he is not an intermediary of any kind, nor is any other prophet or saint. Christ alone is the advocate with the Father\u201d\u2014and I repeated for emphasis\u2014\u201cnot Mary, not Joseph, not Peter, James, or John, not any of the ancient prophets like Adam, Moses, or Abraham. No modern prophet like Joseph Smith or Brigham Young is ever worshiped or prayed to.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p10\" class=\"\">I went on further to explain that the temple in Salt Lake City is not to honor the Prophet Joseph, nor is he even buried there. To make my point that we do not worship our prophets, I said, \u201cPlease believe me when I say that we never make a pilgrimage to where the Prophet Joseph is buried; as a matter of fact, <span class=\"emphasis\">I<\/span> do not even know <span class=\"emphasis\">where<\/span> he is buried!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p11\" class=\"\">This explanation of my not knowing where Joseph Smith is buried seemed to be the most dramatic kind of clarification my friend could have received. He was thoroughly astonished, but he could easily see that his understanding of our Church had been completely wrong. This turnabout then led to a conversation in which truths regarding how we <span class=\"emphasis\">do<\/span> worship the Savior could be discussed easily and openly. The positive fact that we are practicing Christians was established.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p12\" class=\"\">I believe it to be the responsibility of every member of the Church to so live and teach and preach that there will never be any doubt on the part of our friends, associates, and casual acquaintances as to our being Christians, having the desire to receive redemption through Him; to be the kind of person that is a friend of the Savior, a servant of the Savior, and a son or a daughter of the Savior. Let me discuss each one of these three roles:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p13\" class=\"\">First, Be a Friend of the Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p14\" class=\"\">President Kimball qualifies as a friend of the Savior. When he was in the hospital ready to undergo open-heart surgery a few years ago, he was being wheeled down the hall and into the operating room by a young orderly. The young man accidentally smashed his finger between the metal door frame and the metal frame of the bed on which lay the already sedated prophet. When this mishap occurred, the young man, in pain, used an unfortunate expression in which he took in vain the name of the Savior. The prophet stirred, opened his eyes, and gently rebuked the orderly, saying, \u201cYoung man, don\u2019t say that; He\u2019s my best friend!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p15\" class=\"\">Do you and I have a relationship with the Savior such that we would decry the misuse of His name? Does Jesus know that we feel about Him the way President Kimball feels about Him?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p16\" class=\"\">Another example of President Kimball\u2019s discipleship occurred one Christmas Eve several years ago. He called and asked if I were busy. I quickly responded, \u201cNot at all. What can I do for you, President Kimball?\u201d He told me he needed a companion to go with him to the Primary Children\u2019s Hospital to give a few blessings. It turned out that he had heard of several children from South America, as well as some American Indian children, who were in the hospital. We went from floor to floor giving blessings to all the Latins and Lamanites and many others too. I was deeply affected by the love of President Kimball and his tender friendship with each child. He was a friend to the sick\u2014a friend to those far from home. He exemplified the tender, loving friendship that the Savior would give. It was easy to see how he could say, \u201cThe Savior is my best friend.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p17\" class=\"\">Second, Be a Servant of the Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p18\" class=\"\">King Benjamin made this clear:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cFor how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40502\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40502)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40502)\">Mosiah 5:13<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p20\" class=\"\">How can we possibly be a servant to the Savior if we have not served Him, if we are strangers to Him, if we keep Him far from the daily thoughts and intents of our hearts?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p21\" class=\"\">President Harold B. Lee was the kind of person who so knew the Savior and had been a servant for such a long period of time that he knew instinctively what the Savior would say or do in any given situation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p22\" class=\"\">For example, shortly after becoming President of the Church, President Lee held his first press conference as the new prophet of the Church. The reporters posed for President Lee what could have been a difficult question: \u201cWhat is your position with regard to the Vietnam war?\u201d You recall that at that time the war was underway, and there were those who supported it and those who were against our involvement.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p23\" class=\"\">If President Lee said, \u201cI am in favor of our government\u2019s position,\u201d the reporters could say, \u201cHow strange\u2014a spiritual leader in favor of war?\u201d If he answered, \u201cI am against our government\u2019s involvement,\u201d the reporters could also raise doubts by saying, \u201cHow unusual\u2014a religious leader who pretends to support his government, but does not?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p24\" class=\"\">When the people of the press presented the question, President Lee responded as a servant of the Savior would, knowing how to use the very words of the Lord in an inspired manner. His answer disarmed them, impressed them. As I remember, he said, \u201cWe, together with the entire Christian world, abhor war.\u201d And he went on, \u201cThe Savior said, \u2018In the world ye shall have tribulations.\u2019 But He also said, \u2018In me ye might have peace\u2019.\u201d (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"29154\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29154)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29154)\">John 16:33<\/a><\/span>.) Continuing, President Lee quoted from John 14: \u201c\u2018Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I [peace] unto you.\u2019\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29144\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29144)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29144)\">John 14:27<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p25\" class=\"\">And then President Lee taught a great principle. And he said to them: \u201cThe Savior was not speaking of the kind of peace which is won with armies or navies or force; nor was He speaking of the kind of peace which can be negotiated in the halls of congresses. He was speaking of the kind of peace we each can have in our hearts only when we live His commandments to such a degree that we know He is pleased with us.\u201d President Lee, speaking as a true servant of the Prince of Peace, had answered them with inspiration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p26\" class=\"\">Third, Be a Son or a Daughter of the Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/be-a-friend-a-servant-a-son-of-the-savior.p27\" class=\"\">Let there be no confusion\u2014our Heavenly Father <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> the Father of our spirits.
