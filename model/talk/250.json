McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1946, pp. 16-19<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nPresident Smith, counselors, and my brethren and sisters: It has been my privilege since our\nreturn from Europe in the spring of 1940, to visit three of the missions and nearly all the one\nhundred and fifty-eight stakes in the Church, and participate in their quarterly conferences.\nThis is an opportunity that I have appreciated very much.\n<\/p><p>\nCOMMENDATION FOR GOOD WORK\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a fine thing for one to keep busy, at least, it is a fine thing for me. Work is a great\nblessing. Someone has said that even a mule can't kick while he's pulling. It has been very\ninteresting as well as instructive to get better acquainted with you fine stake and ward leaders,\nto see you in action, to observe how you do things, and I was going to say, how some of you\ndon't do things, but that wouldn't be fair, because all of you, as far as I have been able to\nobserve, are doing a splendid job. Of course, some of you are doing better than others. For\nexample, in some of the stakes we find but very few young people in the meetings, not only\nin our conferences, but also in the sacrament meetings, and in other stakes nearly half of the\ncongregations are made up of young people of twenty-one or under; most of them are there\nbecause they have been asked and trained to furnish the music; others have been given\ndefinite assignments. In some of the quarterly conferences we have had as high as three\nhundred young people, furnishing very excellent music. An Aaronic Priesthood chorus of two\nhundred thirty-eight clear-toned young voices gave some very choice selections in the general\npriesthood session of the conference; one of the numbers was so outstanding they were\nrequested to repeat it in the evening session. A number of the stakes have choruses of from\nfifty to two hundred fifty voices made up entirely of Aaronic Priesthood members. In one\nstake, an adult Aaronic Priesthood chorus furnished at least part of the musical program. May\nI take this opportunity to compliment the Presiding Bishopric of our Church upon the splendid\nefforts they are putting forth in behalf of both the boys and men in the Aaronic Priesthood.\nAfter they had made a survey of the Aaronic Priesthood members, and it was shown that\nthere were nearly as many men (that is, men over twenty-one), as boys under twenty-one,\nthey set about to discover the cause&mdash;the source that brought about such a condition, and are\nnow trying to remove the cause. They are fencing the cliff. Many of you know the poem on\n\"The Fence or the Ambulance,\" that illustrates what I mean by discovering and removing the\nsource of evil.\n<\/p><p>\n\"THE FENCE OR THE AMBULANCE\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe community was divided into two factions: one favoring the fence around\nthe cliff; the other, the ambulance down in the valley. And the ambulance, it seemed, had the\nmajority; and so they put the ambulance down in the valley. Then an old sage remarked, \"It's\na marvel to me that people give more attention to repairing results than to stopping the cause,\nwhen they had much better aim at prevention.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Let us stop at the source, all this mischief,\" cried he, <br \/>\n\"Come, neighbors and friends, let us rally,<br \/>\nIf the cliff we will fence, we might almost dispense <br \/>\nWith the ambulance down in the valley.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Oh, he's a fanatic,\" the others rejoined, <br \/>\n\"Dispense with the ambulance, never!<br \/>\nHe'd dispense with all charities, too, if he could, <br \/>\nNo, we'll support them forever.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBut the sensible few who are practical, too, <br \/>\nWill not bear with such nonsense much longer; <br \/>\nThey believe that prevention is better than cure, <br \/>\nAnd their party will soon be the stronger.\n<\/p><p>\nBetter guide well the young than reclaim them when old, <br \/>\nFor the voice of true wisdom is calling,<br \/>\nTo rescue the fallen is good,<br \/>\nBut it is best to prevent other people from falling.\n<\/p><p>\nBetter close up the source of temptation and crime, <br \/>\nThan deliver from dungeon and galley;<br \/>\nBetter put a strong fence around the top of the cliff, <br \/>\nThan an ambulance down in the valley.\n<\/p><p>\nPRESIDING BISHOPRIC FENCING THE CLIFF\n<\/p><p>\nIt is shown by a survey made by the Presiding Bishopric that as a rule the twelve boys in the\ndeacon's quorum remained and were worthy to be ordained teachers, but some of them were\nlost as teachers, and more of them as priests; thus, the adult Aaronic Priesthood group kept\ngetting larger, and the Church and the State were put to more expense and trouble in\nfurnishing more ambulances. The Presiding Bishopric is doing a splendid job in removing the\nsource&mdash;in fencing the cliff. The bishops in the wards are also carrying out a program of\ndefinite assignments. The bishop, who is president of the priest's quorum, receives the priests\nfrom the teacher's quorum as a body, and this group of boys are made to feel that they belong\nto the bishop&mdash;are his special bodyguard, and they are prepared to be recommended to be\nordained elders in a body&mdash;not one of them left behind to add to the number of adult Aaronic\nPriesthood members, and the number of ambulances can be reduced.\n<\/p><p>\nPRIVILEGE OF THE BALLOT\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a fine thing to study causes. Ambulances, so-called, are increasing in so many ways, and\nthey will continue to do so until the sources are discovered and removed. The ballot is a most\nconvenient method that we have in this great free country of ours to remove\ncauses or sources that make it necessary to pay thousands of dollars for ambulances (you can\nname the nuisances that ambulances stand for), and may I urge with all the emphasis possible\nthat every person show his appreciation for his citizenship in this land of freedom by voting\nevery time the opportunity presents itself, and thereby help to keep this country free. I feel so\nkeenly about this matter of voting that I wish at times when I see the indifference manifest by\nso many of our people that some penalty could be imposed upon those who neglect this\nGod-given right. I feel that every person who is entitled to vote and doesn't do so is not a\ngood loyal citizen. And especially is that true of members of the Church. They are not only\nnot good citizens, but I think that they are not good Latter-day Saints, and should be very\nmuch ashamed.\n<\/p><p>\nIt may be wise for me, right here, to get back to the discussion of \"The Fence or the\nAmbulance,\" as exemplified by the Presiding Bishopric. These brethren are not only getting at\nthe source, taking care of these boys, but they are also trying to offer a remedy for those who\nhave already fallen over the cliff. They have prepared a definite outline&mdash;a course of study&mdash;a\nbook of songs&mdash;have assigned these adult members to see that everyone is made comfortable\nas far as seating and ventilation are concerned. Many of them are also assigned to welfare\nprojects. In one ward in a southern stake that I visited, every member of the adult Aaronic\nPriesthood was reported active. In another stake, a ward sent down quite a large group, eight\nmen who had qualified themselves as worthy of having received the Melchizedek Priesthood,\nand they came to the temple in a body and were sealed to their wives and their children for\neternity, and not just \"until death do ye part.\"\n<\/p><p>\nRETURNED SERVICEMEN\n<\/p><p>\nI am very happy that the Presidency of the Church appointed a servicemen's committee to\nlook after our one hundred thousand servicemen. Prevention again is better than cure. You\ncan't estimate the good that this committee and the coordinators have accomplished, putting\ntheir arms around our servicemen, guiding them over dangerous places, talking to them at the\ncrossroads. I am delighted also that President Hugh B. Brown has been appointed to work at\nBrigham Young University to continue his splendid work with the servicemen and women. It\nmight be well if such a committee were appointed also to look after the hundreds of young\npeople who are scattered throughout the land, some of them away from organized wards,\nstakes, or branches, many of them occupying very responsible positions in business, politics,\neducation, and various other professions. These are fine young men, intelligent, and I am sure\nthat the mission presidents would welcome men especially qualified to help them in\ncontacting these very intelligent young men who in the words of the Ancient\nin Three Wise Fools, have reached the age of reason.\n<\/p><p>\nPRESIDENT SMITH&mdash;AMBASSADOR OF GOOD WILL\n<\/p><p>\nThese young people are surely worth saving, and I am very delighted that President Smith-our\nambassador of good will&mdash;is leading the way in this respect; in his kind, tolerant, sweet spirit\nhe has put himself out to speak to many such persons. I know personally of two or three who,\nbecause of President Smith's interest in them, are now using the talents with which they are\nabundantly blessed, for the Church instead of against it. President Smith, like those presidents\nwho have preceded him, is the right man in the right place at the right time. He is the prophet\nfor us in this day.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior also set a very splendid example for all of us to follow. Saul, another brilliant\nyoung fellow who had arrived at the age of reason, was so sure of himself that he was\npersecuting the Christians, even assisting in the stoning of one of the prophets, but that did\nnot deter the Savior from extending his hand, speaking to Saul, and eventually Saul became\nPaul, one of the greatest of the apostles, the great apostle to the Gentiles. Our Lord also left\nthe ninety and nine and found supreme joy in rescuing the lost one\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34093\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34093)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34093)\">Matt. 18:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless us all, brethren and sisters, with wisdom, especially you stake and ward\nleaders, in our efforts to discover and remove causes, sources of evil and at the same time\nkeep working diligently to cure and remove the evils that do now exist, I pray in the name of\nthe Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
