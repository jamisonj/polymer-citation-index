This occurred in the great council in heaven before the peopling of this earth. The children of God were endowed with freedom of choice while yet but spirit beings. The divine plan provided that they be freeborn in the flesh and become heirs to the inalienable birthright of liberty to choose and act for themselves in mortality. It was essential for their eternal progression that they be subjected to the influences of both good and evil.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p4\" class=\"\">Lehi, an early American Nephite prophet, taught:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cFor it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so \u2026 righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3940\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3940)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3940)\">2 Ne. 2:11<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p6\" class=\"\">As sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father, we have this gift of free agency to use in our mortal lives. We must be tried, tested, and proved to see if we will choose the right and do all things whatsoever the Lord our God shall command us. As spirit children of God, we have built-in powers of conscience sufficient to develop our free agency in right choices and to acquire qualities of goodness, humility, and integrity of purpose.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p7\" class=\"\">Elder Bruce R. McConkie made this statement about free agency:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cFour great principles must be in force if there is to be agency: 1. <span class=\"emphasis\">Laws must exist,<\/span> laws ordained by an Omnipotent power, laws which can be obeyed or disobeyed; 2. Opposites must exist\u2014good and evil, virtue and vice, right and wrong\u2014that is, there must be an opposition, one force pulling \u2026 the other. 3. A knowledge of good and evil must be had by those who are to enjoy the agency, that is, they must know the difference between the opposites; and 4. An unfettered power of choice must prevail.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cAgency is given to man as an essential part of the great plan of redemption.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Mormon Doctrine,<\/span> Bookcraft, Inc., 1966 ed., p. 26.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p10\" class=\"\">All things good come from God. All things evil come from Satan. Brigham Young explained it this way:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cThere are but two parties on the earth, one for God and the other for the world or the Evil One. No matter how many names the Christian or heathen world bear, or how many sects and creeds may exist, there are but two parties, one for heaven and God, and the other will go to some other kingdom than the celestial kingdom of God.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> comp. John A. Widtsoe, 1966 ed., Deseret Book Co., p. 70.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p12\" class=\"\">Free agency is an everlasting principle which has existed with God from all eternity. It is a gift from him given with the hope that we will apply it wisely in the conduct of our personal lives. Freedom of choice is a moral agency which we should keep uppermost in our minds in all our activities and decisions. \u201cBy virtue of this agency you and I and all mankind are made responsible beings, responsible for the course we pursue, the lives we live, the deeds we do in the body.\u201d (Wilford Woodruff, <span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,<\/span> Bookcraft, Inc., 1969, pp. 8\u20139.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p13\" class=\"\">We cannot use our free agency as a justification to do evil. Man is free to choose the good or the evil in life, and to obey or disobey the Lord\u2019s commands as he may elect. He can choose to act without compulsion or restraint.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p14\" class=\"\">Free agency doesn\u2019t suggest we do wrong or infringe upon the rights and privileges of others. We often hear a person who transgresses console himself by saying, \u201cI am only hurting myself.\u201d If a man chooses to commit adultery, he must pay a penalty for his sin. Because of his transgression, he is infringing upon the rights of his wife and family, overlooking those who love him and look to him for guidance, good example, and eternal blessings of family unity and togetherness. He hurts others in the process of doing what he calls \u201cexercising my free agency.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p15\" class=\"\">Too many people have the wrong attitude about free agency. They use it as a negative force in their lives rather than as a positive one. Perhaps you have heard this statement: \u201cI can smoke and drink if I want to. I have my free agency.\u201d But why not think in terms of eternal values and say, \u201cI can smoke and drink if I want to. I have my free agency, but I choose to use my agency in bettering my life\u2014in choosing the right and not the wrong.\u201d This can apply to any vice in one\u2019s life. Have the right attitude and a vice can turn to a virtue, and virtue has its own reward. To use our agency for good, we must set aside the defensive, arrogant, and haughty attitude of a transgressor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p16\" class=\"\">Brigham Young taught: \u201cMen should not be permitted to do as they please in all things; for there are rules regulating all good societies \u2026 , the violation of which cannot be countenanced either by civil or religious usages. \u2026 Men \u2026 should not be free to sin against God or against man without suffering such penalties as their sins deserve.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> p. 65.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p17\" class=\"\">How far does our agency extend? Brigham Young answered this question by saying: \u201cThere are limits to agency, and to all things and to all beings, and our agency must not infringe upon that law. A man must choose life or death. \u2026 the agency which is given to him is so bound up that he cannot exercise it in opposition to the law, without laying himself liable to be corrected and punished by the Almighty.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cIt behooves us to be careful, and not forfeit that agency that is given to us. The difference between the righteous and the sinner, eternal life or death, happiness or misery, is this, to those who are exalted there are no bounds or limits to their privileges, their blessings have a continuation \u2026 they increase through all eternity; whereas, those who reject the offer, who despise the proffered mercies of the Lord, and prepare themselves to be banished from his presence, and to become companions of the devils, have their agency abridged immediately, and bounds and limits are put to their operations.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> pp. 63\u201364.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p19\" class=\"\">God has given commandments with promise of blessings for compliance with his laws, and penalties for violation of them. The late James E. Talmage said: \u201cObedience to law is the habit of free men. The transgressor fears the law, for he brings upon himself deprivation and restraint, not because of the law which would have protected him in his freedom, but because of his antagonism to the law. It is no more a part of God\u2019s plan to compel men to work righteousness than it is his purpose to permit evil powers to force his children into sin.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Great Apostasy,<\/span> Deseret Book Co., 1958, pp. 34\u201335.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p20\" class=\"\">A person\u2019s freedom should never be suppressed by men, by Satan, nor by our Lord. Men should never be in bondage one to another. While Satan would like us under his control, God does not control the actions of men. He has given us our agency to combat the trials, temptations, and evils of every kind. However, he gives certain principles that, if followed, will lead us back to his presence. God\u2019s kingdom is founded upon perfect liberty. Every man, woman, and child has the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. Each person alone is responsible to his creator for his individual acts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p21\" class=\"\">God gave us the everlasting gospel, the principles of life and salvation, and has left it up to each of us to choose or reject, with the understanding that we become responsible to him for the results of our acts. The Lord does not force anyone to embrace the gospel, and he will not force them to live it if they have embraced it. \u201cThey act for themselves, and act from choice.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> p. 57.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p22\" class=\"\">Satan exerts his greatest power when God has a work to do among his children on earth. Every dispensation of the gospel since the beginning of time has come to a close, not because God has failed, but because man has failed God by the improper use of his free agency.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p23\" class=\"\">It is most evident in the world today that Satan is raging in the hearts of men. It is a day, according to the Lord, when Satan shall have power over his own dominions. He began his deceitful promotions upon our first parents, Adam and Eve, and has continued his beguiling and enticing practices constantly since then. It is being done most effectively and alarmingly in our present generation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p24\" class=\"\">No one is immune from Satan\u2019s power.

He is an expert on making things seem appealing and right, when actually they can bring about our moral destruction. He does not believe in free agency, and would like to control our minds, thoughts, and acts. We can see his workings more and more in the movies, television shows, magazines, and in the actions of men and nations. If our thoughts are turned to sensual things, we will be strongly tempted to use our free agency wrongfully.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p28\" class=\"\">Once a person yields to sin, he is under Satan\u2019s control and it is not easy to break away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/using-our-free-agency.p29\" class=\"\">Be suspicious of those who would put you in a compromising position.

True freedom of agency exists with the observance of God\u2019s laws. Keep in mind that good and evil can <span class=\"emphasis\">never<\/span> be amalgamated into one. They are at opposite ends. They do not abide in harmony within a person.
