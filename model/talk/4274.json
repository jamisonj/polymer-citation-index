We know that you too have great anxiety for the members of your wards and stakes and expend great time and effort in their behalf. There is much that we ask of you who have been chosen for leadership. We place many loads upon your shoulders. You are asked to run the programs of the Church, interview and counsel with the members, see that the financial affairs of the stakes and wards are properly handled, manage welfare projects, build buildings, and engage in a host of other time-consuming activities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-power-of-the-word.p16\" class=\"\">While none of those activities can be ignored and laid aside, they are not the most important thing you can do for those you serve. In recent years, time and again we have counseled you that certain activities bring greater spiritual returns than others. As early as 1970, President Harold B.

But, by themselves, they do not carry that essential spiritual nourishment and will not accomplish what the Lord has given us to do. \u2026 The right things, those with true spiritual nourishment, are centered in the scriptures.\u201d (In Meeting with Stake Presidents and Regional Representatives, 2 Apr. 1982, pp. 1\u20132.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-power-of-the-word.p23\" class=\"\">I add my voice to these wise and inspired brethren and say to you that one of the most important things you can do as priesthood leaders is to immerse yourselves in the scriptures. Search them diligently. Feast upon the words of Christ. Learn the doctrine. Master the principles that are found therein. There are few other efforts that will bring greater dividends to your calling. There are few other ways to gain greater inspiration as you serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-power-of-the-word.p24\" class=\"\">But that alone, as valuable as it is, is not enough. You must also bend your efforts and your activities to stimulating meaningful scripture study among the members of the Church. Often we spend great effort in trying to increase the activity levels in our stakes. We work diligently to raise the percentages of those attending sacrament meetings. We labor to get a higher percentage of our young men on missions. We strive to improve the numbers of those marrying in the temple. All of these are commendable efforts and important to the growth of the kingdom. But when individual members and families immerse themselves in the scriptures regularly and consistently, these other areas of activity will automatically come. Testimonies will increase. Commitment will be strengthened. Families will be fortified. Personal revelation will flow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-power-of-the-word.p25\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph Smith said that \u201cthe Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and <span class=\"emphasis\">a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, <\/span>than by any other book.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43165\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43165)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43165)\">Book of Mormon, Introduction<\/a><\/span>, italics added.)
