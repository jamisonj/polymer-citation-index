This step seemed to be too big for me to take, but because I already had a testimony burning within me of the truthfulness of this work, I knew that withstanding baptism would take away my right to speak to my Father in Heaven again in prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p4\" class=\"\">So I accepted the challenge for baptism, with a fearful heart, but I told the missionaries that I would do it only on two conditions: First, that I would never be called to any Church position, and second, that I would never have to give a talk. Without the loving influence and the power and security of the Holy Ghost, which I received by the laying on of hands after baptism to help me, I could not have done anything in my various Church assignments by myself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p5\" class=\"\">We, as members, have the privilege to bear witness of the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ through a divinely authorized man, Joseph Smith, in these latter days. As I bore this witness to a man just recently while I was serving as mission president in Germany, I saw that he felt very uneasy about my statement, and he, like so many others, responded with a question: \u201cDon\u2019t we all believe in the same God?\u201d This question hurt me. It always hurts me when I see how many people are so indifferent and show such a lack of awareness in this most vital question in man\u2019s life: Can I find thee, my Father in Heaven?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p6\" class=\"\">Yes, one could say that regardless of when, where, and in what circumstances we are raised, we all long for our Heavenly Father and desire after him, because we knew him before we came to this earth. But do we, on this earth, all believe in the same God? No\u2014absolutely not! Men have created, in their use of free agency, all kinds of different interpretations of our Father in Heaven and the purpose of our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p7\" class=\"\">In our mortal existence there is no place for an uncertain, indifferent awareness of our responsibility and obligation to decide whom we should follow. Either we must attain a knowledge of our Creator and God, who loves us, who wants to bring peace, dignity, light, and happiness into our lives, or by and by we will forget our divine origin and remain in the foggy mists of the deceiver\u2014the adversary, who cannot stand the fact that we, as living souls, did not accept his plan in our premortal lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p8\" class=\"\">He is fighting, with all of his knowledge, to lead men astray as they exercise their free agency, that he might make them his slaves. We are witnesses that the fear, hatred, despair, loneliness, and ugliness that people experience in their lives are the fruits of the influence of the adversary. It is obvious that his long-range, ungodly strategy to destroy our ability to truly love and have faith is aimed at these latter days before the second coming of the Savior, when a decision is required of every man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p9\" class=\"\">If we do not decide to search out and accept the truth in the only way authorized by God, with all our might, mind, and strength, even when it means changing our lives completely, we will have built our house on sand. The half-truths of men, often mingled with scripture, are sometimes strong enough to fulfill the expectations of the people for a season or for a generation, but they can neither bring them along the path of exaltation and eternal life nor bring satisfying answers to the demanding problems of mankind in these days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p10\" class=\"\">Receiving and accepting Jesus Christ and his plan of salvation in its fulness and its truth means leaving the world and its earthly desires behind and building Zion around ourselves. When Christ walked the earth to prepare the way for his disciples, standing in purity and bearing testimony of the truth, he was a light in the darkness, and the darkness knew him not (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"29014\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29014)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29014)\">John 1:5<\/a><\/span>). The darkness organized itself to destroy him. Christ knew that this would happen, not only to him but also to all his true disciples. He said, in speaking to his followers, in <span class=\"citation\" id=\"36698\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36698)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36698)\">Matt. 10:22<\/a><\/span>, \u201cAnd ye shall be hated of all men for my name\u2019s sake.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p11\" class=\"\">When we really follow Christ in his true restored church, it will be manifested in our lives. The fruit will follow. The Holy Ghost will lead us to make uncomfortable decisions, to develop true love and faith by learning to sacrifice and to discipline ourselves. Our abilities will grow and will bring satisfaction and joy and happiness. Through the instrument of an ongoing communication with our Heavenly Father\u2014a constant prayer in our hearts for direction in the many little decisions in our lives\u2014we feel the softness of the yoke of Christ, as he said in <span class=\"citation\" id=\"36704\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36704)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36704)\">Matt. 11:28, 30<\/a><\/span>:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p14\" class=\"\">We will be led to live our lives his way and not the world\u2019s way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p15\" class=\"\">The men of the world feel secure with the question \u201cDon\u2019t we all believe in the same God?\u201d The answer to the question is \u201cNo.\u201d The deceiver has initiated all kinds of philosophies and religions to lead people astray, to make them feel happy and safe in their man-made rationalizing and wickedness. He wants them to forget that someday we all have to stand in the judgment of Christ and report our deeds and words.
