Several weeks ago I met a wonderful man while traveling to Texas. May I share with you a letter that I have written to him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-many-witnesses-of-jesus-christ-and-his-work.p4\" class=\"\">Dear Ken, I feel impressed to write you following our long discussion a few weeks ago on the airplane. I hope you have received my letters and the materials about the Church. I have thought of you so often and how anxious you were to learn all you could about the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-many-witnesses-of-jesus-christ-and-his-work.p5\" class=\"\">I felt I would like to share some thoughts today about the many witnesses of the Lord, Jesus Christ, and His mission to bless all mankind. Because He is the central figure of the life on this earth, every possible opportunity should be taken to understand Him, His purposes, and the witnesses that can bring us to Him. It seems that nothing could be more important to this world and to each of us than to know that.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-many-witnesses-of-jesus-christ-and-his-work.p6\" class=\"\">You know, Ken, each Christmas we sing a song with great feeling and gusto, \u201cJoy to the world, the Lord [will] come; Let earth receive her King! Let ev\u2019ry heart prepare him room, And Saints and angels sing.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 201.) These immortal, almost sacred words state that He will come. But, Ken, He <span class=\"emphasis\">has<\/span> come. And it is about His coming\u2014many times\u2014and the witnesses thereof that I would like to write today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-many-witnesses-of-jesus-christ-and-his-work.p7\" class=\"\">God, our Father, has indeed established a plan for this earth and for all of us. Jesus Christ was central to that plan. Christ would come to earth, give of Himself to people every day, overcome the world, establish His ways for others to follow, and then take upon Himself the sins of the world in Gethsemane, and then be raised from the tomb to live again and tell us that we would live. He would give to the world hope and eternal perspectives. He would offer the way, the truth, and the light by which it could be done. His message would illuminate every human aspiration, every hope, and desire.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-many-witnesses-of-jesus-christ-and-his-work.p8\" class=\"\">No more could we cry out, Ken, \u201cIf only I could know who I am, what is my destiny, who is God, and why am I here.\u201d Many times He gave the answers in His life, in His teachings, and in the words left about Him. Thank our Heavenly Father above that there are many witnesses of Him in each era of time to which we can go and with perfect surety know of Him and His ways. All these witnesses certify of Him, and of the things He taught, and of the guidelines or standards\u2014yes, the commandments\u2014He gave that man could securely pass through this earth with joy and happiness and eternal blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-many-witnesses-of-jesus-christ-and-his-work.p9\" class=\"\">As we open scriptural pages to read of the plan for life on earth, we see that our Father in Heaven made known to the prophets of the Old Testament that the Savior, His Only Begotten Son, would come to earth.

Jeremiah, Zechariah, Job, Moses, and others of the prophets had revealed to them the Christ and that He would come to provide the way for all of us to return to our Father in Heaven.

He gave a special power, the gift of the Holy Ghost, to all who would follow Him and be baptized, which would, He said, be a Comforter, would guide to all truth, would teach all things, would bring all things to our remembrance, would show us all things to come, and would be a witness, and testify of Him.

He raised the dead and made the blind see. He fed thousands on several occasions from just a few loaves of bread and some fishes. He forgave the repentant sinner, gave hope and encouragement, and administered to others all the days of His life. And then he offered Himself, though in the greatest agony and pain ever known to mankind, upon the cross as a final witness of His love for you and me by taking our sins upon Himself, a pure and sinless Son of God, that we might have eternal life. He did something for us that we could not do for ourselves. But think of the great blessing that came a few days later when the tomb was open and He emerged as the living, resurrected, immortal Christ, showing us that He lives and that we, too, would live.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-many-witnesses-of-jesus-christ-and-his-work.p14\" class=\"\">So, again, the witnesses.

But, unfortunately, man would ultimately change His truths, His church, and lose sight of His promises.
