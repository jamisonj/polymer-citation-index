The Tower of Babel had no effect on the language of the Spirit. Therefore, if I speak by the Spirit and you listen by the Spirit, the weakness of my spoken word will be transcended, and we will understand together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-safety-of-the-gospel-law.p5\" class=\"\">I\u2019m not a scientist, but this I have learned since those first totterings and falls as a babe that the law of gravity exists. I have never seen gravity, only its effects. Even so, it is obvious to me that it is in all things, that it is above all things, below all things, round about all things, and that all physical things are held in their positions and controlled in their spheres by this law.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-safety-of-the-gospel-law.p6\" class=\"\">The law of gravity has its limits and conditions. All of the inventions and movements of man take into account these conditions. If a man falls from a high place, he must descend; it matters not his motives. He may have jumped or it might have been an accident; it matters not. For the law of gravity cannot be frustrated, and so he must fall and suffer the destructive consequences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-safety-of-the-gospel-law.p7\" class=\"\">Men who jump from airplanes have discovered a saving device. It is called the parachute.

It matters not that he <span class=\"emphasis\">knows<\/span> the saving power of the parachute. If he does not have one on and open it as he falls, he will not be saved, for the law of gravity cannot be defied. By this we can clearly see that not only is the knowledge of a saving law necessary for salvation but also the application of it in our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-safety-of-the-gospel-law.p9\" class=\"\">Consider what would happen if the law of gravity were suspended from over the face of the earth for twenty seconds.
