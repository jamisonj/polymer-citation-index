Armed with missiles and firebrands, they hurled themselves against the gods,\nseeking their overthrow. But the thunderbolts of Zeus and the arrows of Hercules were too\nmuch for the attackers, and the Titans were finally destroyed.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom this story we get the word titanism. This is a word intended to represent our unfortunate\nhuman inclination to fight against righteousness. Following the example of the ancient giants,\nour world is presently conducting an all-out war against God and his purposes.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Conflict With God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJesus prayed, \"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35323\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35323)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35323)\">Matt. 6:10<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd from the very beginning Deity has been trying to raise our standards to this level\nfor which the Redeemer prayed. He has failed only because of the opposition of those he has\nbeen trying to help. Our human history is made up of a long unpleasant record of antagonism\ntoward God.\n<\/p><p>\nDisobedience brought about the expulsion from Eden. The spirit that caused Cain to murder\nhis brother Abel in order to possess his flocks spread quickly over the earth. Human society\nwas not very old before it was necessary for God to invoke the flood in order to cleanse the\nearth of its sin. This watery devastation was closely followed by the confusion of tongues and\nthe dispersion of the sinners of Babel. In the Meridian of Time rebellion against God led to\nthe rejection and crucifixion of the Savior of the world, and this tragedy was followed by that\nlong black night of apostasy that we call the Dark Ages.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Leading Rebel<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe scripture reminds us that Satan himself became what he is because of his sin of titanism.\nIn the great antemortal council described in the scriptures, Satan sought the overthrow of God\nhimself and succeeded in drawing away from God one third of all of the heavenly host. Since\nthat time, Satan's fight has continued with increasing power to reach its pinnacle of evil in\nour own day.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Elements of the Conflict<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nCertainly the greatest problem of our generation is its titanism, as shown by our enmity\ntoward the Almighty. Every unrighteous act, no matter how small, tends to\nput evil upon the throne of the universe. The Apostle John says that sin is the transgression of\nlaw (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"1071\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1071)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1071)\">1 Jn. 3:4<\/a><\/span>),\nand that is the distinguishing characteristic of our day.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus made his own appraisal of our situation when nineteen hundred years ago he looked\ndown to our day and compared it to the time immediately preceding the flood (see\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35398\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35398)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35398)\">Matt. 24:37<\/a><\/span>).\nIn spite of the fact that in fighting against God we are sinning against ourselves, yet\nwe have been completely unable to stop the great upsurge in crime and delinquency that each\nyear reaches a new high in devastating our lives. We are training ourselves to love sin. We\npay money to see it being committed on the screen; we read about it in books, magazines, and\nnewspapers; and quite naturally we absorb it into our lives.\n<\/p><p>\nAgainst the direct command of God, we sin against our health; we sin against our happiness;\nwe sin against our success; and we sin against Deity himself. But no one can practice evil\nwith impunity. The incidence of psychiatric disease is increasing among us with giant strides.\nThe rate of bankruptcy is growing by leaps and bounds. Business organizations are reporting\nunheard-of increases in theft and other evidences of moral breakdown. Every day the\nnewspapers report new occupational scandals as well as scandals in government itself. The\nKinsey report of a few years ago is a personal testimony of a widespread decadence in\nmorality that is strangely reminiscent of Sodom and Gomorrah.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we build bars in our homes instead of altars, we are fighting against God. In our\nviolations of the Sabbath day we are motivating a greater interest in horse races and baseball\ngames than in the celestial kingdom. We employ some of our best advertising brains and use\nour finest communication media to persuade ourselves and others to take a greater part in the\nvery evils that God has specifically forbidden. As a result of our titanism, our great\nenlightened Christian nation is noted for its drunkenness, lung cancer, immorality, and the\nviolation of its own laws.\n<\/p><p>\nSo far as all practical purposes are concerned, we have largely excluded God from our lives.\nRecently a nationwide religious poll asked whether or not those being interviewed believed in\nGod; ninety-five percent answered yes. When asked whether or not they tried to lead a good\nlife as a result, only twenty-five percent seemed to think that there was any connection\nbetween the two, and fifty-four percent said that religion did not influence their conduct in\npolitics or business affairs. Because we seem to keep our creeds and our deeds in separate\ncompartments, one is powerless to help the other. Church membership in the United States is\nnow at an all-time high, and so are our indicators of crime and sin.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the reasons for our problem is that so many people have depersonalized God and think\nof him only in impersonal terms. We call him by such names as \"the first great cause,\" or we\nrefer to him as \"an eternal principle.\" Then because an eternal principle can neither love nor\npunish us, we feel an increased liberty to indulge our titanism.\n<\/p><p>\nBut our time is growing short; and if we do not give up the assault, we must surely share the\nfate of the titans and the antediluvians in losing the war. In his vision of the judgment, John\nthe Revelator says, \"And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the\nbottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound\nhim . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he\nshould deceive the nations no more\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42374\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42374)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42374)\">Rev. 20:1-3<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd certainly those who continue to\nfollow Satan must share his fate.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Repentance, the Saving Principle<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nBecause sin is the basic problem of our world, repentance has been made one of the first and\none of the most important of the principles of the gospel of Christ. A universal, genuine, and\npermanent repentance would close up our jails, do away with our reform\nschools, prevent our nervous breakdowns, fill our churches, redeem our souls, and restore\nharmony, peace, and happiness to the world. From any point of view, repentance is one of the\nmost praiseworthy actions in life. Through it we abandon unworthy objectives and turn our\nlives upward toward more worthwhile things. The dispensation of Jesus opened with the\ndeclaration of John the Baptist, \"Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35295\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35295)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35295)\">Matt. 3:2<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd in our own day the Lord has said, \"Say nothing but repentance unto this generation\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14363\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14363)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14363)\">D&amp;C 6:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nRepentance is God's cure for every disease that plagues our lives. As repentance is postponed,\nthe sinner becomes more willful, and any upward change becomes more difficult. If this Godly\ngift is not used, it may lapse into impotence, and the soul may be lost.\n<\/p><p>\nThrough Noah the Lord said, \"My spirit shall not always strive with man\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23702\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23702)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23702)\">Gen. 6:3<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd someday when it may be too late, we may discover that repentance is the most thrilling,\nexciting, uplifting of all possible activities.\n<\/p><p>\nSome time ago while visiting the Northern States Mission I found myself one sultry August\nafternoon in southern Illinois in what was probably the most unpleasant weather I have ever\nexperienced. It was very hot and humid, and I was sweaty, sticky, dirty, and generally\nuncomfortable. But after the day's work had been finished, I went to my room in an\nair-conditioned hotel. I took a hot, soapy bath and put on fresh, clean clothing. A little later I\ngot into a bed between cool, white, clean sheets. And for a few minutes before dropping off\nto sleep, I lay there and thought about repentance. And I thought that if it were this pleasant\nto cleanse the body of a little sticky perspiration, what a delight it would be to cleanse the\nmind and soul of guilt and stand clean and free before God.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Repentance is Good<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nEven as late as the cross, repentance is good. One of the thieves crucified with Jesus was\nsorry for what he had done. When he acknowledged his sins, Jesus gave him credit\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31633\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31633)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31633)\">Luke 23:42-43<\/a><\/span>). Certainly\nhe was far ahead of his dishonest companion who remained bitter and rebellious to the very\nend. But the repentance of the thief came too late to undo the evil that his life had caused.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is an old fable about a horse that once ran away from his master. Finally the horse\nrepented and returned to his master and said, \"I have come back.\" The master said. \"Yes, you\nhave come back, but the field is unplowed.\" How can one repent of unplowed ground or of\nlessons unlearned or of character qualities undeveloped? The governor can pardon the\nmurderer, but who can restore life to the victim or the father to his orphaned children.\n<\/p><p>\nRepentance is one of the greatest of all ideas, but we should understand that it also has some\nserious limitations. To begin with it takes time to reform one's life and make restitution for\nhis wrongs, and sometimes an atonement must be made through the personal suffering of the\nwrongdoer.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Prepentance\"\n<\/p><p>\nBut there is one kind of repentance that has no limitations, that is a kind of repentance in\nadvance, which someone has called \"<i>pre<\/i>pentance.\" Prepentance is a repentance that takes\nplace before the offense is committed. Prepentance is the equivalent of prevention. It is a\nrepentance that requires no restitution and demands no payment of penalties. We know that in\nGod's eyes prevention is greatly superior to cure, as he has said, \"For I the Lord cannot look\nupon sin with the least degree of allowance;\n<\/p><p>\n\"Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14357\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14357)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14357)\">D&amp;C 1:31-32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo live a life of prepentance requires us to develop the kind of faith that destroys sin before it\nis indulged. This was \"the way of life\" of Jesus. The scriptures say that Christ, \"was in all\npoints tempted like as we are, yet without sin\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24320\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24320)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24320)\">Heb. 4:15<\/a><\/span>).\nRepentance for him was\nunnecessary because he lived the higher law of prevention.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Discipline for the Will<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe greatest miracle ever performed by Jesus was not in controlling the angry sea but in\ndisciplining his own will. His sinless life is the highest manifestation of excellence ever\nknown in the world. Jesus did not need to do a single evil thing in order to find out that it\nwas wrong. The life of Christ was pure, good. His ledger showed all gains and no losses.\nThere were no destructive injuries to be repaired and no restitutions to be made.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Declare Peace with God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a tremendous benefit we could bestow upon ourselves by calling off the war and\nlearning to live at peace with God, not only in obeying him but also in agreeing with him. If\nwe fully followed him, we could eliminate all of the tragic casualties that are presently\nstrewing themselves along the highway of life.\n<\/p><p>\nRecently a man came to see me who felt that he needed to talk to someone about his\nproblems. He was very sorry about his dishonesties, his cheating, and his immoralities. He\nbitterly regretted the unkindnesses that had caused his wife to die of a broken heart.\nBut although he had repented a thousand times, yet he was powerless to undo his evil. He was\nunemployed because his past weaknesses had made future confidence impossible. His children\nwere still suffering the disgrace of his bad example, and after having set all of these evils in\nmotion, he could only say, \"I wish I could live my life over again.\" But how ridiculous can\nwe be. No one can live his life over again. There are no rehearsals in life. We can't rehearse\nbirth or life or death. To feel sorry for our sins does not erase the injuries or heal up the\nwounds. And how can one repent of a bad example or a damaged soul? Sin is the most\ndangerous and the most destructive of all human experiences, and God has commanded that it\nshould be avoided. \"When we are hungry, sin offers us only poisoned bread; when we are\nthirsty, it invites us to drink at a deadly fountain.\" It causes all of the trouble, pain, and\nunhappiness in the world.\n<\/p><p>\nCertainly we should never think of sin as a plaything, but as our most deadly enemy. God\nhates sin, and the Psalmist speaks of our hating evil with a perfect hatred\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41845\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41845)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41845)\">Ps. 139:22<\/a><\/span>). <i>Pre<\/i>pentance is\nGod's highest law. And what a thrilling and profitable way of life is the religion of doing\ngood, of worshiping God, of hungering and thirsting after righteousness. Jesus demonstrated\nlife's perfect pattern and then said, \"Follow me\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35348\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35348)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35348)\">Matt. 9:9<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd every individual life\nmust finally be judged by how well it carries out that single directive.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God help us to follow him with our whole souls, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
