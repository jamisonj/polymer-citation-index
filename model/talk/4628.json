I also testify of His divinity and of those events in the office, the priesthood, the calling, and the authority of the holy Apostleship with which I and my Brethren are charged.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-supernal-gift-of-the-atonement.p5\" class=\"\">Through the Atonement and those singular events surrounding it, all of the terrible individual and collective sins of all mankind were taken upon the Lord\u2019s shoulders.
