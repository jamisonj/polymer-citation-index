I share it with you today as I endeavor for a few minutes to direct your thinking toward the important word <span class=\"emphasis\">peace.<\/span> A beautiful little blind girl was sitting on the lap of her father in a crowded compartment in a train. A friend seated nearby said to the father, \u201cLet me give you a little rest,\u201d and he reached over and took the little girl on his lap.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p4\" class=\"\">A few moments later the father said to her, \u201cDo you know who is holding you?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut you do.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p6\" class=\"\">Some might be inclined to say, \u201cWhat a perfect trust this child had in her father.\u201d Others may say, \u201cWhat a wonderful example of love.\u201d And still others might say, \u201cWhat an example of faith.\u201d To me it indicates a beautiful blending of all of these principles, which brought a priceless inner peace to the child. She knew she was safe because she knew her father <span class=\"emphasis\">knew<\/span> who was holding her. Affection, respect, and care over the years had placed in this little girl\u2019s heart a peace that surpasseth all understanding. She was at peace because she knew and trusted her father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p7\" class=\"\">We plead for peace in our prayers and thoughts. Where is peace? Can we ever enjoy this great gift while wars, rumors of wars, discord, evil, and contention swirl all around us? The answer is yes. Just as the little blind girl sat on the stranger\u2019s lap with perfect contentment because her father knew him, so we can learn to know our Father and find inner peace as we live his principles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p8\" class=\"\">It is very significant that when Jesus came forth from the tomb and appeared to his disciples, his first greeting was, \u201cPeace be unto you.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32255\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32255)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32255)\">Luke 24:36<\/a><\/span>.) Peace\u2014not passion, not personal possessions, not personal accomplishments nor happiness\u2014is one of the greatest blessings a man can receive. Our trust and our relationship with our Heavenly Father should be one similar to that of the little blind girl and her earthly father. When sorrow, tragedy, and heartbreaks occur in our lives, wouldn\u2019t it be comforting if when the whisperings of God say, \u201cDo you know why this has happened to you?\u201d we could have the peace of mind to answer \u201cNo, but you do.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p9\" class=\"\">Certainly peace is the opposite of fear. Peace is a blessing that comes to those who trust in God. It is established through individual righteousness. True personal peace comes about through eternal vigilance and constant righteous efforts. No man can be at peace who is untrue to his better self. No man can have lasting peace who is living a lie. Peace can never come to the transgressor of the law. Commitment to God\u2019s laws is the basis for peace. Peace is something we earn. It is not a gift. Rather, it is a possession earned by those who love God and work to achieve the blessings of peace. It is not a written document. It is something that must come from within.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p10\" class=\"\">The Salt Lake Valley was settled by those who trekked over the plains under extremely difficult conditions so they could worship God in peace. Left behind was Nauvoo, a deserted city desecrated by the uninformed, misinformed, embittered enemies of the Church. Peace had flown from the City Beautiful. What a price some of those who have gone before us have paid for the privilege of worshipping in peace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p11\" class=\"\">Never will peace and hatred be able to abide in the same soul. Permanent peace will elude those individuals or groups whose objective is to condemn, discredit, rail at, or tear down those whose beliefs are different from their own. These people live by hatred and would destroy others insofar as it is in their power to do so. True Christians have no time for contention. Lasting peace cannot be built while we are reviling or hating others. Those who preach hate, ridicule, and untruths cannot be classified as peacemakers. Until they repent they will reap the harvest to which those engaged in the business of hatred are entitled. Feelings of enmity and malice can never be compatible with feelings of peace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cThe wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cThere is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25614\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25614)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25614)\">Isa. 57:20\u201321<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p14\" class=\"\">However, only those at peace can properly cope with accusations and slander. Inner peace is the prized possession of God\u2019s valiant.

These are they who are greedy and power hungry. \u201cBe not deceived; God is not mocked: \u2026 He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23343\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23343)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23343)\">Gal. 6:7\u20138<\/a><\/span>.) Inner peace flees from those who sacrifice virtue for sexual promiscuity. There are some who advocate and promote new sexual exploits under the guise of \u201crelief from stress.\u201d These people are only sowing unto the flesh and peddling devilish deeds. Wickedness, no matter how it is labeled or camouflaged, will eventually bring grief and heartache and wipe out inner peace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p16\" class=\"\">Peace will never be the possession of those who participate in vulgar conversations and behavior. Let us not be planters of poisonous seeds.

Peace is not when the final installment is paid. Peace is not when marriage comes nor when all the children are enrolled in school. Peace is not when the last child returns from the mission field. Peace is not when an inheritance is received. Peace is not when the scars of death start to heal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p19\" class=\"\">True peace must not be dependent upon conditions or happenings. Peace must stem from an inward contentment built upon trust, faith, and goodwill toward God, fellowmen, and self. It must be constantly nurtured by the individual who is soundly anchored to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Only then can a person realize that the trials and tribulations of daily life are less important than God\u2019s total goodness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p20\" class=\"\">Lasting peace is an eternal personal quest. Peace does come from obedience to the law. Peace comes to those who develop character and trust.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p21\" class=\"\">We have a young grandson who loves gymnastics. He is progressing well and delights in showing us what he can do. While he develops these performance skills his body is maturing in limberness and strength. The last time he invited me to feel the muscles in his arms, I congratulated him. I was proud. As he jumped away from me (gymnasts, it seems, are always jumping and springing), I was impressed with the thought that his parents, grandparents, teachers, and others have an obligation to teach him one of life\u2019s great truths. Flabbiness of character should always be more of a concern than flabbiness of muscles. Body building and body conditioning are worthwhile goals, but there is more needed to gain true inner peace. We must blend balance in our lives and increase in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32210\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32210)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32210)\">Luke 2:52<\/a><\/span>) to reach our full potential.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p22\" class=\"\">No peace will be lasting unless it is built upon the solid foundation of eternal principles such as love of God, love of neighbor, and love of self. Those who love their neighbors can bring peace and happiness to many. Love can build bridges to understanding and tear down walls of suspicion and hate. Christlike love can bring peace into any neighborhood. With that kind of love each of us can help resolve petty differences, be they in the home or community.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p23\" class=\"\">While living in another nation just before World War II was to begin, a leading government official had been working hard to maintain peace for his country. He had in his hands a signed document guaranteeing peace. After negotiating in good faith, he seemingly had achieved that for which millions of his countrymen had been hoping and praying. He publicly assured all of us that it was peace for our times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p24\" class=\"\">Soon, however, he realized that he had been deceived.

The main purpose of schools must always be to develop character, to develop loyalty to the government, loyalty to the home, and loyalty to the individual. This is what real peace is all about\u2014internal and external. No peace, even though temporarily achieved, will be lasting unless it is built upon the solid foundation of such eternal principles as love of God, love of neighbor, love of self. Most men yearn for peace, cry for peace, pray for peace, and work for peace, but there will not be lasting peace until all mankind follow the path pointed out and walked by the living Christ. There can be no peace in sin and disobedience.
