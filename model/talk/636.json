Always on this day, I like to run over in my mind the events that happened on that\nmorning of the resurrection. We cannot be too certain of the order, but it could have been,\nand probably was, as I shall attempt to narrate.\n<\/p><p>\nBefore it was light, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene, the great lover, went to the tomb\nof Jesus and found the stone rolled back. Looking in, she perceived the body was not there.\nShe hastened back to Peter and John and told them. They, running, John outrunning Peter,\nreached the tomb. John looked in but did not enter. Courageous Peter, coming up, strode in\nand saw the burial clothes lying about\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27571\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27571)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27571)\">John 20:1-10<\/a><\/span>).\nThey then apparently returned to their quarters.\n<\/p><p>\nMARY FOLLOWED\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems that Mary followed along after Peter and John, and, seeing a figure, she approached\nthe figure, thinking it was the gardener, and asked where they had lain her Lord. The figure\nspoke, \"Mary\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27572\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27572)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27572)\">John 20:14-16<\/a><\/span>).\nShe recognized him and would have embraced him but he said, \"Touch me\nnot; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I\nascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27573\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27573)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27573)\">John 20:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nShortly afterwards, the women from Galilee, carrying spices with them to prepare the body of\nJesus for its final burial, came up. They looked in and the angels inside the tomb said, \"Ye\nseek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33066\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33066)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33066)\">Mark 16:6<\/a><\/span>).\n\" . . . Why seek ye the living\namong the dead? He is not here, but is risen\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31353\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31353)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31353)\">Luke 24:5-6<\/a><\/span>).\nI am sure that at this moment, if\nnot before, the dense darkness that had enshrouded this great Western Hemisphere broke, the\nclouds rolled back, the light came, for the life and the light of the world had left the tomb.\n<\/p><p>\nThe angels told the women to go and notify the disciples. They did, but the disciples thought\nthe words were idle tales and believed not\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31355\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31355)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31355)\">Luke 24:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAPPEARS TO PETER\n<\/p><p>\nLater in the day, two of the disciples were on their way to Emmaus. The Lord drew near and\nwalked with them. They did not know him. He inquired as to their sadness as they walked.\nThey asked if he did not know what had happened in Jerusalem in these days. He feigned an\nignorance of what they were thinking. They recounted the arrest, the trial, the crucifixion, and\nthe empty tomb. Declaring to them, \"O fools, and slow of heart to believe\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31357\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31357)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31357)\">Luke 24:25<\/a><\/span>), he\nexplained to them all the prophets that had prophesied concerning this great event. They\nentered the village and sat at meat; he broke bread and blessed it. Then they recognized him\nas he vanished from their sight\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31356\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31356)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31356)\">Luke 24:13-32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the same day he appeared to Simon Peter\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31358\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31358)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31358)\">Luke 24:34<\/a><\/span>).\nIn the evening, of the same day, the ten\ndisciples (Thomas absent) had assembled together in a room. The doors and windows were\nshut, but suddenly Christ stood in their midst. They were affrighted. He disclosed himself to\nthem, and ate with them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31359\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31359)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31359)\">Luke 24:36-39<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27574\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27574)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27574)\">John 20:19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA week later, the disciples were again assembled together, Thomas this time being there. He\nhad said he would not believe unless he could touch the body of the Savior. Christ came\nagain to them, though the doors were shut, and again instructed them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27577\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27577)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27577)\">John 20:26-29<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThereafter, at the sea of Tiberias\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27579\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27579)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27579)\">John 21:1-14<\/a><\/span>),\nhe appeared to several of the disciples,\nthose who had gone fishing, thinking their work was over. Then took place that great\nconference, where he asked Peter if Peter loved him, and Peter saying \"Yes,\" Jesus said,\n\"Feed my sheep\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27580\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27580)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27580)\">John 21:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHe appeared to James (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"236\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 236)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(236)\">1 Cor. 15:7<\/a><\/span>),\napparently separately, then to a great multitude\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"234\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 234)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(234)\">1 Cor. 15:6<\/a><\/span>), then again to the\ndisciples at the time of the ascension\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7672\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7672)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7672)\">Acts 1:9<\/a><\/span>). He continued to walk with them at times over a period\nof forty days (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7670\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7670)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7670)\">Acts 1:3<\/a><\/span>), and then came the ascension.\n<\/p><p>\nThus his resurrection was abundantly verified.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Jews and the pagans of the time seem to have had little difficulty with the idea of a\nMessiahship. The pagan theology was filled with pseudo-gods and goddesses who were\nmerely glorified human beings. They could glimpse Messiahship. But they seemed to have\nhad no concept of the resurrection.\n<\/p><p>\nAPOSTASY BEGAN\n<\/p><p>\nEarly in the Christian Church there began to arise heresies regarding the Christ. These\nheresies were aided by the attempt of the early Christians to harmonize their beliefs with the\npagan beliefs, by adopting pagan beliefs. But finally, in the main, these basic anti-Christ\nheresies disappeared, and Jesus was recognized as the Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nThen the apostasy began. The Church began to transgress the laws, to change the ordinances,\nand to break the everlasting covenant\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25139\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25139)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25139)\">Isa. 24:5<\/a><\/span>).\nThe simple principles of Christ's gospel were lost or\nchanged. That was the first great apostasy.\n<\/p><p>\nBut as time went on, some of the ancient heresies reappeared, and this reappearance has been\nincreasing in volume. The heresies began to question whether Jesus was the Christ, and that\nquestion, of course, really questions the Messiahship. Today one great body of the Christian\nworld has abandoned Christ as the Messiah, the Atoning Sacrifice, the Redeemer of the world;\nthey regard him now only as a great teacher and philosopher.\n<\/p><p>\nAnother great section of the present Christian world has more or less taken away from the\nSavior a great part of that spiritual personality which he gave himself, and which his early\nApostles gave, and which we give him. They are dividing their worship between him and his\nmother.\n<\/p><p>\nWe know, and it is our responsibility to carry forward what we do know, that Jesus is the\nChrist, that he is the Son of God, that he was in truth an atoning sacrifice for the fall, that\nthrough him and by him all mortals, whoever they are, will be resurrected, that through his\ngospel and by it, all may be saved, not only, but exalted in the kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems that we are almost alone in clinging to the Christ as he described himself and\ndeclared himself. This must be because we are the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints. Ours is the responsibility to see to it that no act or thought or teaching of ours shall in\nany way question the divinity of Jesus, nor in any way question that he was the Son of God,\nnor in any way question the atoning sacrifice which he made for us. If we do, we shall\nbecome guilty of that great offense where we shall crucify to ourselves the Son of God afresh\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24250\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24250)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24250)\">Heb. 6:6<\/a><\/span>),\nfor which I am sure we shall hardly gain forgiveness.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren and sisters, cling to the Savior. Accept him as he, himself, described himself: \"I am\nthe light and the life of the world\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27549\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27549)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27549)\">John 8:12<\/a><\/span>).\nSalvation comes only through him, and as\nPeter said to his accusers: \". . . there is none other name under heaven given among men,\nwhereby we must be saved\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7686\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7686)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7686)\">Acts 4:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord help us to keep this testimony in our hearts and increase it; may he give us the\ncourage proudly to proclaim it; may our influence in the world be extended until we shall be\nable to bring the righteous everywhere to the knowledge which we possess that they, along\nwith us, if we shall hold our course, shall be saved and exalted in the celestial kingdom, I\nhumbly pray in the name of Jesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
