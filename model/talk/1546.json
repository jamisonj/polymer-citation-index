Contrary to these expressed views, The Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints declares to all the world: \"We believe all that God has revealed, all\nthat He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important\nthings pertaining to the Kingdom of God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6840\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6840)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6840)\">A of F 1:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"All He has revealed; and will yet reveal\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe world is constantly looking for new knowledge, not only in science but also in religion. It\nis the keystone\nto progress. Herein lies the apostasy of the Christian Church established by Jesus and the\napostles. In other words, they believed in the prophets dead, and rejected the living oracles.\nSpiritual knowledge comes from God through his prophets.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Prophets, revelators<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAncient Israel was a prophet nation. The prophets appeared from time to time as they were\nneeded. Their messages were vital, for they were the inspired spokesmen of the Lord. They\nwere not always popular. They were often ridiculed, persecuted, and held in disrepute.\nStephen, the Martyr, in his last and solemn testimony, said to the mob, \"Which of the\nprophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8023\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8023)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8023)\">Acts 7:52<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThese chosen servants, misunderstood and maligned, devoted themselves wholeheartedly and\nconstructively to the task assigned them. It was never an easy one. It was a challenge to\nstrong men who put their service to God above all worldly aspirations. Their aim was always\nto rescue and fortify against the forces of evil, of moral and spiritual disintegration. Through\nthese holy men God has given commandments to his children. But, generally speaking, their\nwords were ignored and rejected. Had they been respected and accepted, the course of human\nhistory would have changed. They appeared as lighthouses to the generation in which they\nlived. When they were ignored and cast aside by unscrupulous leaders, as was often the case,\nthe light was extinguished and darkness covered the earth. There were no prophets during the\ndark ages.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Divine messages come through the prophets<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nGod's message to his children comes through his chosen servants, the prophets. These\nservants were chosen before they were born. They had a divine message that was not only\ntimely but important. They gave evidence of their divine calling wherever and whenever they\nappeared. Spirituality is a consciousness of God, an awareness of his place and power in the\nuniverse. To know him is life eternal. When Israel was at its lowest ebb spiritually, Elijah, a\ngreat prophet, came to their rescue and converted a nation to the true worship of Jehovah.\nThey had been reassured through a manifestation of God's power.\n<\/p><p>\nI have often said that the story of Joseph in Egypt gives the world its finest lesson on\nmorality and clean living. It should be told and repeated frequently to every boy and girl\nduring their adolescence. The example and teaching of the prophets will never become\noutmoded by a righteous people. Every page of scripture contains a directive for you and me\nas we move along in the journey of life. Where would we be today if all the idealism and\nmorality taught by the prophets had been lost in the scramble for earthly and worldly\nrecognition? International negotiations and all the controversies now going\non, it seems to me, are tinctured with selfish ambitions. May I remind you there is no place\nfor selfishness in God's kingdom or in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nSomeone has said that Moses was the first man in history who fought for human rights. He\nfreed the Israelites from the Egyptian bondage. He freed them from their own limitations and\ntaught them the fundamentals of good government. He laid the foundation for law and order.\nMoses brought to the world the Ten Commandments. They are very fundamental. They are\nbasic to every system of law made to govern humanity. To violate them means disaster and\ndestruction. The road to wickedness begins when one of these mandates from God is broken.\n\"And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to\nface\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21271\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21271)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21271)\">Deut. 34:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Modern prophets bring divine guidance<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nLike the prophets of old, Joseph Smith, the modern Prophet, saw visions, received revelations,\npredicted the future, and interpreted the scriptures. The Church would not have come into\nexistence without a prophet. There could have been no restoration without these holy men\nwho spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4899\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4899)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4899)\">2 Pet. 1:21<\/a><\/span>). Their powers and understanding went\nbeyond the limits of our finite comprehension of things. They looked beyond the veil that\nseparates the seen from the unseen world. Had Joseph Smith lacked the insight, the power, and\nthe enlightenment that came to him through his prophetic calling, the Book of Mormon could\nnot have come forth.\n<\/p><p>\nWithout the visions of Moses and Elijah, there would have been no gathering of Israel, and\nthe temple building program characteristic of the Church would have had no beginning. The\nexistence of these temples in the United States, in Canada, in Europe, and on the islands of\nthe sea is a solemn testimony of the sincerity, the conviction, and the positive faith of the\nLatter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe in the prophets, modern and ancient. We have listened to their words during this\nconference. May we remember them and may we abide in the holy commandments that came\nfrom God to them, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
