I am grateful for her influence in my life. In my prayers each day I give thanks for the influence of many good people around me\u2014for friends, for caring neighbors, for the Young Women office staff, and for Sister Jayne Malan and the board members with whom I have a close and cherished relationship.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/i-will-go-and-do.p6\" class=\"\">I feel the love and the great strength that come from my four sons and their families. I appreciate their candor and good humor. In fact, I can hear them now, on both coasts, watching this broadcast and saying, \u201cMy mother? Oh, sure!\u201d Yesterday, I was telling our oldest son that President Monson had said that I might be called on for a few remarks today. President Monson had said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want you to preach a sermon.\u201d Dave replied, \u201cMom, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been telling you for years!\u201d I am grateful that they have the desire to do what\u2019s right.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/i-will-go-and-do.p7\" class=\"\">I give thanks for my sister, who is my friend. Blessed is she who has one like her and thrice blessed if more than one. Sister Ardeth Kapp is like a sister to me. I pay tribute to her as a great woman of vision, called by the Lord to lead the Young Women around the world at a most critical time. She has tutored me, encouraged me, and allowed me to grow. I have served happily as a counselor in the Young Women organization.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/i-will-go-and-do.p8\" class=\"\">I love you young women.

Joe is devoted, and he brings great strength and stability into my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/i-will-go-and-do.p10\" class=\"\">I know that Ezra Taft Benson is a prophet of God. I will follow his counsel, and the counsel of those Brethren who have been called to serve with him.

In the words of a modern-day prophet: \u201cMuch of the major growth that is coming to the Church in the last days \u2026 will happen to the degree that the women of the Church reflect righteousness and articulateness in their lives and to the degree that [they] are seen as distinct and different\u2014in happy ways\u2014from the women of the world.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1979, pp. 103\u20134.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/i-will-go-and-do.p12\" class=\"\">This is a joyous gospel!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/i-will-go-and-do.p13\" class=\"\">My counselors and I look forward eagerly to serving. And we want to serve in a way that will help women everywhere contribute to the great forward movement of the Church. I know that in the strength of the Lord we can do all things required of us.
