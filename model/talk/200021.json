Permit me, however, to say, with regard to some of these ideas presented to the Conference by Brother George Q. and which he has said, he has frequently presented to me and others of the Twelve, that while I duly appreciate the feelings and views of my brethren, and am not ignorant of the proprieties of life, individually I would not wish to change my position. Personally I care nothing about the outside show, the glitter and appearance of men; but I do care about the great eternal principles associated with the Church and Kingdom of God upon the earth. And as has been stated, it was some time before I could make up my mind to accept a proposition of this kind. And I accept it now simply in the capacity of your servant for Christ's sake for the benefit of the Kingdom of God and that all things may be conducted in a proper manner. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v20n482\"> Now we will let this pass, and talk about something else. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v20n483\"> I have been very much interested in the remarks that have been made at this Conference.

There were however, more than six persons in the Church, as was remarked by Brother Snow, the organization being effected for the purpose of legal recognition, still there were only a very few, and as the spirit of revelation rested down upon God's servant Joseph in these early days, who like Adam, Moses, Abraham, Jesus, Jared, Nephi, Moroni and others, had the heavens unfolded to his view, and although the Church was so few in number the principles and purposes of God were developed fully to the vision of his mind, and he gazed upon the things that are to transpire in the latter days associated with the dispensation that he was called upon by the Almighty to introduce. He learned by communication from the heavens, from time to time, of the great events that should transpire in the latter days. He understood things that were past, and comprehended the various dispensations and the designs of those dispensations. He not only had the principles developed, but he  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"175a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD20\/JoD20_0175.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;175a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7350\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>was conversant with the parties who officiated as the leading men of those dispensations, and from a number of them he received authority and keys and priesthood and power for the carrying out of the great purposes of the Lord in the last days, who were sent and commissioned specially by the Almighty to confer upon him those keys and this authority, and hence he introduced what was spoken of by all the prophets since the world was; the dispensation in which we live, which differs from all other dispensations in that it is the dispensation of the fulness of times, embracing all other dispensations, all other powers, all other keys and all other privileges and immunities that ever existed upon the face of the earth. At that time he was a feeble youth, inexperienced, without a knowledge of the learning of the day. But God put him in possession of that kind of intelligence, and what may be termed a scientific knowledge of all things pertaining to this earth, and the heavens, if you please, which was altogether ahead of all the intelligence that existed in the world. He commenced as opportunity presented by following the education he had received from the Almighty, by teaching the principles of life and salvation, the principles of the everlasting Gospel, by conferring upon others that priesthood which had been conferred upon him, and by organizing a state of things that was after the pattern of the heavens, that was calculated to live and grow and increase, that had the principle of life and vitality within itself, and that was calculated to draw together the honest in heart and assimilate them in their ideas and views and feelings and faith, and empower them to operate with him and with the Lord and with the holy priesthood that had existed in <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"175b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD20\/JoD20_0175.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;175b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7350\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> former ages. And thus he commenced to organize the Church with all its various offices under the direct inspiration, guidance and revelation of the Lord. The First Presidency was pointed out, the Twelve were also pointed out and designated, and these quorums were ordained. The high priesthood was organized however before these other quorums took shape. Then there were the quorums of Seventies, then the quorums of Elders, then the Bishops, then the quorums of Priests, Teachers and Deacons, together with the High Councils and all that we know about these things. He taught us all that we know about them; God taught him. Hence in the various organizations of the several quorums of priesthood whether it relates to the Melchizedek, Aaronic or Levitical priesthood, all of these, together with the duties devolving upon each, were given by the Lord. And hence the church that we are associated with is called the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Hence Jesus Christ is the medium through whom we are to approach the Father, calling upon him in the name of Jesus;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"127941\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 127941)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(127941)\">3 Ne. 18:19<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"127942\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 127942)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(127942)\">Moses 5:8<\/a><\/span> for there is no name given under heaven, nor known among men, whereby we can be saved but the name of Jesus Christ.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"71435\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 71435)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(71435)\">Acts 4:12<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"127943\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 127943)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(127943)\">D&amp;C 18:23<\/a><\/span> And although they do not do it now, yet the time is approaching when to him &#x201C;every knee will bow, and every tongue confess that he is the Christ, to the glory of God the Father.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"75458\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 75458)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(75458)\">Philip. 2:10-11<\/a><\/span> And hence the religion we profess is one that has been given us from the heavens.

And God expects it at our hands that we magnify our calling, and that we cleave unto him as his servants upon whom he has conferred this priesthood. He expects it at our hands that we shall magnify it, and not operate according to our peculiar notions, but according to the will and law and guidance and revelations of God in all things and under all circumstances; for we are here as Jesus was here&#x2014;not to do our own will, but the will of our Heavenly Father who has sent us,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"69253\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 69253)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(69253)\">John 6:38<\/a><\/span> and who has called us to this high calling,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"127944\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 127944)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(127944)\">Philip. 3:14<\/a><\/span> and has made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"74916\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 74916)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(74916)\">Eph. 2:6<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v20n486\"> In accordance with the order of God, the Twelve, the Seventies, the High Priests and Elders have been abroad among the nations of the earth, delivering the testimony which God gave to them, and the Spirit and power of God has operated with us in our ministrations; and the results of these operations and these labors, and the faith and the self-abnegation and self-denial and the desire to do the will of God, and the testimonies that have been borne, are manifested in the Saints gathered today as we are in the valleys of the mountains.

There has quite a change taken place since this Gospel was introduced, as the thousands of people who inhabit these valleys sufficiently attest. And if we continue to progress in faith, in union, in intelligence, in virtue, in purity, in knowledge, and especially in the knowledge of God and in the observance of his ordinances, the work of the Lord will continue to roll with tenfold rapidity. We are just commencing our labors, and are just getting ready to perform the work that God has laid upon our shoulders, and are just commencing to perform the work that God intends us to accomplish; everything that has been prophesied by all the ancient prophets, as contained in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, and those things predicted by Joseph Smith, and every other prophet of God, will as surely be fulfilled as we are here today, without any faltering, or flagging, or hesitation. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v20n487\"> We go on and attend to many things.

But men who feel right, they feel that they and all they have belong to the Lord; they feel that they are on hand to perform the work of God, to build up his kingdom, to operate with him and with the holy priesthood, and to prepare Temples to administer for the living and for the dead; that we may indeed be not poor and helpless dolts; but feel that we are saviors upon Mount Zion, and that the kingdom is the Lord's.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"62011\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 62011)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(62011)\">Obad. 1:21<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v20n491\"> There is a good feeling manifested among the brethren and also among the sisters, who are quite as zealous in most interests as the brethren are.

There is constant labor going on in the Temple at St. George, with very little intermission, and a corps of persons steadily engaged administering in the ordinances of the Lord's House there; while in these other places, as you have heard read over, according to the financial accounts pertaining to the Temple being built in Manti and Logan&#x2014;there has been expended in a short time on these two Temples nearly two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The brethren have taken hold of it with a will, and there seems to be a feeling among many of them to see who shall do the most, instead of who can do the least.

And we wish it to be understood among the Elders and Seventies that we do not want men to go on missions who look upon it as a painful duty for them to fulfill; we would rather such men stay at home. But he that hath a desire to preach the Gospel to the world, whose life is upright, pure and virtuous, and who is capable of presenting the principles of the Gospel to the world; he is the kind of man we are desirous to send.
