We all love you.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been reminded that we are short on time and long on speakers. I would be happy were\nall of my time given to Elder Hinckley, but maybe I should use a part of it. I'll pocket my\nprepared speech. Now I'll be prepared for conference next year.\n<\/p><p>\nLet me substitute for it a sermonette or two.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Remember the Sabbath Day&mdash;to Keep It Holy<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSermonette No. 1: Would any of you who claim membership in The Church of Jesus Christ\nof Latter-day Saints, or who are assumed to be members, go to a food store on Sunday, buy\nfood, take it home, put it on the table, and ask the Lord to bless it? End of Sermonette No. 1.\nThe subject of that sermonette is \"Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22742\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22742)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22742)\">Ex. 20:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Be ye clean\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSermonette No. 2: Shame on the girl who would let a boy fondle her body with his hands in\nthat evil practice of petting. And shame on the boy who would take advantage of a girl in that\nabominable practice of petting. Petting leads to something worse. End of Sermonette No. 2.\nThe subject: \"Be clean, ye youth of Zion, and stay clean.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Book of Mormon Testifies of Christ<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI still have time for a storiette. A storiette is a very brief story. Sometimes it is a long story\ngreatly condensed. Mine is that kind.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus told storiettes. We call them parables. A parable is a fictitious storiette. This one is true:\n<\/p><p>\nI have a practice of purchasing a Book of Mormon before I board a plane or train here in Salt\nLake City&mdash;more often it is a plane. The book provides me with reading material and\nmaterial also for someone else, since I purposely leave the book on the plane or train. By the\nway, the last two or three times I have boarded a plane, I couldn't find the stand at which the\nbooks are sold. Whichever priesthood quorum is assigned to provide the stand and books, I\nwish it would get back on the job.\n<\/p><p>\nReturning from Los Angeles one evening after a stake conference, I tied myself in a seat next\nto a window. I was tired. I dozed. A bit later, I suddenly came to life in a seizure of coughs. I\ndiscovered the irritant. A man had strapped himself in the seat beside me and was smoking\nthe stinkiest cigarette I ever smoked, second-handedly. I was glad when the stewardess\nrequested him and others to put out their cigarettes. The plane, she said, was ready for\ntake-off. But just as soon as we were up in the air, he lit up another, and he puffed the smoke\nin my direction; and when he had finished it, he lit another. He was near the butt of a third\none when I, my dander up, decided to tell him off. I was practically fogged out. I turned to\nspeak to him just as he stooped to take something from his briefcase on the floor. I waited.\nStraightening up he beat me to the punch&mdash;to the conversation, that is&mdash;and he said: \"Have\nyou ever read this book?\" I looked at it in astonishment. What do you suppose it was? It was\na Book of Mormon.\n<\/p><p>\n\"May I see it?\" I asked. He handed it to me, and I examined it and said to him: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Yes sir, I have read this very book. Two weeks ago I purchased this identical book before\nboarding a plane in Salt Lake City, and I left it on the plane. I'm glad you found it and are\nreading it.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWell, you must know, from that moment on, all the way to Salt Lake City, the fragrance of\nhis cigarette was fine; it didn't bother me at all, and I was sorry that I had to get off the plane\nin Salt Lake City. I wished I could have gone on farther with him because we were having\nsuch a fine conversation about the Book of Mormon.\n<\/p><p>\nIf this storiette has a subject, it would be \"Read the Book of Mormon.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYou here in this building have read it. There may be people listening in on the air who have\nnot read it. I plead with you, read it. You may find it as interesting as did the man on the\nplane.\n<\/p><p>\nI read the Book of Mormon when I was a young man. I read it on the top of a mountain\ndown in southern Utah where I was tending a theodolite in the service of the US Coast and\nGeodetic Survey. Finishing it, I felt I had a fair understanding of the gospel principles\ncontained in it.\n<\/p><p>\nOnce I sat with General Authorities of the Church and heard President Joseph Fielding Smith\nsay, in substance, \"Brethren, all of us have to read the Book of Mormon. We are asking the\nmembers of the Church to do it, so we brethren must do it, too.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the brethren moaned, saying, \"Must we who have read it so many times take time out\nto read it again?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Yes,\" replied President Smith, \"we can't ask the members to do something we are not willing\nto do.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI turned to the brother sitting next to me and asked him how many times he had read the\nBook of Mormon. He answered, \"Forty-five times.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"May I quote you?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Not until I go home and check.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe next day he told me I could quote him: \"I have read the book fifty times.\" That brother is\nMilton R. Hunter. \"I taught,\" he said, \"the Book of Mormon in seminary and institute classes.\nThat accounts for my reading it so many times.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHow many times have you read it? Read it again. And this time read it <i>slowly<\/i>, so you can\ndigest the spiritual calories you will find in it. Read it <i>personally<\/i>, putting yourself in the shoes\nof Lehi, who was told to take his family into the wilderness. What would you have done were\nyou in his shoes? Put yourself in Nephi's shoes. He was instructed to go after the brass plates.\nWhat would you have done in his shoes? Yes, read it personally.\n<\/p><p>\nRead it <i>purposefully<\/i>, and let your purpose be to discover its spiritual calories and the gospel\nof Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nRead it for <i>pleasure<\/i>. Discover how it testifies of the Christ. Somebody said his name is\nmentioned 526 times therein. It testifies also of the Bible. Turn off the TV, turn off the radio,\nand read the Book of Mormon. You will enjoy it.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear you my witness: In the Book of Mormon you will find the gospel of Jesus Christ. You\nmay discover, reading it, that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true. I did.\nMay you so find it, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
