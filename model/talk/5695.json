Patience can be a helpful companion during such stressful times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/patience-a-heavenly-virtue.p13\" class=\"\">Occasionally I visit nursing homes, where long-suffering is found. While attending Sunday services at one facility, I noticed a young girl who was to play her violin for the comfort of those assembled. She told me she was nervous and hoped she could do her best. As she played, one called out, \u201cOh, you are so pretty, and you play so beautifully.\u201d The strains of the moving bow across the taut strings and the elegant movement of the young girl\u2019s fingers seemed inspired by the impromptu comment.

A dear and cherished young friend, Wendy Bennion of Salt Lake City, was such an example. Just the day before yesterday, she quietly departed mortality and returned \u201cto that God who gave [her] life\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10153\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10153)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10153)\">Alma 40:11<\/a><\/span>). She had struggled for over five long years in her battle with cancer. Ever cheerful, always reaching out to help others, never losing faith, her contagious smile attracted others to her as a magnet attracts metal shavings. While ill and in pain, a friend of hers, feeling downcast with her own situation, visited Wendy. Nancy, Wendy\u2019s mother, knowing Wendy was in extreme pain, felt that perhaps the friend had stayed too long. She asked Wendy, after the friend had left, why she had allowed her to stay so long when she herself was in so much pain. Wendy\u2019s response: \u201cWhat I was doing for my friend was a lot more important than the pain I was having. If I can help her, then the pain is worth it.\u201d Her attitude was reminiscent of Him who bore the sorrows of the world, who patiently suffered excruciating pain and disappointment, but who, with silent step of His sandaled feet, passed by a man who was blind from birth, restoring his sight. He approached the grieving widow of Nain and raised her son from the dead. He trudged up Calvary\u2019s steep slope, carrying His own cruel cross, undistracted by the constant jeers and taunting that accompanied His every step. For He had an appointment with divine destiny. In a very real way He visits us, each one, with His teachings. He brings cheer and inspires goodness. He gave His precious life that the grave would be deprived of its victory, that death would lose its sting, that life eternal would be our gift.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/patience-a-heavenly-virtue.p16\" class=\"\">Taken from the cross, buried in a borrowed tomb, this man of sorrows, acquainted with grief, arose on the morning of the third day.

Just a month ago, Sister Monson and I, along with Elder and Sister Dieter Uchtdorf, held a meeting of dedication in G\u00f6rlitz. The same songs were sung as were rendered twenty-seven years earlier. The members knew the significance of the occasion, marking the total fulfillment of the promise. They wept as they sang. The song of the righteous was indeed a prayer unto the Lord and had been answered with a blessing upon their heads.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote12-95911_000_024\">12<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20285\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20285)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20285)\">D&amp;C 25:12<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/patience-a-heavenly-virtue.p51\" class=\"\">At the conclusion of the meeting we were reluctant to leave.
