The first lesson focuses upon the blessings that come to individuals and families as they faithfully obey this commandment. The second lesson emphasizes the importance of tithing in the growth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in all of the world. I pray the Holy Ghost will confirm to each of us the truthfulness of the principles I discuss.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"topic\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Lesson Number 1\u2014Significant but Subtle Blessings<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-windows-of-heaven.p7\" class=\"\">Sister Bednar\u2019s mother is a faithful woman and an inspired homemaker. From the earliest days of her marriage, she carefully has kept the household financial records. For decades she has accounted conscientiously for the family income and expenditures using very simple ledgers. The information she has collected over the years is comprehensive and informative.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-windows-of-heaven.p8\" class=\"\">When Sister Bednar was a young woman, her mother used the data in the ledgers to emphasize basic principles of provident living and prudent home management. One day as they reviewed together various categories of expenses, her mother noted an interesting pattern. The costs for doctor visits and medicines for their family were far lower than might have been expected. She then related this finding to the gospel of Jesus Christ and explained to her daughter a powerful truth: as we live the law of tithing, we often receive significant but subtle blessings that are not always what we expect and easily can be overlooked. The family had not received any sudden or obvious additions to the household income. Instead, a loving Heavenly Father had bestowed simple blessings in seemingly ordinary ways. Sister Bednar always has remembered this important lesson from her mother about the help that comes to us through the windows of heaven, as promised by Malachi in the Old Testament (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"125656\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125656)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125656)\">Malachi 3:10<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-windows-of-heaven.p9\" class=\"\">Often as we teach and testify about the law of tithing, we emphasize the immediate, dramatic, and readily recognizable temporal blessings that we receive. And surely such blessings do occur. Yet some of the diverse blessings we obtain as we are obedient to this commandment are significant but subtle. Such blessings can be discerned only if we are both spiritually attentive and observant (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"125657\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125657)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125657)\">1\u00a0Corinthians 2:14<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-windows-of-heaven.p10\" class=\"\">The imagery of the \u201cwindows\u201d of heaven used by Malachi is most instructive. Windows allow natural light to enter into a building. In like manner, spiritual illumination and perspective are poured out through the windows of heaven and into our lives as we honor the law of tithing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-windows-of-heaven.p11\" class=\"\">For example, a subtle but significant blessing we receive is the spiritual gift of gratitude that enables our appreciation for what we have to constrain desires for what we want. A grateful person is rich in contentment. An ungrateful person suffers in the poverty of endless discontentment (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"125658\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125658)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125658)\">Luke 12:15<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-windows-of-heaven.p12\" class=\"\">We may need and pray for help to find suitable employment.

We might want and expect a job offer, but the blessing that comes to us through heavenly windows may be greater capacity to act and change our own circumstances rather than expecting our circumstances to be changed by someone or something else.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-windows-of-heaven.p13\" class=\"\">We may appropriately desire and work to receive a pay raise in our employment to better provide the necessities of life.

Interestingly, the answers to these prayers did not produce additional weapons or an increased number of troops. Instead, God granted these faithful warriors assurance that He would deliver them, peace to their souls, and great faith and hope for their deliverance in Him (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"125665\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125665)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125665)\">Alma 58:11<\/a><\/span>).

Assurance, peace, faith, and hope initially might not seem like the blessings warriors in battle might want, but they were precisely the blessings these valiant young men needed to press forward and prevail physically and spiritually.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-windows-of-heaven.p15\" class=\"\">Sometimes we may ask God for success, and He gives us physical and mental stamina.

The Council on the Disposition of the Tithes was established by revelation and consists of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the Presiding Bishopric (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"125677\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125677)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125677)\">D&amp;C 120<\/a><\/span>).

I gained a greater appreciation and reverence for the Lord\u2019s laws of finance for individuals, for families, and for His Church. The basic financial program of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2014for both income and disbursement\u2014is defined in sections 119 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125670\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125670)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125670)\">D&amp;C 119<\/a><\/span>] and 120 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125669\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125669)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125669)\">D&amp;C 120<\/a><\/span>] of the Doctrine and Covenants. Two statements found in these revelations provide the foundation for the fiscal affairs of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-windows-of-heaven.p23\" class=\"\">Section 119 simply states that all members \u201cshall pay one-tenth of all their interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever, \u2026 saith the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125672\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125672)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125672)\">verse\u00a04<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-windows-of-heaven.p24\" class=\"\">Then, concerning the authorized disbursement of the tithes, the Lord said, \u201cIt shall be disposed of by a council, composed of the First Presidency of my Church, and of the bishop and his council, and by my high council; and by mine own voice unto them, saith the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125671\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125671)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125671)\">D&amp;C 120:1<\/a><\/span>). The \u201cbishop and his council\u201d and \u201cmy high council\u201d referred to in this revelation are known today as the Presiding Bishopric and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, respectively. These sacred funds are used in a rapidly growing church to spiritually bless individuals and families by constructing and maintaining temples and houses of worship, supporting missionary work, translating and publishing scriptures, fostering family history research, funding schools and religious education, and accomplishing many other Church purposes as directed by the Lord\u2019s ordained servants.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-windows-of-heaven.p25\" class=\"\">I marvel at the clarity and brevity of these two revelations in comparison to the complicated financial guidelines and administrative procedures used in so many organizations and governments around the world. How can the temporal affairs of an organization as large as the restored Church of Jesus Christ possibly operate throughout the entire world using such succinct instructions? To me the answer is quite straightforward: this is the Lord\u2019s work, He is able to do His own work (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"125674\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125674)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125674)\">2\u00a0Nephi 27:20<\/a><\/span>), and the Savior inspires and directs His servants as they apply His directions and labor in His cause.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-windows-of-heaven.p26\" class=\"\">In that first council meeting I was impressed by the simplicity of the principles that guided our deliberations and decisions. In the financial operations of the Church, two basic and fixed principles are observed. First, the Church lives within its means and does not spend more than it receives. Second, a portion of the annual income is set aside as a reserve for contingencies and unanticipated needs. For decades the Church has taught its membership the principle of setting aside additional food, fuel, and money to take care of emergencies that might arise. The Church as an institution simply follows the same principles that are taught repeatedly to the members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-windows-of-heaven.p27\" class=\"\">As the meeting progressed, I found myself wishing that all members of the Church could observe the simplicity, the clarity, the orderliness, the charity, and the power of the Lord\u2019s own way (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"125675\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125675)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125675)\">D&amp;C 104:16<\/a><\/span>) for conducting the temporal affairs of His Church.
