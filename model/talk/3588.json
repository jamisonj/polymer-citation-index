Their concerns range from wars, rumors of wars, famine, and inflation to drug addiction, climate changes, pollution, bigness of government, etc. I can understand why those who are without faith in our Lord and Savior would become prophets of gloom. Times can be difficult.

Generally, the greatest weaknesses exist in the organization and operations in both the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthood quorums. Let me direct a few words of instruction to you who have the responsibility for this important link in the priesthood chain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/when-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p12\" class=\"\">President Stephen L Richards at one time gave us a threefold definition of a priesthood quorum. He said a priesthood quorum is three things: \u201cfirst, a class; second, a fraternity; and third, a service unit.\u201d (In Conference Report, Oct. 1938, p. 118.)

Fundamental in this teaching is instruction in our duties as bearers of the priesthood. It is not a time for speculation regarding the mysteries of the world. It is a time of basic, practical, how-to instruction, for which we can find application in our lives. The lessons should teach us how we can become better husbands, fathers, and members of quorums and should teach us our responsibilities to our fellowmen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/when-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p16\" class=\"\">This summer I had the opportunity of attending a high priest group meeting in a small community in southern Wyoming. The lesson that week was on justification and sanctification. It was evident as the lesson was beginning that the teacher was well prepared to instruct his brethren. Then a question prompted a response which changed the whole course of the lesson. In response to the question, the comment of one of the brethren was, \u201cI have listened with great interest to the lesson material. The thought has crossed my mind that the information presented will soon be lost if we do not find application to put the material presented into practice in our daily lives.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/when-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p17\" class=\"\">Then he went on to propose a course of action for the quorum. The night before, a citizen of the community had passed away. His wife was a member of the Church, but he had not been. This high priest had visited the widow and offered his sympathy. Leaving the home after the visit, his eyes wandered over the beautiful farm of the deceased brother. He had put so much of his life and labor into building it up. The alfalfa was ready to cut; the grain would soon be ready to harvest. How would this poor sister cope with the sudden problems now falling on her? She would need time to get herself organized for her new responsibilities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/when-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p18\" class=\"\">Then he proposed to the group that they make an application of the principle that was being taught\u2014by working with the widow to keep her farm operational until such time as a more permanent solution could be found by the widow and her family. The balance of the meeting was spent in organizing the project to assist her. The principles of the lesson found immediate application.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/when-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p19\" class=\"\">As we left the classroom, there was a good feeling among the brethren. I heard one of them remark as he passed through the doorway, \u201cThis project is just what we needed to get this quorum working together again.\u201d A lesson had been taught, a brotherhood had been strengthened, a service project had been organized to assist someone in need.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/when-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p20\" class=\"\">Brethren, let us make of our quorums a class where we will receive the best instruction possible to guide us in our responsibilities and obligations as bearers of His holy priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/when-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p21\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Second, the quorum as a fraternity.<\/span> Many years ago I was called to be the adviser to a priests quorum. It was during a time when the Church had instituted a standard quorum award program. The program was designed to encourage the full quorum to have an interest in each member. An award was given for the achievement of the total quorum, not for individual accomplishment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/when-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p22\" class=\"\">This was a quorum of high-spirited, devoted young men. They fulfilled their quorum responsibilities almost 100 percent, with the exception of one member. Bill had lost his father the previous year, and he was having a hard time adjusting to this great loss in his life. His mother was doing all she could to help Bill find himself again, but he started missing his meetings and developing some other bad habits.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/when-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p23\" class=\"\">After Bill had missed one meeting, a quorum member was assigned to contact him and encourage him to attend his quorum meeting. The quorum member was only able to reach his mother, who explained that Bill stayed out so late on Saturday night she could not get him up on Sunday morning. The second week came and still no Bill in quorum meeting. Again a contact was tried, with the same result.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/when-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p24\" class=\"\">As we assembled for quorum meeting the third week without Bill, I could see there was great concern on the part of the quorum for their absent member. They expressed the fact they were not a whole quorum without him, and they could not hold another meeting without Bill. I asked for suggestions. Quick was the response that we go over to his home and hold the meeting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/when-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p25\" class=\"\">We drove to Bill\u2019s house. His mother was most cooperative and invited us to go back into Bill\u2019s bedroom. There was Bill, comfortably sleeping in his bed. We started the meeting with a spirited opening hymn. On the first note Bill came up out of those sheets like he had been shot out of a gun. He wondered what was happening to him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/when-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p26\" class=\"\">What followed was one of the sweet experiences of my life. Each quorum member expressed his love for Bill. This was followed by a kneeling prayer around Bill\u2019s bed. Bill got to his feet after the prayer with tears rolling down his face. We shook hands and left, a whole quorum once again. Bill knew of the love his quorum members had for him, and he wanted to be a part of it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/when-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p27\" class=\"\">Elder Rudger Clawson of the Council of the Twelve once said: \u201cThe Priesthood of God on earth has been organized into quorums for the mutual good of the members, and for the advancement of the Church.

If this spirit be cultivated, wisely and persistently, no other organization will become more attractive to the man who holds the Priesthood.\u201d Let us build a bond of brotherhood for each member of our quorum.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/when-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p28\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Third, the quorum is a service unit.<\/span> \u201cWhen thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren\u201d was the counsel of the Savior to Peter.

Smith once told of an instance he remembered from his boyhood. He said that when he was very young he was attending a party in the Mansion House given by his uncle, the Prophet Joseph Smith. A large company was present, engaging in the festivities of the occasion. Suddenly the door opened and a man entered, dressed in ragged, shabby clothes. He was dirty, and his hair and beard were long and unkempt. He looked like a tramp. The Prophet at the time was on the other side of the room, opposite the door through which the man had come. President Smith said that Joseph, athletic man that he was, fairly sprang across the room, grabbed the shabby man in his arms, and hugged him as if he were a near and dear relative. This man was a brother in the priesthood. He had undergone a harrowing experience and made a tremendous sacrifice for his brother, the Prophet of God.

It is an instrument of service.
