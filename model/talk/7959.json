She was radiant, smiling, and filled with light. I wanted to know her, so I quietly introduced myself. She whispered her name, Kate, and I recognized her last name as a family that had lived in Michigan, where my family once lived. Kate was their grown-up daughter, who five weeks earlier had returned from her mission to Germany.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/when-you-save-a-girl-you-save-generations.p14\" class=\"\">During the session the thought kept entering my mind: \u201cIntroduce Kate to Chris.\u201d I put this prompting aside, thinking, \u201cWhen, where, how?\u201d As we were preparing to leave, Chris came over to tell us good-bye and I seized the opportunity.

She was raised in a home where having family home evening, praying together, and studying the scriptures made her home a holy place. As a child, she learned about the temple, and the song \u201cI Love to See the Temple\u201d was a favorite for family home evening.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-10705_000_046\">5<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See \u201cI Love to See the Temple,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Children\u2019s Songbook,<\/span> 95.]<\/span><\/sup> As a little girl, she watched her parents set an example of seeking a holy place as they went to the temple on a weekend evening instead of going to a movie or to dinner.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/when-you-save-a-girl-you-save-generations.p17\" class=\"\">She loved her father dearly, and he used his priesthood authority to help her make her first covenant of baptism. She then had hands laid on her head and received the Holy Ghost. Kate said, \u201cI was excited to receive the Holy Ghost, and I knew that it would help me stay on the path to eternal life.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/when-you-save-a-girl-you-save-generations.p18\" class=\"\">Life continued on for Kate in a very blessed and happy way. When she was 14, she started high school and loved seminary, another holy place to learn about the gospel. One day her teacher started to talk about trials and guaranteed that we would all face them. She said to herself, \u201cI don\u2019t want trials; I don\u2019t want to hear this.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/when-you-save-a-girl-you-save-generations.p19\" class=\"\">It was just a few weeks later that her father woke up on Easter Sunday extremely ill. Kate said: \u201cMy father was a very healthy person; he was a marathon runner. My mother was so alarmed by how sick he was that she took him to the hospital. Within 36 hours he had a massive stroke that shut down most of his body. He could blink, but the rest of his body was not working. I remember seeing him and thinking, \u2018Oh no, it\u2019s happening. My seminary teacher was right. I am having a trial.\u2019\u201d Within a few days Kate\u2019s father passed away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/when-you-save-a-girl-you-save-generations.p20\" class=\"\">Continuing, Kate said: \u201cIt was so hard. You never want to lose the hero of your life. I knew I could make it a springboard for growth or allow it to be a roadblock. I didn\u2019t want to let it ruin my life, because I was only 14 years old. I tried to be as close to the Lord as possible. I read my scriptures a lot. Alma chapter 40 assured me that the resurrection is real and through Christ\u2019s Atonement, I could be with my father again. I prayed a lot. I wrote in my journal as often as I could. I kept my testimony vibrant by writing it down. I went to church and to Young Women every week. I surrounded myself with good friends. I kept close to caring relatives and especially to my mom, who was the anchor in our family. I sought out priesthood blessings from my grandfather and other priesthood holders.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/when-you-save-a-girl-you-save-generations.p21\" class=\"\">These consistent choices, like those of the wise virgin, added oil to Kate\u2019s lamp. She was motivated by her desire to be with her father again. Kate knew her father was aware of her choices, and she did not want to disappoint him. She wanted an eternal relationship with him, and she understood that staying on her covenant path would keep her life woven tightly with his.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/when-you-save-a-girl-you-save-generations.p22\" class=\"\">The trials didn\u2019t end, however. When Kate was 21 and submitting her mission papers, her mother was diagnosed with cancer. Kate had to make an important decision in her life. Should she stay home and support her mother or go on her mission? Her mother was given a priesthood blessing promising that she would survive the illness. Assured by this blessing, Kate went forward with faith and continued her plans to serve a mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/when-you-save-a-girl-you-save-generations.p23\" class=\"\">Kate said: \u201cIt was taking a step in the dark, but while I was on my mission, the light eventually came and I received news that my mother\u2019s blessing was realized. I was so glad that I didn\u2019t put off serving the Lord. When hard things come, I think it\u2019s easy to become stagnant and not really want to move forward, but if you put the Lord first, the adversities can lead to beautiful blessings. You can see His hand and witness miracles.\u201d Kate experienced the reality of President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson\u2019s words: \u201cOur most significant opportunities will be found in times of greatest difficulty.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-10705_000_046\">6<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Thomas\u00a0S.

She said: \u201cI didn\u2019t just survive my dad\u2019s death; it became part of my identity for good, and had my mom been taken away, it would have done the same thing.
