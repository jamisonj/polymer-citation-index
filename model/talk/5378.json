Thank you for joining with us on this beautiful fall morning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p4\" class=\"\">Life in every era has had its troubles. Surely the Dark Ages were appropriately named, and not one of us is anxious to be transported back even to those later years of, say, the Hundred Years\u2019 War or the Black Plague. No, we\u2019re quite happy to have been born in a century of unprecedented material blessings and abundant living; yet in community after community, in small nations and large, we see individuals and families facing heightened anxiety and fear. It would seem that discouragement, depression, and despair are our contemporary \u201cBlack Plague.\u201d Ours is, as Jesus said it would be, a time of distress with perplexity (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32479\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32479)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32479)\">Luke 21:25<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p5\" class=\"\">We know that some of the world\u2019s most painful suffering is done in silence, in the sorrow of a lonely life. But some of it has more violent expression. Millions around the world are, as one observer put it, \u201cangry, armed and dangerous.\u201d In too many cities, drive-by shootings are becoming as common as drive-through laundries, and too many youngsters are packing a gun to school the way they used to pack a lunch.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p6\" class=\"\">There is an increasing feeling that time is out of joint, that no one seems wise enough or strong enough to set it right. In many cases, governments are in office but not in power, community values and neighborhood pride are often superficial or nonexistent, and too frequently the home is an alarming failure.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p7\" class=\"\">Furthermore, many of the social and political medicines of our day regularly miss the mark, so those would-be physicians stand by the bedside of \u201cfeverish and delirious humanity\u2014outwitted, discredited, dumbfounded \u2026 not knowing in which direction to seek delivered\u201d (Charles Edward Jefferson, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Character of Jesus,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Parliament Publishers, 1968, p. 17).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p8\" class=\"\">If I may be so bold this morning, may I suggest \u201cdirection for deliverance\u201d? In words of one syllable, we need to turn to God. We need to reaffirm our faith, and we need to reassert our hope. Where necessary we need to repent, and certainly we need to pray. It is the absence of spiritual fidelity that has led us to moral disarray in the twilight of the twentieth century. We have sown the wind of religious skepticism, and we are reaping the whirlwind of existential despair.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p9\" class=\"\">Without our religious faith, without recognizing the reality and necessity of spiritual life, the world makes no sense, and a nonsense world is a place of horror. Only if the world has meaning at a spiritual level is it possible for human beings to keep going, to keep trying. As Hamlet so wisely implored, so should we: \u201cAngels and ministers of grace defend us!\u201d (act 1, scene 4, line 39).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p10\" class=\"\">My testimony today is of the angels and ministers of grace who will always defend us if, as the prophet Alma commanded us, we \u201ctake care of \u2026 sacred things,\u201d we \u201clook to God and live\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10032\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10032)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10032)\">Alma 37:47<\/a><\/span>). More prayer and humility, more faith and forgiveness, more repentance and revelation and reinforcement from heaven\u2014these are where we seek remedy and deliverance for \u201cfeverish and delirious humanity\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Character of Jesus,<\/span> p. 17).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p11\" class=\"\">I testify this morning of God\u2019s limitless love for his children, of his unquenchable desire to help us heal our wounds, individually and collectively. He <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> our Father, and Wordsworth wrote more than he knew when he said we came to earth \u201ctrailing clouds of glory \u2026 from God who is our home\u201d (\u201cOde: Intimations of Immortality\u201d). But in far too many cases we find no modern belief in a Heavenly Father, and when there is a belief, it is too often an erroneous one. God is not dead, and he is not an absentee landlord. God is not uncaring, or capricious, or cantankerous. Above all, he is not some sort of divine referee trying to tag us off third base.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p12\" class=\"\">The first and great commandment on earth is for us to love God with all our heart, might, mind, and strength (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"19818\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19818)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19818)\">D&amp;C 59:5<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"37515\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37515)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37515)\">Matt. 22:37<\/a><\/span>) because surely the first and great promise in heaven is that he will always love us that way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p13\" class=\"\">So much of what so many think about God (if they think about him at all) must make him weep.

She spoke of the tears and the waves of sorrow that any mother would experience with a prognosis as grim as Jimmie\u2019s was. But like the faithful Latter-day Saints they are, the Lewises turned to God with urgency and with faith and with hope. They fasted and prayed, prayed and fasted.
