My friends and I would play ball in a small alleyway behind the houses where we lived. The quarters were cramped but all right, provided you hit straight away to center field. However, if you hit the ball to the right of center, disaster was at the door. Here lived a lady who would watch us play, and as soon as the ball rolled to her porch her English setter would retrieve the ball and present it to Mrs. Shinas as she opened the door. Into her house Mrs. Shinas would return and add the ball to the many she had previously confiscated. She was our nemesis, the destroyer of our fun\u2014even the bane of our existence. None of us had a good word for Mrs. Shinas, but we had plenty of bad words for her. The windows of her house received more special soap treatment on Halloween than did any other. None of us would speak to Mrs. Shinas, and she never spoke to us. She was hampered by a stiff leg which impaired her walking and must have caused her great pain.

I honestly don\u2019t know what came over me, but I took a few more minutes and, with our hose, watered her lawn. This I did each night, and then when autumn came, I hosed her lawn free of leaves as I did ours and stacked the leaves in piles at the street\u2019s edge to be burned or gathered.

She went to the kitchen and returned with a large box filled with baseballs and softballs, representing several seasons of her confiscation efforts. The filled box was presented to me; however, the treasure was not to be found in the gift, but rather in her voice. I saw for the first time a smile come across the face of Mrs. Shinas, and she said, \u201cTommy, I want you to have these baseballs, and I want to thank you for being kind to me.\u201d I expressed my own gratitude to her and walked from her home a better boy than when I entered.

His sweet wife had tried in vain to interest him in the Church. A lovely daughter and precious son had both put forth their best efforts, with no perceptible change. Perhaps Shelley just couldn\u2019t express his inner feelings or demonstrate positive emotions. In the ward, every effort had been expended, but to no avail.

In his characteristic, direct way, he asked if I would perform the ordinance in the temple which would seal his family for all eternity. I responded, \u201cShelley, that would be a privilege for me, but first you must become a member of the Church.\u201d Can you imagine my surprise when he replied, \u201cI have joined the Church. I now hold the Melchizedek Priesthood and am very active.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/a-royal-priesthood.p45\" class=\"\">What a special blessing, to welcome Shelley, his wife, Eugenia, his daughter, Utahna, and, by proxy, his son, Robert, to a beautiful sealing room in the Salt Lake Temple. The blessings of eternity were bestowed. Just three years later, I spoke at Shelley\u2019s funeral services. He had progressed from doubt to faith and now had looked upward and gone forward, bidding farewell to mortality and receiving a welcome to paradise. Today he is with his beloved Eugenia, and they are with Robert and wait one day to welcome Utahna. When I reflect on the life of Shelley, I feel a debt of gratitude to that humble crossing guard, to those faithful home teachers, to that patient wife and daughter, and to all who made a difference in the unfolding of eternal blessings for Shelley and his family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/a-royal-priesthood.p46\" class=\"\">Our Lord and Savior said, \u201cCome, follow me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32431\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32431)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32431)\">Luke 18:22<\/a><\/span>.)
