Having first explained to his hearers the atonement of Christ, he continued, \u201cTherefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9307\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9307)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9307)\">Alma 34:17<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fundamental-welfare-services.p30\" class=\"\">He then gave these classic instructions on prayer:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fundamental-welfare-services.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cCry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fundamental-welfare-services.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cYea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fundamental-welfare-services.p33\" class=\"\">\u201cCry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fundamental-welfare-services.p34\" class=\"\">\u201cBut this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fundamental-welfare-services.p35\" class=\"\">\u201cYea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9308\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9308)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9308)\">Alma 34:21, 23\u201324, 26\u201327<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fundamental-welfare-services.p36\" class=\"\">Now one, it might seem, would be justified in thinking that people who prayed in this manner would be pretty good people.

No matter how many stocks and bonds or how much land and other properties we possess, they are not wholly ours. They are the Lord\u2019s. He further says that he owns and gives to us all the blessings we have and that he makes us stewards over them, responsible to him. He makes it clear that it is his purpose to provide for his Saints, but he requires that it be done in his way, which way, he explains, is for those who <span class=\"emphasis\">have<\/span> to contribute to those who <span class=\"emphasis\">have not.<\/span> Having made us stewards, he gives us our agency, however, and then lays down the condition that if we accept these blessings and refuse to contribute our share for the care of the poor, we shall go to\u2014well, he tells us where we shall go.
