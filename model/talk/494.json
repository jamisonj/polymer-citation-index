McKay<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Second Counselor in the First Presidency<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">David O. McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1950, pp. 162-168<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nWhen we realize that the twelve thousand or more members of the priesthood quorums\nassembled here tonight can say, each one in his own heart, \"I know that my Redeemer lives,\"\nwe can sense at least dimly the strength of this Church, for upon the priesthood rests the\nstructure, the entire structure of the Church of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nEVIDENCES OF PROGRESS\n<\/p><p>\nWe have cause to be thankful that we have many evidences today of the marvelous growth of\nthis work. In the mission fields we have more missionaries than we have ever had before,\nnearly six thousand, not counting the missionaries in the stakes of Zion; tithing is greater than\never and increasing; baptisms in the field are greater; only within the last two weeks we had\nreports of a hundred and fifty baptisms in one mission in August; another, in the same month,\ntwo hundred and sixty-three, and these are converts, not children. The stakes and wards are\nincreasing. More Church edifices are now under construction than we have ever had before in\nthe history of the Church. All these are sure evidences of progress; and this attendance tonight\nis another&mdash;one of the most encouraging. As President Smith has said, you are not here out of\ncuriosity. You are not here because of any special attraction. You are here because you\nrespect your calling. You honor your priesthood because of the sense of the responsibility that\nyou carry. Each of you who holds the priesthood carries a certain amount of responsibility for\nthe success of God's work. That realization that willingness to respond to duty, has brought\ntogether tonight on this September 30, 1950, the largest assembly of priesthood, I believe,\never held in the Church at a priesthood meeting.\n<\/p><p>\nThe assembly of itself is an inspiration, especially when you contemplate its significance, and\nrealize that in the brotherhood of Christ we are all one, supporting one another. It is sublime.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray for your sympathy, for your faith and prayers, and above all, for the inspiration of the\nLord, that what I may say may be of worth, of interest, and contributive to the advancement\nof God's work.\n<\/p><p>\nNEED OF REVERENCE\n<\/p><p>\nI have, really, on my mind but one message. I am going to say one appeal for this vast\naudience of leaders. I believe there is one great need in the Church which you presidencies of\nstakes, bishoprics of wards, presidencies of quorums, and officers in auxiliaries, can supply. I\nhave in mind the need of more reverence in our houses of worship, better order and discipline\nin our classrooms, in quorum meetings and in auxiliary groups.\n<\/p><p>\nThe more we try to cultivate the attributes of the Savior, the stronger we become in character\nand in spirituality, and those are the two great purposes of life, so to live that we may be\nsusceptible to the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and to his guidance.\n<\/p><p>\nOVERCOME EVIL TENDENCIES\n<\/p><p>\nI do not know who it was who wrote many years ago that the whole purpose of life might be\nsummed up in these words: \"To subdue matter that we might realize the ideal.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I first read that I thought I could paraphrase it and say, \"The whole purpose of life is to\nbring under subjection the animal passions, proclivities and tendencies, that we might realize\nthe companionship, always, of God's Holy Spirit.\" I think that is the ideal. One chief purpose\nof life is to overcome evil tendencies, to govern our appetites, to control our passions&mdash;anger,\nhatred, jealousy, immorality. We have to overcome them: we have to subject them, conquer\nthem, because God has said: \"My spirit will not dwell in unclean tabernacles, nor will it\nalways strive with man\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23564\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23564)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23564)\">Gen. 6:3<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40233\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40233)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40233)\">Mosiah 2:37<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA DIVINE ATTRIBUTE\n<\/p><p>\nThe principle of self-control lies at the basis of reverence and good order in classrooms. I do\nnot know how to define reverence but I do know how to classify or to place it as one of the\nobjectives of nobility, indeed, one of the attributes of deity.\n<\/p><p>\nLove is the divinest attribute of the human soul. I am not so sure but sympathy is next to\nit&mdash;sympathy for the afflicted, for suffering animals, for our brethren and sisters. That is a\nGod-like virtue.\n<\/p><p>\nKindness is also a sublime virtue. The first sentence in what is now known as the Psalm of\nLove is this: \"Love suffereth long and is kind\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"188\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 188)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(188)\">1 Cor. 13:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHowever, in my thought tonight, I am prompted to place reverence next to Love. Jesus\nmentioned it first in the Lord's prayer: \"Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy\nname . . .\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34338\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34338)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34338)\">Matt. 6:9<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31262\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31262)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31262)\">Luke 11:2<\/a><\/span>). Hallow&mdash;to make holy&mdash;to hold in reverence.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Jesus cleansed the temple, he was filled with reverent indignation because men were\ndesecrating his Father's house, selling doves and lambs to be offered as sacrifice\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34364\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34364)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34364)\">Matt. 21:12<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27394\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27394)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27394)\">John 2:13-17<\/a><\/span>). Money\nchangers were there for the convenience of those who came from other countries, so they\ncould give in local currency their temple contributions. Seemingly, in their own eyes, they\nwere justified, but they were doing these things in the House of God. We are told that he\noverturned the money changers' tables, and said to the sellers of doves, \"Take these things\nhence. Make not my Father's house a house of merchandise\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27397\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27397)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27397)\">John 2:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nREVERENCE DEFINED\n<\/p><p>\n\"Reverence,\" wrote Ruskin, \"is the noblest state in which a man can live in\nthe world. Reverence is one of the signs of strength; irreverence one of the surest indications\nof weakness. No man will rise high who jeers at sacred things. The fine loyalties of life must\nbe reverenced or they will be foresworn in the day of trial.\"\n<\/p><p>\nCharles Jefferson, the author of \"The Character of Jesus\" writes: \"Men in many circles are\nclever, interesting, brilliant, but they lack one of the three dimensions of life. They have no\nreach upward. Their conversation sparkles, but it is frivolous and often flippant. Their talk is\nwitty, but the wit is often at the expense of high and sacred things.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYou can tell a true soul of wit by the things of which he makes light. The best humorous\nwriters avoid making light of religion, or of sacred things.\n<\/p><p>\nJefferson continues: \"One finds this lack of reverence even in the church. In every community\nthere are those who treat the House of God as they treat a streetcar, entering it and leaving it\nwhen they please. Even habitual church attendants often surprise and shock one by their\nirreverent behavior in the House of Prayer. Those persons are not ignoramuses or barbarians;\nthey are simply undeveloped in the virtue of reverence.\n<\/p><p>\nORDER IN CLASSROOMS\n<\/p><p>\nOur classrooms are sometimes places of boisterousness. Here is where we need good teachers.\nA teacher who can present a lesson interestingly will have good order, and when he or she\nfinds students who are rebellious, flipping papers, paying no attention, stumbling, kicking one\nanother, he or she may know that the lesson is not being properly presented. Perhaps it was\nnot even properly prepared.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of our mothers recently went to a Sunday School class to try to find out why her son\nwas losing interest. There was so much boisterousness, so much confusion, so much noise,\nthat she felt heartsick; and as she arose to leave she said to the teacher: \"I thought this was a\nSunday School class, not bedlam!\"\n<\/p><p>\nSELF-CONTROL EXEMPLIFIED\n<\/p><p>\nI have said something about self-control, self-mastery, as being one of the fundamental\npurposes of life. You see it exemplified in the life of the Savior, on the Mount of Temptation,\nwhen he resisted the tempter, who said: \"If thou be the Son of God, command that these\nstones be made bread,\"&mdash;an appeal to his appetite. \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by\nevery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34326\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34326)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34326)\">Matt. 4:3-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"If thou be the Son of God,\" again strong in his taunting, \"Cast thyself down; for it is\nwritten\"&mdash;he quotes scripture&mdash;\"He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their\nhands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34329\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34329)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34329)\">Matt. 4:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"It is written,\" said the Savior, \"Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34330\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34330)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34330)\">Matt. 4:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the next temptation Satan is not taunting, but pleading. \"All these things will I give thee,\"\nshowing him the kingdoms of the world, \"if thou wilt fall down and worship me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34331\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34331)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34331)\">Matt. 4:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat is a lesson of life. The tempter was foiled, taunting at first, strong in his assurance that\nhe could tempt, but at last pleading, and finally banished. \"Get thee hence, Satan, for it is\nwritten, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34332\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34332)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34332)\">Matt. 4:10<\/a><\/span>). And angels\ncame and administered to him (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50048\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50048)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50048)\">Matt. 4:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow then, there is a lesson of life to us all. Satan tauntingly tempts us, and unless we resist\nand have in mind a higher goal than the mere indulgence or gratification of the physical, we\nare going to weaken, and the tempter will gain in strength.\n<\/p><p>\nTO BEGIN IN CHILDHOOD\n<\/p><p>\nThe lesson of self-control should begin in childhood, in the home. Little children should have\na sense of freedom to do as they wish up to a certain point. Beyond that point they cannot go,\nand that is when that freedom interferes with the rights, comfort or convenience of another\nmember of the family.\n<\/p><p>\nI have told before about an incident that occurred in a zoo. It is simple, and some probably\nmay think we should not go to the monkeys for lessons. I think they can teach us some. Sister\nMcKay and I stood one day, I believe it was at San Diego, watching a mother monkey with a\nnew born babe. She was guarding it, her quick eye watching the other monkeys in the cage;\nbut the little babe was free to do just as it pleased, hopping around, weak in its infancy,\ngetting hold of the bars, starting to climb. When it would reach a certain place, the mother\nwould reach up and bring it back. When it got into a danger point, that mother instinctively\nguarded it and said, \"Back this way.\" And then the babe was free again, but only within\ncertain limits.\n<\/p><p>\nI said to Sister McKay, \"There is a lesson of life in guiding children.\"\n<\/p><p>\nRIGHTS OF OTHERS\n<\/p><p>\nIn the classrooms children should be taught, should be free to discuss, free to speak, free to\nparticipate in class work, but no member of the class has the right to distract another student\nby jostling or making light and frivolous remarks. And I think in this Church, in the\npriesthood quorums and classes and in auxiliaries, teachers and superintendents ought not to\npermit it. Disorder injures the child who makes it. He should learn that when he is in society\nthere are certain things which he cannot do with impunity. He cannot trespass upon the rights\nof his associates.\n<\/p><p>\nLet children learn this lesson in youth because when they get out in society\nand try to trespass against the law they will feel the restraining hand and probably suffer\npunishment.\n<\/p><p>\nGood order in the classroom is essential to instill into the hearts and lives of young men and\nyoung women the principle of self-control. They want to talk and they want to whisper, but\nthey cannot do it because it will disturb somebody else. Learn the power and lesson of\nself-mastery.\n<\/p><p>\nReverence should be particularly manifest in sacrament meeting in quorum meetings, in\nSunday School, in M.I.A., in Primary, yes and in Relief Society. This is a missionary Church.\nPeople come here for light and knowledge, for instruction, and they have a right to find it\nwhen they come.\n<\/p><p>\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER\n<\/p><p>\nThe following extract from a letter that came to the First Presidency last week will illustrate\nmy point: \n<\/p><p>\n\"About one month ago two of your missionaries came to my door with a Book of Mormon.\nSince I am a Catholic, and a Catholic writer for our press, and since I am fully acquainted\nwith Catholic doctrine and our Holy Bible, I at first refused the offer of the Book of Mormon.\nThey, however, persisted, and as I have permission to read other books, it being given me by\nmy pastor since I am a writer I finally took the book. Of course you might well guess what\nhappened. Having been trained during my sixteen years as a Catholic to recognize the truth\nwhen I see, hear or read it, I could not very well fail to recognize also that the Book of\nMormon is true. This was even more the case when they later brought what might be termed\nits companion book, The Doctrine and Covenants.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Surely this is not the kindly, gentle Jesus, as most Catholics are taught to know him, but just\nas surely in the Doctrine and Covenants this is the voice of Jesus as he spoke to the Apostles,\nthe Pharisees and scribes, and all the people during his three years of public ministry on earth.\nConsequently, I began taking instructions, and your missionaries came twice a week to hold\ncottage meetings.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Then I was taken to some Church meetings over in Rodeo three miles from here, and I must\nadmit that each time I have returned home broken-hearted and mourning to myself, 'Oh, poor\nJesus, surely you have made the most miserable failure in your life in trying to establish your\nChurch anew with these people.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"During the distribution of the bread and water I can discern no spirit of prayer or prayerful\nreception among the congregation. They are just as liable to be smiling and whispering\ntogether as not, scarcely discerning the body of the Lord.\"\n<\/p><p>\n       \"Your own defects to know,<br \/>\n       Make use of every friend and every foe.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIRREVERENCE IN SERVICES\n<\/p><p>\nOn September 13 there came to my desk this letter from one of our stake workers: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I refer to pronounced irreverence in our church services, with the noise, laughter and\nconfusion that often accompanies such a condition. This is responsible for considerable\ncriticism and dissatisfaction and results in absenting many members from the meetings. Our\nhome, stake missionaries, are seriously handicapped in their work as many fear to bring\ninvestigators to our meetings while this condition of irreverence prevails.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The trouble is often intensified by reason of frivolous remarks by speakers on the stand, and\noutbursts of laughter from the audience in which the children feel free to participate. This is a\nsad admission in connection with the true Church of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Irreverence in God's house is not conducive to the best interests of the sacrament\nadministration and God must be displeased with the insincerity of his children who partake of\nthe sacred emblems carelessly, devoid of reverence that should characterize true worship.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIMPROVEMENT NOTED\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to say here that my observation leads me to believe that we have made a\nwonderful step in that. I have not been in a house of worship, either in Sunday School or in\nsacrament meeting, where the order during the administering of the sacrament has not been\njust as perfect as it is at this moment in this building. A baby's voice, perhaps, somewhere,\nbut God is not displeased with a baby's voice, when the parents and others are reverently\nthinking of the covenants they are making. However, the writer of this letter seems to have\nhad a different experience.\n<\/p><p>\nI plead with you to develop this Christ-like attribute of reverence in our houses of worship\nand better discipline in our classrooms. And I believe that you brethren can lead in it.\n<\/p><p>\nELDERS EXAMPLE FOLLOWED\n<\/p><p>\nI remember in 1923, attending a conference at Burnley, Liverpool Conference. Brothers and\nsisters came from various parts of the district, and happy to see one another as you\nmissionaries know they are, shaking hands, members of the Church happy to see the elders,\nshaking hands with them, and the elders joining in social greetings.\n<\/p><p>\nThe meeting was held on the third floor of a public hall. In the adjoining room the sisters\nwere preparing the lunch. We could hear the rattle of tin pans and of other receptacles. Ten\no'clock came and there was still noise. It was fully five minutes before there was order.\n<\/p><p>\nSix months from that time when we held a meeting with the elders in that district, prior to the\nopening of the conference, we said: \"Brethren, the Lord is not displeased with our greetings,\nexpressions of love and brotherhood, but he is displeased with the irreverent\nattitude, and we have some choice people, strangers who are not used to this free intercourse\nof greetings so characteristic of Latter-day Saint meetings. So tomorrow morning, after you\nhave greeted your friends from various places, without any announcement, at seven minutes to\nten o'clock, you quietly take your seats. Do not say a word. You just go to your assigned\nplaces.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThey did so and at four minutes to ten o'clock every member of that district in attendance at\nthe conference, following the example of the missionaries, was in his or her seat, and there\nwas order even before the hour of opening arrived.\n<\/p><p>\nREVERENCE ENJOINED\n<\/p><p>\nIt is said that \"Where two or three are gathered in my name there will I be to bless them\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34363\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34363)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34363)\">Matt. 18:20<\/a><\/span>),\nand I tell you when he is present we should be reverent.\n<\/p><p>\nSomeone said if Shakespeare were to enter this hall tonight, we should all stand up to greet\nhim, but if Christ entered, we should fall on our knees and worship him.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you, brethren, as leaders in Israel, as guides to youth to increase your influence\nwith those among whom you labor. The Lord help us to sanctify our houses of worship, that\nour chapels may be indeed sacred places in which we meet to worship God, I pray, in the\nname of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
