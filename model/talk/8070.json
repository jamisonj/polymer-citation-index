Our hearts have been touched and our faith strengthened as we have partaken of the spirit which has been present during these conference sessions. As we conclude, we thank our Heavenly Father for His many blessings to us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/until-we-meet-again.p5\" class=\"\" id=\"p5\">We have been lifted and inspired by the beautiful music that has been provided during the sessions.

We will miss them. Their contributions to the work of the Lord have been enormous and will be felt throughout generations to come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/until-we-meet-again.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">May we return to our homes with a resolve in our hearts to be a little better than we have been in the past. May we be a little kinder and more thoughtful. May we reach out in helpfulness, not only to our fellow members but also to those who are not of our faith. As we associate with them, may we show our respect for them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/until-we-meet-again.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">There are those who struggle every day with challenges.
