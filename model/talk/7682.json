Different as we are in circumstances and experiences, we share a desire to become better than we are. There may be a few who mistakenly feel they are good enough and a few who have given up trying to be better. But, for all, the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is that we can and must expect to become better as long as we live.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/our-perfect-example.p7\" class=\"\">Part of that expectation is set for us in a revelation given by God to the Prophet Joseph Smith.

We believe that through living the gospel of Jesus Christ we can become like the Savior, who is perfect.

I remember watching the faces of a room full of children singing it on a Sunday. Each of the children was leaning forward, almost to the front of the chair. I could see light in their eyes and determination in their faces as they sang with gusto. You may have heard the song too. I hope it will sound forever in our memories.

Jesus Christ was their example. To be like Him was their fixed goal. And their eager looks and their shining eyes convinced me that they had no doubts. They expected to succeed. They believed that the instruction of the Savior to be perfect was not a hope but a command. And they were sure He had prepared the way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/our-perfect-example.p20\" class=\"\">That determination and confidence can and must be in the heart of every Latter-day Saint. The Savior has prepared the way through His Atonement and His example. And even the children who sang that song knew how.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/our-perfect-example.p21\" class=\"\">Love is the motivating principle by which the Lord leads us along the way towards becoming like Him, <span class=\"emphasis\">our perfect example.<\/span> Our way of life, hour by hour, must be filled with the love of God and love for others. There is no surprise in that, since the Lord proclaimed those as the first and great commandments. It is love of God that will lead us to keep His commandments. And love of others is at the heart of our capacity to obey Him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/our-perfect-example.p22\" class=\"\">Just as Jesus used a child in His mortal ministry as an example for the people of the pure love they must and could have to be like Him, He has offered us the family as an example of an ideal setting in which we can learn how to love as He loves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/our-perfect-example.p23\" class=\"\">That is because the greatest joys and the greatest sorrows we experience are in family relationships. The joys come from putting the welfare of others above our own. That is what love is. And the sorrow comes primarily from selfishness, which is the absence of love. The ideal God holds for us is to form families in the way most likely to lead to happiness and away from sorrow. A man and a woman are to make sacred covenants that they will put the welfare and happiness of the other at the center of their lives. Children are to be born into a family where the parents hold the needs of children equal to their own in importance. And children are to love parents and each other.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/our-perfect-example.p24\" class=\"\">That is the ideal of a loving family. In many of our homes, there are the words \u201cOur Family Can Be Together Forever.\u201d There is a gravestone near my home of a mother and grandmother. She and her husband were sealed in the temple of God to each other and to their posterity for time and all eternity. The inscription on the gravestone reads, \u201cPlease, no empty chairs.\u201d She asked for that inscription because she knew that whether the family will be together depends on the choices each family member makes. The word \u201cplease\u201d is there because neither God nor she can compel another to choose happiness. And there is Satan, who wants misery, not happiness, in families in this life and in the next.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/our-perfect-example.p25\" class=\"\">My hope today is to suggest some choices which may seem difficult but that would assure you that you have qualified for there to be no empty chairs in your family in the world to come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/our-perfect-example.p26\" class=\"\">First, I give counsel to husbands and wives. Pray for the love which allows you to see the good in your companion. Pray for the love that makes weaknesses and mistakes seem small. Pray for the love to make your companion\u2019s joy your own. Pray for the love to want to lessen the load and soften the sorrows of your companion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/our-perfect-example.p27\" class=\"\">I saw this in my parents\u2019 marriage. In my mother\u2019s final illness, the more uncomfortable she became, the more giving her comfort became the dominant intent of my father\u2019s life. He asked that the hospital set up a bed in her room. He was determined to be there to be sure that she wanted for nothing. He walked the miles to work each morning and back to her side at night through those difficult times for her. I believe it was a gift from God to him that his power to love grew when it mattered so much to her. I think he was doing what Jesus would have done out of love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/our-perfect-example.p28\" class=\"\">Now I give counsel to the parents of a wandering child. The Savior is the perfect example of persisting in love. You remember His words of comfort to the people among the Nephites who had rejected His earlier invitation to come to Him. He spoke to the survivors of the destruction which came after His Crucifixion: \u201cO ye house of Israel whom I have spared, how oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and return unto me with full purpose of heart.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-04211_000_024\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"119474\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 119474)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(119474)\">3\u00a0Nephi 10:6<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/our-perfect-example.p29\" class=\"\">The story of the prodigal son gives us all hope.

You may not have parents that are living. In some cases, you may not feel that your parents are worthy of the honor and respect of their children. You may not even have ever known them.

And in every case, even if your life is not lengthened, its quality will be improved simply by remembering your parents with honor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/our-perfect-example.p32\" class=\"\">Now to those who have adopted other people\u2019s families as if they were their own: I have friends who remember my children\u2019s birthdays better than I do. My wife and I have had friends who seldom failed to visit or to remember a holiday with us. I often am touched when someone begins a conversation, \u201cHow is your family?\u201d and then waits to hear the answer with love showing in their face. They seem attentive when I go through a description of the life of each of my children. Their love helps me to feel more keenly the love of the Savior for our children.

It will help to remember how you have felt, at times, like a little child, even in the midst of cares and trials. Think of those children singing the song.
