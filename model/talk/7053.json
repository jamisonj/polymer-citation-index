Knight. It was the only time I ever met him. After he pronounced my lineage, his next words\u2014the first words of counsel in my blessing\u2014were \u201cRemember the teachings of your father.\u201d That counsel has been and continues to be a great blessing in my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/remember-the-teachings-of-your-father.p5\" class=\"\">Not long after receiving my blessing, I came home from Sunday School. Our lesson had been about Joseph Smith\u2019s First Vision, and I was wondering if it was really true. My father was leaving for a Church meeting. I stopped him and asked, \u201cDad, how do we really know that Joseph Smith had that vision?\u201d My father put his arm around me, and we sat on the sofa in our living room. There he shared with me the Prophet Joseph\u2019s account, and my father bore his own testimony of its truthfulness. That experience with my father burns in my heart today. Since then I have never doubted the Prophet Joseph\u2019s account of his First Vision.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/remember-the-teachings-of-your-father.p6\" class=\"\">Over my teenage years, I remember vividly my father\u2019s regular study of the Book of Mormon. His love of the Book of Mormon and counsel to me to study and ponder over it were the beginning of a journey with that sacred record that is the foundation of my personal testimony today. It is a journey each of us must take.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/remember-the-teachings-of-your-father.p7\" class=\"\">Others along the way helped me on my personal journey with the Book of Mormon. My first seminary teacher shared her experience as a young missionary wanting to know if the Book of Mormon was true. She told of reading King Benjamin\u2019s speech and in her mind\u2019s eye seeing King Benjamin standing on his tower and hearing him deliver that great sermon. Her testimony, accompanied by the Spirit, left a deep impression upon my mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/remember-the-teachings-of-your-father.p8\" class=\"\">I remember the summer before entering college having the chance to go to Monument Valley to work on the first high school built there for the Navajo people. As I was about to leave home, my father asked me if I was going to take my Book of Mormon. I hadn\u2019t thought to, but I paid heed to his question. I remember lying in my bunk late at night at the construction site and feeling the spirit and power of the Book of Mormon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/remember-the-teachings-of-your-father.p9\" class=\"\">I remember as a young missionary in the Great Lakes Mission coming to that great knowledge and absolute testimony that the Book of Mormon was another witness of another nation that Jesus is the Christ and this Church is true. From those experiences there burns in my heart today that divine witness of the message of the Book of Mormon, of Christ as our Savior and Redeemer, and of the Restoration of His Church in these latter days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/remember-the-teachings-of-your-father.p10\" class=\"\">I want to share with you some of the great blessings the Book of Mormon can bring to us. The Book of Mormon can and does change lives. After our son John received his mission call to Japan, he said to me, \u201cDad, before I enter the Missionary Training Center, I am going to read the Book of Mormon twice.\u201d I said to John, \u201cThat is quite a demanding goal.\u201d I felt his resolve and made the decision to follow his example. I began reading early each morning. A few days later when I came home from work, John said to me, \u201cI caught up with you today.\u201d I asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d His response, \u201cI caught up to where you are in the Book of Mormon. You left it open on your desk.\u201d The next morning after my reading, I felt inspired to turn about 150 pages past where I was. I left my Book of Mormon open where he could not miss it and went to work. After a meeting that morning, I checked my voice mail. The very first message said, \u201cYeah, sure, Dad!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/remember-the-teachings-of-your-father.p11\" class=\"\">Why this story? As I watched my son read from the Book of Mormon, I began to see a special change in his life as he prepared to enter the Missionary Training Center. That experience has anchored my son to the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/remember-the-teachings-of-your-father.p12\" class=\"\">I recall an experience with a zone leader in England who came to me during the lunch break at zone conference. He said, \u201cWe are teaching a lady who is blind and nearly deaf. She wants to know if the Book of Mormon is true. What shall we do?\u201d I did not have an answer at that moment, but I said, \u201cI will let you know after our conference.\u201d During the afternoon session I had the distinct impression come as to how to help her. After the meeting I said to the zone leader, \u201cHave this sister hold her copy of the Book of Mormon and turn its pages very slowly. When she has done this, have her ask if it is true.\u201d Though she could not read nor hear the words, she felt the spirit and power of the Book of Mormon, and it changed her life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/remember-the-teachings-of-your-father.p13\" class=\"\">I have come to love the message of the Book of Mormon.

In this regard, Elder Bruce R.
