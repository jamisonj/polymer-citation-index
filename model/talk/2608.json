I approach it with all the humility and with the profound respect it commands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-sanctity-of-life.p4\" class=\"\">I have chosen to speak on the sanctity of life. I desire also to speak with reverence about the hallowed hallmark of life, which is the ability to reproduce itself. I wish also to be an advocate for the unborn. For this reason I direct my remarks primarily to women, because only they can honor the holy calling of motherhood, which is the most exalted good that can be rendered to mankind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-sanctity-of-life.p5\" class=\"\">In the Talmud we read that he who saves one life is as if he had saved an entire world. Since the beginning of man, God has taught of an absolute respect for human life. From the very first moment of his being until the last breath of his life, there is a veneration for life which includes those in being, but not yet born.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-sanctity-of-life.p6\" class=\"\">One wise teacher tells us, \u201cOne human life is as precious as a million lives, for each is infinite in value.\u201d (Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits, <span class=\"emphasis\">Jewish Views on Abortion,<\/span> p. 4.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-sanctity-of-life.p7\" class=\"\">The exercise of a man or woman\u2019s sacred procreative powers makes each a partner with God in creation and brings to them in parenthood their greatest happiness. This divine partnership also brings their greatest privileges and most weighty responsibilities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-sanctity-of-life.p8\" class=\"\">Since becoming a parent is such a transcending blessing, and since each child is so precious and brings so much happiness, a cardinal purpose of marriage and of life itself is to bring forth new life within this partnership with God. Obligations inherent in the creation of precious human life are a sacred trust, which if faithfully kept, will keep us from degenerating into moral bankrupts and from becoming mere addicts of lust.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-sanctity-of-life.p9\" class=\"\">The responsibilities involved in the divine life-giving process, and the functions of our body, are so sacrosanct that they are to be exercised only within the marriage relationship. Those who do not accept and meet those responsibilities, for any reason, as well as those who do, should never depart from the law of chastity if they wish to be truly happy. All members of this Church seeking eternal joy and peace are expected to and will wish to come to the marriage altar free from sexual transgressions\u2014chaste and pure. Any who fail to do so may find that they have cheated themselves of their own self-respect, dignity, and much of the great joy they seek in marriage. Because of the special inner peace, strength, and happiness it brings, chastity, as the law of God, is and always has been really \u201cin,\u201d and unchastity is and always has been really \u201cout.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-sanctity-of-life.p10\" class=\"\">In times past we have looked upon a person who saves another human life as a great hero; yet now we have come to a time when the taking of an unborn human life for nonmedical reasons has become tolerated, made legal, and accepted in many countries of the world. But making it legal to destroy newly conceived life will never make it right. It is consummately wrong.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-sanctity-of-life.p11\" class=\"\">President Spencer W.

This is contrary to insurmountable medical evidence. Dr. Bernard N. Nathanson recently revealed that he was among those who were militantly outspoken in favor of legalized abortion and joined in using every device available in political action to promote it. He helped set up and became director of the first and largest abortion clinic in the western world. After the center had performed some sixty thousand abortions, Dr. Nathanson resigned as director. He said, \u201cI am deeply troubled by my own increasing certainty that I had in fact presided over 60,000 deaths. There is no longer serious doubt in my mind that human life exists within the womb from the very onset of pregnancy.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">New England Journal of Medicine,<\/span> vol. 291, no. 22, p. 1189.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-sanctity-of-life.p13\" class=\"\">Way back in the sixteenth century, Arantius showed that maternal and fetal circulations were separate, thus clearly demonstrating that there are two separate lives involved. The unborn babe is certainly alive, because it possesses the token of life which is the ability to reproduce dying cells. (Dr. Eugene F.

(Dr. James H. Ford, M.D., <span class=\"emphasis\">California Medical Journal,<\/span> Nov. 1972, pp. 80\u201384.) Some justify abortions because the unborn may have been exposed to drugs or disease and may have birth defects. Where in all the world is the physically or mentally perfect man or woman? Is life not worth living unless it is free of handicaps? Experience in working with handicapped children would suggest that human nature frequently rises above its impediments and that in Shakespeare\u2019s words, \u201cThey say best men are molded out of faults, And, for the most, become much more the better For being a little bad\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Measure for Measure,<\/span> 5, i, 445) in the physical sense.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-sanctity-of-life.p18\" class=\"\">Many parents who have known the heartache and concern of caring for a handicapped child would agree with Pearl Buck, Nobel prize-winning author who said, \u201cA retarded child, a handicapped person, brings its own gift to life, even to the life of normal human beings.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Death Before Birth,<\/span> the Constitutional Right to Life Committee, Providence, Rhode Island.)

I quote, \u201cAbortion must be considered one of the most revolting and sinful practices in this day. \u2026 Members of the Church guilty of being parties to the sin of abortion must be subjected to the disciplinary action of the councils of the Church as circumstances warrant.\u201d Members are counseled neither \u201cto submit to or perform an abortion except in the rare cases where\u201d it is medically necessary, and, as the First Presidency has further counseled, \u201ceven then it should be done only after counseling with the local presiding priesthood authority and after receiving divine confirmation through prayer.\u201d The First Presidency has advised that it will be amenable to the laws of repentance and forgiveness.

Psychiatric experts remind us that there are certain fundamental, biological facts which influence the psyche of those who bring new life into the world. One says, \u201cThe ability of mothers to accept infants after they are born is underrated and underestimated.\u201d (Dr. S. Bolter, <span class=\"emphasis\">American Journal of Psychiatry,<\/span> Oct. 1962, pp. 312\u201316.) Childbearing is a basic biological and psychological, privileged function of womankind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-sanctity-of-life.p22\" class=\"\">One of the most evil myths of our day is that a woman who has joined hands with God in creation can destroy that creation because she claims the right to control her own body.

Whenever and wherever it occurs, we all suffer another loss from that little which sustains us and holds us together. It is the degradation of humanity. It is fulness emptied, innocence defiled, song unfinished, beauty discarded, hope unsprung.
