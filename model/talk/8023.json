Shortly after taking possession of the new vehicle, my friend wanted to demonstrate the utility of the truck and validate his reasons for wanting to purchase it. So he decided he would cut and haul a supply of firewood for their home. It was in the autumn of the year, and snow already had fallen in the mountains where he intended to find wood. As he drove up the mountainside, the snow gradually became deeper and deeper. My friend recognized the slick road conditions presented a risk, but with great confidence in the new truck, he kept going.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/bear-up-their-burdens-with-ease.p11\" class=\"\">Sadly, my friend went too far along the snowy road. As he steered the truck off of the road at the place he had determined to cut wood, he got stuck. All four of the wheels on the new truck spun in the snow. He readily recognized that he did not know what to do to extricate himself from this dangerous situation. He was embarrassed and worried.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/bear-up-their-burdens-with-ease.p12\" class=\"\">My friend decided, \u201cWell, I will not just sit here.\u201d He climbed out of the vehicle and started cutting wood. He completely filled the back of the truck with the heavy load. And then my friend determined he would try driving out of the snow one more time. As he put the pickup into gear and applied power, he started to inch forward. Slowly the truck moved out of the snow and back onto the road. He finally was free to go home, a happy and humbled man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"topic\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Our Individual Load<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/bear-up-their-burdens-with-ease.p14\" class=\"\">I pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost as I emphasize vital lessons that can be learned from this story about my friend, the truck, and the wood. It was the load. It was the load of wood that provided the traction necessary for him to get out of the snow, to get back on the road, and to move forward. It was the load that enabled him to return to his family and his home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/bear-up-their-burdens-with-ease.p15\" class=\"\">Each of us also carries a load. Our individual load is comprised of demands and opportunities, obligations and privileges, afflictions and blessings, and options and constraints. Two guiding questions can be helpful as we periodically and prayerfully assess our load: \u201cIs the load I am carrying producing the spiritual traction that will enable me to press forward with faith in Christ on the strait and narrow path and avoid getting stuck? Is the load I am carrying creating sufficient spiritual traction so I ultimately can return home to Heavenly Father?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/bear-up-their-burdens-with-ease.p16\" class=\"\">Sometimes we mistakenly may believe that happiness is the absence of a load. But bearing a load is a necessary and essential part of the plan of happiness. Because our individual load needs to generate spiritual traction, we should be careful to not haul around in our lives so many nice but unnecessary things that we are distracted and diverted from the things that truly matter most.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"topic\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>The Strengthening Power of the Atonement<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/bear-up-their-burdens-with-ease.p18\" class=\"\">The Savior said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/bear-up-their-burdens-with-ease.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/bear-up-their-burdens-with-ease.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/bear-up-their-burdens-with-ease.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129665\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129665)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129665)\">Matthew 11:28\u201330<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/bear-up-their-burdens-with-ease.p22\" class=\"\">A yoke is a wooden beam, normally used between a pair of oxen or other animals that enables them to pull together on a load.
