It is interesting to me that John spoke to Joseph and Oliver, when they were both young men and when they were not highly regarded by people of the world, as his fellow servants. He did not speak down to them as a king might speak to one of his subjects. He did not speak down to them as a judge might speak to an individual on trial before him. He did not speak down to them as a university president or a high school principal might speak to his students. Rather, he who was a resurrected being addressed these young men as his fellow servants. To me there is something wonderful in this. It speaks of the true spirit of the great and magnificent brotherhood of which we are all a part, the priesthood of God. We are all servants together, regardless of our position in the Church or in the world, regardless of wealth or lack of it, regardless of the color of our skin\u2014we are all servants together, brothers one to another and sons of God as a part of this great body of sacred priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p11\" class=\"\">That should mean something to each of us. It does not demean us or put us down in any way. It elevates all of us as fellow servants of the Lord in the responsibility of carrying on the work of the ministry in his Church. You and I, including all of the Brethren seated on the stand in this Tabernacle, and each of you out across the Church in many places, are all fellow servants of the Lord; we hold the holy priesthood and have the right to exercise it in the work of which we are a part. I hope you will never forget this, particularly you young men.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p12\" class=\"\">The next phrase to which I bring your attention denotes the authority in which John spoke. Said he, \u201cin the name of Messiah.\u201d None of us exercises this priesthood in the power or authority which we have naturally within ourselves. Always in the exercise of the priesthood we do it in the authority of Messiah. Who was Messiah? He was Jesus Christ, the Son of God. John might have said \u201cin the name of Jesus Christ,\u201d as we usually do. I hope you will never forget that in exercising your priesthood as young men, whether in passing the sacrament, in serving as a home teacher, in administering the sacrament, or in baptizing, you are acting as a servant of the Lord in his holy name and by his divine authority.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p13\" class=\"\">Boys, if you will remember this, it will have a tremendous influence upon your lives. You will know that if you are to serve in the name of Jesus Christ, as one holding the priesthood, you cannot with propriety be dishonest, you cannot abuse your bodies with drugs or alcohol or tobacco, you cannot take the name of the Lord in vain, you cannot be morally unclean. You hold the priesthood which authorizes you to act in the name of Jesus Christ. I plead with you tonight to live worthy of the exercise of this priesthood at all times and under all circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p14\" class=\"\">Then John the Baptist, in his bestowal of this authority, spoke concerning the powers of this priesthood.

A Priest holds the keys of the ministering of angels,\u201d said he. \u201cNever in my life, as an Apostle, as a Seventy, or as an Elder, have I ever had more of the protection of the Lord than while holding the office of a Priest.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Millennial Star,<\/span> 53:629.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p16\" class=\"\">Think of it, my dear young brethren. This priesthood which you hold carries with it the keys of the ministering of angels. That means, as I interpret it, that if you live worthy of the priesthood, you have the right to receive and enjoy the very power of heavenly beings to guide you, to protect you, to bless you. What boy, if he is thoughtful, would not welcome this remarkable blessing?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p17\" class=\"\">In the same talk from which I quoted a statement from President Woodruff, he also said: \u201cAfter I came to these valleys and returned to Winter Quarters, I was sent to Boston by President Brigham Young. \u2026 While on the road there, I drove my carriage one evening into the yard of Brother Williams. Brother Orson Hyde drove a wagon by the side of mine. I had my wife and children in the carriage. After I turned out my team and had my supper I went to bed in the carriage. I had not been there but a few minutes when the Spirit said to me, \u2018Get up and move that carriage.\u2019 I told my wife I had to get up and move the carriage. She said, \u2018What for?\u2019 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 That is all she asked me on such occasions; when I told her I did not know, that was enough. I got up and moved my carriage four or five rods, and put the off fore wheel against the corner of the house. I then looked around me and went to bed. The same Spirit said, \u2018Go and move your animals from that oak tree.\u2019 They were two hundred yards from where my carriage was. I went and moved my horses, and put them in a little hickory grove. I again went to bed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cIn thirty minutes a whirlwind came up and broke that oak tree off within two feet from the ground. It swept over three or four fences and fell square in that dooryard, near Brother Orson Hyde\u2019s wagon, and right where mine had stood. What would have been the consequences if I had not listened to that Spirit? Why, myself and wife and children doubtless would have been killed. That was the still, small voice to me\u2014no earthquake, no thunder, no lightning\u2014but the still, small voice of the Spirit of God. It saved my life. It was the spirit of revelation to me.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Millennial Star,<\/span> 53:642\u20133.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p19\" class=\"\">Such was the testimony of a great and wise and prayerful man who became the President of the Church.

The place was this Tabernacle. It was in commemoration of President Woodruff\u2019s ninetieth birthday. This great building was filled to capacity with all seats occupied and the aisles packed in every part of the building, such as we are not permitted to do now. It is estimated there were more than ten thousand young people present\u2014a vast congregation of young men your age and young women of the same age. President Woodruff, who was then weak in body and whose voice was not strong, stood at the pulpit where I stand and said, particularly to the young men present, these words:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cI have passed through the periods of boyhood, early manhood and old age. I cannot expect to tarry a great while longer with you, but I want to give you a few words of counsel. You occupy a position in the Church and Kingdom of God and have received the power of the holy priesthood. The God of heaven has appointed you and called you forth in this day and generation. I want you to look at this. Young men listen to the counsel of your brethren. Live near to God; pray while young; learn to pray; learn to cultivate the Holy Spirit of God; link it to you and it will become a spirit of revelation unto you, inasmuch as you nourish it. \u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p31\" class=\"\">He went on to say: \u201cGod in heaven has willed to spare me to see this day.
