I am honored yet humbled by the responsibility which is mine to address a few remarks to you. I pray for the Spirit of the Lord to attend me as I do so.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p5\" class=\"\" id=\"p5\">Seventy-five years ago, on February\u00a014, 1939, in Hamburg, Germany, a public holiday was celebrated. Amid fervent speeches, cheering throngs, and the playing of patriotic anthems, the new battleship <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> was put to sea via the River Elbe. This, the most powerful vessel afloat, was a breathtaking spectacle of armor and machinery. Construction required more than 57,000 blueprints for the 380-millimeter, radar-controlled, double-gun turrets. The vessel featured 28,000 miles (45,000 km) of electrical circuits. It weighed over 35,000 tons, and armor plate provided maximum safety. Majestic in appearance, gigantic in size, awesome in firepower, the mighty colossus was considered unsinkable.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">The <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span>\u2019s appointment with destiny came more than two years later, when on May\u00a024, 1941, the two most powerful warships in the British Navy, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Prince of Wales<\/span> and the <span class=\"emphasis\">Hood,<\/span> engaged in battle the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> and the German cruiser <span class=\"emphasis\">Prinz Eugen.<\/span> Within five minutes the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> had sent to the depths of the Atlantic the <span class=\"emphasis\">Hood<\/span> and all but three men of a crew of over 1,400. The other British battleship, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Prince of Wales,<\/span> had suffered heavy damage and turned away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">Over the next three days the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> was engaged again and again by British warships and aircraft. In all, the British concentrated the strength of five battleships, two aircraft carriers, 11 cruisers, and 21 destroyers in an effort to find and to sink the mighty <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">During these battles, shell after shell inflicted only superficial damage on the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck.<\/span> Was it unsinkable after all? Then a torpedo scored a lucky hit, which jammed the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span>\u2019s rudder. Repair efforts proved fruitless. With guns primed and the crews at ready, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> could only steer a slow circle. Just beyond reach was the powerful German air force. The\u00a0<span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> could not reach the safety of home port. Neither could provide the needed haven, for the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> had lost the ability to steer a charted course. No rudder, no help, no port. The end drew near. British guns blazed as the German crew scuttled and sank the once seemingly indestructible vessel. The hungry waves of the Atlantic first lapped at the sides and then swallowed the pride of the German navy. The <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> was no more.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10911_000_026\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See Ludovic Kennedy, <span class=\"emphasis\">Pursuit: The Chase and Sinking of the Bismarck<\/span> (1974).]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">Like the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck,<\/span> each of us is a miracle of engineering. Our creation, however, was not limited by human genius. Man can devise the most complex machines but cannot give them life or bestow upon them the powers of reason and judgment. These are divine gifts, bestowed only by God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">Like the vital rudder of a ship, brethren, we have been provided a way to determine the direction we travel. The lighthouse of the Lord beckons to all as we sail the seas of life. Our purpose is to steer an undeviating course toward our desired goal\u2014even the celestial kingdom of God. A man without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder, never likely to reach home port. To us comes the signal: chart your course, set your sail, position your rudder, and proceed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">As with the mighty <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck,<\/span> so it is with man. The thrust of the turbines and the power of the propellers are useless without that sense of direction, that harnessing of the energy, that directing of the power provided by the rudder, hidden from view, relatively small in size but absolutely essential in function.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">Our Father provided the sun, the moon, and the stars\u2014heavenly galaxies to guide mariners who sail the lanes of the sea. To us, as we walk the pathway of life, He provides a clear map and points the way toward our desired destination. He cautions: beware the detours, the pitfalls, the traps. We cannot be deceived by those who would lead us astray, those clever pied pipers of sin beckoning here or there. Instead, we pause to pray; we listen to that still, small voice which speaks to the depths of our souls the Master\u2019s gentle invitation, \u201cCome, follow me.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-10911_000_026\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130149\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130149)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130149)\">Luke 18:22<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">Yet there are those who do not hear, who will not obey, who prefer to walk a path of their own making. Too often they succumb to the temptations which surround all of us and which can appear so enticing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">As bearers of the priesthood, we have been placed on earth in troubled times. We live in a complex world with currents of conflict everywhere to be found. Political schemes ruin the stability of nations, despots grasp for power, and segments of society seem forever downtrodden, deprived of opportunity and left with a feeling of failure. The sophistries of men ring in our ears, and sin surrounds us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">Ours is the responsibility to be worthy of all the glorious blessings our Father in Heaven has in store for us. Wherever we go, our priesthood goes with us. Are we standing in holy places? Please, before you put yourself and your priesthood in jeopardy by venturing into places or participating in activities which are not worthy of you or of that priesthood, pause to consider the consequences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">We who have been ordained to the priesthood of God can make a difference. When we maintain our personal purity and honor our priesthood, we become righteous examples for others to follow. The Apostle Paul admonished, \u201cBe thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-10911_000_026\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130150\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130150)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130150)\">1\u00a0Timothy 4:12<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> He also wrote that the followers of Christ should be \u201cas lights in the world.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-10911_000_026\">4<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130151\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130151)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130151)\">Philippians 2:15<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Providing an example of righteousness can help to illuminate an increasingly dark world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">Many of you will remember President N.\u00a0Eldon Tanner, who served as a counselor to four Presidents of the Church. He provided an undeviating example of righteousness throughout his career in industry, during service in the government in Canada, and as an Apostle of Jesus Christ. He gave us this inspired counsel: \u201cNothing will bring greater joy and success than to live according to the teachings of the gospel. Be an example; be an influence for good.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">He continued: \u201cEvery one of us has been foreordained for some work as [God\u2019s] chosen servant on whom he has seen fit to confer the priesthood and power to act in his name. Always remember that people are looking to you for leadership and you are influencing the lives of individuals either for good or for bad, which influence will be felt for generations to come.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-10911_000_026\">5<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[N.\u00a0Eldon Tanner, \u201cFor They Loved the Praise of Men More Than the Praise of God,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1975, 74.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">We are strengthened by the truth that the greatest force in the world today is the power of God as it works through man. To sail safely the seas of mortality, we need the guidance of that Eternal Mariner\u2014even the great Jehovah. We reach out, we reach up to obtain heavenly help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">A well-known example of one who did not reach upward is that of Cain, son of Adam and Eve. Powerful in potential but weak of will, Cain permitted greed, envy, disobedience, and even murder to jam that personal rudder which would have guided him to safety and exaltation. The downward gaze replaced the upward look; Cain fell.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">In another time and by a wicked king, a servant of God was tested. Aided by the inspiration of heaven, Daniel interpreted for the king the writing on the wall. Concerning the proffered rewards\u2014even a royal robe, a necklace of gold, and political power\u2014Daniel said, \u201cLet thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-10911_000_026\">6<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130152\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130152)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130152)\">Daniel 5:17<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Great riches and power had been offered to Daniel, rewards representing the things of the world and not of God. Daniel resisted and remained faithful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p22\" class=\"\" id=\"p22\">Later, when Daniel worshipped God despite a decree declaring such to be forbidden, he was thrown into a den of lions. The biblical account tells us that the following morning, \u201cDaniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in \u2026 God.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-10911_000_026\">7<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130153\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130153)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130153)\">Daniel 6:23<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> In a time of critical need, Daniel\u2019s determination to steer a steady course yielded divine protection and provided a sanctuary of safety. Such protection and safety can be ours as we also steer that steady course toward our eternal home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">The clock of history, like the sands of the hourglass, marks the passage of time. A new cast occupies the stage of life. The problems of our day loom ominously before us. Throughout the history of the world, Satan has worked tirelessly for the destruction of the followers of the Savior. If we succumb to his enticings, we\u2014like the mighty <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span>\u2014will lose that rudder which can guide us to safety. Instead, surrounded by the sophistication of modern living, we look heavenward for that unfailing sense of direction, that we might chart and follow a wise and proper course. Our Heavenly Father will not leave our sincere petition unanswered. As we seek heavenly help, our rudder, unlike that of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck,<\/span> will not fail.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p24\" class=\"\" id=\"p24\">As we venture forth on our individual voyages, may we sail safely the seas of life. May we have the courage of a Daniel, that we might remain true and faithful despite the sin and temptation which surround us. May our testimonies be as deep and as strong as that of Jacob, the brother of Nephi, who, when confronted by one who sought in every way possible to destroy his faith, declared, \u201cI could not be shaken.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-10911_000_026\">8<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130154\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130154)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130154)\">Jacob 7:5<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/guided-safely-home.p25\" class=\"\" id=\"p25\">With the rudder of faith guiding our passage, brethren, we too will find our way safely home\u2014home to God, to dwell with Him eternally.
