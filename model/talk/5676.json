After undergoing heart-bypass surgery two months ago, I am grateful to be able to stand anywhere.

Some people have suggested this may have contributed to my heart problems. I don\u2019t know about that, but I do know that our tour of these locations filled our souls with an ever greater love and respect for the Prophet Joseph Smith, for his family, and for the stalwarts who first embraced the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and became members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. What an extraordinary experience it was to teach my family from the Doctrine and Covenants while standing on the very ground where many of those revelations and instructions were received.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/hyrum-smith-firm-as-the-pillars-of-heaven.p5\" class=\"\">Visiting those inspirational sites and immersing ourselves as a family in the events of the Restoration reminded me again of the marvelous privilege we have to live in a day when we have such clear doctrinal understanding of our Heavenly Father\u2019s plan for the salvation and exaltation of his children. The clarity of our relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ and his restored church is precious, empowering knowledge for each one of us. I thank God that in these difficult days of moral decay and departure from sound values, we have no shortage of revealed truth to guide our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/hyrum-smith-firm-as-the-pillars-of-heaven.p6\" class=\"\">During the past several weeks of physical recovery, I have found myself with more time on my hands than I am accustomed to, with an unscheduled opportunity to think, to ponder, and to pray. I do not recommend the course of action that brought this gift of time to me, but I believe all of us would benefit from time to ponder and meditate. In the quiet moments of personal introspection, the Spirit can teach us much.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/hyrum-smith-firm-as-the-pillars-of-heaven.p7\" class=\"\">The Spirit has confirmed to me the important responsibility we have to see that the legacy of faith of our pioneer forefathers is never lost.

He knew the course his life would take, and he consciously chose to follow it. To Joseph, Hyrum became companion, protector, provider, confidant, and eventually joined him as a martyr. Unjust persecution engulfed them throughout their lives. Although he was older, Hyrum recognized his brother\u2019s divine mantle.

As chairman of the temple committee, Hyrum rallied the Church to perform the seemingly impossible task of building the Kirtland Temple when most Church members literally had nothing to give to the cause. A few years later he repeated this service with the building of the Nauvoo Temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/hyrum-smith-firm-as-the-pillars-of-heaven.p15\" class=\"\">Hyrum served in the Ohio bishopric, on the first high council, as Patriarch, counselor in the First Presidency, and finally as one of only two men ever to hold the office of Assistant President of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/hyrum-smith-firm-as-the-pillars-of-heaven.p16\" class=\"\">Hyrum served many missions for the Church.

He asked Joseph to inquire of the Lord what he should do. In section 11 of the Doctrine and Covenants we read the Lord\u2019s response: \u201cSeek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word. \u2026 Study my word which hath gone forth \u2026 , and also study my word \u2026 which is now translating.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-95911_000_004\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20257\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20257)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20257)\">D&amp;C 11:21\u201322<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/hyrum-smith-firm-as-the-pillars-of-heaven.p20\" class=\"\">Hyrum\u2019s life is a witness to his obedience to this instruction.

According to Lucy Mack Smith, when young Joseph first told the rest of the family about his experience in the Sacred Grove, Hyrum and all the others received the message \u201cjoyfully.\u201d The family sat \u201cin a circle, \u2026 giving the most profound attention to a boy \u2026 who had never read the Bible through in his life.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote9-95911_000_004\">9<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">History of Joseph Smith,<\/span> p. 82.]<\/span><\/sup> In contrast to the reaction of Laman and Lemuel to their younger brother Nephi\u2019s divine calling [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"2108\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2108)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2108)\">1 Ne. 18:10<\/a><\/span>, <span class=\"citation\" id=\"2106\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2106)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2106)\">1 Ne. 16:37\u201338<\/a><\/span>] and to the jealousy of the older brothers of Joseph who was sold into Egypt [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24125\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24125)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24125)\">Gen. 37:5\u201311<\/a><\/span>], there was no jealousy or animosity in Hyrum Smith.

We do not need more members who question every detail; we need members who have felt with their hearts, who live close to the Spirit, and who follow its promptings joyfully.
