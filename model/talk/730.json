A few days ago it was rather doubtful whether I could appear\nin conference, but I chanced to meet President McKay.  He informed me I was scheduled to\nspeak, and I felt if it were President McKay's desire that I speak to you, the Lord would bless\nand sustain me.  When I arrived this morning, he suggested that I might be called on in this\nmeeting, and of all things, I left my talk at home.  I told him, however, that I was not sure\nthat was the talk I should give. I therefore, need the inspiration and the blessings of the Lord\nwith me.  I ask for an interest in your faith and prayers.\n<\/p><p>\nBrothers and sisters, I would be most ungrateful if I failed to express gratitude and\nappreciation for the faith and the prayers of the Saints throughout the Church for my recovery\nfrom the illness that has inactivated me the past four months.  I have been cognizant in many\nways of your appeals for divine favor in my behalf, and I acknowledge to the Lord before\nyou the healing blessings of his holy Spirit I am here today because of his blessings.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to express appreciation to my brethren of the General Authorities, whose brotherhood,\nlove, affection, and faithful devotion I shall always remember with tender emotions and fond\nmemories for the benefit of their administrations, their faith and prayers, in which all of you\nhave taken a part and confirmed by your own supplications to God, the eternal Father of us\nall.  From the depths of my heart I thank all of you, and express profound gratitude and\nappreciation for your kindness and for your love.  I sincerely hope my appreciation can be\nadequately evidenced by my faithful devotion to the ministry of our Lord and Savior, Jesus\nChrist, whose servant I am.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear witness to you that Jesus is the Christ, the Only Begotten\nSon of the living God, our Lord, Redeemer, Savior, and Advocate with the Father, the Light\nand Life of men, and the only name under heaven, given among men whereby salvation can\nbe obtained.\n<\/p><p>\nI like these words from the Apostle John quoting the Savior to his disciples: \n<\/p><p>\nIf I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth\nof me is true.\n<\/p><p>\nYe sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.\n<\/p><p>\nBut I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to\nfinish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27590\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27590)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27590)\">John 5:31-33,36-37<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJohn the Baptist so early bore witness that Jesus was the Christ.  He had that most wonderful\nof opportunities of baptizing his Lord and witnessing the Holy Ghost descend upon him in the\nsign of a dove, confirming the Lord's Messiahship.  The Apostle John later\nsaid, \"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1041\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1041)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1041)\">1 Jn. 5:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe God and Father of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, spoke from the heavens on the\noccasion of Christ's baptism and said, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34610\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34610)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34610)\">Matt. 3:17<\/a><\/span>).\nI think of that other occasion when Christ took Peter, James, and John with him\non the Mount and was transfigured before them, Elias and Moses appeared, and then the voice\nof God from heaven again declared: \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased;\nhear ye him\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34641\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34641)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34641)\">Matt. 17:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1042\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1042)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1042)\">1 Jn. 5:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe ministry of Jesus of Nazareth is itself a witness and testimony that he was the Son of the\nliving God.  As we have heard this morning, Christ was crucified and arose from the grave in\na glorious resurrection.  He first appeared unto Cephas after his resurrection and then to his\ndisciples, members of the Twelve.  Later he appeared unto about five hundred brethren at\nonce (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"248\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 248)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(248)\">1 Cor. 15:5-8<\/a><\/span>).\nFor forty days following his resurrection\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7705\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7705)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7705)\">Acts 1:3<\/a><\/span>),\nhe personally ministered among men and\ntaught them; he counseled and directed them in the ministry.  They went forth testing of him\nthat he was the Redeemer and Son of the living God.  Later he was seen of Paul the Apostle,\nwho also testified of him gloriously.  The Savior stated: \". . . for the works which the Father\nhath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath\nsent me\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27591\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27591)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27591)\">John 5:36<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is the other witness, spoken of by Jesus, the witness of the Holy Ghost\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27607\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27607)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27607)\">John 14:16-17<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27613\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27613)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27613)\">John 16:13-15<\/a><\/span>), that testified to\nthe spirit of his disciples, that this was the Son of God who had called them, and whom they\nserved.  The two angels who stood by as he was received into heaven said he should so come\nin like manner as they had seen him go into heaven\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7706\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7706)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7706)\">Acts 1:9-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nShortly thereafter followed the long period of spiritual darkness, and then came the time for\nthe last and most important of all God's dispensations to be ushered in; therefore, because of\nits importance, God the eternal Father and his Son Jesus Christ personally appeared to the\nboy, Joseph Smith, and informed him of his holy calling\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30332\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30332)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30332)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>).  Later Moroni, a resurrected prophet\nof the living God, from the Nephite nation, came to him and showed him where the plates\nwere deposited that contained a record of a branch of God's people\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30338\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30338)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30338)\">JS&mdash;H 1:30-33<\/a><\/span>).  This record Joseph later\ntranslated by the gift and power of God.\n<\/p><p>\nThree men were shown these plates by an angel of God and the voice of the Lord declared\nfrom heaven that the record was true and the translation correct, and they should to all the\nworld (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43102\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43102)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43102)\">BM Three Wit.<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd then later eight men had the privilege of seeing these plates\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43115\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43115)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43115)\">BM Eight Wit.<\/a><\/span>). All these men are\nwitnesses to the divine calling of the Prophet Joseph Smith.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord gave revelations to the\nProphet Joseph singly upon many occasions; also to Joseph and Oliver Cowdery; also to\nJoseph and Martin Harris.  Heavenly resurrected beings manifested themselves unto him and\nthem and conferred upon them the gifts, the authorities, and the powers to officiate in all the\naffairs of God's kingdom.  It seems fitting that the man who testified of the Savior, John the\nBaptist, has come and conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, the Aaronic\nPriesthood (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30340\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30340)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30340)\">JS&mdash;H 1:68-72<\/a><\/span>),\nand that later the three men, Peter, James, and John, who were with the Savior on\nthe Mount when he was transfigured before them, and God again testified of his Son, should\ncome and confer upon the Prophet Joseph and Oliver Cowdery the Melchizedek Priesthood\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13230\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13230)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13230)\">D&amp;C 27:12<\/a><\/span>),\nthe priesthood after the order of the Son of God that has to do with the spiritual endowments,\nauthorities, and blessings of God's church.\n<\/p><p>\nMy brothers and sisters, the Prophet, unschooled, unlearned, could not have given to the\nworld what he was privilege to reveal unless God were with him.  God inspired him in all\nthat he did.  There were living witnesses who testified to his divine calling for heavenly\nmessengers had manifested this truth to several brethren.  Surely if we receive the witness of\nmen, the witness of God is more certain.  The office of the Holy Ghost is to testify of the\nFather and Son, it is also the spirit of truth, and when it testifies to the spirit\nof men there comes an inward feeling whether a thing is true or whether it is not true.  In the\ncase of the Prophet, Joseph Smith, it was true, for men in his day and since have received that\nwitness and testimony which the Holy Ghost itself manifests unto those who seek after truth.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again the works of Joseph Smith&mdash;analyze them; everything about them indicates his\nprophetic calling.  Where a testament is, there must of necessity be the death of a testator\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24260\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24260)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24260)\">Heb. 9:16<\/a><\/span>), and\nsurely this was a testament unfolding and revealing again God's kingdom with all of its\nsaving ordinances, principles, and divine powers.  A testament is not of force until after men\nare dead (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24261\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24261)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24261)\">Heb. 9:17<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Prophet gave his life to seal that testimony, and thus the sacrifice of his life\nbecomes a witness to all men of the truth and power of his holy calling and ministry.\n<\/p><p>\nMy brothers and sisters, before the Prophet Joseph Smith departed this life he conferred upon\nthe Twelve all the keys, powers, and authority to carry forward this important work of the\nlatter-day; that work has not stopped in its progress; it has gone forward; and the fruits of it\nare a witness to all people of its truth.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear testimony to you that the Presidents of the Church, our spiritual leaders who have\nfollowed Joseph Smith, are prophets of God.  I cannot quote the exact words, but in the\nThursday temple meeting of all the General Authorities, where we had gone in fasting and\nprayer in preparation for this great conference, President McKay said, \"Brethren, I want to say\nto you that Christ is at the helm of this Church, and he is guiding it by his holy power.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI received a witness from the Spirit that President McKay's statement was true.  I bear that\nwitness to you, my brothers and sisters. I know that leaders of other churches might make\nsimilar statements, but would the Holy Ghost manifest the truth of it to their listeners?  If we\nreceive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1043\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1043)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1043)\">1 Jn. 5:9<\/a><\/span>), which witness all can receive from\nthe Holy Ghost, for which I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
