Who? \/ Now is the time to show\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 260).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p5\" class=\"\">In this, the dispensation of the fulness of time, as we prepare for the final satanic battles in anticipation of the return of Christ to the earth, it is very important to know who is on the Lord\u2019s side. The Lord needs to know on whom He can rely.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p6\" class=\"\">You would hope that every priesthood holder could be counted on to show up for service in the ranks of the Lord\u2019s army. Today in the Church there are about three million priesthood holders, split evenly between the Aaronic and the Melchizedek Priesthoods.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p7\" class=\"\">Unfortunately, far too many of these men, young and not so young, are missing, absent without leave, AWOL.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p8\" class=\"\">One day they each sat humbly while men of authority laid hands upon their heads and conferred the priesthood upon them. That day they all made a covenant of obedience and service with the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p9\" class=\"\">To understand the importance of these covenants we need to ask ourselves, \u201cWhat is the priesthood?\u201d Every alert deacon knows the answer to this question: The priesthood is the power to act in God\u2019s name.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p10\" class=\"\">What does this mean to you deacons, teachers, and priests? First, it means you are authorized to pass, prepare, and bless the sacrament. Is this a big deal? Absolutely!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p11\" class=\"\">Who administered the first sacrament service that we have any record of? Of course the answer is the Lord Jesus Christ. The evening before His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, Christ prepared, blessed, and passed the sacrament to His disciples. So when we perform this sacred ordinance, we are actually standing in for the Savior Himself. That is special!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p12\" class=\"\">John the Baptist laid his hands on the heads of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and conferred upon them the priesthood of Aaron and declared, \u201cI confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44261\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44261)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44261)\">D&amp;C 13:1<\/a><\/span>). That is a significant responsibility for men of any age. With that charge, we are clearly on the Lord\u2019s side.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p13\" class=\"\">What of the Melchizedek Priesthood? The 84th section of the Doctrine and Covenants reads, \u201cAnd this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44262\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44262)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44262)\">D&amp;C 84:19<\/a><\/span>). This priesthood holds the power to administer and lead, to bless and to heal, to teach and to seal. These priesthood service activities clearly place the practicing brethren on the Lord\u2019s side.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p14\" class=\"\">One of the greatest examples of priesthood sealing power is the story of Nephi, son of Helaman. Because of his diligence in declaring the word of God, the Lord gave him sealing power that \u201cwhatsoever ye shall seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44263\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44263)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44263)\">Hel. 10:7<\/a><\/span>).

When I turned 12 years old, my father, Charles Oaks, and my bishop, George Collard, laid their hands on my head and conferred upon me the Aaronic Priesthood and ordained me a deacon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p17\" class=\"\">Several years later, then Elder Gordon B. Hinckley used this same heavenly directed procedure to ordain me a Seventy. Each ordination reflects additional divine trust and a new opportunity to serve on the Lord\u2019s side.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p18\" class=\"\">When armies are formed, battles are generally fought on vast battlefields. But this battle for souls is quite different. The conflict goes on each day in individual lives and pits the Lord\u2019s troops against Satan\u2019s forces of greed, selfishness, and lust.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p19\" class=\"\">The muscular young men of Helaman\u2019s 2,060 stripling warriors, shoulder to shoulder, imply the need for great physical strength to join their ranks. But there is room for every stout-hearted soul in this endeavor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p20\" class=\"\">We have an 11-year-old grandson, Andrew, who is confined to a wheelchair, maybe for the rest of his life. He will be ordained a deacon in the fall and will join the priesthood army of the Lord. His physical handicap will not limit him in this war, because the weapons of choice are not spears and swords wielded on a chaotic field of battle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p21\" class=\"\">Rather, the weapons of eternal worth reflecting the whole armor of God are <span class=\"emphasis\">truth, righteousness, faith, prayer,<\/span> and the <span class=\"emphasis\">word of God<\/span> (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44264\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44264)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44264)\">Eph. 6:13\u201318<\/a><\/span>). These weapons are wielded in our minds, mouths, and movements. Every righteous thought, word, and deed is a victory for the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p22\" class=\"\">That is why Andrew has no handicap in this battle. His parents have taught him well.

The prizes are the very souls of the sons and daughters of God, their eternal salvation.

They will teach him to pass the sacrament and to collect fast offerings. They will look after him, because that is what priesthood quorums are all about\u2014caring for one another. In fact that is how the Lord\u2019s priesthood army is organized, into quorums.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/whos-on-the-lords-side-who.p25\" class=\"\">I spent a majority of my life as a pilot in the United States Air Force.
