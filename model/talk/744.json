Hunter, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1954, pp. 106-114<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nSince the day that the Angel Moroni gave the gold plates to the Prophet Joseph Smith from\nwhich he translated and published the Book of Mormon, vast amounts of marvelous evidences\nhave accumulated.  These evidences sustain the divine authenticity and truthfulness of that\nholy ancient record.\n<\/p><p>\nAlso, during the same period of time, enemies of truth and light have done everything within\ntheir power to oppose the Book of Mormon, trying to prove that its claims are false.  Some of\nthese men, no doubt, were merely misled; but the majority of them did what they did with\nevil intent.  The result has been that all of their works have come to naught.  The evil results\nof their efforts have vanished as the dew on earth&rsquo;s verdure vanishes in the presence of the\nrising sun.  Thus, the Book of Mormon stands today in higher repute than ever before in the\nhistory of the Church.  None of its claims have been proven to be false.  On the other hand, a\nvast accumulation of evidences&mdash;some of which speak as it were from the dust and others\nfrom the ancient past&mdash;continue to bear witness to the divinity of this sacred book and to its\ntruthfulness.\n<\/p><p>\nBeyond a shadow of doubt, the Book of Mormon is the word of God, a divine and sacred\nbook, preserved by the Lord and his holy angels to come forth in the latter days as a new\nwitness to Jesus Christ and the gospel which he proclaimed.\n<\/p><p>\nI shall point out some of the astounding Book of Mormon evidences, listing them under three\nmajor headings: first archaeological evidences; second&mdash;testimonies of sixteenth century\nIndian historians; and third&mdash;writings of Catholic padres of the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies, which writers secured their information firsthand from the Indians.\n<\/p><p>\nAmerican archaeology had its birth shortly before the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith. \nJohn Lloyd Stephens had visited Guatemala, Honduras, and Yucatan, had come back to the\nUnited States, and had written a glowing report of the beautiful temples, pyramids, and other\narchaeological remains which dotted the jungles of Central America and\nMexico. (John Lloyd Stephens, <i>Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan<\/i>\n(1841): <i>Incidents of travel in Yucatan<\/i> (1843).)  From the time of the publishing of Stephens&rsquo;\nbooks forward, the governments of Mexico, Central America, and portions of South America,\nas well as archaeological organizations from the United States and her neighbors to the south,\nhave spent vast amounts of money, and have exerted an untold amount of effort at numerous\nof these archaeological sites.  Also, considerable work has been done in reconstructing the\nancient buildings.  In reconstructing these marvelous pyramids, temples, and other\narchaeological ruins, the archaeologists and their helpers have placed the stones as far as\npossible back as they were when the ancient Americans first erected the buildings.  The result\nis that today the country from north of Mexico City southward to Chile is literally dotted with\nnumerous archaeological sites, many of which have been excavated by archaeologists.\n<\/p><p>\nBefore proceeding further, I desire to point out, definitely, that the majority of the\narchaeological ruins that have been excavated postdate Book of Mormon times, and some of\nthem were originally erected several hundred years following the close of Nephite history. \nThen you may ask, &ldquo;What evidence do these ancient ruins give to sustain the Book of\nMormon?&rdquo;\n<\/p><p>\nI shall answer as follows: The Book of Mormon claims that great civilizations lived in ancient\nAmerica.  In fact, that sacred record points out that three separate peoples came to America in\nancient times and established their civilizations. These peoples were known as Jaredites,\nNephites, and Mulekites. The best archaeologists at the present time claim that many of the\narchaeological remains that have been excavated were built over earlier temples, pyramids,\nand other buildings, connoting earlier civilizations; and in many respects these earlier peoples\nwere more highly developed, or more civilized, than were the people who erected the\nbuildings of the archaeological remains that are now extant; for example, Miguel Covarrubias,\nspeaking the views of the Mexican archaeologists, places the La Venta site within the period\nof 200 B.&nbsp;C. to 300 A.&nbsp;D.  To quote from this writer: \n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nEverywhere there are archaeological treasures that lie hidden in the Jungles and under the rich\nsoil of southern Vera Cruz, burial mounds and pyramids, masterfully carved colossal\nmonuments of basalt, splendid statuettes of precious jade, and sensitively modeled figurines of\nclay all of an unprecedented, high artistic quality.  The tantalizing presence of a great and\nremote past in what is now uninhabited, impenetrable jungle is all the more puzzling because\narchaeologists now agree that many of these artistic masterpieces date back to the beginnings\nof the Christian era.  Appearing suddenly out of nowhere in a state of full development, they\nconstitute a culture that seems to have been the root, the mother culture, from which the latter\nand better-known (Maya, Totonac, Zapotec, etc.) cultures sprang.\n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nThis oldest of native American high cultures is also the newest, since it was &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; only\na few years ago and still awaits exhaustive scientific study. (Miguel Covarrubias, <i>Mexico\nSouth&mdash;The Isthmus of Tehuantepec<\/i> (1946), pp. 79-80.)\n<\/p><p>\nLatter-day Saints know that the three oldest &ldquo;native American high cultures&rdquo; were the Jaredite,\nNephite, and Mulekite cultures, the latter two fitting well within the La Venta period.\n<\/p><p>\nThe La Venta archaeological site, located near the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, was excavated\nby Dr. Matthew W. Stirling in 1939-1940.  He is credited with dating this culture from 450\nB.&nbsp;C. to 600 A.&nbsp;D. (A. Hyatt Verrill, <i>Americas&rsquo; Ancient Civilizations<\/i> (1953), p. 100.)  He\nmade an archaeological find there of great importance, a carving of a statue of a man which\nreminds one of the usual portrayal of &ldquo;Uncle Sam.&rdquo; (Matthew W. Stirling, <i>National\nGeographic Magazine<\/i> (Sept., 1940),  p. 327; Milton R. Hunter and Thomas Stuart Ferguson,\n<i>Ancient America and the Book of Mormon<\/i>, pp. 133-135, 173.)  This figure had a full flowing\nbeard and an aquiline nose, constituting a good representation of a Hebrew priest. \nCovarrubias described the figure as one representing a person having &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. surprising\npronounced Semitic features.&rdquo; (Covarrubias, <i>op. cit.<\/i>, p. 90.)  Stirling points out that the figure\nis depicted as wearing &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shoes with odd, pointed, upturned toes.&rdquo; (Stirling, <i>op. cit.<\/i>, p. 327.) \n Neither the shoes nor the face and flowing beard of &ldquo;Uncle Sam&rdquo; could\nhave been a representation of a red-skinned Indian (Sylvanus G. Morley, <i>The Ancient Maya<\/i>,\np. 21, states: &ldquo;The Maya are not a hairy people.  The men either have no beards and\nmoustaches at all, or only very meager, sparse ones, while other parts of their body have less\nhair than is the case of American whites.&rdquo; The same facts hold true with the majority of\nIndians.); but, as stated, it strongly resembles a Jewish priest of pre-Christian times.\n<\/p><p>\nDr. Stirling also found in southwestern Mexico at Izapa a stone covered with carvings which\nhave been interpreted by Dr. M. Wells Jakeman of Brigham Young University as a\nrepresentation of Lehi&rsquo;s dream of the &ldquo;Tree of Life,&rdquo; recorded in\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1518\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1518)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1518)\">1 Ne. 8:1-38<\/a><\/span>.  To quote\nDr. Jakeman: \n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\n.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the resemblance of this sculpture to the Book of Mormon account cannot be accidental.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\nIt practically establishes an historical connection .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. between the ancient Central American\npriests responsible for the sculpture and the Lehi people of the Book of Mormon!  Indeed, the\naccurate and detailed knowledge of Lehi&rsquo;s vision .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. displayed by these priests in this\nsculpture, can be explained only by their identification as an actual group of the Lehi people.\n(M.  Wells Jakeman, &ldquo;An Unusual Tree of Life Sculpture from Ancient Central America&rdquo;\n<i>Bulletin of University Archaeological Society<\/i> (March, 1953), pp. 26-49.)\n<\/p><p>\nOf special interest to Latter-day Saints is the temple of Quetzalcoatl, located at Teotihuac\u00e1n,\nnorth of Mexico City. This temple is decorated with serpents&rsquo; heads, surrounded with <i>quetzal<\/i>\nfeathers. <i>Quetzal<\/i> is the name of a beautiful bird with resplendent long, green feathers, found\nmainly in Guatemala and Honduras (Hunter and Ferguson, <i>op. cit.<\/i>, pp. 199, 195-222). <i>Coatl<\/i>\nis the ancient Mexican word for serpent. (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, 199; Verrill. <i>op. cit.<\/i>, pp. 101-111.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe Book of Mormon gives a beautiful account of Christ&rsquo;s appearance to the Nephites\nfollowing his crucifixion and resurrection.

To\nthem he gave the true gospel plan of salvation, and the people lived in almost perfect\nrighteousness for over two hundred years.  Certainly Christ&rsquo;s visit constituted one of the\ngreatest events, if not the greatest, that transpired in ancient America.\n<\/p><p>\nFollowing the apostasy of the Nephites and the Lamanites from the true religion of the Master\nand the extermination of the Nephite civilization (about 400 A.&nbsp;D.), the Lamanites or Indians\nretained in their traditions a memory of the appearance of the resurrected Savior to their\nforefathers.  This white-bearded God, according to one tradition, came to the people through\nthe air, and as he descended to earth the sunrays sparkled on his beautiful white body and\nclothing.  The <i>quetzal<\/i> bird as it flew through the air reminded the people of the glorious\nbeauty and radiant splendor of the white-bearded God who had appeared to their ancestors;\nand so they added a pagan touch to that memorable event by selecting the most beautiful and\nhighly prized bird of the New World, the <i>quetzal<\/i>, as a symbol of the white God, or Jesus\nChrist. Also, <i>coatl<\/i>, or serpent, was an ancient symbol of Israel&rsquo;s Anointed One.  Thus, the\nIndians commemorated their white-bearded God with the symbol of &ldquo;Quetzal-bird serpent&rdquo; or\nQuetzalcoatl. (George C. Vaillant, <i>Aztecs of Mexico<\/i>, p. 52;  Bancroft, <i>Native Races<\/i>,\nvol. 2, p. 511 ff.; [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41098\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41098)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41098)\">Num. 21:8-9<\/a><\/span>];\n[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27587\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27587)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27587)\">John 3:14-15<\/a><\/span>]; Maurice H. Farbridge,\n<i>Studies in Biblical and Semitic Symbolism<\/i>, p. 25; Hunter and Ferguson, <i>op. cit.<\/i>,\npp. 195-222; Verrill, <i>op. cit.<\/i>, p. 67.)\n<\/p><p>\nTraditions existed among practically every American Indian tribe, especially the more\ncivilized peoples of Peru, Central America, Guatemala, Yucatan, and Mexico, to the effect\nthat their ancestors were visited by a white-bearded God, who gave them their culture, their\ncivilization, and their religion, and who promised that someday he would return to their\ndescendants.  These traditions account for the easy conquest of Mexico and Peru; but, more\nimportant, they all bear witness to Christ&rsquo;s appearance to the ancient Americans, as accounted\nin the Book of Mormon.\n<\/p><p>\nAlso, of special interest to members of the Church of Jesus Christ are the beautiful and\nfamous archaeological ruins in Yucatan, especially those at Chich\u00e9n, Itz\u00e1, Uxmal, and Kabah. \nThe massive pyramids, temples, and other important structures were erected during the tenth\ncentury A.&nbsp;D., constituting the workmanship of the New Mayan Empire.  Those Mayas of\nYucatan, as had the Toltecs of Teotihuac\u00e1n, worshiped the white-bearded God, whom they\ncalled Kukulcan.  They carved motifs to Kukulcan on their buildings similar\nto those at Teotihuac\u00e1n and at other Mexican sites, i.e., the plumed serpent. (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, p. 101 ff.) \nIn fact, the plumed serpent is extensively used in decorating all of their buildings.\n<\/p><p>\nAlso, the Mayas decorated their buildings with another motif or symbol&mdash;that of a bearded\nwhite man wearing quetzal feathers.  The latter carvings represented priests of Kukulcan\n(Quetzalcoatl), or probably Kukulcan himself.  They are definitely not of Indian type but are\nof Hebraic type.  To quote Theodore Arthur Willard: \n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nAn interesting sidelight .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is the distinctly Semitic cast of countenance of some of the\nancient sculptures and murals found at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and in other old Maya cities.\nThe dignity of face and serene poise of those carved or painted likenesses is strikingly Hebraic.\n(Theodore Arthur Willard, <i>The City of the Sacred Well<\/i>, p. 36.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe marvelous archaeological finds at Palenque in the Usumacinta Valley&mdash;especially the\ncross and the Egyptian-type burials, the famous ruins of the Old Mayan Empire in Honduras\nand Guatemala&mdash;especially those at Copan, Uaxact\u00fan, and Quirigu\u00e1, all bear testimony to the\nBook of Mormon&rsquo;s claims that high civilizations lived in ancient America.  The late Dr.\nSylvanus G. Morley maintained that the Maya history had its beginning as early as 300 B.&nbsp;C.\n(Morley, <i>op. cit.<\/i>, p. 14)  and that pre-Maya history extends back to about 3000 B.&nbsp;C. (<i>Ibid.<\/i>,\npp. 38, 44.)  The former date would reach in the earlier part of Nephite history, and the latter\nwould extend to the beginnings of Jaredite history.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen one considers all of the wonderful archaeological remains in Mexico, Honduras,\nGuatemala, and Central America, and those of South America, one comes to the conclusion\nthat those of the northern hemisphere do not surpass the marvelous archaeological ruins found\nin Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Colombia.  Numerous buildings have been excavated and some\nof them reconstructed.  Thousands of graves have been opened and from them have been\ntaken the most beautiful and artistic workings in gold, silver, copper, and precious stones of\nvarious kinds. (Verrill. <i>op. cit.<\/i>, 183-195.)  Also, from those graves have been taken the most\nfinely woven, beautiful laces, the most gorgeous wool and cotton cloths, and &ldquo;fine-twined\nlinen&rdquo; [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24682\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24682)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24682)\">Hel. 6:13<\/a><\/span>]. In fact, various\narchaeologists maintain that the world has known no races of people\nwho surpassed the predecessors of the Inca civilization in these various handicrafts.  Some of\nthem maintain that the earliest South American civilization dates as far back as 3000 B.&nbsp;C.\n(<i>Ibid.<\/i>, pp. 174-175, 183, 210.); for example, A. Hyatt Verrill states: \n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nDespite the high attainment in art, engineering, astronomy and government which were\nreached by the Aztecs, the Incas, the Mayas and others, in a way these unknown, forgotten\nraces of South America were more remarkable, and were unquestionably far more ancient. \nFrom the Chibcha district in Colombia to northern Chile, numerous races rose to a civilized\nstate, vanished and were forgotten centuries before the first Montezuma or the first Inca saw\nthe light of day. (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, p. 148.)\n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nAs a general rule, when we find a race excelling in some one art or occupation we find the\npeople deficient in some other art or industry, but the Chimus appear to have been masters of\nall trades.  Their textiles, especially their laces, were marvelous examples of weaving, and\ntheir mosaic and mother-of-pearl work was exquisite.  Many specimens of these are truly\nwonderful examples of this highly developed art.  There are vases, cups, ceremonial utensils,\near plugs, breastplates, wooden utensils, objects made of clay and of bone that are highly and\nmost artistically embellished with mosaic inlay of mother-of-pearl, the red Spondylus shell,\ncolored stone and precious metals.  Many of their robes and ponchos of magnificent textiles\nare completely covered with ornaments of gold, silver, mother-of-pearl and sections of bright\ncolored sea shells arranged in charming patterns so as to give the effect of a mosaic cloth.\n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nThey were also highly skilled wood carvers and there is scarcely a wooden object that is not\nhandsomely carved.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  They had developed a unique method of weaving feathers into\ncloth thus producing feather robes, tunics, head coverings, etc., that are gorgeous in color and\ndesign.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nEven in their ordinary metal work the Chimus exhibited the greatest skill and a most artistic\ntaste.  Metals were cast, embossed, etched, engraved, pressed, hammered, spun or built up\ninto innumerable forms by welding and soldering.  In fact every means of\nworking metals known to modern artisans was employed by the Chimus. (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, pp. 154-157.)\n<\/p><p>\nIt is to be recalled that the Book of Mormon history is confined to the period between the\nbuilding of the Tower of Babel and 421 A.&nbsp;D., the period during which the ancient Americans\nmade their greatest achievements in the various handicrafts as described by Mr. Verrill.  Also,\nwe should recall that the Book of Mormon made such claims as follows: \n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\n[The Jaredites had] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all manner of fruit, and of rain, and of silks, and of fine linen, and of\ngold, and of silver, and of precious things\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22201\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22201)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22201)\">Ether 9:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\n[The Nephites and Mulekites also had an abundance] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of all things whatsoever they stood\nin need&mdash;and abundance .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of silk\nand fine-twined linen, and all manner of good homely cloth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8939\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8939)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8939)\">Alma 1:29<\/a><\/span>;\nsee <span class=\"citation\" id=\"8940\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8940)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8940)\">Alma 4:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAgain we read: \n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nAnd behold, there was all manner of gold in both these lands, and of silver, and of precious\nore of every kind; and there were also curious workmen, who did work all kinds of ore and\ndid refine it; and thus they did become rich.\n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nBehold their women did toil and spin, and did make all manner of cloth, of fine-twined linen\nand cloth of every kind, to clothe their nakedness\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24681\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24681)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24681)\">Hel. 6:11,13<\/a><\/span>;\nsee <span class=\"citation\" id=\"40263\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40263)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40263)\">Mosiah 10:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nCertainly all of these archaeological remains fit well with the Book of Mormon claims\nregarding the Jaredites Nephite, and Mulekite civilizations; thus archaeology speaks as it were\nfrom the dust, verifying the Book of Mormon to be true&mdash;to be the word of God.\n<\/p><p>\nThe second evidences verifying the Book of Mormon which I shall discuss are the writings of\nthe sixteenth century Indian historians.  When the Spanish conquistadors and the Catholic\npadres were conquering Mexico and Yucatan, they found that the Indians had many\nbooks&mdash;large libraries. Many of the Indians knew how to read and write and were more civilized than\nwere their conquerors from Europe.  In order to destroy as far as possible the natives&rsquo;\ncivilization and do away with what the Catholic fathers termed &ldquo;the Indians&rsquo; wicked\npaganism,&rdquo; the Catholic padres burned all of the books that they could find, completely\ndestroying the libraries. This terrible act of vandalism resulted in a terrific loss to our\nunderstanding of the history of the Indians and their ancestors.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was fortunate, however, that three or four excellent manuscripts written by Indian historians\nduring the first century of their contact with the Spaniards escaped the ruthless destruction. \nThese writings have been translated into English during the past several years.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of these important writings was produced in 1554, in the Quich\u00e9-Maya Indian language\nof Guatemala, and &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. signed by the kings and dignitaries of the Quich\u00e9\ncourt.&rdquo; (<i>Title of the Lords of Totonicap\u00e1n<\/i>, p. 164.)  It is known as the\n<i>Title of the Lords of Totonicap\u00e1n<\/i>. At the\nrequest of the Quich\u00e9 Indians, Dionisio Jos\u00e9 Chonay, a Catholic priest, translated the\ndocument from the Quich\u00e9 language into Spanish in 1834. It was first translated into English\nby Delia Goetz and published in 1953. However, Dr. M. Wells Jakeman published in English\nextracts from the Spanish version in 1945, this being the first time that any of this work had\nappeared in English.  The <i>Totonicap\u00e1n<\/i> claims that the ancestors of the Quich\u00e9-Mayas\n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\n.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. came from the other part of the ocean, from where the sun rises, a place called <i>Pa Tul\u00e1n<\/i>,\n<i>Pa Civ\u00e1n<\/i> meaning Bountiful] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they came from where the sun rises, descendants of\nIsrael, of the same language and the same customs .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they were sons of Abraham and Jacob.\n(<i>Ibid.<\/i>, pp. 169-170.)\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then the authors of Totonicap\u00e1n close their account as follows: \n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nNow on the twenty-eighth of September of 1554 we sign this attestation in which we have\nwritten that which by tradition our ancestors told us, who came from the other part of the sea,\nfrom Civan-Tulan, bordering on Babylonia. (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, p. 194; Hunter and Ferguson, <i>op. cit.<\/i>, pp. 8,\n56-64, 70, 80-84, 250.)\n<\/p><p>\nThese statements are all in perfect agreement with the claims made in the\nBook of Mormon (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1522\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1522)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1522)\">1 Ne. 17:40<\/a><\/span>).\nWe should recall that Nephi and his brethren built their\nship at a place which they named Bountiful which was located on the southeastern shores of\nArabia or &ldquo;bordering on Babylonia&rdquo;; and from that place they set sail for America\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1521\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1521)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1521)\">1 Ne. 17:5-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe <i>Totonicap\u00e1n<\/i> also claims that God gave to their original prophet-leader a peculiar\ninstrument, called <i>Giron-Gagal<\/i>, through the power of which the people were guided to their\nnow home. (Totonicap\u00e1n, <i>op. cit.<\/i>, p. 170.)  One is reminded of the Liahona which was given\nby the Lord to Father Lehi\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1520\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1520)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1520)\">1 Ne. 16:10<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8951\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8951)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8951)\">Alma 37:38-41<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnother Quich\u00e9-Maya book, the <i>Popol Vuh<\/i>, much more detailed than <i>Totonicap\u00e1n<\/i>, was\nwritten between 1554 and 1558 A D.  In its present printed form, it is a book containing over\ntwo hundred pages.  It might be termed the Lamanite account of their history and religion, as\nthe Book of Mormon is the Nephite account.  Regarding this book, Brasseur de Bourbourg\nwrote: \n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nThe <i>Popol Vuh<\/i> appears to have been written, in part, from memory, following ancient\noriginals, and in part, copied from the sacred books of the Quiches,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This manuscript .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\nis written in a Quich\u00e9 of great elegance, and the author must have been one of the princes of\nthe royal family, of their his who composed it a few years after the arrival of the Spaniards,\nwhen all of their ancient books were disappearing. (Brasseur de Bourbourg, cited in <i>Popol Vuh<\/i>, p. 21.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe <i>Popol Vuh<\/i> was first translated into English by Delia Goetz and Sylvanus G. Morley and\npublished in 1950.\n<\/p><p>\nIn this book the Quich\u00e9-Maya Indians of Guatemala give an account of the creation of the\nworld (<i>Popol Vuh<\/i>, pp. 81-90), of the origin of man (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, pp. 86-89), of the flood\n(<i>Ibid.<\/i>, p. 90), of the confusion of tongues (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, p. 36), and of the coming of\ntheir ancestors across the sea from the East (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, pp. 18, 79-80).  It also mentions the\nfact that the colonizers were\nguided to their new home by a peculiar instrument, called <i>Pizom-Gagal<\/i> (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, p. 205) (the\nLiahona).  Thus the <i>Popol Vuh<\/i> in many items sustains the teachings of the more beautiful and\ncomplete account found in the Book of Mormon.\n<\/p><p>\nA third book written by the Indians of Guatemala, <i>The Annals of the Cakchiquels<\/i>, also bears\nwitness to the teachings of the Book of Mormon.  The writers, the Cakchiquel Indians, were a\nbranch of the Quich\u00e9-Mayas.  I shall quote from this writing: \n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nI shall write the stories of our first fathers and grandfathers,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that from the other side of\nthe sea we came to the place called Tulan [Bountiful],&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nThus, then we were four families who arrived at Tulan, we the Cakchiquel people, oh, our\nsons! so they told us. (<i>The Annals of the Cakchiquels<\/i> (tr. from Cakchiquel-Maya into Eng. by\nAdrian Recinos and Delia Goetz, 1953), pp. 43-44.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe greatest book of the Indian writings of the sixteenth century is the <i>Works of Ixtlilxochitl<\/i>,\nwritten about 1600 A.&nbsp;D. by an Aztec prince named Ixtlilxochitl who lived near the City of\nMexico. (Hunter and Ferguson, <i>op. cit.<\/i>, pp. 1-450.) This Indian writer claimed that ancient\nAmerica was settled by three distinctive groups of people.  The first settlers, termed the\nAncient Ones, the Giants, or the First Tultecs, he claimed came from the Tower of Babel at\nthe time of the confounding of tongues.  They came to this land across the sea from the East. \nMany details of their history are given by Ixtlilxochitl which correspond closely to the\nJaredite history in the Book of Ether.\n<\/p><p>\nThe second group of settlers Ixtlilxochitl called the Tultecs.  His account of these people,\nalthough much briefer, corresponds very closely to the account given in the Book of Mormon\nof the Nephites, event after event agreeing in the principal points.  He even tells of the last\ngreat wars between the two people with dates almost identical with those recorded in the\nBook of Mormon.\n<\/p><p>\nThe third people, whom Ixtlilxochitl called Olmecs and who are identified as the Mulekites,\nexterminated the last of the first colonizers.  This event reminds one of Coriantumr, the last\nJaredite, who lived for nine months with the Mulekites before his death.  Ixtlilxochitl even\ntells of the merging together of the Tultecs and Olmecs (Nephites and Mulekites) and of the\ndominance of the Tultecs&rsquo; culture, which is in complete agreement with the\nBook of Mormon account.\n<\/p><p>\nThroughout the entire <i>Works of Ixtlilxochitl<\/i>, point after point, both in history and doctrine,\nare reasonably comparable to the historical events and teachings of the Book of Mormon.\nMerely for the purpose of illustration, I shall give one quotation from Ixtlilxochitl.  He tells\nof the terrific destruction that took place at the time of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion, as follows: \n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nIt was 166 years since they had adjusted their years and times with the equinox, and 270 since\nthe Ancient Ones had been destroyed, <i>when the sun and the moon eclipsed, and the earth\ntrembled, and the rocks broke<\/i>, and many other things and signs took place,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  This\nhappened in the year of <i>ce Calli<\/i>, which, adjusting this count with ours, comes to be\n<i>at the same time when Christ our Lord suffered, and they say it happened during the first\ndays of the year<\/i>.  (<i>Works of Ixtlilxochitl<\/i>, in Hunter and Ferguson, <i>Ibid.<\/i>, p. 190.)\n<\/p><p>\nWe recall that in 3 Nephi it is written: \n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nAnd it came to pass in the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, on the fourth day of the\nmonth, there arose a great storm, such an one as never had been known in all the land\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5531\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5531)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5531)\">3 Ne. 8:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then the Book of Mormon account continues with a description of the terrific destruction\nthat took place while Christ hanged on the cross and the intense darkness which prevailed for\nthree days while the Master&rsquo;s in the tomb.  Observe that the Book of Mormon gives the time\nof this event as the first month of the year and the fourth day of the month and during the\nperiod of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion while Ixtlilxochitl states &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>at the same\ntime when Christ our Lord suffered .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. during the first days of the year<\/i>.&rdquo;\nThere is no way under heaven whereby\nthis Indian could have known such facts except through direct revelation from the Lord or\nfrom records which were in his possession.  He claimed the latter.\n<\/p><p>\nSome authors are prone to discredit the writings of Ixtlilxochitl and the other Indian historians\non the grounds that they could have been influenced by the Spanish Catholic priests.  It is a\nfact of great significance, however, that these Indian writers recorded numerous historical\nfacts, as well as items pertaining to the social and religious teachings and customs of their\nancestors, of which the Catholic padres could have had no knowledge save only through\npossessing the Book of Mormon or comparable records.  Such writings the Catholic priests\ndid not have; but the Indians did possess records and traditions of their ancestors, which\nresulted in their writings comparing so favorably with the Book of Mormon.\n<\/p><p>\nThe third item I suggested that I would discuss is the writings of the sixteenth century\nCatholic missionaries who got their information directly from the Indians. One of the most\nimportant of these writers was Bernardino de Sahagun. He lived in Mexico from 1529 to 1590\nA.&nbsp;D. and produced his scholarly work in Aztec in the latter part of the sixteenth century.\n(Bernardino de Sahagun, <i>Historia de Las Cosas de Nueva Espa\u00f1a<\/i>, cited in Hunter and\nFerguson, <i>op. cit.<\/i>, pp. 30-31.)  It is one of the most reliable and comprehensive reports\nconcerning the ancients of Middle America.  It was first published in Spanish in 1829, and\nsince then portions of it have been published in English.  Sahagun states: \n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nConcerning the origin of these peoples, the report the old men [of central Mexico] give is that\nthey came by sea .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in some wooden boats.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  But it is conjectured by a report found\namong all these natives that they came from seven caves, and that these seven caves are the\nseven ships or galleys in which the first settlers of this land came,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nThe people first .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. came coasting along the coast disembarking in the port of Panuco, which\nthey called Panco, which means &ldquo;place where those arrived who crossed the water.&rdquo;  This\npeople came in search of the terrestrial paradise, and they had as a family name Tamoanchan,\nwhich means &ldquo;we are looking for our home.&rdquo; (<i>Ibid.<\/i>)\n<\/p><p>\nRecall the Jaredite history which tells that the forefathers crossed the ocean in eight barges in\nsearch of &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the land of promise, which was choice above all other lands of the earth&rdquo; (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22198\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22198)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22198)\">Ether 1:42<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22199\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22199)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22199)\">Ether 2:7,15<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22200\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22200)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22200)\">Ether 6:5,12<\/a><\/span>).\nSahagun&rsquo;s writings give numerous proofs which\nsustain the teachings and history of the Book of Mormon, but time will not permit giving\nmore of them here.\n<\/p><p>\nBishop Bartholom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a prominent Catholic missionary, writing in 1552-1553, said\nof the Indians of Guatemala that\n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\n.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they had among them information of the flood and of the end of the world,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and so\nthey believe that another <i>Butic<\/i> is about to come which is another flood and judgment, not of\nwater, but of fire which they, say will be the end of the world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas,\n<i>Apologetica Historia de las Indias<\/i>, Cap. CCXXXV.)\n<\/p><p>\nLas Casas found an abundance of teachings among the Indians which resembled Christian\ndoctrine, and so he concluded that the devil had arrived in America ahead of the Christians\nand implanted in the minds and hearts of the natives many teachings closely akin to\nChristianity. (Hunter and Ferguson, <i>op. cit.<\/i>, p. 222.)  Since the Book of Mormon peoples had\na thorough knowledge of the gospel, some of the divine truths would naturally be handed\ndown from age to age, probably in altered forms.\n<\/p><p>\nDiego de Landa, a prominent Spanish missionary in Yucatan, writing in about 1556, says that,\naccording to the Mayas, &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the world was destroyed by a deluge.&rdquo; (Diego de Landa,\n<i>Relaci\u00f3n de las cosas de Yucatan<\/i> (Eng. tr. by Alfred M. Tozzer, 1941), p. 93.)  He also\nstated: \n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nSome of the older people of Yucatan say that they have heard from their ancestors that this\nland was occupied by a race of people who came from the East and whom God had delivered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\nIf this were true, it necessarily follows that all the inhabitants of the Indies are\ndescendants of the Jews. (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, p. 16.)\n<\/p><p>\nJuan de Torquemada, a Spanish missionary in Mexico whose book was first published in\nSpain in 1613 A.&nbsp;D., declared that &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the ancients .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. put [i.e., wrote or inscribed] many\nthings in two columns, one of metal, and another of brick or stone.&rdquo; (Juan de Torquemada,\n<i>Monarquia Indiana<\/i>, Tomo 1, p. 255.)  It should be recalled that the Nephites inscribed their\nhistory on metal plates.\n<\/p><p>\nHarold Gladwin quotes Torquemada&rsquo;s description of the clothing worn by the Olmecs and\nthen comments that the description of the garb reminds one &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the robes of Biblical\ntimes in Palestine.&rdquo; (Harold S. Gladwin, <i>Men out of Asia<\/i> (1947), p. 305.)\n<\/p><p>\nI have given some strong evidence from archaeology, from Indian historians of the sixteenth\ncentury, and from Catholic padres of the sixteenth century, which all corroborates the claims\nmade by the Book of Mormon; however, the greatest testimony we have of the Book of\nMormon is the book itself, especially Moroni&rsquo;s testimony and admonition, which reads as\nfollows: \n<\/p><p class=\"quote\">\nAnd when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the\nEternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a\nsincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you,\nby the power of the Holy Ghost (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38253\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38253)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38253)\">Moro. 10:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThousands of Latter-day Saints have put that exhortation to the test and know as they know\nthat they are alive that the Book of Mormon is true. When I was a child and first heard the\nstories of the Book of Mormon, the Holy Ghost touched my heart and bore a sweet witness to\nit of the divine authenticity of that ancient record.  I knew then as I knew that I was alive that\nthe Book of Mormon is true, is divine, is a sacred record of the inhabitants of ancient\nAmerica.  As I grew older, I read the book many times, and each time the same sweet\ntestimony came into my heart, sometimes coming so forcefully that I was filled with emotion\nto the extent that tears ran down my cheeks. As I read the Book of Mormon now, the Holy\nGhost still bears testimony to me that it is the word of God.\n<\/p><p>\nI know that the Book of Mormon is one of the greatest books in the world. It contains the\ngospel of Jesus Christ to the Jews and to the Gentiles.  It is a new witness to Christ and the\ngreat work which he performed.  I challenge any honest man or woman in the world to put\nMoroni&rsquo;s exhortation to the test; and I promise that if it is done with real intent, having a true\ndesire to receive a testimony, and having faith in Christ, God will reveal\nthrough the Holy Ghost a testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon to each one\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38254\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38254)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38254)\">Moro. 10:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless the honest in heart throughout the entire world that they will study the Book\nof Mormon and receive a testimony; and may he bless the members of the Church that we\nwill study this sacred book and live in accordance with its teachings, I humbly pray, in the\nname of Jesus Christ.
