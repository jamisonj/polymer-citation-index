I pay tribute to those who have organized it and to all who have participated.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p5\" class=\"\">Prior to my call to full-time service as a Church leader, I worked as a medical doctor specializing in the teaching, research, and practice of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery. I performed about seven thousand operations. During nearly four decades as a student of medical sciences, I learned to distinguish between the physical and spiritual components of the human soul. A patient could be physically weak but spiritually strong, and vice versa. For example, on many occasions I watched the critically ill mobilize great spiritual strength in order to undergo a high-risk operation to correct a physical problem within the heart. In contrast, I saw individuals without physical abnormality who were seriously ill because of spiritual loss of heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p6\" class=\"\">Duties have taken me to approximately one hundred nations of the earth, where I have observed the physical and spiritual dualism of life on a broader scale. There I have noted examples of the same physical and spiritual disparity that I previously encountered in my profession. I have observed that if a great physical disaster should strike, such as a devastating earthquake or flood, people are motivated spiritually by an uncommon desire to help one another. After the great earthquake in Armenia in December 1988, for example, I saw spontaneous outpourings of help from all over the world. Donors from many nations contributed aid to hundreds of thousands of homeless victims. Generosity seemed to transcend political or racial differences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p7\" class=\"\">Fortunately, such major disasters are rare. But unfortunately, when normal life resumes, the pendulum seems to swing from spiritual vitality to laxity. It is ironic that as affluence and physical comforts increase, spiritual strength declines. This observation has prompted the title for my message: \u201cCombatting Spiritual Drift\u2014Our Global Pandemic.\u201d Reversing this crisis in the health of the human spirit is an enormous challenge.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Changes Since the Last Parliament of the World\u2019s Religions<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p9\" class=\"\">In the century that has elapsed since the last meeting of the Parliament of the World\u2019s Religions, there have been notable advances in virtually every field of human endeavor. Think of the progress made in transportation, communication, commerce, agriculture, medicine, science, and electronics.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p10\" class=\"\">But spiritual progress has lagged behind. We see evidences of increasing ethnic strife and hatred. Nationalism seems to be taking priority over brotherly love. Violence and civil wars are raging. Divorce and diminishing regard for the sanctity of human life have eroded the strength of the family\u2014the basic unit of society. Immorality, infidelity, and promiscuity\u2014once shunned\u2014are now tolerated and even condoned. We have witnessed the insidious intrusion of pornography, with its attendant denigration of the human soul. And gambling, which preys upon the poor and the compulsive, has crept from the realm of the illegal into the arena of governmental sponsorship.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Religion\u2019s Role in the Past Century<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p12\" class=\"\">We may well ask, \u201cWhat has been the role of religion during this past century?\u201d The lofty objectives and high ideals promoted by the religions of the world are truly commendable. Much good has been done. We should all feel a deep sense of gratitude for noble predecessors in every faith group.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p13\" class=\"\">At the same time, we should be objective enough to analyze past activity and note any efforts that might have been inadequate, misdirected, or even counterproductive. For instance, worldly trends may have been assimilated into some religious ideology. On occasion, there may have been misguided incursions of religion into the political arena. And in spite of the exemplary behavior of the majority of our religious leaders and members, inappropriate conduct by any individual identified with a specific religious movement tends to tarnish the image of all. Sadly, we have also witnessed instances of interfaith contention, maligning, and intolerance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p14\" class=\"\">Moreover, honest people searching for answers to life\u2019s greatest questions may have turned to religion, asking, \u201cWhere did I come from?

This can happen only as we proclaim eternal truths that have the power to engender spiritual strength. Human nature cannot be changed by reforming public policy; that kind of change comes by exposing the human mind and heart to the transforming teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. I have learned that when we teach His correct principles, people govern themselves appropriately.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p18\" class=\"\">We at this world parliament represent many religious persuasions. Because there is much that is praiseworthy in each of our faiths, it is important for us to maintain the integrity of our religious institutions and to preserve tolerance of each other\u2019s sacred beliefs. These factors are essential to the strength of a pluralistic society. Tolerance and understanding are enhanced as we teach clearly and courteously the tenets of our religions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p19\" class=\"\">In that spirit, and as done so well by previous speakers, I would like to speak of the organization I represent. I would like to speak of the institution and of the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sometimes known as the \u201cMormon\u201d church. That is not its correct name, as many of you may know; it is only a nickname\u2014derived from our belief in the Book of Mormon, to which I will refer later.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p21\" class=\"\">\n\t  <span class=\"strong\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Institutional Background<\/span>\n\t  <\/span>\n\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p22\" class=\"\">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has endured much persecution, oppression, and hardship. From these experiences has come our genuine passion for tolerance and a sincere appreciation for feelings held sacred by others. Early members of this church were some of the great pioneers in the development of the United States of America. All eight of my great-grandparents, for example, were early converts to this church from populous nations of Europe. All eight of them immigrated to the U.S.A. and became part of the nineteenth century\u2019s historic trailblazing trek westward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p23\" class=\"\">Now the Church has a worldwide membership in excess of eight million people.

For example, I previously served as general president of the Sunday School of the Church for eight years, while continuing my professional work as a cardiovascular surgeon. Our religious activities throughout the world are led by male and female volunteers. We believe that everyone can be happy because everyone can serve. Congregations in Germany are led by Germans, in Peru by Peruvians, in Japan by Japanese, and so on.

He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lord\u2019s anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20009\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20009)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20009)\">D&amp;C 135:3<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p44\" class=\"\">\n\t  <span class=\"strong\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">The Standard Works<\/span>\n\t  <\/span>\n\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p45\" class=\"\">We regard the Book of Mormon as companion scripture to the Holy Bible (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"7040\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7040)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7040)\">A of F 1:8<\/a><\/span>). While the Bible bears record of teachings the Lord gave to His prophets who lived in the Old World, the Book of Mormon contains teachings the Lord gave to His prophets who lived in the American hemisphere. This record covers a period of about a thousand years, from approximately 600 <span class=\"small\">B.C.<\/span> to <span class=\"small\">A.D.<\/span> 400 (although there is reference to other migrations and peoples preceding that time). The Book of Mormon bears record of the personal ministry of Jesus Christ, as the resurrected Lord, to inhabitants of ancient America. Prophets recorded His teachings among them.

It came as a heavenly gift to the entire human family. Originally inscribed on metallic plates and written in a modified Egyptian language, that record was preserved for many centuries, then made available for translation into the English language. That translation was done by the Prophet Joseph Smith through the gift and power of God. Subsequently, the book has been translated into many other languages. Since its first publication in 1830, millions of copies of the Book of Mormon have been printed. In the year 1992 alone, nearly five million copies were distributed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p46\" class=\"\">We have observed that sincere study of the Book of Mormon transforms the spirit and engenders a testimony of Jesus Christ that heals the spiritual hearts of men and women throughout the world. The more widely it is read and understood, the greater is its influence for good.

It affirms itself to be Christ\u2019s church of old, reestablished anew. Its message to the world is one of peace and goodwill, with a sincere invitation to come and partake of all the blessings incident to the new and everlasting covenant between God and His children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Interfaith Cooperation<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p97\" class=\"\">Moving now from the distinctive doctrines and tenets of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I would like to discuss areas in which faith groups may cooperate. Members of our church often join with other like-minded citizens, regardless of religious persuasion, in support of worthy causes and humanitarian projects. This can be done without losing independent identity and strength. We are mindful of history\u2019s lesson that attempts of interfaith groups to unify through theological blending have not always been successful. Indeed, when divine doctrines are compromised to accommodate social pressures, religious institutions become no more relevant in their mission than other agencies of good intent. At the same time, we should be models of tolerance of others whose sacred beliefs may differ from our own. We recognize that if one religion is persecuted, all are attacked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p98\" class=\"\">We need to safeguard the proper relationships of religion to governments and to the people we serve. We are under obligation to take a strong stand on moral issues in order to preserve a wholesome and ethical environment. As religious leaders, our participation in the political process may be needed to protect precious religious liberty. This is particularly important in countries of the earth whose citizens, until recently, have been deprived of freedom of religious expression and practice. Many of those nations are now shaping laws to allow freedoms that citizens of other countries have long enjoyed. These developing democracies deserve support.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p99\" class=\"\">Selected humanitarian projects can be pursued independently or cooperatively. We can promote education regarding moral values, the arts, service to humanity, and the value of education itself. We can give encouragement for family life, knowing that patience, righteousness, and love will be rewarded with joy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p101\" class=\"\">Returning to the medical metaphor with which I began, I firmly feel that the people of this world can be healed as we do our best in combatting spiritual drift\u2014our global pandemic. Healing requires a concurrent development of the will to live, the faith to become well, and the motivation to improve our world for future generations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p102\" class=\"\">May I conclude on a personal note. My expressions represent more than mere belief. I know from personal experience that God can and does communicate with individuals. Through that personal revelation, one may surely know that God lives, that His Beloved Son, Jesus, is the Christ, and that the doctrines I have discussed which are pertinent to man\u2019s salvation and eternal progress are true. Similar strong convictions in the hearts of millions of individual members comprise the real vitality of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic.p103\" class=\"\">After this exposure to the roots of our faith, you deserve to experience some of the good fruits by which you shall also know us.
