We pray that the emphasis we naturally place on families will not make you feel less needed or less valuable to the Lord or to His Church. The sacred bonds of Church membership go far beyond marital status, age, or present circumstance.

Prayerfully prepare for it and live for it. Be married the Lord\u2019s way. Temple marriage is a gospel ordinance of exaltation. Our Father in Heaven wants each of His daughters to have this eternal blessing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/to-the-single-adult-sisters-of-the-church.p21\" class=\"\">Therefore, don\u2019t trifle away your happiness by involvement with someone who cannot take you worthily to the temple. Make a decision now that this is the place where you will marry. To leave that decision until a romantic involvement develops is to take a risk the importance of which you cannot now fully calculate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/to-the-single-adult-sisters-of-the-church.p22\" class=\"\">And remember, you are not required to lower your standards in order to get a mate. Keep yourselves attractive, maintain high standards, maintain your self-respect. Do not engage in intimacies that bring heartache and sorrow.

Do not be so concerned about his physical appearance and his bank account that you overlook his more important qualities. Of course, he should be attractive to you, and he should be able to financially provide for you. But, does he have a strong testimony? Does he live the principles of the gospel and magnify his priesthood? Is he active in his ward and stake? Does he love home and family, and will he be a faithful husband and a good father? <span class=\"emphasis\">These <\/span>are qualities that really matter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/to-the-single-adult-sisters-of-the-church.p24\" class=\"\">And I would also caution you single sisters not to become so independent and self-reliant that you decide marriage isn\u2019t worth it and you can do just as well on your own. Some of our sisters indicate that they do not want to consider marriage until <span class=\"emphasis\">after <\/span>they have completed their degrees or pursued a career. This is not right. Certainly we want our single sisters to maximize their individual potential, to be well educated, and to do well at their present employment. You have much to contribute to society, to your community, and to your neighborhood. But we earnestly pray that our single sisters will desire honorable marriage in the temple to a worthy man and rear a righteous family, even though this may mean the sacrificing of degrees and careers. Our priorities are right when we realize there is no higher calling than to be an honorable wife and mother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>The Lord Knows and Loves You<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/to-the-single-adult-sisters-of-the-church.p26\" class=\"\">I also recognize that not all women in the Church will have an opportunity for marriage and motherhood in mortality.
