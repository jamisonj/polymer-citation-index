On July 24, 1847, the pioneer company of our people came into this valley. An advance group had arrived a day or two earlier. Brigham Young arrived on Saturday. The next day, Sabbath services were held both in the morning and in the afternoon. There was no hall of any kind in which to meet. I suppose that in the blistering heat of that July Sunday they sat on the tongues of their wagons and leaned against the wheels while the Brethren spoke. The season was late, and they were faced with a gargantuan and immediate task if they were to grow seed for the next season. But President Young pleaded with them not to violate the Sabbath then or in the future.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p6\" class=\"\">The next morning they divided into groups to explore their surroundings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p7\" class=\"\">Brigham Young, Wilford Woodruff, and a handful of their associates hiked from their campground a little to the south of us, on past the ground where we are, and up the hill to the north of us.

They did not look like statesmen with great dreams. They did not look like rulers poring over maps and planning an empire. They were exiles, driven from their fair city on the Mississippi into this desert region of the West. But they were possessed of a vision drawn from the scriptures and words of revelation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p16\" class=\"\">I marvel at the foresight of that little group. It was both audacious and bold. It was almost unbelievable. Here they were, almost a thousand miles from the nearest settlement to the east and almost eight hundred miles from the Pacific Coast. They were in an untried climate. The soil was different from that of the black loam of Illinois and Iowa, where they had most recently lived. They had never raised a crop here. They had never experienced a winter. They had not built a structure of any kind. These prophets, dressed in old, travel-worn clothes, standing in boots they had worn for more than a thousand miles from Nauvoo to this valley, spoke of a millennial vision. They spoke out of a prophetic view of the marvelous destiny of this cause. They came down from the peak that day and went to work to bring reality to their dream.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p17\" class=\"\">Sometimes in our day, as we walk our narrow paths and fill our little niches of responsibility, we lose sight of the grand picture. When I was a small boy, draft horses were common. An important part of the harness was the bridle. On the bridle were blinders, one on each side. They were so placed that the horse could see only straight ahead and not to either side. They were designed to keep him from becoming frightened or distracted and to keep his attention on the road at his feet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p18\" class=\"\">Some of us do our work as if we had blinders on our eyes. We see only our own little narrow track. We catch nothing of the broader vision. Ours may be a small responsibility in the Church. It is good to fulfill that responsibility with diligence.

While so doing, we must never lose sight of the greater picture, the large composite of the divine destiny of this work. It was given us by God our Eternal Father, and each of us has a part to play in the weaving of its magnificent tapestry. Our individual contribution may be small, but it is not unimportant.

The First Presidency responded: \u201cOur motives are not selfish; our purposes not petty and earth-bound; we contemplate the human race\u2014past, present, and yet to come\u2014as immortal beings, for whose salvation it is our mission to labor; and to this work, broad as eternity and deep as the love of God, we devote ourselves, now, and forever.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era,<\/span> May 1907, p. 495.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p28\" class=\"\">We serve as teachers in quorums and auxiliary organizations; we serve as missionaries at home and abroad; we serve as researchers in family history and as temple workers\u2014hopefully each with diligence in our little corner\u2014and from all of this there emerges a remarkable and wonderful pattern, a phenomenon grand in its comprehensiveness, as broad as the earth and encompassing all of the generations of men.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p29\" class=\"\">If each of us does not do well that which is his or hers to do, then there is a flaw in the entire pattern.

In August of 1852, only five years later, a special conference was held in the old tabernacle on this square. President Heber C.

Across the broad prairie between the mountains of the West and the Missouri and Mississippi rivers there were two bodies of Latter-day Saints moving in opposite directions. Missionaries traveling to the eastern states and Europe passed converts gathering from those lands to the Zion of the West. There was likewise a movement to the West Coast and across the Pacific, with elders going to Hawaii, even to Hong Kong, China, Siam, Ceylon, and India. This was all part of this grand vision of an ensign to the nations. It has gone on ever since, and it goes on today at an accelerated pace. In a hundred nations missionaries of the Church are teaching the doctrines of salvation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p37\" class=\"\">They are building the kingdom across the world.
