She\u2019s often thought of as \u201cSuperwoman.\u201d Some call her the typical Relief Society sister, the woman who makes fabulous bread, plays the organ like a professional, and dresses her impeccably groomed children in the clothes she\u2019s made.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/these-things-are-manifested-unto-us-plainly.p7\" class=\"\">Where is she?

For many of us, comparing ourselves to a practically perfect Latter-day Saint woman is part of how things are.

Because I know many of you, I know of your goodness and your individual gifts from the Lord. I can see that these comparisons may keep you from achieving your potential and basking in associations that will enrich your lives and the lives of others. Sometimes the basis for these incorrect comparisons comes from other Relief Society sisters, the Relief Society organization, or expectations about roles in life.

We can never accurately take the measure of our lives based on social, economic, ethnic, age, marital, or physical conditions. Ask yourself, are the comparisons you may make of yourself and others based on the model of the Savior\u2019s life, or do they come from trying to fit your life into the pattern of others\u2019 lives?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/these-things-are-manifested-unto-us-plainly.p15\" class=\"\">Sometimes comparisons creep up on us.
