Moyle, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1959, pp. 82-85<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brethren, this is a solemn moment for me, I can assure you. I have been coming to these\nSaturday evening Priesthood meetings for a good many years&mdash;all my life since I was\nordained a deacon. I was here when President McKay was called into the Twelve. I was here\nwhen President Richards was called into the Twelve. I have come here many times with my\nfather. I have realized that the instructions that were given to the Priesthood by the Brethren\non these occasions were equally good for father and for son.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the first call that has come to me to address this great body of Priesthood, and I assure\nyou that if I am able to give you any thoughts this evening that will be beneficial to the work,\nwe shall have to ascribe the honor to our Father in Heaven. I am sure we must all of us feel\ndependent upon him for the guidance, the direction and the inspiration essential for each one\nof us to have ever present in order to fulfill the calls which are made of us by those who\npreside over us in the Priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nI have a deep sense of appreciation for the work of these Brethren who have preceded me,\nand especially President Stephen L Richards. For many years past it has been my great\npleasure to be here and to expect to hear words of inspiration and wisdom from him, and I\nhave never been disappointed. We miss President Richards, and we continue, as we undertake\nto carry on, to remember his beloved wife and all of his posterity, and pray that the blessings\nof the Almighty may continue to be with them, to guide and direct them in the footsteps of\ntheir illustrious father and husband.\n<\/p><p>\nWe do not need, however, to eulogize men who perform their duties and responsibilities in\nthe Priesthood. Certainly that which we undertake to do is not done for the purpose of being\npraised of men. It is to give us that solemn deep-seated satisfaction in our hearts that we in\nsome small way have helped to establish the Kingdom of our Heavenly Father here upon this\nearth in these latter days. To this purpose we dedicate our lives and all that we have and are,\nand our constant prayer to our Heavenly Father is that we might have added strength, added\ncapacity, added capability to accomplish more and more in his service. If I have any\ncomplaint tonight it would be that the days are not long enough. Some of you were here last\nnight when I was suggesting to the bishops that we ought to increase the hours of proselyting\nof our stake missionaries, and I said I thought that we ought to strike an average of about 40\nhours a week. I, of course, misspoke myself&mdash;I meant 40 hours a month.\n<\/p><p>\nBut I have been thinking about that incident, and I know many men in this Church whose\ntime would permit them to live up to the ideal which I spoke unintentionally. We have\nthese&mdash;I was going to say, eight-hour days&mdash;but I suppose nobody works eight hours any\nmore, do they? Six times eight would be forty-eight, and it seems to me I heard something\nabout a 40 hour week, and sometimes weeks that call for lesser labor.\n<\/p><p>\nIt may not be entirely a coincidence that these shrinking hours of labor required of us in our\ndaily employment should come about coincident with the tremendous need that we have in the\nChurch for work in the service of the Master. This subject of ward teaching that Bishop\nCheever and Bishop Hill have so beautifully discussed with us tonight has at its root the\nperformance of a service, a labor. It is time-consuming, but how\ntremendously rewarding to know that every month of our lives we have contacted somebody,\nmade their lives happier and better than they otherwise would have been.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I know one of these bishops pretty well. He had no more been called into the bishopric\nthan he said to himself and to me and to some others in the ward, \"I wonder if it's necessary\nfor a young man to ever reach the age of 20 and not be worthy and ready and willing to go\non a mission?\" It is little wonder that he has ward teaching in his heart, because he could not\nhave hoped for such a result had the homes in which those young men lived not been visited\nregularly.\n<\/p><p>\nSometimes I get off on my statistics, but my best knowledge and understanding is that since\nhe became bishop there hasn't been a single boy escape, and if there have, perchance, been\none or two that I do not know about, I still say the record is miraculous, and it comes about\nas a result of work. Everyone of those young men who have gone into the mission \nfield&mdash;and I can speak with some feeling about this subject because one of them is my own \nson&mdash;loves his bishop, and when they come back from their mission fields, as they do nearly every\nmonth, they go to their bishop and tell him they are ready to go to work in the ward.\n<\/p><p>\nI tell you, brethren, this ward teaching is basically fundamental. It is the foundation, so to\nspeak, upon which we can build in any of our Church activities, to accomplish any results that\nare desirable. Now, we have in the Church today about one out of every four young men who\nreach the age of 20 who go on a mission. I want you bishops to ask yourselves this question:\n\"Where have we failed with reference to the other three?\" That was the plea that Bishop\nIsaacson made to you last night with reference to your Senior Aaronic Priesthood Group. I am\nsure that a bishop should either have that young man ready to go on a mission, or have the\nsatisfaction of knowing that he had exhausted the resources at his command in attempting to\nqualify him therefore.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have a tremendous need for missionaries, and I have a feeling, brethren, that if we started\nto exercise our Priesthood in our relationships with our families, our intimate relationships,\nearly in our family history, that our young men would have become so well assured of the\npower and the efficacy of the Priesthood held by their fathers, that it would become in very\ndeed their principal ambition in life to receive that same Priesthood, and I cannot think of any\ngreater satisfaction that comes into the life of a righteous father than to himself be worthy\nwhen the time arrives, and his son has qualified himself to receive either the Lesser or the\nHigher Priesthood, to confer that Priesthood upon him under the direction of his bishop or his\nstake president.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to leave this thought with you this evening, brethren. I do not believe that any one of\nus who are recipients of the Priesthood ever exercise that Priesthood in the performance of a\nsingle ordinance, the performance of a single act, in which we invoke the power of our\nPriesthood, without having in our hearts simultaneously therewith a deep-seated, genuine, true\ntestimony of the divinity of the work in which we are engaged, and a knowledge that God has\nin very deed restored his Priesthood to the earth, and that we have been the beneficiaries of\nthat great gift.\n<\/p><p>\nMy thoughts go back at the moment to when I was a little boy. I was awfully sick, I thought.\nI do not think my sickness was very serious. I may have had a bad case of measles or\nsomething like that, but I was sick, and I was miserable, and my father had lived so closely to\nme that I was just as certain as that I lived that when my father came home and I asked him\nto administer to me that I would be healed. Do you think a boy can go through that kind of\nan experience with his father and have his prayers answered, have his faith justified, and not\nlove that father? And even more important than that, not, have a keen realization and\nappreciation of the power that his father has by virtue of the Priesthood which has been\nconferred upon him? I am sure that from that moment on I lived, as far as I can review my\nlife in my own mind, to receive that same Priesthood, to perform that same service in behalf\nof my family when I might be blessed with one, and I never cease to be\ngrateful to the Lord for the almost innumerable instances when I have had the privilege of\nexercising my Priesthood outside the family circle in behalf of my brethren and sisters\nthroughout the Church, and being absolutely conscious when I laid my hands upon their heads\nthat there was a power there making itself manifest in my ministry, that would bring about the\npurposes of our Heavenly Father here upon this earth.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so I say if we exercise this Priesthood in behalf of our families we cannot help but have\nour families grow up to follow in our footsteps, and what father is there among us that would\nnot have his son go on a mission. I have made this statement many times in the Church in\nmany of your stakes&mdash;I have never yet been contradicted, I have never yet had a case brought\nto my attention that would disprove what I have said&mdash;and that is this: that the Lord has so\nblessed and prospered the Saints that today we are well enough off to send anybody on a\nmission that is worthy and willing to go, and supplement whenever necessary whatever means\nhe and his family may have to keep him on the mission. We are not having missionaries come\nhome in the middle of their missionary terms because their families have run out of finances.\n<\/p><p>\nNow the Lord has blessed us for a purpose. His blessings have not been showered upon us for\nthe purpose of our following the ways of the world. Why do you think we pay our tithing?\nIsn't it to put our hearts in tune with the Spirit of our Heavenly Father, to enter into a\npartnership with him and dedicate the other nine tenths to the best possible use available to\nbring about his purposes, first with the family, and second, with the ward.\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure the generosity of the Latter-day Saints knows no bounds. Some people say that\nthere are too many calls made upon us, but I never yet, and I think I can truthfully say this,\nin all my experience in the Church heard anyone complain about the cost of a mission. There\nis something about a mission. Sometimes I think it affects the family at home even more than\nthe missionary himself.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember one night many years ago in Charleston, West Virginia. We had a little group of\nmissionaries there as we toured the East Central States Mission&mdash;about 20, as I recall \nit&mdash;and one elder got up and said: \"Brother Moyle, I have only been on a mission for a year, but\nevery day that I am on my mission I have a stronger assurance come to me that as a result of\nmy mission I will bring my father into the Church. Do you know why I want to bring my\nfather into the Church? It is because I have seen and heard my mother pray for that event to\nhappen as far back as I can remember. I just have a feeling that if, through my diligence, my\neffort, my worthiness as a missionary, spending my two years in this mission, I can\naccomplish that result, I will have been able to give my mother that which she wants above\nall else on earth, and incidentally, make it possible for me to be sealed to my father and my\nmother, and give to them the benefits of the Holy Endowment.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to charge, if it were possible, every Latter-day Saint home to produce a\nmissionary. It would be easy to divide the homes in the Church between those who are\npresided over by returned missionaries, and those who are presided over by men who have\nnot filled that call. I am sure that the latter group have always been anxious, always just a\nlittle disappointed that they did not go on a mission themselves. There need be no\ndisappointment in the heart of any Latter-day Saint father, whether he has been on a mission\nor not. If I were the head of a family and I had not been on a mission, I would devote myself\nto receive the blessing of a mission through my son.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to say to you tonight, brethren, in all solemnity, that we can receive those blessings if\nwe rear our children to qualify for that great service, the greatest service of all. That is the\nservice to which the Twelve have been called, and all their Assistants and Associates. It is the\nprime charge that the Savior gave his Apostles of old&mdash;to go into the world and to preach\nthe gospel of Jesus Christ (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33116\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33116)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33116)\">Mark 16:15<\/a><\/span>),\nthe gospel of life and salvation, to all the children of our Heavenly\nFather here upon this earth.\n<\/p><p>\nI know that God lives. I know that the power of the Priesthood is with us,\nand I know that there is vested in President David O. McKay all the keys of the Priesthood.\nThere has flowed into this dispensation all of the power and all of the authority and all of the\nkeys and blessings of all other dispensations. That we know. And I am sure that you brethren\nwill have difficulty in realizing how deep-seated my gratitude to my Heavenly Father is for\nthis testimony, this knowledge that God lives, and that he sustains his mouthpiece upon this\nearth with power and authority to speak in his name every day of his life.\n<\/p><p>\nI do not know what in the world I could have done to be worthy of this close association with\nthese men whom I revere and idolize. For 53 years President McKay has been as dedicated a\nman as ever lived upon the face of the earth to the tasks which have been his, and now I have\nthe privilege of undertaking in my weak way to be of some assistance to him.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Clark and I have been thrown together in our Welfare work these many years, and I\nhave learned to love and respect and revere him. I do hope and pray that the Lord will bless\nme that my labors may in some small measure reflect the deep sense of gratitude I have in\nmy heart for this call, and make me capable, qualified, worthy, to continue to associate and to\ncounsel with you, my beloved brethren. I love the brethren of this Church. I am so grateful\nthat I have had these years of opportunity to associate with President Joseph Fielding Smith\nand the members of the Twelve. It was brought rather sternly to my realization that I was not\na member of the Twelve any more when my beloved friend, Howard W. Hunter, was called to\ntake my place in the Twelve. I love and respect and revere him, as I do all of the members of\nthe Twelve, and my prayer daily is that with this call which has come to me, the Lord may\nmake it possible for me to stand even closer and be more intimate, and draw greater strength\nfrom these Brethren who have sustained and upheld me all these years as a member of their\nQuorum.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I do invoke the blessings of the Lord upon us all, and pray that we will constantly unite\nour faith and prayers that the Lord will bless and sustain President McKay and President\nClark with the health and strength and vigor and vitality of body and of mind and of spirit,\nwhich will make it possible for them day to day to fulfill the righteous desires that they have\nin their hearts, the desires that they have to carry this work on, and this I pray humbly in the\nname of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
