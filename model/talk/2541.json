He thrills us; he thrills me and I am sure he thrills you. He is a mighty man of God, and yet he is so humble. He has the common touch; we all love him very much. And I am sure that I may speak for everyone of you in saying to him this day how grateful we are for his leadership and that we uphold and sustain him with all our hearts and all our souls. President Kimball, we are grateful for your leadership.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/eternal-togetherness.p4\" class=\"\">I have a friend whose name is Kenneth.

They do things together, go places together, have fun together. Some people may wonder what more they possibly could have. But they do lack one thing\u2014and it is a serious deficiency. They do not have that something which could make their happiness and togetherness permanent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/eternal-togetherness.p6\" class=\"\">They are <span class=\"emphasis\">so<\/span> satisfied with the present that they never have considered the possibility that someday it may all stop and that they won\u2019t have this happiness, this togetherness, any longer and that their present enjoyment may become but a pleasant memory.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/eternal-togetherness.p7\" class=\"\">Kenneth and his wife, Lucille, are good people, honest and upright. They don\u2019t go to church, though, and they feel they can be good enough without it. They teach their children honesty and virtue and they tell themselves that is about all the Church would do for them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/eternal-togetherness.p8\" class=\"\">And, anyway, they insist that they need their weekends for family recreation. Saturdays and Sundays are the only days Kenneth has free from his work, so church-going would really get in their way and would be an obstacle to their plans for each weekend\u2014so they tell themselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/eternal-togetherness.p9\" class=\"\">I would like now to talk to Kenneth and his family, and to all other families in similar circumstances.

I\u2019m sure you already believe that. And there is a God in heaven who is our eternal Father. You believe that too. But what are we doing to assure a proper place for ourselves in that eternity?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/eternal-togetherness.p31\" class=\"\">I think that we must all accept the fact that whereas God is a most merciful Father\u2014infinitely so\u2014he also is a just God.

As the children of God, we have within us the full capability of becoming like him. Isn\u2019t it natural for children to become like their parents? But we can\u2019t become like him merely through wishful thinking, nor even by being what we ourselves may call good.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/eternal-togetherness.p33\" class=\"\">He has his own plan for us to follow, and it alone will assure us the desired results. It is a formula for success both in this life and the life to come. Unless we follow it, we restrict ourselves. It is that way in everything else, isn\u2019t it? Do you remember when you studied chemistry in school? What happened if you didn\u2019t follow the formula in a laboratory experiment? Do you remember also in school that you were required to follow the curriculum or you couldn\u2019t graduate? It is the same with eternity. We have to follow the Lord\u2019s formula, which is his gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/eternal-togetherness.p34\" class=\"\">If we do, we may always have this togetherness which you now enjoy in your family, and neither death nor the resurrection will prevent it.
