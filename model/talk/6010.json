Relief Society has always been comprised of those who put others first and self last. I remember that when I was a small boy during the Depression, my mother was the secretary-treasurer of the ward Relief Society. Back then dues were paid to assist those in need. Mother was not really a bookkeeper, so Dad would help her. The individual contributions were never so much as a dollar, but rather would be a quarter, a dime, a nickel, a few pennies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/the-mighty-strength-of-the-relief-society.p12\" class=\"\">I learned many lessons from my mother.

Such men were always polite. They offered to do some work for the food. Indelibly imprinted on my mind is the picture of a gaunt and hungry man standing at our kitchen door, hat in hand, pleading for food. Mother would welcome such a visitor and would direct him to the kitchen sink to wash up while she prepared food for him to eat. She never skimped on quality or quantity; the visitor ate exactly the same lunch as did my father. As he wolfed down the food, Mother took the opportunity to counsel him to return to his home and his family. When he left the table, he had been nourished physically and spiritually. These men never failed to say thank you.

As they were about to discontinue their search, they noted a driveway which was strewn with mud puddles from a recent storm. It was next to a foundry. Sister Keachie gazed down the driveway perhaps 60 feet and could just make out a garage with a curtain at the window.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/the-mighty-strength-of-the-relief-society.p51\" class=\"\">Deciding to investigate, the two sweet sisters walked through the mud to a point where the entire garage could be seen. Now they noticed a door, not visible from the street, which had been cut into the side of the garage. They noticed a chimney with smoke rising from it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/the-mighty-strength-of-the-relief-society.p52\" class=\"\">They knocked at the door. A man of about 65 years of age, William Ringwood, answered. They presented their story concerning the need of every home having the <span class=\"emphasis\">Relief Society Magazine.<\/span> William Ringwood replied, \u201cYou\u2019d better ask my father.\u201d Ninety-three-year-old Charles W. Ringwood then came to the door and also listened to the message. He subscribed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/the-mighty-strength-of-the-relief-society.p53\" class=\"\">Elizabeth Keachie reported to me the presence of these two men in our ward. When I requested their membership certificates from the Membership Department at the Presiding Bishopric\u2019s Office, I was told that the certificates had remained in the lost file of the Presiding Bishopric\u2019s Office for many years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/the-mighty-strength-of-the-relief-society.p54\" class=\"\">On Sunday morning Elizabeth Keachie brought to our priesthood meeting Charles and William Ringwood\u2014the first time they had been inside a chapel for a long while. Charles Ringwood, 93, was the oldest deacon I had ever met, and his son was the oldest male member holding no priesthood I had ever met.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/the-mighty-strength-of-the-relief-society.p55\" class=\"\">The elder Brother Ringwood was ordained a priest and then an elder. I shall never forget his interview with respect to seeking a temple recommend. He handed me a silver dollar which he took from an old worn leather coin purse and said, \u201cThis is my fast offering.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/the-mighty-strength-of-the-relief-society.p56\" class=\"\">I replied, \u201cOh, Brother Ringwood, you owe no fast offering.

At his funeral service, I noticed his family sitting on the front row of the mortuary chapel, but I also noticed two sweet ladies sitting near the rear\u2014Elizabeth Keachie and Helen Ivory. As I gazed upon those two sweet women, I thought of the 76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants: \u201cI, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.
