Sill<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Sterling W. Sill, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1962, pp. 36-39<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brothers and sisters, I appreciate very much this privilege of participating with you in this\ngreat general conference of the Church. As a kind of text I would like to borrow a little from\nthe philosophy of Rudyard Kipling. Kipling was an English writer born in 1865. He lived in\nthat period when England was the world's leading naval power. He saw much of the\nchange-over from the old sailing ship to the use of steam as a means of ocean navigation.\nKipling preserved for us some interesting ideas about this transition in his poem entitled,\n\"M'Andrew's Hymn.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe dictionary says that a hymn is a song of praise or adoration, having a religious\nsignificance. Kipling's M'Andrew was the captain of an early steamship in the days when 98\npercent of the land-based work of the world was done by the muscle power of men and\nanimals. And even though M'Andrew's engines were very primitive, he praised God for the\nuse of this gigantic new power that had been placed in his hands, and he looked forward to\nthe time when his ship might attain a speed of 30 miles per hour.\n<\/p><p>\nM'Andrew sang: \n<\/p><p>\n\"From coupler-flange to spindle-guide I see Thy hand, O God&mdash;<br \/>\n     Predestination in the stride o'yon connectin' -rod.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen standing alone at night as he guided his ship home from its long journey abroad, he\nsaid: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I cannot get my sleep to-night; old bones are hard to please; <br \/>\n     I'll stand the middle watch up here&mdash;alone wi' God an' these<br \/>\n     My engines, after ninety days o'race an' rack an' strain<br \/>\n     Through all the seas of all Thy world, slam-bangin's home again.<br \/>\n     Slam-bang too much&mdash;they knock a wee&mdash;the cross-head gibs are loose,<br \/>\n     But thirty-thousand miles o' sea does them fair excuse.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen while reflecting upon the beginning and contemplating the future of the machine, he\nsaid: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Ten pounds was all the pressure then with which a man could drive; <br \/>\n     An' here, our workin' gauges given 165!<br \/>\n     We're creepin' up wi' each new rig&mdash;less weight an' larger power; <br \/>\n     There'll be the loco-boiler next an' thirty mile an hour!<br \/>\n     Thirty an' more. What I ha' seen since ocean-steam began<br \/>\n     Leaves me no doubt for the machine: but what about the man?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen for a while M'Andrew focuses his meditation upon some of the blemishes of the men\nwho run the machines. Frequently his sailors debased themselves and put ugly scars upon\ntheir souls. The fires of sin blackened their lives even as the flames blackened the ship's\nfurnaces. M'Andrew pointed out that in traveling a million miles of sea some of his sailors\nhad traveled an even greater distance away from God and the purposes for which they were\ncreated. But M'Andrew knew that the most important question must always be, \"what about\nthe man?\" He says: \n<\/p><p>\n\"'Tis the man that counts, wi' all his runs, o'er a million\n        miles o' sea: <br \/>\n     Four times the span from earth to moon . . . But how far, O Lord,\n        from Thee?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen thinking about the machine of the future M'Andrew said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"In spite of knock and scale, of friction waste and slip<br \/>\n     By thy great light, now mark my word<br \/>\n     We'll build a perfect ship.<br \/>\nI'll never last to judge her lines<br \/>\n     Or take her curve, not I.<br \/>\n     But I have lived, and I have worked<br \/>\n     Thanks be to Thee Most High.\"\n<\/p><p>\nFrom M'Andrew's day till now we have continued to perfect our machines until we have far\nsurpassed M'Andrew's dream of \"a perfect ship.\" The early steamship could hardly carry\nenough coal to provide the means of propelling itself across the ocean. But the new atomic\nships now being launched can carry a full cargo around the earth twenty times or more\nwithout ever a thought of refueling.\n<\/p><p>\nOur machines not only carry us across the oceans and take us under the polar icecap, but they\nplow our ground, cook our food, refrigerate our homes, make our clothes, balance our books,\ncarry our messages, build our roads, and move our mountains. Some pictures were recently\npublished showing the construction of the Suez Canal in the 1860's. They showed the dirt\nbeing removed in baskets, strapped to the backs of human beings. Then less than a hundred\nyears later a single giant earth-moving machine could do the work previously done by\nthousands of men.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have electronic brains equally as capable in the mental field. There are a great many\nphysical and mental jobs which we can no longer afford to have done by \"manpower\"\ninasmuch as \"machine power\" is so much cheaper and more effective. If M'Andrew praised\nGod for the machines of his day, what would he think of those of our time, capable of\ncarrying us through the stratosphere at many times the speed of sound, or what would he\nthink of our $20,000,000,000 project to put a man on the moon? If M'Andrew lived among\nus, he would be sure to commend us for our machines and equally sure to inquire, \"What\nabout the man?\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe just hope that when man finally does arrive on the moon, he will not create the sorry state\nof affairs there that presently trouble the earth. But whether here or on the moon, our most\nserious question will always be, \"What about the man?\" What about his honor, what about his\nfaith, what about his future? How much personal improvement will we make this year? An\ninvestment that pays five percent interest will more than double itself in fifteen years. How\nmuch personal doubling have we done in that time? It is wonderful for us to be able to stand\nflapping our wings in preparation for our flight into space, but in the process are we getting\nany closer to God and our own eternal life? Captain M'Andrew dreamed of building a perfect\nship, yet he said, \"It's the man that counts.\" What our world needs is more perfect men.\n<\/p><p>\nFor more than nineteen centuries now we have held up before our minds the example of a\nperfect man, and his greatest message was, \"Follow me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35155\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35155)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35155)\">Matt. 4:19<\/a><\/span>).\nWith all of our great ability, how\nwell are we following him in his faith? How well are we following him in his works, or in the\ndevelopment of real character qualities in ourselves? As the high point in the most important\nsermon ever given, the greatest man who ever lived said, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as\nyour Father which is in heaven is perfect\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35163\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35163)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35163)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>). Our Father in heaven is the most\nperfect, and the most intelligent Being in the universe. He is a member of the highest order in\nexistence. He has the greatest sense of values. He is God. But what about the man? Man's\neternal spirit is the literal offspring of God, and according to the natural laws of the universe,\nthe offspring may someday hope to become like the parent. There is everything in\nremembering our heritage and constantly reaffirming it by the perfection of our own lives.\n<\/p><p>\nBut generally we are not thinking very much about perfection in men. We live in the age of\nmachines. We occupy ourselves with armament races astronauts to the moon, and contests for\nsupremacy in material things. What a wonderful world we could have if we could make an\nimprovement in ourselves to match the improvement in the machines we operate!\n<\/p><p>\nMany years ago Harry Emerson Fosdick wrote an interesting book entitled, <i>On Being a Real Person<\/i>.\nHe detailed some of the items necessary if one desired to develop himself into a truly\noutstanding individual. And that is something we should work at a great deal harder than we\ndo. But in the Holy Scriptures God has given his own specifications for\ndeveloping life's highest values. It was intended that by following his formula every child of\nGod should become \"a magnificent human being\" and eventually become even as God. But\nfirst we must get rid of the dishonesties, the disloyalties, and the immoralities that destroy so\nmany of our lives and put perfection forever beyond our reach.\n<\/p><p>\nIn an absolute sense, perfection in this life may be an impossibility. But in many ways a state\nof near perfection <i>is<\/i> a reasonable goal for us; for example, we <i>can<\/i> all be perfect in abstaining\nfrom tea and coffee. We can be perfect in freeing ourselves from the use of tobacco and\nalcohol. We can be perfect in the payment of our tithing. We can be perfect in our attendance\nat Sacrament meeting. We can be perfectly honest and perfectly dependable and perfectly\nmoral, and this with much less effort than we spend in developing perfection in our machines.\n<\/p><p>\nThe book of Genesis says that Noah was a righteous man and perfect in his generation\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23679\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23679)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23679)\">Gen. 6:9<\/a><\/span>). Enoch\nwas also a perfect man, and under his teachings, his people so perfected themselves that the\nentire city was translated. The scripture says, \"And Enoch walked with God: and he was not;\nfor God took him\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23678\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23678)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23678)\">Gen. 5:24<\/a><\/span>).\nIf the people living in the city of Enoch could be perfect,\nthen the people living in your city and the people living in my city can be perfect also.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are some people who maintain that it is very difficult to live the religion of Christ, and\nfor some people any righteous effort is difficult. But what kind of person would you expect to\nbe most severely tempted by dishonesty or immorality or profanity? Or what kind of person\nwould you expect to have the most difficulty in abstaining from drunkenness or from\nbetraying his country? The ones suffering the strongest temptations from evil would likely be\nthose living closest to evil. It has been pointed out that no one ever fell into a mud puddle\nwho didn't first go too close to it. We are not necessarily complimenting ourselves when we\nboast of the difficulty we have in living our religion, just as we would not be complimenting\nourselves to confess difficulty in restraining ourselves from being thieves and murderers.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is not difficult to live the religion of Christ if that is what we really want to do. That is, it\nis just as easy for an honest man to be honest as it is for a dishonest man to be dishonest. It is\njust as easy for a faithful man to be faithful as it is for an unfaithful man to be unfaithful. In\nfact, it has been said that one can get to heaven on half the effort that we usually burn up in\ngoing to hell.\n<\/p><p>\nWe become godly or moral or obedient, just as we become anything else, by practice. And\nonly as we live the principles of the gospel can we really know of their truthfulness and\nvalue. It is the person who pays his tithing who believes in tithing. It is the one who observes\nthe Word of Wisdom who knows the truth of the Word of Wisdom. It is the person who\nkeeps the Sabbath day holy who champions it. And it is only the person who gives service\nwho knows the joys of serving.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus said, \"He that doeth my will shall know of the doctrine\" (see\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28012\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28012)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28012)\">John 7:17<\/a><\/span>). And Emerson\nsaid, \"Do the thing and you shall have the power.\" If we can live one gospel principle\nperfectly today, we can live two gospel principles perfectly tomorrow. Perfection in one thing\nwill act as a steppingstone to perfection in something else and soon we may approach\nperfection in all things.\n<\/p><p>\nIn announcing his famous \"as if\" principle, William James said that if you want a quality, act\n\"as if\" you already had it. If you want to be friendly, act as if you are already friendly. If you\nwant to be courageous, don't go around talking fear and indulging in negative, un-Christian\nthinking. If you want to be faithful, act \"as if\" you are already faithful. Do the things that\nfaithful people do. Go to church, say your prayers, love God, refrain from evil, study the\nscriptures, be honest with yourself, and everyone else. And if you would like to be perfect,\nact \"as if\" you were already perfect. Don't go around glorying in your sins and weaknesses.\nWe can come very close to perfection if we really get the spirit of it in our hearts.\nIf we really want to obey God, we should act \"as if\" we were already\nobedient. We should think obedience, love obedience, practice obedience, and we should\nallow no exceptions to obedience. The fewer the exceptions to perfection, the nearer we get to\nperfection.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the Golden Age of Greece, Pericles said that no one had a right to fill an important\noffice until he had first filled some smaller offices with distinction. Too frequently we want to\ndo some great thing before we have practiced perfection in doing little things well.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we want to be great souls in heaven, we should practice being great souls here. If we\nbelieve that honor is better than dishonor, then we should immediately begin practicing honor,\nnot just in big things, but in all things.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is no question about the fact that our machines of the future will become more and\nmore efficient. Our standard of living will probably go on increasing; our land will become\nmore and more productive; our cities will become bigger and more beautiful. Recently there\nwas unveiled in this city a master plan for our second century of development. Certainly in\nthe future thousands of people will come here to admire our wide streets, our beautiful parks,\nand our useful buildings. But far the most important part of what our visitors will want to\nknow is, \"What about the man?\" They will want to know how well we are living this new\nrevelation of the gospel. M'Andrew may well join with Edwin Markham and Sing: \n<\/p><p>\n\"We are all blind until we see<br \/>\n     That in the human plan,<br \/>\n     Nothing is worth the building<br \/>\n     That does not build the man.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Why build these cities glorious,<br \/>\n     If man unbuilded goes.<br \/>\n     In vain we build the world,<br \/>\n     Unless the builder also grows.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure of this, that the greatest waste there is in the world is not our blighted cities, nor\nthe erosion of our soils, nor the depletion of our natural resources. It isn't the devastation of\nour wars nor the cost of our crime. The greatest waste there is in the world is that human\nbeings, you and I, live so far below the level of our possibilities; compared with what we\nmight be, we are only half alive. The most important part of any second century plan would\nbe to constitute our lives as a hymn of praise to our Heavenly Father, not only for the\ninestimable privilege of building a perfect ship and building a perfect city and building a\nperfect national community, but we should also build into our lives a perfect devotion for\nGod's perfect plan designed to bring about our perfection and eternal glory. May each of us\nbe able to find God's own answer to M'Andrew's question, is my prayer, which I ask in the\nname of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
