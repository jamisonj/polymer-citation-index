The power to bind and seal on earth and in heaven has again been entrusted to authorized servants of God. Eternal marriage, marriage of highest promise, is again performed for time and for all eternity by qualified officiators in the holy temples of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>2. A Happy Marriage\u2014Forever<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p22\" class=\"\">But a marriage designed to last forever will be a good marriage, growing and gracious. Sometimes the distinctive elements of temple marriage are thought of as being exclusive in duration and authority. Of course, everyone who comes to the temple to be married understands that the ceremony is performed by God\u2019s authority for time and eternity. But the remarkable revealed ceremony at the altar in a temple contemplates <span class=\"emphasis\">much more<\/span> than this. The quality of the relationship thus established is of highest importance. Wonderful promises are sealed upon a man and woman in temple marriage, and the realization of the promised blessings is related directly to their understanding and keeping the solemn commitments they make to each other and the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p23\" class=\"\">Those commitments in a temple are total and permanent\u2014involving the whole person, <span class=\"emphasis\">as is,<\/span> for the whole journey. Neither will remain as he or she is, of course; they will both grow and develop in a multitude of ways. But this marriage ceremony is without condition or reservation, save only the faithfulness of those who make it. On this solid foundation the newly formed family joyfully undertakes to learn how to live happily forever, to build a strong and loving union that will grow more wholesome and more glorious everlastingly. How do we ensure success in such a vital and great undertaking?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p24\" class=\"\">Many new and enduring relationships spring into being with marriage\u2014relationships all of which are vital to the happiness of the family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p25\" class=\"\">For her, the words\u2014sacred words\u2014are wife, mother, homemaker, heart of a home; for him, husband, father, protector, provider, leader in his home in the warm spirit of the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p26\" class=\"\">Together they enter a <span class=\"emphasis\">partnership,<\/span> sharing and learning and growing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p27\" class=\"\">They join their lives as <span class=\"emphasis\">companions<\/span> in the special sense that married people do. Whether in the same room or a world apart, they are married twenty-four hours a day. They care about the whole person, the whole future of each other. With good humor and good disposition and genuine consideration of the needs of the other, they set out to <span class=\"emphasis\">make<\/span> it a happy life. They laugh a lot and cry a little. They are warm and considerate and thoughtful: the note, the telephone call, the kind word, the sensitive response, the excitement of heading home to her, of having him come home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p28\" class=\"\">Married people are <span class=\"emphasis\">sweethearts,<\/span> in a special creative union, blessed with that powerful chemistry that draws two together, sometimes from next door, sometimes from a world away.

It blows away the chaff and takes the kernel, rejoices in the uniqueness of the other, listens patiently, gives generously, forgives freely. Friendship will motivate one to cross the room one day and say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d It will not pretend perfection nor demand it. It will not insist that both respond exactly the same in every thought and feeling, but it will bring to the union honesty, integrity. There will be repentance and forgiveness in every marriage\u2014every good marriage\u2014and respect and trust.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p36\" class=\"\">And all these and other elements we are not able to mention eloquently declare that such a union doesn\u2019t just <span class=\"emphasis\">happen.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p37\" class=\"\">So the need becomes clear for careful, thoughtful preparation, selection, and courtship. No one should be unwise enough to count on an across-the-crowded-room romanticized live-happily- ever-after marriage made without proper thoughtfulness, preparation, and prayer. Marriage is an everyday and every-way relationship in which honesty and character and shared convictions and objectives and views about finances and family and life-style are more important than moonlight and music and an attractive profile.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>3. A Culminating Covenant<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p39\" class=\"\">The surest basis for all of this is to be worthily married in the temple. But temple marriage is not an isolated ordinance. It serves both as a culmination of other ordinances and the foundation for family and the eternal future.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p40\" class=\"\">Perhaps some of you young men do not know that no one can enter into a temple marriage until he or she has been to the temple previously to receive his or her own blessings. Two who desire an eternal marriage cannot establish that relationship until each has personally made sacred covenants with the Lord. These covenants center in principles that are basic in a truly Christian life and in the foundation of a good marriage and family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p41\" class=\"\">You see, the covenants we make in the temple, like the other sacred ordinances in the kingdom, relate us to and center in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p42\" class=\"\">In the temple we make commitments to follow Him in doing God\u2019s will and keeping His commandments, in valuing others and in unselfishly serving, in loving God and our fellowmen. Sexual purity and complete fidelity to moral principle are promised, with a sense of self-worth and self-control and whole-souled devotion to the cause of righteousness and truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p43\" class=\"\">All of this happens through the priesthood, the Holy Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God.

A thoughtful understanding of this should automatically eliminate any false perceptions of superiority or inferiority. Men and women are of equal value before God and must be equally valuable in the eyes of each other. A true devotion to following the example of the Son of God will never permit notions of domination or dictatorship or possession or control. It will never justify unrighteousness or abuse or filth or discourtesy. Christ\u2019s way is the way of persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, love unfeigned.

Two Mature Adults<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p45\" class=\"\">It is simple to see, isn\u2019t it, that the kind of marriage we\u2019re talking about doesn\u2019t just happen? The foundation is laid in the House of the Lord. The marriage is pronounced by authority of God. And then it is fashioned by two who are wholesome, prepared emotionally and practically, and who are honest. It requires being <span class=\"emphasis\">ready<\/span> to go to a temple, being mature enough to make promises and keep them and to receive holy promises and qualify for them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p46\" class=\"\">So wherever we are with respect to marriage\u2014years from it, close to it, or deeply committed in it\u2014we must be wise, be faithful to the commandments of God, be true. Marriage is the closest and most intimate relationship one makes in this life, and the most serious and sacred decision. If you haven\u2019t been to the Lord\u2019s house, get ready, be clean, prepare to come to establish the foundation for a special, happy, eternal marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/eternal-marriage.p47\" class=\"\">And the inspiration for all of this is the sweet assurance\u2014deeply rooted in the heart of every decent man who is living as he should with his sweetheart wife, or who has so lived, or who is planning and preparing such a union\u2014that heaven will be heaven for us because we know we will be there with the one we love the best. Parley P. Pratt said after he met the Prophet in Philadelphia that \u201cit was from him that I learned that the wife of my bosom might be secured to me for time and all eternity; and that the refined sympathies and affections which endeared us to each other emanated from the foundation of divine eternal love. It was from the Prophet that I learned that we might cultivate these affections, and grow and increase in the same to all eternity.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Autobiography of Parley P.

Our last child was born twenty-four years ago, but the circle continues to expand and grow. God being willing, we may live to see another generation of wonderful children entering the world. We are grateful to know that our family will relate with us eternally, even as we will with those who gave us mortal life, and all of us together will find a loving place ultimately and a continuing relationship under the holy influence of Him whose spirit children we are and of Him whose holy sacrifice brought us the blessings of eternal life.
