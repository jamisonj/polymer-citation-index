We thank God for the revelations that He gives to His prophet, President Thomas S. Monson.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/a-plea-to-my-sisters.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">Brothers and sisters, when we met in general conference six months ago, none of us anticipated the coming changes that would tug at the heartstrings of the entire Church. Elder L.\u00a0Tom Perry delivered a powerful message about the irreplaceable role that marriage and family occupy in the Lord\u2019s plan. We were stunned when just a few days later, we learned of the cancer that would soon take him from us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/a-plea-to-my-sisters.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">Though President Boyd\u00a0K. Packer\u2019s health had been declining, he continued to \u201csoldier on\u201d in the work of the Lord. He was frail last April, yet he was determined to declare his witness as long as he had breath. Then, just 34 days after Elder Perry\u2019s passing, President Packer also stepped across the veil.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/a-plea-to-my-sisters.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">We missed Elder Richard G. Scott at our last general conference, but we\u2019ve reflected upon the powerful witness of the Savior he had borne in many previous conferences. And just 12 days ago, Elder Scott was called home and reunited with his beloved Jeanene.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/a-plea-to-my-sisters.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">I had the privilege of being with all of these Brethren during their final days, including joining members of President Packer\u2019s and Elder Scott\u2019s immediate families just before their passing. It has been difficult for me to believe that these three treasured friends, these magnificent servants of the Lord, are gone. I miss them more than I can say.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/a-plea-to-my-sisters.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">As I\u2019ve reflected on this unexpected turn of events, one of the impressions that has lingered with me is that which I observed in these surviving wives. Etched in my mind are the serene images of Sister Donna Smith Packer and Sister Barbara Dayton Perry at their husbands\u2019 bedsides, both women filled with love, truth, and pure faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/a-plea-to-my-sisters.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">As Sister Packer sat next to her husband in his final hours, she radiated that peace that passes all understanding.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-12461_000_037\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"131261\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131261)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131261)\">Philippians 4:7<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Though she realized that her beloved companion of almost 70 years would soon depart, she showed the tranquility of a faith-filled woman.

Her older brother had previously died of a similar condition. Her parents pleaded for help. I was not optimistic about the outcome but vowed to do all in my power to save her life. Despite my best efforts, the child died. Later, the same parents brought another daughter to me, then just 16 months old, also born with a malformed heart. Again, at their request, I performed an operation. This child also died. This third heartbreaking loss in one family literally undid me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/a-plea-to-my-sisters.p24\" class=\"\" id=\"p24\">I went home grief stricken. I threw myself upon our living room floor and cried all night long. Dantzel stayed by my side, listening as I repeatedly declared that I would never perform another heart operation. Then, around 5:00 in the morning, Dantzel looked at me and lovingly asked, \u201cAre you finished crying? Then get dressed. Go back to the lab. Go to work! You need to learn more. If you quit now, others will have to painfully learn what you already know.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/a-plea-to-my-sisters.p25\" class=\"\" id=\"p25\">Oh, how I needed my wife\u2019s vision, grit, and love!
