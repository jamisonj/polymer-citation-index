From it we receive\nstrength and courage. It occurred to me as I sat here this morning and this afternoon that the\nChurch is a great educational institution, supplying the training and the education so much\nneeded in this world, torn asunder at the present time by war and destruction. Its purpose is to\nenlighten and exalt humanity.\n<\/p><p>\nCONFERENCES AN INSPIRATION\n<\/p><p>\nToday, in conference assembled, we rejoice in the efficiency of this Church, in its vitality, its\npower, its growth, its leadership, in its comprehensive program, and in the wide scope of its\nactivities. The conferences of the Church have always been a great inspiration to the\nLatter-day Saints. We come here to be renewed in our faith, to be encouraged in our labors\nand to be strengthened in our responsibility, and we never go away disappointed.\n<\/p><p>\nRELIGION A PRESENT DAY NEED\n<\/p><p>\nThe challenge to you and me today, as workers in this Church, has never been greater. \"There\nwas never a time more cut off from Christ,\" says a modern writer, \"than the present, and there\nwas never a time that needed Him more.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe have witnessed in recent years a departure from fundamentals long established, a breaking\naway from standards and doctrines that are as old as the Decalog. The paramount need of the\nhour, it seems to me, is a return to the old-fashioned virtues that formed the very bedrock of\nour social and economic life. We should have learned long ago that paganism and true\nChristianity can never be welded together. You cannot serve God and Mammon, said Jesus\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33832\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33832)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33832)\">Matt. 6:24<\/a><\/span>).\nThat doctrine was true centuries ago when it was uttered; it is true today. A compromising,\ndistorted and vacillating Christianity was never taught by Jesus and His apostles, or by Joseph\nSmith and his followers. They were firm and unyielding in their requirements for Church\nmembership\n<\/p><p>\nREJOICES IN CHURCH\n<\/p><p>\nI rejoice in the testimonies which have come to me concerning the divinity of God's work. It\nis a great work, as I said in the beginning. The Church is great in purpose and plan, in its\nprogram. It is great in its achievements, and in its missionary endeavor. In these days of crisis\nand turmoil we must not fail, for much depends upon our faith, our integrity, and our activity\nin the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless the Latter-day Saints, that they may be true to their responsibilities and true to\ntheir convictions, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
