I am able to work nearly half of each day at my office, and\nsometimes more, with the counsel and consent of my doctor. It is his recommendation,\nhowever, that I do not speak at this time, and so I shall ask your forbearance while that\nwhich I have to say shall be read. If I were on my feet, speaking under the momentary\npromptings of the Spirit, perhaps it would be given to me to say more things in addition to\nthose which are here written&mdash;and I ask the Lord that he may direct all who speak during this\nconference, that they may speak under the guiding influence of his holy spirit, and that those\nthings which are now read, and those things which shall yet be spoken, will further bear\nwitness of the truthfulness of the cause in which we are met, and give comfort and counsel to\nall who shall hear or read them.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I sit in this tabernacle my mind goes back over the many years that have passed since we\nfirst began holding meetings here. I see the leaders of this people who have come and\ngone&mdash;from Brigham Young on down&mdash;and I can see generations of the priesthood of Israel\nwho have gathered here to learn their duty\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12051\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12051)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12051)\">D&amp;C 107:99<\/a><\/span>),\nto renew their faith, and to go forth to labor for\nthe furtherance of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Faces and events pass in memory&mdash;the\nfaces of mighty men of God, most of whom have long since finished their work here&mdash;and\nyou, my brethren, have taken their places, and carry forward the work from where they left it.\n<\/p><p>\nMY BROTHER'S CONVERSION\n<\/p><p>\nAs I sit here today, I remember what to me was one of the greatest of all the incidents in my\nlife, in this tabernacle. One Sunday afternoon, nearly fifty years ago, I came here as one of\nthe youngest of the apostles to attend the meeting, and saw for the first time in the \ncongregation, my brother who had been careless, indifferent, and wayward, and who had\nevinced no interest in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. My brother, Fred, and I had engaged in a\nventure which had failed. We had both placed all that we had in it and more. Feeling that he\nhad ruined me financially and being without that faith which sustains in time of crisis, Fred\nwent into the woods with the intention of taking his own life. Finally, he got down on his\nknees and prayed, \"O God, if there is a God!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8830\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8830)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8830)\">Alma 22:18<\/a><\/span>). When he got up from his knees, he threw his\npistol into the brush, and sat down and wrote me a letter, saying that he knew there was a\nGod who told men to do good, and that there was a devil who inspired men to destroy their\nown lives, which is second only to murder.\n<\/p><p>\nAs soon as he had written the letter a spirit came over him telling him, \"The minute your\nbrother gets that letter he will insist on you being baptized. You are a fine specimen to be\nbaptized; you are one of the worst profaners in the country; you once had an interest in a\ngambling house.\" And so he threw the letter into his trunk instead of mailing it.\n<\/p><p>\nThe next night he wrote the same thing again, and shed more tears, but did not have the\ncourage to send me that letter either. He wrote three such letters and put them all into his\ntrunk. Finally, he wrote again and said, \"Heber, this letter is going to be mailed,\" and he went\nto the post office and mailed it. He fought all night with himself, and got up\nbefore daylight and went to the post office and got the letter out and threw it in the trunk\nalso. Finally, he wrote again and said, \"This letter will surely be mailed.\" He did mail it, and\nagain he got up before daylight and started for the post office to get it out, but came to a\nlarge post or pole and threw his arm around it, and said, \"I am going to stand here and hold\non until the mail goes out,\" which he did.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I got his letter, instead of my writing and telling him he was to be baptized I wrote\nhim and said, \"Fred, maybe now that you know there is a God and a devil, you think I will\nask you to be baptized, but as long as you live I do not want you to be baptized until you\nyourself have faith in the truth of the Gospel.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI bought a Book of Mormon and took it to my office, and I prayed to The Lord that when I\nopened it it would be to the best passage in the entire book for my brother. It opened to the\n36th chapter of Alma (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8836\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8836)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8836)\">Alma 36:1-30<\/a><\/span>), wherein Alma tells of his going about with the sons of Mosiah,\nfighting against the Church, and that he had suffered the torments of the damned, but after\npraying to the Lord and becoming converted to the truth he had exquisite joy, and from that\nday he had labored unceasingly to bring souls to a knowledge of God.\n<\/p><p>\nI turned that page down, and I turned down a page at chapter 29 wherein Alma says: \"O that\nI were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with\nthe trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8832\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8832)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8832)\">Alma 29:1<\/a><\/span>). I\nfelt that those comments were the best in the whole book for my brother, and I thanked the\nLord that the book had opened to the 36th chapter of Alma, and for prompting me also to\nthink of the 29th chapter. When, after this, I saw Fred for the first time in this building, and\nrealized that he was seeking God for light and knowledge regarding the divinity of this work,\nI bowed my head and I prayed that if I were requested to address the audience, the Lord\nwould inspire me by the revelation of His Spirit, to speak in such manner that my brother\nwould have to acknowledge to me that I had spoken beyond my natural ability, that I had\nbeen inspired of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nI realized that if he made that confession, then I should be able to point out to him that God\nhad given him a testimony of the divinity of this work.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Angus M. Cannon, who was presiding at the meeting, came to me and said:\n\"Brother Milton Bennion is here and has been invited to speak, but he can come some other\nday.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI said: \"I never speak long. Let Brother Bennion take all the time he needs and I will take\nwhat time is left.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Bennion told of his visit around the world; among other things, of visiting the Holy\nLand and the sepulchre of Jesus.\n<\/p><p>\nWhile he was speaking, I took out of my pocket a Ready Reference that I always carried, and\nmarked some passages that tell of the vicarious work for the dead, of the announcement that\nJesus went and preached to the spirits in prison, and proclaimed the Gospel of Jesus Christ to\nthem (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2220\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2220)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2220)\">1 Pet. 3:18-19<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2222\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2222)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2222)\">1 Pet. 4:6<\/a><\/span>). I intended to preach upon the fact that the Savior of the world had\nnot only brought the Gospel to every soul upon the earth, but also that it reached back to all\nthose who had died without a knowledge of it, and that they would have the privilege of\nhearing it. In choosing this subject, I thought, \"What will appeal most to my brother?\" Our\nfather had died when Fred was six weeks old, and realizing that work was being done where\nhis father now is, it seemed to me that this was the best subject I could discuss.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen it came time for me to speak, I remember standing here at this pulpit, feeling that this\nwas perhaps the greatest of all the great themes that we as Latter-day Saints had to proclaim\nto the world. I laid the book down, opened at that page. I said: \"I cannot tell you just why,\nbut never before in all my life have I desired so much the inspiration of the Lord as I desire it\ntoday.\" I asked the people for their faith and prayers. I prayed for the inspiration of the Lord,\nand I never thought of the book from that minute until I sat down thirty minutes later. I\nclosed my remarks at twelve minutes after three o'clock, expecting that President George Q.\nCannon, who was also present, would follow me. Brother Angus Cannon came to the upper\nstand, and said, \"Brother George, there are forty-eight minutes left for you; will you occupy\nthe rest of the time?\"\n<\/p><p>\nBrother George Q. Cannon declined, and indicated that he thought it would be a good time to\nclose the meeting. But Brother Angus refused to take \"No\" for an answer, and said: \"I am not\ngoing to waste three-quarters of an hour. If you don't speak, I shall call on somebody else to\noccupy the balance of the time.\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Cannon said, finally: \"All right, I will say something. And he arose and said in\nsubstance:\n<\/p><p>\n\"There are times when the Lord Almighty inspires some speaker by the revelations of His\nSpirit, and he is so abundantly blessed by the inspiration of the living God that it is a mistake\nfor anybody else to speak following him, and one of those occasions has been today in the\naddress of Brother Grant, and I therefore ask President Angus Cannon to call on someone to\noffer the benediction, after the choir has sung, and dismiss the meeting.\" Of course Brother\nAngus could do nothing else.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I sat down after my talk, I remembered that my book was still lying open on the pulpit.\nPresident George Q. Cannon was behind me in the President's seat, and I heard him say to\nhimself: \"Thank God for the power of that testimony!\" When I heard this I remembered that I had forgotten\nthe sermon I had intended to deliver, and the tears gushed from my eyes like rain, and I\nrested my elbows on my knees and put my hands over my face, so that the people by me\ncould not see that I was weeping like a child. I knew when I heard those words of George Q.\nCannon that God had heard and answered my prayer. I knew that my brother's heart was\ntouched.\n<\/p><p>\nI devoted my thirty minutes almost entirely to a testimony of my knowledge that God lives,\nthat Jesus is the Christ, and to the wonderful and marvelous labors of the Prophet Joseph\nSmith, bearing witness to the knowledge God had given me that Joseph\nSmith was in very deed a prophet of the true and living God. I will not take time here to\nrepeat that whole sermon, but some paragraphs from it I should like to recall now. I said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"It affords deep interest, no doubt, to all the Latter-day Saints who are here, as well as to\nthose who are not members of the Church,. . . . to listen to a recital that has any bearing upon\nthe life and labors of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It is a remarkable fact that we can\nnever read of the labors which he performed, or listen to others speaking of the great work\nwhich he accomplished, without taking pleasure in it, while on the other hand, there is\nnothing so interesting in the life and history of any other individual but what by hearing or\nreading it time and time again we become tired of it. I can bear testimony, from my own\nexperience, that the oftener I read of the life and labors of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\nthe greater are the joy, the peace, the happiness, the satisfaction that fill my soul in\ncontemplating what he did.\n<\/p><p>\n\"It is also a source of unbounded joy to me and fills my heart beyond my power of\nexpression to contemplate the fact that God our Heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus Christ\nhave visited the earth and again revealed the gospel to man; and it fills me with thanksgiving\nand gratitude, far beyond my power to tell, that he has blessed me with a knowledge of the\ndivinity of the work in which we are engaged. The Lord in this regard has been no respecter\nof persons (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7523\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7523)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7523)\">Acts 10:34<\/a><\/span>).\nThe humble, the poor, the unlearned (so far as the education of this world is\nconcerned) have been as abundantly blessed of God with this testimony as those that have had\nmore abundantly of the things of this world. We find people that have been gathered from all\nthe nations of the earth, in fulfilment of the prophecies that were uttered thousands of years\nago, that the Saints should be brought to the tops of the mountains and that the Lord would\nestablish His work here (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25006\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25006)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25006)\">Isa. 2:2<\/a><\/span>);\nand this people are blessed with a testimony of the divinity of the\nwork in which they are engaged. . . . No power upon the face of the earth, not the wisdom of\nall the wise men combined, could ever have united the hearts and the souls of the Latter-day\nSaints as God has united them. . . . \n<\/p><p>\n\"While I was visiting in St. George and talking with the president of the St. George Stake of\nZion, I was forcibly reminded of the faith that burns in the hearts of the Latter-day Saints. He\nwas speaking of his early experience, and he told me that one day President Young said to\nhim, 'Brother McArthur, within ten days I wish you to prepare to go on a mission to Europe,\nand I expect you to be absent for four and perhaps seven years.' That very day that he was\ntold to get ready he had a child born, and when he returned home the child was over four\nyears of age.\n<\/p><p>\n\"In going upon that mission he did not have the means. . ., but he sold some property that\nwas worth three or four times as much as he was able to get for it; in fact, some few months\nafter, it changed hands for about four times more than what he sold it for. He made this\nsacrifice, and without one dollar of reward he went to the nations of the earth and spent four\nyears of his life proclaiming the gospel, declaring that the angel that was\nseen flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting Gospel to preach to them that\ndwelt on the earth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42163\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42163)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42163)\">Rev. 14:6<\/a><\/span>) had come,\nand that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God who testified of\nthis.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Brother McArthur told me of many incidents of his mission that were truly remarkable.\nAmong other things, he said the Prophet Joseph Smith visited him while he was on this\nmission. And I say to you today that. . . thousands, yes, tens of thousands of men and women\nwill stand up and testify, as Brother McArthur did to me, that God our Father has blessed\nthem, that he has given them manifestations of his approval of their labors which have been\ninspired by the Holy Ghost; and they will, in all solemnity and without any excitement, testify\nto you that they do know for themselves that they are engaged in the work of God. . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"More than once I have heard President Wilford Woodruff say, in private and public, that he\nhas listened to the Prophet Joseph Smith stating to them the fact that the Latter-day Saints\nwould yet come to the valleys of the Rocky Mountains and become a great and a prosperous\npeople. We stand today as a living evidence to the world of the divinity of mission of the\nProphet Joseph Smith. Why? Because our very presence in these mountains is a fulfilment of\nthe predictions of that inspired man. . . . I stand before you today a mere boy, and yet Joseph\nSmith was martyred when he was a year younger than I am. . . . When we contemplate what\nhe did. . . it is indeed a marvel and a wonder. In speaking of this I am reminded of. . . the\nbook, Figures of the Past, written by Josiah Quincy, who was a statesman and a\nphilanthropist. In it was the following statement:\n<\/p><p>\nIt is by no means improbable that some future textbook for the use of generations yet unborn\nwill contain a question something like this: What historical American of the nineteenth\ncentury has exerted the most powerful influence upon the destinies of his countrymen? And it\nis by no means impossible that the answer to that interrogatory may be thus written: Joseph\nSmith, the Mormon Prophet.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . The Latter-day Saints have seen scores of the prophecies that he uttered fulfilled to the\nvery letter. Everybody that came into his presence was impressed with the influence and spirit\nwhich he manifested. Many are the men whom I have met that have ridiculed the late Prophet \nBrigham Young, and I have persuaded such men to go with me to meet him, and they have\ninvariably come away from meeting him inspired with a reverence for the man, because the\nSpirit of God surrounded him day by day. I tell you that it is by the inspiration of God, and\nnot by the power of man, that Joseph Smith, that Brigham Young, that John Taylor, that\nWilford Woodruff have been able to unite the hearts of the Latter-day Saints and to establish\nand build up the Church of Jesus Christ. Without the light and the guidance of the Spirit of\nGod the work of God on the earth could not succeed; it would crumble and go to pieces. . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"I want to say to the Latter-day Saints that it behooves us, having received a testimony of the\ndivinity of the work in which we are engaged, so to order our lives from day to day that\nglory shall be brought to the work of God by the good deeds that we perform, so letting our\nlight shine that men, seeing our good deeds, shall glorify God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33875\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33875)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33875)\">Matt. 5:16<\/a><\/span>). No people\nupon the face of the earth have been blessed as have the Latter-day Saints; no people have\never had the many manifestations of the kindness and mercy and long-suffering of God that\nhave been bestowed upon us, and I say we, above all men and women upon the earth should\nlive Godlike and upright lives. That God may help us to do so, is my prayer and my desire. . . .\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis, in brief, in spirit and in substance, is what I preached to my brother under the\ninspiration of the Spirit of the Lord, in this tabernacle on January 26, 1896. I was then\nthirty-nine years of age.\n<\/p><p>\nThe next morning, my brother came into my office and said, \"Heber, I was at a meeting\nyesterday and heard you preach.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI said, \"The first time you ever heard your brother preach, I guess?\" \n<\/p><p>\n\"Oh, no,\" he said, \"I have heard you many times. I generally come in late and go into the \ngallery. I often go out before the meeting is over. But you never spoke as you did yesterday.\nYou spoke beyond your natural ability. You were inspired of the Lord.\" These were the\nidentical words I had uttered the day before, in my prayer to the Lord! \n<\/p><p>\nI said to him, \"Are you still praying for a testimony of the gospel?\" He said, \"Yes, and I am\ngoing nearly wild.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI asked, \"What did I preach about yesterday?\" \n<\/p><p>\nHe replied, \"You know what you preached about.\" I said, \"Well, you tell me.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"You preached upon the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI answered, \"And I was inspired beyond my natural ability; and I never spoke before at any\ntime you have heard me, as I spoke yesterday. Do you expect the Lord to get a club and\nknock you down? What more testimony do you want of the Gospel of Jesus Christ than that a\nman speaks beyond his natural ability and under the inspiration of God, when he testifies of\nthe divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe next Sabbath he applied to me for baptism.\n<\/p><p>\nENDURING TO THE END\n<\/p><p>\nGod our Heavenly Father has promised that those who are faithful to the end shall be saved\nin his kingdom (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11937\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11937)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11937)\">D&amp;C 6:13<\/a><\/span>). It fills my heart with unspeakable joy when I see the aged veterans stand up\nand bear their testimonies to the truth of the gospel. . . I rejoice also when I see the youth\nof Israel in the line of duty, the sons and grandsons of those who have labored energetically\nfor the advancement of this kingdom. It fills my heart with gratitude and thanksgiving that the\ntestimony of the Holy Ghost does abide in the sons and daughters of those who have been\nfaithful to the cause of God.\n<\/p><p>\nBut there is nothing that is more sorrowful, nothing that brings greater regret to my heart,\nthan to see the sons and daughters of those who have been faithful turn away from the Gospel\nof Christ, but I believe that if we as Latter-day Saints will arise in the might and majesty of\nour calling, arise in the testimony of Jesus Christ that burns in our hearts,\nand do our duty and keep the commandments of God our Heavenly Father as we should keep\nthem, and set examples before our children that are worthy of imitation, few of them will\nturn away from the path of right. \n<\/p><p>\nGo where you will among the elders of Israel, travel from one end of the Church to the other,\nand you will find a testimony burning in the hearts of the Latter-day Saints that this is the\nwork of Almighty God and that his Son Jesus Christ has established it. You find this\ntestimony, you hear it borne, but do we always live the lives of Latter-day Saints? Do we live\nas we should live, considering the great testimony that has been given unto us? Do we keep\nHis commandments as we ought to do? We carry upon our shoulders the reputation, so to\nspeak, of the Church, every one of us.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I look around and realize how many of those who have been wonderfully blessed of the\nLord have fallen by the wayside, it fills me with humility. It fills me with the spirit of\nmeekness and with an earnest desire that I may ever seek to know the mind and the will of\nGod and to keep His commandments rather than to follow out my own desires.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE REPENTANT SINNER\n<\/p><p>\nThere is nothing in the world that is more splendid than to have in our hearts a desire to\nforgive the sinner if he only repents. But I want to say, do not forgive the sinner if he does\nnot repent. \"By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins&mdash;behold he will confess them\nand forsake them\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11984\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11984)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11984)\">D&amp;C 58:43<\/a><\/span>). It is up to the Lord, however, and unless they confess their sins we are not\nobliged to forgive, but when they really and truly repent, it is one of the obligations that rest\nupon us to forgive those who have sinned.\n<\/p><p>\nThe devil is ready to blind our eyes with the things of this world, and he would gladly rob us\nof eternal life, the greatest of all gifts\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11945\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11945)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11945)\">D&amp;C 14:7<\/a><\/span>).\nBut it is not given to the devil, and no power will ever\nbe given to him to overthrow any Latter-day Saint that is keeping the commandments of God.\nThere is no power given to the adversary of men's souls to destroy us if we are doing our\nduty. If we are not absolutely honest with God, then we let the bars down, then we have\ndestroyed part of the fortifications by which we are protected, and the devil may come in. But\nno man has ever lost the testimony of the Gospel, no man has ever turned to the right or to\nthe left, who had the knowledge of the truth, who was attending to his duties, who was\nkeeping the Word of Wisdom, who was paying his tithing, who was responding to the calls\nand duties of his office and calling in the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are some who are forever asking to know what the Lord wants of them, and who seem\nto be hesitating on that account. I am thoroughly convinced that all the Lord wants of you and\nme or of any other man or woman in the Church is for us to perform our full duty and keep\nthe commandments of God.\n<\/p><p>\nPRAY ALWAYS\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the requirements made of the Latter-day Saints is that they shall be faithful in\nattending to their prayers, both their secret and family prayers. The object that our Heavenly\nFather has in requiring this is that we may be in communication with Him, and that we may\nhave a channel open between us and the heavens whereby we can bring down upon ourselves\nblessings from above. No individual who is humble and prayerful before God and supplicates\nhim every day for the light and inspiration of his Holy Spirit will ever become lifted up in the\npride of his heart, or feel that the intelligence and the wisdom that he possesses are all\nsufficient for him.\n<\/p><p>\nPray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea, that you may conquer Satan, and that\nyou may escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold his work\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11940\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11940)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11940)\">D&amp;C 10:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPray always, that ye may not faint, until I come\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12017\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12017)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12017)\">D&amp;C 88:126<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOUR YOUNG MEN IN SERVICE\n<\/p><p>\nBetween forty-five and fifty thousand of the young men of this Church are now wearing the\nuniforms of their respective countries. Some of them are here today, and thousands of them\nare scattered on far fronts in many lands. I hope and pray that every boy will feel in his heart:\n\"I want to know what is right and dean and pure and holy, and I want God to help me.\" I\nwant every Latter-day Saint soldier to get down on his knees and pray God to help him to\nlead a dean life, and to preach the Gospel wherever he is by the way he lives. There are no\nsins charged to our account because we are tempted, provided we shall resist the temptation.\nBut we have no right to go near temptation, or in fact to do or say anything that we cannot\nhonestly ask the blessing of the Lord upon; neither to visit any place where we would be\nashamed to take our sister or sweetheart. The good Spirit will not go with us onto the Devil's\nground, and if we are standing alone upon ground belonging to the adversary of men's souls,\nhe may have the power to trip us and destroy us. We can't handle dirty things and keep clean\nhands. Virtue is more valuable than life.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray the Lord to bless you, our young men in the armed forces of the world, that our\nHeavenly Father will be with you to sustain you and to increase your faith day by day; that\nyou may be preserved in your trials, your hardships, your suffering, with strength to face the\neventualities of each day and with the assurance that the Lord, your God, will bring in his\nown way and time everlasting compensation to you for your sacrifice, as you walk in his\nways and live lives that conform with the Priesthood you bear.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray for the wives, the children, the mothers and fathers of these men who are serving their\ncountries the world over, that they may be sustained in their waiting, that their anxious fears\nmay be quieted, that comfort and assurance may come into their lives.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray for peace; for wisdom, reverence and humility on the part of the\nleaders of nations; for repentance, and a turning to the ways of righteousness on the part of all\nmen.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray for the Latter-day Saints in all nations, at home and abroad, and on the islands of the\nsea; I pray that they may have the strength and the faith to live righteously, and I extend to\nthem anew the hand of fellowship.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray for righteous men everywhere. To all of God's children who are worthy to be called\nsuch, I send my blessings, for we are all the children of our Father in heaven, and heirs to his\nblessings, according to our faithfulness and obedience.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray for the sorrowing, for the bereaved, for the oppressed that they shall be comforted.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat the world needs today more than anything else is an implicit faith in God, our Father,\nand in Jesus Christ, His Son, as the Redeemer of the world, The message of the Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the world is that God lives, that Jesus Christ is his Son,\nand that they appeared to the boy, Joseph Smith\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30224\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30224)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30224)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17-20<\/a><\/span>), and promised him that he should be an\ninstrument in the hands of the Lord in restoring the Gospel of Jesus Christ in this\ndispensation (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30227\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30227)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30227)\">JS&mdash;H 1:33<\/a><\/span>).
