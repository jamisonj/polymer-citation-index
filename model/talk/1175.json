Like many others, I began the reading. I have almost finished it. At the same time I\nalso read Orson Pratt's treatise on the book as he wrote it many years ago. It has been\nrefreshing and stimulating to me and certainly very enlightening, even though it has been read\nand referred to many times over the years.\n<\/p><p>\nElder Pratt, in writing his analysis of this latter-day scripture, makes this statement: \"The book\nmust be either true or false. If true, it is one of the most important messages ever sent from\nGod. If false, it is one of the most cunning, wicked, bold, deep-laid impositions ever pawned\non the world.\"\n<\/p><p>\nMany people during this year are reading the Book of Mormon. Many have read it in the past,\nand many will read it in the future. It was given to the world through Joseph Smith the\nProphet when he was a young man in his early twenties. The Prophet was a humble man. He\nwas unlearned in the arts, the sciences, and literature of the world. At the same time he laid\nno claim whatever to any literary power or ability. The book was not produced as a result of\nprolonged preparation or any studious effort such as the writing of a book would entail. It is\nin perfect harmony with the Bible teachings. It contains a similar message and emphasizes the\nsame truths. No book was ever written with a higher and a nobler purpose. Its aim is to teach\nthe Jew and the Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God who manifests himself to all\nnations (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43135\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43135)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43135)\">BM Title Page<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is and always has been a builder of faith and a converter of souls. Its power in these\nrespects is marvelous and beyond the understanding of the unbelieving and those who \"are\nwise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25214\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25214)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25214)\">Isa. 5:21<\/a><\/span>). A humble approach to its reading is\nnecessary.\n<\/p><p>\nReaders of the book are left with God's help to determine its value, its divinity, and its\ntruthfulness. They are not asked to consult with the scholars or the recognized men of\nlearning as to its validity. They are cautioned, however, to ask God the Eternal Father in the\nname of Jesus Christ (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38288\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38288)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38288)\">Moro. 10:4<\/a><\/span>)\nregarding the reliability and the trustworthiness of the message it\ncontains, directed as it is to the Jews, the Gentiles, and the remnant of the Nephite race.\n<\/p><p>\nUnder that procedure they will receive a testimony as to its sanctity and authenticity which is\nstronger and mightier than all the arguments of cynics and skeptics. No one has found\nanything that nullifies the testimony of the three witnesses to this sacred volume\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43108\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43108)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43108)\">BM Three Wit.<\/a><\/span>). Their\ntestimonies still stand. Not a single thing has been brought to light, not a single thing to\ndiscredit their solemn declaration. It was challenged, as you may know and surmise, and the\nintegrity of the witnesses was questioned. Their characters were assailed, and they were\naccused of being in collusion with a wicked pretender and a false prophet.\n<\/p><p>\nIt has always been so and naturally was expected, for the world is full of doubters and cynics.\nJesus knew this when he talked to Nicodemus. \"We speak that we do know,\" said Jesus, \"and\ntestify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.\n<\/p><p>\n\"If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of\nheavenly things?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27957\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27957)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27957)\">John 3:11-12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThese were the words of the Master, but these witnesses never wavered in their testimony.\nThey left the Church and were unfriendly to the Prophet. They were\nexcommunicated at a time when the Church needed their support. There is something\ndramatic about Oliver Cowdery's return to the Church. The day he came back the fortunes of\nthe Church were at their lowest ebb. The people were outcast and had been driven from their\nhomes and possessions. Fully repentant, Oliver Cowdery was baptized and entered the Church\nas a humble member.\n<\/p><p>\nMartin Harris returned and was baptized after a long period on the outside. His numerous\ntestimonies to his neighbors and friends are a vindication against the charges that he had\ndenied his testimony.\n<\/p><p>\nDavid Whitmer, disgruntled and disappointed, did not return. He claimed the Church had left\nhim; that he had not left the Church. He evidently lacked humility which is required of\nfaithful members of the Church. His last act was to reconfirm his testimony and to rebuke\nthose who had accused him of being unfaithful to the written document which he had signed.\nHe executed an affidavit on his deathbed to silence those who had questioned his integrity.\n<\/p><p>\nBut the book itself is the best evidence of its divinity. If the book is a fraud, Joseph Smith\nknew it. There could be no question in his mind about its being fraudulent or genuine. He had\nthe answer. Thousands have read it and have come away with the same testimony which he\nand the others gave. Not a single logical explanation has been offered to discredit the claim of\nthe Prophet and his associates. The book still stands as a divine record, unmarred by the\nattacks of critics, most of whom were insincere and untrustworthy.\n<\/p><p>\nIf Joseph Smith wilfully and deliberately fabricated that volume and gave it to the world as\nscripture, he was unworthy of the confidence of all good men. Of all men he would be the\nmost deceptive and the most dishonest. He would be a stranger to every divine and holy\nimpulse. By every law of affinity his mind would be darkened by his evil designs. God's\nSpirit would depart from him. No heavenly inspiration or enlightenment could emanate from\none so bad, but his scriptural productions, every one, emphasize moral and spiritual values.\nThey are warnings against wrongdoing. They are confirmations of Bible teachings.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Book of Mormon especially is a strong indictment against every sin in every form. I beg\nof you, brethren and sisters, to read the book; and as you go home following this conference,\nopen the sacred volume and read it slowly and prayerfully, chapter by chapter, until it is\nfinished, and, if you will do so, God will bless you. He will strengthen your testimony. He\nwill increase your faith, and he will bless you in your devotion to the great cause for which\nwe all stand.\n<\/p><p>\nMay you and I be faithful in all things I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
