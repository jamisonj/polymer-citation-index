The solemn written testimony of three witnesses to what they saw and heard\u2014two of them simultaneously and the third almost immediately thereafter\u2014is entitled to great weight. Indeed, we know that upon the testimony of <span class=\"emphasis\">one<\/span> witness great miracles have been claimed and accepted by many religious people, and in the secular world the testimony of one witness has been deemed sufficient for weighty penalties and judgments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p15\" class=\"\">Persons experienced in evaluating testimony commonly consider a witness\u2019s opportunity to observe an event and the possibility of his bias on the subject.

Each of the three had ample reason and opportunity to renounce his testimony if it had been false, or to equivocate on details if any had been inaccurate. As is well known, because of disagreements or jealousies involving other leaders of the Church, each one of these three witnesses was excommunicated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by about eight years after the publication of their testimony. All three went their separate ways, with no common interest to support a collusive effort. Yet to the end of their lives\u2014periods ranging from 12 to 50 years after their excommunications\u2014not one of these witnesses deviated from his published testimony or said anything that cast any shadow on its truthfulness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p17\" class=\"\">Furthermore, their testimony stands uncontradicted by any other witnesses. Reject it one may, but how does one explain three men of good character uniting and persisting in this published testimony to the end of their lives in the face of great ridicule and other personal disadvantage? Like the Book of Mormon itself, there is no better explanation than is given in the testimony itself, the solemn statement of good and honest men who told what they saw.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Martin Harris<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p19\" class=\"\">Having a special interest in Martin Harris, I have been saddened at how he is remembered by most Church members. He deserves better than to be remembered solely as the man who unrighteously obtained and then lost the initial manuscript pages of the Book of Mormon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p20\" class=\"\">When the Book of Mormon was published, Martin Harris was nearly 47 years of age, more than 20 years older than Joseph Smith and the other two witnesses. He was a prosperous and respected citizen of Palmyra, New York. He owned a farm of over 240 acres, large for the time and place. He was an honored veteran of two battles in the War of 1812. His fellow citizens entrusted him with many elective offices and responsibilities in the community. He was universally respected for his industry and integrity. Assessments by contemporaries described him as \u201can industrious, hard-working farmer, shrewd in his business calculations, frugal in his habits,\u201d and \u201cstrictly upright in his business dealings\u201d (quoted in Richard Lloyd Anderson, <span class=\"emphasis\">Investigating the Book of Mormon Witnesses<\/span> [1981], 96\u201397, 98).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p21\" class=\"\">This prosperous and upright older man befriended the young and penniless Joseph Smith, giving him the $50 that permitted him to pay his debts in Palmyra and locate in northeastern Pennsylvania about 150 miles away. There, in April 1828, Joseph Smith began his first persistent translation of the Book of Mormon. He dictated, and Martin Harris wrote until there were 116 pages of manuscript.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p22\" class=\"\">Martin\u2019s persistent requests to show this manuscript to his family wearied Joseph into letting him take it to Palmyra, where its pages were stolen from him, lost, and probably burned. For this the Lord rebuked Martin and Joseph. Joseph had his gift of translation suspended for a season, and Martin was rebuked as \u201ca wicked man\u201d who had \u201cset at naught the counsels of God, and \u2026 broken the most sacred promises which were made before God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21031\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21031)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21031)\">D&amp;C 3:12\u201313<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"21047\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21047)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21047)\">D&amp;C 10<\/a><\/span>). Fortunately, both Joseph and Martin were later forgiven by the Lord, and the work of translation resumed with other scribes. We obviously honor Joseph for his magnificent ministry, but Martin\u2019s subsequent faithfulness continues under a shadow from which this important man should be rescued.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p23\" class=\"\">I will review some of the high points of Martin Harris\u2019s life following the devastating episode of the stolen and lost manuscript.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p24\" class=\"\">About nine months after Martin\u2019s rebuke, the Prophet Joseph received a revelation declaring that there would be three witnesses to the plates and if Martin would humble himself he would be privileged to see them (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"21035\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21035)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21035)\">D&amp;C 5:11, 15, 24<\/a><\/span>). A few months later, Martin Harris was selected as one of the Three Witnesses and had the experience and bore the testimony described earlier.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p25\" class=\"\">One of Martin Harris\u2019s greatest contributions to the Church, for which he should be honored for all time, was his financing the publication of the Book of Mormon. In August 1829 he mortgaged his home and farm to Egbert B. Grandin to secure payment on the printer\u2019s contract. Seven months later, the 5,000 copies of the first printing of the Book of Mormon were completed. Later, when the mortgage note fell due, the home and a portion of the farm were sold for $3,000. In this way, Martin Harris was obedient to the Lord\u2019s revelation:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cThou shalt not covet thine own property, but impart it freely to the printing of the Book of Mormon. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cPay the debt thou hast contracted with the printer.

He was present at the organization of the Church on April 6, 1830, and was baptized that same day. A year later he was called to journey to Missouri with Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, and Edward Partridge (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"21098\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21098)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21098)\">D&amp;C 52:24<\/a><\/span>).

Emer spent a year preaching the gospel near his former home in northeastern Pennsylvania. During most of this time Emer\u2019s companion was his brother Martin, whose zeal in preaching even caused him to be jailed for a few days. The Harris brothers baptized about 100 persons. Among those baptized was a family named Oaks, which included my great-great-grandfather. Thus, my middle name and my last name come from the grandfathers who met in that missionary encounter in Susquehanna County in 1832\u201333.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p30\" class=\"\">Back in Kirtland, Ohio, after his mission, in February 1834 Martin Harris was chosen by revelation to serve on the first high council in the Church (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"21165\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21165)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21165)\">D&amp;C 102:3<\/a><\/span>).

During 1837 there were intense financial and spiritual conflicts in Kirtland, Ohio. Martin Harris later said that he \u201clost confidence in Joseph Smith\u201d and \u201chis mind became darkened\u201d (quoted in Anderson, <span class=\"emphasis\">Investigating the Book of Mormon Witnesses,<\/span> 110). He was released from the high council in September 1837 and three months later was excommunicated.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p33\" class=\"\">Martin\u2019s wife, Lucy, who had been involved in the loss of the manuscript pages, died in Palmyra in 1836.

There he was rebaptized by a visiting missionary in 1842. In 1856 Caroline and their four children took the long journey to Utah, but Martin, then 73 years of age, remained on his property in Kirtland. In 1860 he told a census taker that he was a \u201cMormon preacher,\u201d evidence of his continuing loyalty to the restored gospel. Later he would tell a visitor, \u201cI never did leave the Church; the Church left me\u201d (quoted in William H. Homer Jr., \u201c\u2018Publish It Upon the Mountains\u2019: The Story of Martin Harris,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era,<\/span> July 1955, 505), meaning of course that Brigham Young led the Church west and the aging Martin remained in Kirtland.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p35\" class=\"\">During part of his remaining years in Kirtland, Martin Harris acted as a self-appointed guide-caretaker of the deserted Kirtland Temple, which he loved. Visitors reported his alienation from the leaders of the Church in Utah but also his fervent reaffirmation of his published testimony of the Book of Mormon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p36\" class=\"\">Finally, in 1870, Martin\u2019s desire to be reunited with his family in Utah resulted in a warm invitation from Brigham Young, a ticket for his passage, and an official escort from one of the Presidents of Seventy. A Utah interviewer of the 87-year-old man described him as \u201cremarkably vigorous for one of his years, \u2026 his memory being very good\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News,<\/span> 31 Aug. 1870). He was rebaptized, a common practice at that time, and spoke twice to audiences in this Tabernacle. We have no official report of what he said, but we can be sure of his central message since over 35 persons left similar personal accounts of what he told them during this period. One reported Martin saying, \u201cIt is not a mere belief, but is a matter of knowledge. I saw the plates and the inscriptions thereon. I saw the angel, and he showed them unto me\u201d (quoted in Anderson, <span class=\"emphasis\">Investigating the Book of Mormon Witnesses,<\/span> 116).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p37\" class=\"\">When he reiterated his testimony of the Book of Mormon in the closing days of his life, Martin Harris declared, \u201cI tell you of these things that you may tell others that what I have said is true, and I dare not deny it; I heard the voice of God commanding me to testify to the same\u201d (quoted in Anderson, <span class=\"emphasis\">Investigating the Book of Mormon Witnesses,<\/span> 118).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p38\" class=\"\">Martin Harris died in Clarkston, Utah, in 1875, at age 92. His life is commemorated in the memorable pageant, <span class=\"emphasis\">Martin Harris: The Man Who Knew,<\/span> produced each summer in Clarkston, Utah.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p39\" class=\"\">What do we learn from this example? (1) Witnesses are important, and the testimony of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon is impressive and reliable. (2) Happiness and spiritual progress lie in following the leaders of the Church. (3) There is hope for each of us, even if we have sinned and strayed from a favored position.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-witness-martin-harris.p40\" class=\"\">The Lord\u2019s invitation is warm and loving: \u201cCome back and feast at the table of the Lord, and taste again the sweet and satisfying fruits of fellowship with the saints\u201d (The First Presidency, \u201cAn Invitation to Come Back,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Church News,<\/span> 22 Dec. 1985, 3).
