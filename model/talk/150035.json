I am surrounded with those who know by experience that we are dependent upon the influence and inspiration of the Holy Ghost to enable us to teach the things of the kingdom of God. My faith is that no man, in this or any other generation, is able to teach and edify the inhabitants of the earth without the inspiration of the Spirit of God.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"85293\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 85293)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(85293)\">D&amp;C 42:14<\/a><\/span> As a people we have been placed in positions the last forty years which have taught, in all our administrations and labors, the necessity of acknowledging the hand of God in all things.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"86351\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 86351)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(86351)\">D&amp;C 59:21<\/a><\/span> We feel this necessity today.

In my public teaching I never permit my mind to follow in any channel except that which the Spirit dictates to me, and this is the position we all occupy when we meet with the Saints, or when we go forth to preach the Gospel.

When it was given no man among us knew anything about Salt Lake or the Rocky Mountains; but it has been fulfilled before our eyes. We have come up here, and in so doing have fulfilled the revelations of God so far. Let us continue, I pray God my heavenly Father that he will bless the Latter-day Saints; that he will give us his Holy Spirit and wisdom, that our eyes may be opened, that we may have faith in the things of God. Let a man lose the Holy Spirit and what faith has he? None, either in God or in his revelations, and that is what is the matter today. You may take the best friends we have outside of this kingdom, and you can hardly get them to believe that God has any<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"283a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD15\/JoD15_0283.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;283a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/5628\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>thing to do with the affairs of men, or that he has power to do anything for them, either as individuals or nations.

They would no longer wonder why the Latter-day Saints have faith in God if their eyes were open so that they could understand the work and things of God. They cannot understand it, they cannot even see the kingdom of God unless they are born of the Spirit of God, and they cannot enter into it unless they are born of the water and the Spirit, according to the words of Jesus to Nicodemus.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"68764\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 68764)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(68764)\">John 3:3,5<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v15n1013\"> I have a desire that we may be faithful in our mission and ministry, as Elders of Israel and as Saints of God, that we may do our duty, and maintain our position before the Lord.

We have no right to sin, whether we are in the canyon drawing wood, or performing any other hard labor, and we should have the Spirit of God to direct us then as much as when preaching, praying, singing and attending to the ordinances of the house of God. If we do this as a people we shall grow in the favor and power of God. We should be united together, it is our duty to be so. Our prayers should ascend before God, and I know they do. I know that President Young is prayed for&#x2014;I know that his Counselors and the Twelve are prayed for, and that the Church and kingdom of God is prayed for. We should continue this, and if we pray in faith we shall have what we ask for. The Lord has taught us to pray, and I rejoice that I have learned to pray according to the order of God, for in this we have a promise&#x2014;that where two or three agree in asking for any thing that is just and right, it shall be granted unto them.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"65087\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 65087)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(65087)\">Matt. 18:19-20<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v15n1014\"> May God bless you!
