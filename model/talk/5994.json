It can be enjoyed by young and old. In the early days of the Church, a young boy by the name of Will Cluff, 10 years of age, living in Nauvoo, had a remarkable, pure faith. He had an experience to which many of us can relate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/the-weightier-matters-of-the-law-judgment-mercy-and-faith.p54\" class=\"\">His family was poor and had only one cow, which they depended on for food. In the spring of 1842 the cow strayed off. One evening in August his father came home very weary and discouraged. He and Will\u2019s brothers had spent much of the summer looking for the cow. Will said, \u201cFather, if you will let me take Charley (an old horse) I will go and find the cow.\u201d He reluctantly said he could.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/the-weightier-matters-of-the-law-judgment-mercy-and-faith.p55\" class=\"\">Early next morning Will rode to the Big Mound, three miles east and in the prairie country. Here he had often herded cows with other boys from Nauvoo. He got off the horse and, holding it by the bridle, knelt down and fervently prayed the Lord to direct him which way to go to find the cow. He climbed back on the horse and rode south, a course he was impressed to take even though there were numerous bunches of cattle in every direction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/the-weightier-matters-of-the-law-judgment-mercy-and-faith.p56\" class=\"\">After traveling a few miles in the open prairie and passing hundreds of cattle, Will came to a fence. He dismounted and let down the stake, led his horse in, put up the fence, then rode three miles across the field. He again found himself in the open prairie with numerous bunches of stock in every direction. When he had gone about a quarter of a mile from the field, he rode right on to the cow, feeding alone some distance from any other animals.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/the-weightier-matters-of-the-law-judgment-mercy-and-faith.p57\" class=\"\">Will started to drive the cow in the direction of the city.
