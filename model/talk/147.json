Smith, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1944, pp. 109-113<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nInasmuch as this is a priesthood meeting, and inasmuch as at our last semi-annual conference\nI spoke at the priesthood meeting, this was the one session at which I expected to be\ncomfortable. I have learned another lesson in jumping at conclusions.\n<\/p><p>\nSince this is a priesthood meeting, if I may have the assistance of my Father in heaven, I\nshould like to attempt, at least, to make a few observations that may answer some queries you\nhave, and I feel safe in assuming that some of these queries are common, because of the\nfrequency with which they have been put to me.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE NECESSITY FOR WITNESSES\n<\/p><p>\nOliver Cowdery occupied a unique position in the Church. He was called to be a special\nwitness, and that is according to law\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11950\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11950)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11950)\">D&amp;C 18:9<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Lord has said time and again that his word is to be\nestablished in the mouths of two or three witnesses\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3003\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3003)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3003)\">2 Cor. 13:1<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11938\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11938)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11938)\">D&amp;C 6:28<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12057\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12057)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12057)\">D&amp;C 128:3<\/a><\/span>). It is significant that the Prophet Joseph\nSmith did not receive the priesthood by himself, but he, together with Oliver Cowdery,\nreceived the priesthood, and it was Oliver Cowdery's calling to bear witness to these things.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior himself, according to the law, required a witness, and his Father in person, bore\nwitness to the divinity of his Son. Together they appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. You\nwill find ample Biblical support for the necessity of witnesses.\n<\/p><p>\nOliver Cowdery did not remain faithful, and his position was given to Hyrum Smith.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again, verily I say unto you, let my servant William be appointed, ordained, and\nanointed, as a counselor unto my servant Joseph, in the room of my servant Hyrum, that my\nservant Hyrum may take the office of Priesthood and Patriarch, which was appointed unto\nhim by his father, by blessing and also by right; That from henceforth he shall hold the keys\nof the patriarchal blessings upon the heads of all my people. That whoever he blesses shall be\nblessed, and whoever he curses shall be cursed; that whatsoever he shall bind on earth shall be\nbound in heaven; and whatsoever he shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12054\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12054)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12054)\">D&amp;C 124:91-93<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHyrum Smith was called to be the patriarch to the Church, but he was also called to take\nOliver Cowdery's place as special witness to the Prophet.\n<\/p><p>\n. . . From this time forth I appoint unto him that he shall be a prophet, and a seer, and a\nrevelator unto my church, as well as my servant Joseph; That he may act in concert also with\nmy servant Joseph; and that he shall receive counsel from my servant Joseph, who shall show\nunto him the keys whereby he may ask and receive, and be crowned with the same blessing,\nand glory, and honor, and priesthood, and gifts of the priesthood, that once were put upon\nhim that was my servant Oliver Cowdery; That my servant Hyrum may bear record of the\nthings which I shall show unto him, that his name may be had in honorable remembrance\nfrom generation to generation, forever and ever\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12055\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12055)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12055)\">D&amp;C 124:94-96<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat calling was over and beyond his office of patriarch. He was a special witness to his\nbrother, and was shown the keys of presidency. Now this situation has been unique in the\nhistory of the Church. Since that time that has not been necessary. There are thousands of\npersons who now are witnesses of the divinity of the Prophet Joseph Smith, so that the office\nthat Hyrum Smith held was more than the office which subsequent patriarchs have held.\n<\/p><p>\nSPECIFIC DUTIES OF PATRIARCHS\n<\/p><p>\nPatriarchal blessings are sacred things. It is significant to me that in the revelation, the great\nrevelation on priesthood, the word \"patriarch\" itself is not used. I have pondered that\nconsiderably.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is the duty of the Twelve, in all large branches of the church, to ordain evangelical\nministers, as they shall be designated unto them by revelation. The order of this priesthood\nwas confirmed, to be handed down from father to son, and rightly belongs to the literal\ndescendants of the chosen seed, to whom the promises were made\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12048\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12048)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12048)\">D&amp;C 107:39-40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen the order of this priesthood, beginning with Adam, is chronicled in the 107th section of\nthe Doctrine and Covenants (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12049\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12049)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12049)\">D&amp;C 107:41-53<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow we know that these men were patriarchs. I am not sure that I know precisely why the\nwords \"evangelical ministers\" were used, rather than the word \"patriarchs.\" It seems, however,\nsignificant to me that the term here used suggests very definitely the spiritual nature of the\npatriarchal office. It is not an administrative office, it is not an executive office, it is a\nspiritual office.\n<\/p><p>\nThe old patriarchs, of course, lived under a patriarchal system of government. The head of the\nfamily was, actually the head of their government, and that continued for a good many\ngenerations. We no longer live under a patriarchal form of government. Our civil government\nis greatly different. The Prophet Joseph Smith, in a meeting with the Twelve, explains\nspecifically that \"evangelical ministers\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21604\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21604)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21604)\">Eph. 4:11<\/a><\/span>) means \"patriarchs.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIf I remember correctly, he gave these instructions on the 27th of June, 1839. I may be\nwrong. One of the duties of a patriarch in these days is to declare the lineage of the persons\nreceiving blessings. I am of the opinion that that means much more than simply a declaration\nof fact. Some persons who have received patriarchal blessings and who have not had their\nlineage declared have shown a good deal of concern, wondering about it.\n<\/p><p>\nI must confess, for myself, I have never been able quite to understand why we should be so\nmuch concerned about merely not knowing. Certainly this declaration of lineage is a more\nimportant thing than simply giving an individual a psychological satisfaction as to his\nheritage.\n<\/p><p>\nA RESPONSIBILITY IN LINEAGE\n<\/p><p>\nI believe that a declaration of lineage, by the authority of the priesthood is also a declaration\nof, and an assignment to, a responsibility. When one has his lineage declared, he is given a\nresponsibility to fulfill, according to that heritage.\n<\/p><p>\nOn the very day that the Prophet explained that evangelical ministers meant patriarchs, he also\nexplained some of the functions of the Comforter. He explained the difference between the\ntwo comforters, and he explained that one of the functions of the Holy Ghost is to purge the\nGentiles of their Gentile blood. Now we know that today heritages are mixed. Pure racial\nstrains&mdash;certainly in the Occident&mdash;are almost impossible to discover. Bloods are mixed but a\nGentile, born of full Gentile lineage, being converted to the gospel, accepting the gospel, and\nreceiving the Holy Ghost, through his faithfulness, according to the Prophet's words&mdash;and\nthese are not my words&mdash;according to according to the Prophet's words, will have his Gentile\nblood completely purged, and he will become literally of the blood of Israel.\n<\/p><p>\nI think that fact is something for patriarchs prayerfully to ponder.\n<\/p><p>\nA FATHER'S BLESSING\n<\/p><p>\nThe question has arisen a number of times recently whether or not fathers are entitled to give\ntheir children patriarchal blessings. The answer is yes and no. After all, if you are going to\ndeal technically merely in the meanings of words, a patriarchal blessing means a father's\nblessing. A patriarch is literally a paternal ruler. That is what the word means, and any father\nin the Church who holds the higher priesthood, may, in the authority of that priesthood give\nunto his child a blessing, and that is a patriarchal blessing, in that it is a father's blessing.\n<\/p><p>\nBut according to the ruling of the Church, that blessing is not to be recorded as having come\nfrom an ordained patriarch, because it does not come from an ordained patriarch. The\nbusiness of declaring lineage and giving patriarchal blessings, these blessings given by one\nwho is ordained a patriarch; that is the privilege of the ordained patriarch. Such blessings are\nrecorded and kept in the Church historian's library.\n<\/p><p>\nMORE THAN ONE PATRIARCHAL BLESSING\n<\/p><p>\nThere are some who would like to have more than one patriarchal blessing. In the early days\nof the Church many people received many patriarchal blessings, or at least blessings by\npatriarchs. The First Presidency and Council of the Twelve have advised that one person\nreceive one patriarchal blessing. Now, that is not one of the laws of the Medes and Persians.\nThere are and have been a few cases that have come to my attention where persons have\nreceived patriarchal blessings when they were very young, and where they have felt that the\nblessings have been mostly fulfilled, and they would like another patriarchal blessing.\n<\/p><p>\nThe advice of the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve is to the effect that under\nnormal circumstances one person should receive one patriarchal blessing. I think that wherever\nthere is to be an exception, the recommendation for that exception should be made very, very\ncarefully, and bishops and stake presidents should exercise care in that regard. If the bishop\nand the stake president concerned, after careful and very thorough consideration, feel that\nconditions warrant it, they may issue a signed recommendation to their patriarch to give an\nadditional patriarchal blessing to the person recommended. In such rare cases, where the\nlineage has already been declared, there is no need, of course, for repetition.\n<\/p><p>\nA PATRIARCHAL BLESSING FOR INDIVIDUAL COMFORT\n<\/p><p>\nA patriarchal blessing is a very personal thing. Sometimes zealous teachers in auxiliary\norganizations develop enthusiasm in classes for patriarchal blessings, and there have been\ncases where whole classes have gone to receive their patriarchal blessings at one time. This\nbrethren, would better be avoided. It is commendable, on the part of teachers of children, to\ntalk about patriarchal blessings, to explain the importance of them and their value, but the\nindividual himself, if he wants it, should first obtain his proper recommendation, and then\nmake his own appointment with the patriarch, and having received that blessing he should\nhold it sacred. It is not a thing to be published; it is not for everybody to see; it is for his\ncomfort, for his strengthening. It is his blessing.\n<\/p><p>\nEvery one of you who has had a patriarchal blessing probably has a testimony about it, and\nalmost daily one of the great joys comes to me&mdash;as it does to every patriarch&mdash;and also one\nalso one of the terrifying things about the position, is the testimonies of persons who have\nreceived patriarchal blessings.\n<\/p><p>\nBLESSING UPON HIS SON\n<\/p><p>\nLet us teach our children the value of them, let us teach them what they are, let us instill into\nthem a desire to get them.\n<\/p><p>\nI think one of the biggest thrills that I have had was a few weeks ago. One day on my\nappointment sheet I read merely \"appointment.\" There was no name. I asked my secretary\nwho that was, and she mumbled something rather inarticulately. At the appointed hour, my\nlittle nine-year-old boy came into my office, beaming all over. On his own initiative he had\ngone to his bishop and the president of the stake and he brought me his recommendation to\nhave his daddy give him a patriarchal blessing.\n<\/p><p>\nI acknowledge my weakness; many times a day I am aware of my utter dependence upon our\nFather in heaven. I ask you, my brethren for your sustaining prayers. I bespeak for every\npatriarch in the Church the prayers of our brethren.\n<\/p><p>\nGod give us vision in these times when nations are being sacrificed upon the altar of\nrighteousness. Give us the power to see and the strength to do, I pray, in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
