Many of the Christian churches are closing down some of their church buildings because the people will not support them. While this is taking place, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints continues to grow and the number of those participating in the Church programs is increasing. I would like to briefly mention several statistics regarding the growth and progress of the Savior\u2019s church in the British Isles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-living-christ.p8\" class=\"\">In the year 1960 we had one mission serving 55 million people in England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland with approximately 180 full-time missionaries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-living-christ.p9\" class=\"\">In the early part of 1960 there were no stakes of the Church, and today we have 27 fully organized stakes and 5 more areas ready to be considered for stakehood. We also have 12 districts that are preparing to become stakes. In 1960 we had 11,000 members. Today, we have over 100,000 members. In 1960 there were no Church buildings adequate to serve the needs of a ward. Today, we have 175 beautiful chapels and 47 more under construction or in preliminary preparation for construction. There are in the British Isles 376 units of the Church including missions, stakes, districts, wards, branches, and other Church programs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-living-christ.p10\" class=\"\">There are millions of the Lord\u2019s covenant children in the British Isles that are waiting for the Lord\u2019s missionaries and Latter-day Saints to reach and teach them the sacred principles and ordinances of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ as it is recorded in the holy scriptures. We are just scratching the surface of what needs to be done in these countries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-living-christ.p11\" class=\"\">Many of the Christian churches in the British Isles do not consider or recognize The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a Christian church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-living-christ.p12\" class=\"\">The following statement was printed in the <span class=\"emphasis\">London Times:<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-living-christ.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cAre the Mormons Christians?
