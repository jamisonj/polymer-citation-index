[\"For the Strength of the Hills.\"]\n<\/p><p>\nIn deep humility I stand before you this morning. I seek an interest in your faith and prayers,\nand the blessings of our Heavenly Father, that I might have his Spirit to sustain me.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is a great honor, a sobering responsibility, and a sacred privilege.  I thrill with this great\nconference and the messages that have been given.  Although I will have to get part of the\nmessages through the written word, I am very grateful to the Lord that I was able to attend\npart of the meetings yesterday and to be here this morning. It became necessary to attend an\nimportant cabinet meeting in Washington on Friday and to stop in Denver en route to Salt\nLake City.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to say to you, my brothers and sisters and friends, that I am very happy to\nreport, based on that visit and on a telephone conversation five minutes before this session\nbegan, that the President of the United States continues to make excellent progress.  He has\nbeen informed of the spontaneous prayers that have ascended to our Heavenly Father in the\nsessions of this great conference, and more particularly the prayer which was offered in his\nbehalf by the General Authorities of the Church as they surrounded the sacred altar in the\ntemple in fasting and prayer on Thursday.  Knowing the President as a great and good\nman&mdash;a man of faith and deep spirituality&mdash;I know he would want me to express to all within the\nsound of my voice his gratitude for the faith and prayers which have been offered.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been deeply impressed the past few years with the growth in spirit, fellowship, and\nbrotherhood which seems to be in evidence in the Church. For the past three years I have\nbeen traveling approximately one hundred thousand miles each year. Almost everywhere I\nhave gone I have been greeted by members of the Church, either at the airport or at meetings&mdash;which\nthey were not obligated to attend&mdash;and always there were expressions of love and\nconfidence and prayers in my behalf, and an expression of interest and pride in the growth of\nthe Church in all the world.  I believe I have also found evidence of increased faith and\ndevotion.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is quite appropriate, it seems to me, that much reference has been made in this conference\nto conditions in Europe and the great events that have taken place there in recent months: the\ndedication of the temple at Bern; the breaking of ground for a new temple in England; the\nannouncement of a possible third temple.\n<\/p><p>\nReference has been made to the European tour of the choir, the faith of the Saints, and the\nblessings which they enjoy today compared with only a few years ago&mdash;yes, just a short\ndecade ago. I am very grateful to President McKay and the other members of the Presidency\nthat Sister Benson and I were invited to attend that glorious dedication in Bern, Switzerland. \nI think I have never felt in all my life the veil quite so thin as it was three weeks ago this\nmorning as we met in the opening session of that dedication service in that lovely spot in the\nhouse of the Lord, and as we listened to the prayer offered by President McKay and the\nremarks which preceded that prayer.  Surely he was inspired, and surely we were all uplifted\nand convinced beyond any shadow of a doubt that the action taken by the First Presidency in\nextending temples into Europe had the benediction and approval of our Heavenly Father.  I\nshall never forget that glorious event!  To me it was the most important event that has\ntranspired in Europe in 118 years since the gospel was first taken to those shores.  I am\ngrateful to the Lord that my official duties permitted me to attend that dedication, almost in a\nmiraculous manner, because had it not been for the postponement of a week I probably would\nnot have had the opportunity.  I think, President McKay, that the postponement was in part an\nanswer to my prayers.\n<\/p><p>\nNaturally I was deeply impressed with the contrast between conditions in Europe in 1946\nwhen I was there last and conditions as we find them now.  I have been going back in\nmemory, off and on ever since the dedication, reviewing in my mind the conditions that\nexisted there when I went on an emergency mission in response to the First Presidency's call\nin 1946, and conditions as we saw them and as others saw them on this recent tour of the\nchoir and the visit of the other brethren and the dedication of the temple. Surely the God of\nheaven has blessed Europe and the people of those countries.  It almost seemed impossible for\nme to realize that in 1946, while traveling over 60,000 miles, most of it by army planes&mdash;unheated\nplanes with bucket seats&mdash;in jeeps, and some of it in wooden railway coaches and\non army trains&mdash;that much of Europe was in complete economic and spiritual collapse; it\nseemed almost impossible to realize the change that had come about, the comforts that are\navailable now which were entirely absent then.  Then there were railway stations that were\nbombed and blasted, schedules that were irregular and undependable, whole cities laid waste,\nservice disrupted, and business paralyzed.  Now everything seems to be in order&mdash;no more\nsleeping on straw beds or living on \"K\" rations. Everything seems promising and peaceful.\n<\/p><p>\nThe people too have changed&mdash;no more shivering with cold; no more evidence of\nmalnutrition; no more people poorly clothed and in rags; no more hungry and starving people,\nespecially little children.  No more great streams of refugees crowding the country roads with\nall their earthly belongings on their backs; no more great hordes of displaced persons, families\nbroken, people discouraged, bewildered, frustrated, sick at heart!  Yes, there has come a great\nchange, and I thank God that his blessings have been showered upon those nations,\nparticularly those that have suffered so much because of World War II.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to mention this morning just one simple experience to illustrate not only the\nchanges that have come about, but also something of the influence and the power of music\nand the Tabernacle Choir.  I have wanted to relate this to the Tabernacle Choir ever since I\nreturned.  Even though they are not all here this morning, I want to mention it.\n<\/p><p>\nYou will recall the accounts of the bombing of that great city of Hamburg, a great and proud\ncity, a great industrial center.  When we went there in the spring of 1946, it seemed as if the\nwhole city was a shambles.  There was nothing but rubble.  There were no streetcars\noperating, no bus lines&mdash;all services were broken.  Everything seemed to be broken to pieces. \nAs I remember they estimated that the city was over seventy percent destroyed.  A thousand\nplanes had swooped down upon that city night after night.  During one terrible night&mdash;and I\nheard the account firsthand from many of our faithful Saints&mdash;during one terrible night five\nof our six places of meeting were destroyed.  We lost, as I recall, twenty-six members of the\npriesthood. Then there followed one of the best demonstrations of the spirit of the welfare\nprogram that I think this Church affords: The district president called the Saints together and\nthey brought such food, bedding, and clothing as they could salvage and put it at the feet of\nthe district presidency for distribution among the members of the Church according to need.\n<\/p><p>\nWhile this experience was still fresh in our minds, we were meeting at the city of Herne with\nthe Saints of the battered Ruhr industrial area for their first district conference after the war.\nThe meeting was being held in an old bombed-out schoolhouse.  I do not recall exactly how\nmany people were there, but there were several hundred. We had set the meeting for eleven\no'clock in order to give them time to walk the long distances many of them had to come,\nsome of them carrying babies in arms because there were no public conveyances available,\nand most of them had worn out their bicycles or were unable to get repair parts.\n<\/p><p>\nThe district presidency had arranged, with our co-operation, a special surprise for the\ncongregation that morning. From somewhere they had obtained an old radio which they had\nplaced under cover in one corner of the building. At a certain moment in that service, which I\nshall never forget, the controls of that radio were turned to Radio Stuttgart, the American\narmy radio station operated by a Mormon serviceman, and we heard strains of the Tabernacle\nChoir float out over the audience in that stirring and beautiful pioneer song, \"Come, Come,\nYe Saints.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAfter the second number, \"O My Father,\" had been sung, I think there was not a dry eye\namong the adults in that audience.  I saw before me an audience literally melted to tears\nthrough the singing of Mormon hymns by our great choir.  It seemed as if all the cares of\nthose suffering Saints were forgotten that morning.  Even during the thirty-minute lunch\nperiod&mdash;when the most common item for lunch was a mixture of cracked grain and a little\nwater such as we used to feed the baby chicks&mdash;even during the lunch period they talked of\ntheir blessings and expressed their gratitude for the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nThen as we left that evening after the second session, the common expression was, as we bade\nthem good-bye, \"All is gut, Brother Benson.\" Well, all is good now surely.  With the coming\nof the temples, with the material restoration that has come to those countries, and with what I\nhope is a deepened interest in spiritual matters&mdash;to which the temple will contribute in great\nmeasure&mdash;I hope too there will be a great increased interest in things spiritual, that\nthose nations might be preserved in peace.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless those wonderful people who will be recipients of the blessings of the temple,\nprovided they prepare themselves for those blessings by living the gospel.  And I sincerely\nhope and pray that not only they, but also all of us everywhere, will make that preparation\nthat we may enjoy the richest blessings known to men and women in this world which are\ntied up with the sacred ordinances and blessings of the temples of God.  While I recognize\nthat there are many Saints who are still isolated and who will be unable, probably, to reach\nthe temples, this movement in Europe which I am sure was made under inspiration will bring\nthe temples closer to many thousands of our Father's children.\n<\/p><p>\nTo those who are still isolated may I say this: In my humble judgment if you continue to live the\ngospel and keepp the commandments, and keep yourselves pure and unspotted from the world,\nthe Lord will in some way make up to you that which you seem to be losing because it may\nnot be possible for you to go to the temple.  You will not be deprived of blessings which\nyour lives merit.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, my brethren and sisters, much has been said regarding the attitude of the world toward\nthe Church and kingdom of which we are a part.  It seems as if we have been accepted, as it\nwere, by the world.  Much of praise, much of commendation, many favorable comments in\nthe press and elsewhere have been made regarding the Church in recent years.  Sister Benson\nand I were delighted as we traveled officially through six countries of Europe.  We were\ndelighted to find as we visited with officials of governments and agricultural leaders, men of\nprominence, in dinners and receptions, and in informal meetings, that everywhere there was\nfavorable comment regarding the Church and its people. Many, many were the conversations\nwe held regarding the Church and its program.\n<\/p><p>\nBut I would like to raise this warning, my brothers and sisters.  In this period of apparent\ngoodwill&mdash;good feeling toward the Church&mdash;when it seems as if we have no great obstacles\nany more as we once had, there should be deep concern.  In my judgment, in the hour of our\nsuccess is our greatest danger.  And apparently this is an hour of great success.  No more\npersecution&mdash;persecution which once tended to drive us together and make us united! Now\nwe seem to be accepted by the world. Will it mean disunity?  Will it mean that we will rest\non our laurels and sit back, as it were, and think that all is well in Zion?  I think there is real\ndanger in this period, this period of praise and commendation.  I am happy for it, provided\nwe be careful, that we be on our guard.  The praise of the world will not save us.  It will not\nexalt us in the celestial kingdom.  Only the living of the principles of the gospel will bring us\nsalvation and exaltation.  And so I hope that our performance in living the gospel will be\nequal to the commendation and the praise we are receiving, that our performance will at least\nequal our reputation, and we have a good reputation.  God grant that we may merit all the good things\nthat have been said about us, and that more good things might be accurately said about us in\nthe future.\n<\/p><p>\nI realize that the devil is alert.  He is the enemy of this work.  He is the enemy of all\nrighteousness, and I know that he is clever, that he never takes a holiday.  He works overtime. \nHe is ingenious.  I am confident he will devise new ways to fight this work.  We may not\nknow just what form those schemes will take, but we must be vigilant.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay, I thought, very wisely said last night that should opposition come the best way for us\nto meet it is to live to prove false any false accusations.  With all my heart I endorse that\nsentiment.\n<\/p><p>\nBut there is real danger, my brothers and sisters.  There is real danger that during this period\nwe may let down our guard, as it were; that we may be tempted to join with the world and\nadopt some of their standards against which we have been warned by the Lord.  I think this is\nparticularly true in the social field.  Only recently there came to my attention the fact that a\ngroup of young women, wives, some of whose husbands are employed in the government of\nthe United States and of men who had attained a certain amount of prominence in their\nrespective fields, who had more or less concluded that in order to be accepted by the world,\nin order that their husbands might get ahead in the world, they would have to let down just a\nlittle in their standards.  They had concluded they would have to serve cocktails and coffee in\ntheir homes when friends came.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to testify to you, my brothers and sisters, and particularly to the young married couples\nof this Church, that such a conclusion is not only unwise and unjustified, but it is also\ndangerous and can lead only to heartache and disappointment and a loss of faith.  I am\nconfident that now more than ever before, possibly, is a time for us to live the gospel, to keep\nthe commandments, to maintain every standard of the church, and to be true to our covenants. \nBy so doing we not only guarantee and safeguard our own future and our salvation and\nexaltation, but we will also tend to safeguard the future of our own descendants and assure to\na much greater extent our own success in our chosen fields, no matter what those fields might\nbe.\n<\/p><p>\nI think it was Nephi who said that the time would come when there would be a tendency for\npeople to become pacified; they would be lulled away into a false security; there would be\nthose who would be at ease in Zion, saying \"Zion prospers, all is well\"; and that the devil\nwould cheat their souls and lead them carefully down to hell (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3579\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3579)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3579)\">2 Ne. 28:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI think we need to be on the alert today to see that that does not happen in the Church.  I had\noccasion many times on this last tour through Europe, as I have had before, to thank the Lord\nfor the Word of Wisdom.  Many were the conversations we had regarding the Church, and\nparticularly those my good wife had, as we sat at dinners, luncheons, etc., and it came to their\nattention that we did not drink liquor, smoke, etc.  Immediately they wanted to know more\nabout the Church, and always there was commendation for our standards.  Never once was\nthere any embarrassment. Always there was a feeling of gratitude and thanksgiving on our\npart at the end of the day or evening because of the standards which the God of heaven has\nprovided in his Church.\n<\/p><p>\nThis was the same no matter how high the station of the officials with whom we met.  And I\nsay to you, it always will be true of men of goodwill, men of character.  As Latter-day Saints\nwe cannot afford to let down our standards, to refuse to live the gospel completely and fully.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us, my brethren and sisters, that we may continue a peculiar people, as Peter said\nof the saints of old.  He referred to them as a peculiar people.  So are we, and may we\ncontinue so.  May we who hold the priesthood of God be unafraid to step forward and\nprovide the righteous leadership which is necessary in our various fields of activities! This is a\ntime for demonstration, my brethren of the priesthood, to let the world know something of the\nfruits of Mormonism, something of the testimonies which we bear, something of our faith and\nour determination to live the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, let us do what is right, and we shall have no occasion to worry.  I testify to you with all\nmy soul that this work in which we are engaged is the truth.  God has again spoken from the\nheavens.  His work is upon the earth.  Joseph Smith was in very deed a Prophet of God.  The\nsame power and authority which he bore is now in the hands of President David O. McKay.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to realize these facts and to heed the counsel of our great leader and those who\nserve as leaders in the priesthood everywhere, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
