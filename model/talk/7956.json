During the 18th and early 19th centuries, potential immigrant laborers were recruited in Great Britain, Germany, and other European countries, but many who were willing to go could not afford the cost of travel. It was not uncommon for these to travel under an indenture or contract, promising to work after their arrival for a certain period of time without wages as payment for their passage. Others came with the promise that family members already in America would pay their fare upon arrival, but if that didn\u2019t happen, the newcomers were obliged to pay their own costs through indentured service. The term used to describe these indentured immigrants was \u201credemptioners.\u201d They had to redeem the cost of their passage\u2014in a sense, purchase their freedom\u2014by their labor.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10705_000_042\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"emphasis\">Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary,<\/span> 10th ed.

First, it atones for Adam\u2019s transgression and the consequent Fall of man by overcoming what could be called the direct effects of the Fall\u2014physical death and spiritual death. Physical death is well understood; spiritual death is the separation of man from God. In the words of Paul, \u201cFor as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124317\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124317)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124317)\">1\u00a0Corinthians 15:22<\/a><\/span>).

By the Redemption of Christ, all overcome the grave and are resurrected to immortality. In addition, all overcome spiritual death by being brought back into the presence of God to be judged. Jesus said, \u201cAs I have been lifted up [upon the cross] by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124327\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124327)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124327)\">3\u00a0Nephi 27:14<\/a><\/span>). Those who are cleansed from sin will remain with God in the heavenly kingdom, but those who have not repented and are unclean cannot dwell with a holy God, and after the Judgment they must depart and thereby suffer spiritual death again. This is sometimes referred to as a second death or suffering spiritual death a second time.

Even so, our greatest redemptive service will be to lead them to Christ. Without His Redemption from death and from sin, we have only a gospel of social justice. That may provide some help and reconciliation in the present, but it has no power to draw down from heaven perfect justice and infinite mercy. Ultimate redemption is in Jesus Christ and in Him alone. I humbly and gratefully acknowledge Him as the Redeemer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10705_000_042\"><a name=\"-10705_000_042\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote1-10705_000_042\">1.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"emphasis\">Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary,<\/span> 10th ed.

By the Redemption of Christ, all overcome the grave and are resurrected to immortality. In addition, all overcome spiritual death by being brought back into the presence of God to be judged. Jesus said, \u201cAs I have been lifted up [upon the cross] by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124327\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124327)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124327)\">3\u00a0Nephi 27:14<\/a><\/span>). Those who are cleansed from sin will remain with God in the heavenly kingdom, but those who have not repented and are unclean cannot dwell with a holy God, and after the Judgment they must depart and thereby suffer spiritual death again. This is sometimes referred to as a second death or suffering spiritual death a second time.

An unredeemed individual\u2019s suffering for sin is known as hell. It means being subject to the devil and is described in scriptural metaphors as being in chains or a lake of fire and brimstone. Lehi begged his sons to choose Christ\u2019s Redemption \u201cand not choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124332\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124332)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124332)\">2\u00a0Nephi 2:29<\/a><\/span>).
