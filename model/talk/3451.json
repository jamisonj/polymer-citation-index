They truly understand the meaning of an impressive revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/let-every-man-learn-his-duty.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/let-every-man-learn-his-duty.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cHe that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he that learns not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17519\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17519)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17519)\">D&amp;C 107:99\u2013100<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/let-every-man-learn-his-duty.p15\" class=\"\">Inscribed beneath Robert E. Lee\u2019s bust in the Hall of Fame are his words: \u201cDuty is the sublimest word in our language. Do your duty in all things. You cannot do more. You should never wish to do less.\u201d (In John Bartlett, <span class=\"emphasis\">Familiar Quotations,<\/span> Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1968, p. 620.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/let-every-man-learn-his-duty.p16\" class=\"\">Most of us don\u2019t mind doing what we <span class=\"emphasis\">ought<\/span> to do when it doesn\u2019t interfere with what we <span class=\"emphasis\">want<\/span> to do, but it takes discipline and maturity to do what we ought to do whether we want to or not. Duty is too often what one expects from others and not what one does. What people think and believe and plan are all very important, but what they <span class=\"emphasis\">do<\/span> is the thing that counts most. It is a call to throw out selfishness and to think of the common good of all.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/let-every-man-learn-his-duty.p17\" class=\"\">We must always remember that duty reminds us we are stewards of all that our Creator has entrusted to us. When we accept duties willingly and faithfully, we find happiness. Those who make happiness the chief objective of life are bound to fail, for happiness is a by-product rather than an end in itself. Happiness comes from doing one\u2019s duty and knowing that his life is in harmony with God and his commandments. The members of the Jamaica Branch know that they are living in harmony with our Father\u2019s commandments, and this brings them great happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/let-every-man-learn-his-duty.p18\" class=\"\">A group of missionaries, also in Jamaica, understood their duties to teach the gospel to everyone who would hear their message. As all missionaries are, they were very dependent on their monthly checks from home, but in Jamaica the banking rules dictated that after the checks were presented at the bank for cash, a two-month waiting period had to elapse before the cash could be provided. This was very inconvenient and frustrating to the missionaries, and they agreed that it would be impossible for them to continue to endure such an arrangement. They would have to do something about it\u2014and do something they did! The bank manager was taught the gospel, was baptized, and as a result the check-cashing problem was magically solved. Those elders knew their duty and accomplished it with faith and diligence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/let-every-man-learn-his-duty.p19\" class=\"\">Also, it was a problem there for the missionaries to get the proper kinds and quantities of food in Jamaica. They could obtain some staples essential to good nutrition but only after prolonged and tedious trouble and waiting. Another problem, another solution: teach and baptize the grocer. This they did, and thereafter had no problem in obtaining the food they needed and wanted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/let-every-man-learn-his-duty.p20\" class=\"\">In Jamaica, as in many other parts of the world, missionaries ride bicycles to carry out the Lord\u2019s work. But bicycles often break down and parts wear out. And there are often delays in obtaining parts and having repairs made. Again, the solution was obvious\u2014teach and baptize the bicycle repairman. At last report, he was responding to the missionaries\u2019 friendship and testimonies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/let-every-man-learn-his-duty.p21\" class=\"\">It is obvious that doing our duty is the best way to solve our problems. The proper pattern of duty has been set by those who have gone before us and is continued today by devoted teachers and leaders throughout the Church. The attitude and spirit central to a lifetime of duty is pinpointed in this poem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Who does his task from day to day<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And meets whatever comes his way,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Believing God has willed it so,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Has found true greatness here below.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Who guards his post no matter where,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Believing God must need him there,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Although but lowly toil it be,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Has risen to nobility.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">For great and low there is one test,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">\u2019Tis that each man shall do his best,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Who works with all the strength he can<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Shall never die in debt to man.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/let-every-man-learn-his-duty.p34\" class=\"\">(Anonymous.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/let-every-man-learn-his-duty.p35\" class=\"\">Every successful man and woman in the history of the world has known his or her duty and has had a firm desire to fulfill it.
