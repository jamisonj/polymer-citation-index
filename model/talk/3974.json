This area is known to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the Sacred Grove. On the day of our visit, the bees were kissing the wildflowers, and the soft zephyrs gently rustled the leaves of the great trees. It is a place of perfect peace and serenity. It was easy to believe that the heavens were opened and that the magnificent vision took place there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/the-magnificent-vision-near-palmyra.p6\" class=\"\">I refer to the awesome experience of Joseph Smith when he beheld God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, in the spring of 1820. There has been no event more glorious, more controversial, nor more important in the story of Joseph Smith than this vision. It is possibly the most singular event to occur on the earth since the Resurrection. Those who do not believe it happened find it difficult to explain away. Too much has happened since its occurrence to summarily deny that it ever took place. Some years later, still suffering under the impact of that happening, Joseph said, \u201cIf I had not experienced what I have, I should not have known it myself.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Millennial Star,<\/span> Nov. 1844, p. 93.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/the-magnificent-vision-near-palmyra.p7\" class=\"\">Young Joseph Smith, fourteen years of age, lived with his family near Palmyra, New York. In the spring of 1820, Joseph, like many others, was caught up in the religious excitement of the day. Desiring to know the truth for himself, and encouraged by the epistle of James, he knelt in solitary, fervent prayer in that beautiful grove not far from his home. He was at first violently seized by \u201cthe power of some actual being from the unseen world.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30672\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30672)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30672)\">JS\u2014H 1:16<\/a><\/span>.)

As a result, much ridicule, contempt, and even hatred were visited upon him. His mother, Lucy Mack Smith, relates that after the First Vision, \u201cfrom this time until the twenty-first of September, 1823, Joseph continued, as usual, to labor with his father, and nothing during this interval occurred of very great importance\u2014though he suffered every kind of opposition and persecution from the different orders of religionists.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of Joseph Smith by His Mother,<\/span> ed.

I have actually seen a vision. \u2026 I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30676\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30676)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30676)\">JS\u2014H 1:25<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/the-magnificent-vision-near-palmyra.p14\" class=\"\">There are several other accounts of the magnificent vision near Palmyra recorded by the Prophet\u2019s associates or friends before the Prophet\u2019s death, who, at various times, heard the Prophet recount the First Vision.

As an example, the Prophet refers in the published account of the First Vision to the religious fervor in the area where the Smith family was living at the time. Among others, Brigham Young later affirmed: \u201cI very well recollect the reformation which took place in the country among the various denominations of Christians\u2014the Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and others\u2014when Joseph was a boy.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 12:67.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/the-magnificent-vision-near-palmyra.p16\" class=\"\">Three years following the vision near Palmyra came the visit of the angel Moroni.
