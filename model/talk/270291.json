The\n  prophets do not declare that they saw a beast or beasts, but that they saw the <i>image<\/i> or <i>figure<\/i> of a\n  beast.<span class=\"footRef\">1<\/span> Daniel did not see an actual bear or a lion, but the images or figures of those beasts. The\n  translation should have been rendered &ldquo;image&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;beast,&rdquo; in every instance where beasts\n  are mentioned by the prophets. But John saw the actual beast in heaven,<span class=\"footRef\">2<\/span> showing to John that beasts\n  did actually exist there, and not to represent figures of things on the earth. When the prophets speak\n  of seeing beasts in their visions, they mean that they saw the images, they being types to represent\n  certain things. At the same time they received the interpretation as to what those images or types\n  were designed to represent.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">I make this broad declaration, that whenever God gives a vision of an image, or beast, or figure\n  of any kind, He always holds Himself responsible to give a revelation or interpretation of the\n  meaning thereof, otherwise we are not responsible or accountable for our belief in it. Don&rsquo;t be afraid\n  of being damned for not knowing the meaning of a vision or figure, if God has not given a revelation\n  or interpretation of the subject.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">John saw curious looking beasts in heaven; he saw every creature that was in heaven,&mdash;all the\n  beasts, fowls and fish in heaven,<span class=\"footRef\">3<\/span>&mdash;actually there, giving glory to God.<span class=\"footRef\">4<\/span> How do you prove it? (See\n  Rev. 5:13.) &ldquo;And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such\n  as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power,\n  be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">5<\/span><\/p>\n  <div class=\"topic \">Varied Creatures in Heaven<\/div>\n  <p class=\"std\">I suppose John saw beings there of a thousand forms, that had been saved from ten thousand\n  times ten thousand<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> earths like this,&mdash;strange beasts of which we have no conception: all might be\n  seen in heaven. The grand secret was to show John what there was in heaven. John learned that God\n  glorified Himself by saving all<span class=\"footRef\">7<\/span> that His hands had made,<span class=\"footRef\">8<\/span> whether beasts, fowls, fishes or men; and\n  He will glorify Himself with them.<span class=\"footRef\">9<\/span><\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">Says one, &ldquo;I cannot believe in the salvation of beasts.&rdquo;  Any man who would tell you that this\n  could not be, would tell you that the revelations are not true.
