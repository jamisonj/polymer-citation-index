The\n  proclamation which was sent, some time ago, to the churches abroad, has been responded to, and\n  great numbers are making preparations to come and locate themselves in this city and vicinity.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">From what we now witness, we are led to look forward with pleasing anticipation to the future,\n  and soon expect to see the thousands of Israel<span class=\"footRef\">3<\/span> flocking to this region in obedience to the heavenly\n  command; numerous inhabitants&mdash;Saints&mdash;thickly studding the flowery and wide-spread prairies\n  of Illinois; temples for the worship of our God erecting in various parts, and great peace resting<span class=\"footRef\">4<\/span>\n  upon Israel.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">We would call the attention of the Saints more particularly to the building of the Temple, for\n  on its speedy erection great blessings depend. The zeal which is manifested by the Saints in this city\n  is, indeed, praiseworthy, and, we hope will be imitated by the Saints in the various stakes and\n  branches of the Church, and that those who cannot contribute labor will bring their gold and their\n  silver,<span class=\"footRef\">5<\/span> their brass and their iron, with the pine tree, and box tree,<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> to beautify the same.<\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112371\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112371)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112371)\">Alma 51:6<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">2. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"115994\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 115994)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(115994)\">D&amp;C 124:46<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">3. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"106240\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 106240)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(106240)\">Num. 10:4,36<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">4. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108498\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108498)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108498)\">Luke 10:5-6<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"111845\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 111845)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(111845)\">Alma 7:27<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"115369\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 115369)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(115369)\">D&amp;C 105:25<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"116961\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 116961)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(116961)\">Abr. 1:2<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">5. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"115939\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 115939)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(115939)\">D&amp;C 124:26-27<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">6. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107277\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107277)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107277)\">Isa. 60:13,17<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
