They came to a great sea, and they rejoiced unto the Lord because He had preserved them. After they had been in the land Bountiful for a space of many days, the Lord spoke to Nephi and said, \u201cArise, and get thee into the mountain.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1998\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1998)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1998)\">1 Ne. 17:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p4\" class=\"\">Nephi obeyed the Lord; he went into the mountain and prayed.

I have sometimes wondered what would have happened if Nephi had asked the Lord for tools instead of a place to find the ore to make the tools. I doubt the Lord would have honored Nephi\u2019s request. You see, the Lord knew that Nephi could make the tools, and it is seldom the Lord will do something for us that we can do for ourselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p10\" class=\"\">The Lord does help when we go to Him in times of need, especially when we are committed to His work and respond to His will. But the Lord only helps those who are willing to help themselves. He expects His children to be self-reliant to the degree they can be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p11\" class=\"\">Brigham Young instructed the Saints, \u201cInstead of searching after what the Lord is going to do for us, let us inquire what we can do for ourselves.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> sel. John A. Widtsoe, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1978, p. 293.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p12\" class=\"\">Independence and self-reliance are critical to our spiritual and temporal growth. Whenever we get into situations which threaten our self-reliance, we will find our freedoms threatened as well. If we increase our dependence on anything or anyone except the Lord, we will find an immediate decrease in our freedom to act. As President Heber J. Grant declared, \u201cNothing destroys the individuality of a man, a woman, or a child as much as the failure to be self-reliant.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Relief Society Magazine,<\/span> Oct. 1937, p. 627.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p13\" class=\"\">Never before in my life has the doctrine of self-reliance been more needed to be preached and encouraged for the benefit of the Saints. We live in a time of rapid change. Governments are rising and falling. Industries are blooming and then all too soon becoming obsolete. New discoveries in science are soon overshadowed by new findings. Unless we are continuously expanding our understanding and vision, we, too, will become out-of-date. Research tells us that individuals entering the labor market today will be forced to find three to five different career paths during their productive years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p14\" class=\"\">What must we do to become more self-reliant?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p15\" class=\"\">My parents established a family tradition in our home which was fun for me in my early years and has become even more meaningful as I reflect back on it as the years have passed. On the first birthday of each child the family would gather in the living room. In the center of the living room floor, our parents would place articles for the one-year-old child to select. The selection to be made might indicate an interest the child would pursue in life. The articles were the Bible, a child\u2019s bottle filled with milk, a toy, and a savings bank, filled with coins. The child was placed on one side of the room and the family on the other side. Family members would encourage the child to crawl toward the objects and make a selection. This was all in fun, of course.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p16\" class=\"\">I was told that I selected the bank and went into finance as my profession. I watched my brother Ted select the scriptures, and he pursued law as his chosen profession. Over the years he has relied on the scriptures as a basis for his judgments. My youngest brother, Bob, was the well-rounded member of the family. He crawled over, sat down on the Bible, put the bottle of milk in his mouth, and then held the toy in one hand and the bank in the other.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p17\" class=\"\">Now I propose to you that in this entertaining family activity we can find the most fundamental principles of self-reliance. First, the scriptures represent our need for spiritual nourishment. In the scriptures, the Lord reveals His will to His children. From the very beginning of time, He has instructed His prophets to record His communications with them for the benefit of His children. The holy scriptures declare eternal values; they are the firm foundation on which we can build a successful mortal experience. We become more self-reliant when we study the holy scriptures, which teach the principles that provide a divine center to our lives here in mortality.<\/p>\n<!-- NEEDSWORK: we didn't insert links to Job's life or King Benjamin's address, so let's talk about the rule for when to insert -->\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p18\" class=\"\">We should be comforted by the fact that we have the best text which has ever been written, or ever will be written, as our guide. We can turn to 2 Kings, the fifth chapter (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3225\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3225)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3225)\">2 Kings 5<\/a><\/span>), and learn about obedience. We can study the life of Job and learn integrity. King Benjamin\u2019s address in Mosiah teaches industry. The life of Joseph, as told in Genesis 39 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24063\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24063)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24063)\">Gen. 39:7-20<\/a><\/span>), tells us what we should do when our standard of morality is being tested.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p19\" class=\"\">These are just a few examples of the lessons we could learn from the holy scriptures. They are lessons which have stood the test of time. Our challenge is to make them come alive in the hearts and minds of our families as we assume the responsibility to teach them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p20\" class=\"\">Second, the bottle filled with milk symbolizes the physical body\u2019s need for nourishment. Our Welfare Services program has taught us by using the spokes of a wheel to define the essential elements of temporal self-reliance. The elements contained in the wheel are education; physical health; employment; home storage; resource management; and social, emotional, and spiritual strength.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p21\" class=\"\">This summer my wife and I had the opportunity to visit an eighty-year-old man who certainly demonstrated each of these elements in his life. He was born in a small Idaho town and worked long hours on the farm to finance his education. He spent his professional life teaching English and Spanish in a small high school. To set aside funds for missions and the education of his large family, he grew strawberry and raspberry crops to be picked and sold to the local markets. This labor occupied his summers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p22\" class=\"\">Because these fruits were so labor-intensive, few people had the ambition to grow them. They were much-wanted crops. The demand was always there for as many berries as he could produce. He was never satisfied with the productivity of his crops, so he studied new varieties in an attempt to find the best producers. His backyard was literally an experimental farm for testing the variety of bushes that produced the sweetest and most abundant fruit in his particular climate. His studies yielded increased productivity. The labor kept him in good physical health. The fields of berries furnished automatic employment for his children each summer. The berries delivered to the market could be exchanged not only for cash but also for commodities to be used in their home storage. He managed his resources to build a beautiful home and supply the needs of his family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p23\" class=\"\">This man loved to watch the Lord\u2019s system of multiplying and replenishing the earth, which gave him social, emotional, and spiritual strength. Now retired from active teaching, he continues to grow his berries, not for profit but for satisfaction. Six mornings each week during the berry harvest season, you will see him leading a parade of ten to twelve cars out of the city toward his berry patch. Families come to add to their home storage by picking the berries. I asked him the price per case if we supplied our own labor. He answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My pay is seeing the look on people\u2019s faces as they leave the field holding the fruits of their labors in their arms.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p24\" class=\"\">I am convinced there are thousands of ways for families to build self-reliance by working together in productive pursuits. Perhaps a good family home evening discussion could produce some ideas to help make your family unit more temporally self-reliant.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p25\" class=\"\">Third, the toy I mentioned earlier represents the acquisition of things of the world. We are bombarded today with powerful media to \u201cacquire now and pay later\u201d in what are purported to be painless monthly installments. We live in an impatient world where everyone wants everything now. The acquisition of worldly goods seems to foster an appetite for more rather than any kind of lasting satisfaction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p26\" class=\"\">Using our resources and worldly goods wisely and extending their life will help us become more self-reliant. I watched a young family move this summer, and I was intrigued by the labels on the boxes coming out of the storage room. They read, \u201cClothing\u2014Girls\u20142 yrs. old,\u201d \u201cClothing\u2014Girls\u20143 yrs. old,\u201d and so on up. Clearly, this family had a well-conceived plan to maximize the usage of purchased items of clothing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p27\" class=\"\">We live in a world blessed with so much abundance. Let us be certain that the resources with which we are blessed are never wasted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p28\" class=\"\">Finally, the fourth item, the bank. It is a symbol of our financial well-being. I learned a great lesson early in my business career. My boss called me into his office. I could tell he had something on his mind. He said, \u201cGive me a definition of interest.\u201d Of course, I reached back in my training and gave him a definition I had learned from a textbook. He said, \u201cNo, no, no, that\u2019s not the one I want. You listen and remember this one: Thems that understands it, earns it; and thems that don\u2019t, pays it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p29\" class=\"\">Now it doesn\u2019t take a genius to understand that before you can collect interest, you must first have some savings. Having savings while continuing to increase one\u2019s standard of living requires understanding of one simple practice and then religiously applying it. After paying your tithing of 10 percent to the Lord, you pay yourself a predetermined amount directly into savings. That leaves you a balance of your income to budget for taxes, food, clothing, shelter, transportation, etc. It is amazing to me that so many people work all of their lives for the grocer, the landlord, the power company, the automobile salesman, and the bank, and yet think so little of their own efforts that they pay themselves nothing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p30\" class=\"\">Be prudent, wise, and conservative in your investment programs. It is by consistently and regularly adding to your investments that you will build your emergency and retirement savings. This will add to your progress in becoming self-reliant.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/becoming-self-reliant.p31\" class=\"\">The principle of self-reliance is spiritual as well as temporal. It is not a doomsday program; it is something to be practiced each and every day of our lives. May we continue to hold fast to the eternal truths of self-reliance is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
