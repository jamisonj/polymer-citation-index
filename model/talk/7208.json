I think it means to nurture others. Joseph Smith called it acting \u201caccording to those sympathies\u201d in our hearts.

I believe that you too have been guided and helped as you teach, comfort, and encourage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p10\" class=\"\">Yet as women we are pretty hard on ourselves! Believe me when I say each of us is much better than we think. We need to recognize and celebrate what we\u2019re doing right. Much of what we do seems small and insignificant\u2014just a part of daily living. When we are called \u201cto give an account to Jehovah,\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-25911_000_038\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Relief Society Minutes, Apr. 28, 1842, 34.]<\/span><\/sup> as the Prophet Joseph counseled, I know that we will have much to share.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p11\" class=\"\">Let me give you an example. Recently I asked Elder William W. Parmley about his memories of his mother, LaVern Parmley, who served as the Primary general president for 23 years. He didn\u2019t refer to her talks at conferences or the many programs she implemented. He spoke of one of his sweetest moments when he was 17 and preparing to go away to college. He remembered sitting with his mother as she taught him how to sew on a button. With children of all ages, small and simple acts have lasting impact.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p12\" class=\"\">Not all of us have children to teach the basics of sewing to. The early sisters were a diverse group just like us. Some were married, some single, some widowed, but they were united in purpose. As I\u2019ve been with you in many lands and many places, I have felt your love. Sisters, I love you, and I know the Lord loves you too.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p13\" class=\"\">Now, many of you are single. You are students; you are working; you are new to Relief Society. Some of you have been longtime members. Please believe me when I say each of you is valued and needed. Each of you brings love, energy, perspective, and testimony to the work. Your efforts to live close to the Spirit bless us all because you have learned to rely on the Spirit for strength and direction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p14\" class=\"\">One evening a single sister, Cynthia, felt prompted to go and see a sister she visit taught. The sister wasn\u2019t home. As Cynthia walked home, she noticed a nurse outside a hospital with two children, both serious-burn victims. When Cynthia heard the nurse call the little girl\u2019s name, a flash of recognition crossed her mind: she had known these two children as a missionary in Bolivia four years before. Becoming reacquainted on the lawn of the hospital, it was obvious the children were healing physically, but without any family support, they were suffering emotionally. Cynthia began visiting the children and nurturing them. Heeding the prompting of the Spirit, Cynthia became God\u2019s instrument for blessing two homesick children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p15\" class=\"\">Was that effort because she was single? No. It was because she was attentive to the Spirit and had yielded her heart to God. If we are in tune with the Spirit, if we are seeking the Lord and His guidance, if our direction is to return to our Father in Heaven, the sweet moments will come. And we will treasure them, for we have become instruments in the hands of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p16\" class=\"\">Sometimes our lives take unexpected turns, and we have to move from \u201cplan A\u201d to \u201cplan B.\u201d One single sister wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever felt true happiness in my adult life until I came to the conclusion that my worth as a person and as a daughter of my Heavenly Father had nothing to do with my marital status. At that point, I began to focus on my spiritual and personal growth and not on whether I was ever going to marry.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-25911_000_038\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Personal correspondence.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p17\" class=\"\">See how much we learn and grow when we share with one another our witness that the Lord lives and loves us. As I\u2019ve said before, if I could have one thing happen for each of you, it would be that you feel the love of the Lord in your life daily.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p18\" class=\"\">Sometimes that love comes in unexpected ways. Kristen was finishing a graduate degree and had recently given birth to her second child. She felt the other graduates had accomplished so much more and was reluctant to attend the graduation dinner. Her fears were confirmed when, at the dinner, the students were asked to list their professional accomplishments. Kristen recalled: \u201cI suddenly felt embarrassed and ashamed. I had nothing to call myself, no lofty position, no impressive job title.\u201d To make matters worse, the professor read the lists as he presented a diploma to each student. The woman ahead of Kristen had many accomplishments: she already had a PhD, was receiving a second master\u2019s degree, and she\u2019d even been a mayor! The woman received grand applause.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p19\" class=\"\">Then it was Kristen\u2019s turn. She handed the professor her blank sheet, trying to hold back the tears. The professor had been one of her teachers and had praised her performance. He looked at her blank paper. Without missing a beat he announced, \u201cKristen holds the most critical role in all of society.\u201d He was quiet for a few seconds, then declared in a powerful voice, \u201cShe is the mother of her children.\u201d Instead of a few courteous claps, people rose to their feet. There was just one standing ovation that night; it was for the mother in the room.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p20\" class=\"\">Mothers, you are instruments in God\u2019s hands, with a divine responsibility to teach and nurture your children. Little ones so need your kind and loving hand. As you put them first, He will direct you how to best serve them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p21\" class=\"\">All of you with older children are needed in your homes. Yes, there are frustrations, but there are lots of joys. Look for them! Having raised four industrious sons, I learned a thing or two about being an instrument: Enjoy the energy of these years! Make your home a safe, happy, relaxed place where friends are welcome. Listen, love, share your stories of your childhood and teenage years with your children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p22\" class=\"\">Have expectations for your children. We had a curfew and told our sons that the Holy Ghost goes to bed at midnight. When they didn\u2019t come home, a few times the Holy Ghost told me to go out and find them. That surprised a few of their dates! We laugh about that now\u2014but I must admit, laughter comes easier as they have grown older.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p23\" class=\"\">Be there for your children. Sit on the bed and enjoy the late-night talks\u2014try to stay awake! Pray for the Lord to inspire you. Forgive often. Choose your battles. Testify frequently of Jesus Christ and His goodness and of the Restoration. And most of all, let them know of your trust in the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p24\" class=\"\">If your children are grown and gone; if you are single, divorced, or widowed; don\u2019t let your circumstance dictate your willingness to share your life experiences. Your voice is needed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p25\" class=\"\">In a Relief Society Sunday lesson in my ward, we were discussing what makes a good marriage. One sister, Lisa, said: \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t say anything because I\u2019m divorced. But what keeps me going is my temple covenants.\u201d After the lesson, I asked some new young adult Relief Society sisters what in this lesson had connected to them. They said, \u201cLisa\u2019s comment impacted us most.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p26\" class=\"\">Now, my dear older sisters, I see God\u2019s image in your noble countenances. How your wisdom, patience, and experience have touched so many lives! My amazing mother-in-law, Mary, in her 90s used to say, \u201cPeople think because I\u2019m old I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d Let me tell you what she knew and what she did. While living in a senior residence, Mary asked the manager if they could use a room for church services. He told her no because the center was nondenominational. She refused to accept his answer! With some other senior sisters, Mary persisted until the company provided a room. Soon a branch was organized, and members were meeting each Sunday to partake of the sacrament and renew their covenants. Age is not a barrier to becoming an instrument in the hands of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p27\" class=\"\">There are countless ways to be instruments in God\u2019s hands. For example, be the kind of visiting teacher you\u2019ve always wanted; ask a young single adult about what she likes to do rather than why she\u2019s not married; share instead of accumulate; carefully choose your dress, speech, and choice of entertainment; smile at your husband or child who knows they\u2019ve caused frustration and heartache; put your arm around a young woman; teach in nursery with a happy heart; show by your attitude that you are finding joy in the journey. The Prophet Joseph said of such efforts, \u201cIf you live up to your privilege[s], the angels cannot be restrained from being your associates.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-25911_000_038\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Relief Society Minutes, Apr. 28, 1842, 38.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/sweet-moments.p28\" class=\"\">I testify we are engaged in the work of God.
