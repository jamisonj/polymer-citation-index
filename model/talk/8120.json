If we have lived faithfully until the time of our death, we \u201cwill have all the blessings, exaltation, and glory that any man or woman [who has had that opportunity] will have.\u201d (See <span class=\"emphasis\">The Teachings of Lorenzo Snow,<\/span> ed.

President Marion\u00a0G. Romney taught: \u201cThe suffering and distress endured by people of this earth is the result of unrepented and unremitted sin.\u00a0\u2026 Just as suffering and sorrow attend sin, so happiness and joy attend forgiveness of sins\u201d\u00a0(in Conference Report, Apr. 1959, 11).<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">Why does lack of repentance cause suffering and pain?<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p22\" class=\"\" id=\"p22\">One of the possible answers is that \u201ca punishment [was] affixed, and a just law given, which brought [about] remorse of conscience\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131051\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131051)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131051)\">Alma 42:18<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"131052\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131052)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131052)\">verse 16<\/a><\/span>). The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that we are the ones who condemn ourselves and that it is the torment of disappointment in our mind that makes it as intense as a burning lake of fire and brimstone (see <span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith<\/span> [2007], 224).<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">If we attempt to appease our conscience by trying to \u201cexcuse [ourselves] in the least point because of [our] sins\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131053\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131053)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131053)\">Alma 42:30<\/a><\/span>) or by trying to hide them, the only thing we will accomplish is to offend the Spirit (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"131054\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131054)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131054)\">D&amp;C 121:37<\/a><\/span>) and delay our repentance. This type of relief, besides being temporary, will ultimately bring more pain and grief into our lives and will diminish our possibility of receiving a remission of our sins.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p24\" class=\"\" id=\"p24\">For this type of suffering, the pleasing word of God also brings comfort and hope; it tells us that there is relief from the pain caused by the effects of sin. This relief comes from the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ and takes effect if we exercise faith in Him, repent, and are obedient to His commandments.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p25\" class=\"\" id=\"p25\">It is important that we realize that just like the remission of sins, repentance is a process and not something that happens at one particular moment. It requires consistency in each of its steps.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p26\" class=\"\" id=\"p26\">For example, when we partake of the sacrament, we show the Lord that we are going to remember Him always and keep His commandments. That is an expression of our sincere intent.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p27\" class=\"\" id=\"p27\">The moment we begin to remember Him and keep His commandments every day\u2014and not just on the Sabbath day\u2014is when the remission of our sins begins to gradually take effect and His promise of having His Spirit with us begins to be fulfilled.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p28\" class=\"\" id=\"p28\">Without the proper obedience that must accompany our intent, the effect of remission may disappear before long and the companionship of the Spirit begins to withdraw. We will run the risk of honoring Him with our lips while removing our hearts from Him (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"131055\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131055)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131055)\">2\u00a0Nephi 27:25<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p29\" class=\"\" id=\"p29\">In addition to comforting us, the pleasing word of God warns us that this process of receiving a remission of our sins can be interrupted when we become entangled \u201cin the vanities of the world,\u201d and it can be resumed through faith if we sincerely repent and humble ourselves (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"131056\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131056)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131056)\">D&amp;C 20:5\u20136<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p30\" class=\"\" id=\"p30\">What might be some of those vanities that can interfere in the process of receiving a remission of our sins and that are associated with keeping the Sabbath day holy?<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p31\" class=\"\" id=\"p31\">Some examples include arriving late for sacrament meeting without a valid reason; arriving, without previously having examined ourselves, to eat the bread and drink from the cup unworthily (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"131057\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131057)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131057)\">1\u00a0Corinthians 11:28<\/a><\/span>); and arriving without first having confessed our sins and having asked God for forgiveness for them.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p32\" class=\"\" id=\"p32\">Other examples: being irreverent by exchanging messages on our electronic devices, leaving the meeting after partaking of the sacrament, and engaging in activities in our homes that are inappropriate for that sacred day.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p33\" class=\"\" id=\"p33\">What might be one of the reasons why we, knowing all these things, often fail to keep the Sabbath day holy?<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p34\" class=\"\" id=\"p34\">In the book of Isaiah, we can find an answer that, though related to the Sabbath, also applies to other commandments that we must keep: \u201cTurn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131058\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131058)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131058)\">Isaiah 58:13<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p35\" class=\"\" id=\"p35\">The key words are \u201cturn away \u2026 from doing thy pleasure,\u201d or in other words, doing God\u2019s will.
