There are\ncompleted, but not dedicated because they are not entirely paid for, 233 buildings, or a total\nof Church buildings constructed and dedicated in 1960 of 394. We have no information\ncompiled for the first three months of 1961, but it is estimated that buildings in the planning\nstage and under construction would exceed the 900 mark.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we were to ask for the most commendable progress, I would not answer: \"<i>In the increased membership<\/i>,\"\nalthough in the last thirteen months the growth of the Church in numbers in the\nstakes and in the missions has been most encouraging. There has been an increase of a figure\napproaching the 100,000 mark. This afternoon we shall find the total membership given in the\nstatistics.\n<\/p><p>\nI would not answer that the most commendable progress has been <i>in better understanding<\/i>\n<i>among the leaders of municipalities, newspaper editors, and well-informed people generally<\/i>\n<i>regarding the purposes, organization, and contributions of the Church toward peace and the<\/i>\n<i>ultimate destiny of the world.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nI would answer that <i>the most encouraging progress of the Church during the last year is seen<\/i>\n<i>in the increased number of young people participating in Church activity<\/i>. We hear much\nabout the delinquency and incorrigibility of youth. I desire to say a word this morning about\ntheir <i>corrigibility<\/i>, as we have seen it and noticed it in visiting in different parts of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nFor example, on Sunday, March 26, 1961, I attended the dedicatory services of the Bountiful\nSouth Stake Center and Bountiful Eighth Ward Church edifice. There were in attendance over\n1,700 people, the majority of whom impressed me as being young members of the Primary\nAssociation and teenagers. That same evening I attended the Sacrament meeting of the Garden\nHeights Ward, Canyon Rim Stake. Here again a large proportion of the congregation was\nmade up of young people.\n<\/p><p>\nTwo weeks ago today in our regular weekly meeting, one of the brethren of the General\nAuthorities, I think it was Brother Mark E. Petersen, reported that he learned recently while\nattending the Bear River Stake conference that four wards in that stake had a Sacrament\nmeeting attendance for one month of above fifty percent of the entire membership of the\nward, and two of these four wards were in the sixty percent bracket. The Oneida Stake had a\nyear-long average high in the forties, and some wards had sixty percent, and even seventy\npercent in attendance. In each case the young people were a conspicuous part of the audience.\n<\/p><p>\nFor this increased attendance of young people much credit is due to the Presiding Bishopric,\nwho have put forth special effort to have the deacons, teachers, and priests attend Sacrament\nmeetings. And right here I would like to say to this vast congregation that it is a significant\nfact in Church organization that the bishop of the ward is not only ordained to preside over\nhis particular ecclesiastical group but is also set apart by divine appointment as president of\nthe priests' quorum, made up of 18, 19, and 20-year-old young men who, with young women\nof corresponding age, literally carve the moral atmosphere of the community.\n<\/p><p>\nMuch of this activity of the young is due to the Mutual Improvement Associations, who have\nplaced special emphasis upon the attendance of members of the MIA at Sacrament meetings.\nThe Primary general presidency and board and stake and ward workers merit great credit also.\n<\/p><p>\nBut I know and you know that mere attendance at Church and other acts of piety signify little\nif the person does not conform his acts and his speech to the principles of the gospel. Into\nthree principal environments the child is daily thrown, which direct his actions, inspire his\nbehavior in all his contacts with his fellow beings, enable him to control himself or to become\na slave to his appetites, his passions, and desires.\n<\/p><p>\nThese three environments are: the home, the school, the church.\n<\/p><p>\nBeaconsfield wisely wrote: \"I have always felt that the best security for civilization is the\ndwelling, and that upon properly appointed and becoming dwellings depends more than\nanything else the improvement of mankind. Such dwellings are the nursery of all domestic\nvirtues, and without a becoming home, the exercise of those virtues is impossible.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt is not generally conceded by educators nor by parents that the real education of a child\nbegins early in home life. One of our best modern philosophers, referring to the value of\neducation in childhood, says this: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Time does not have the same value in childhood as in later years. A year is much longer,\nphysiologically and psychologically, for a child than for a man. One year for a child of ten\ncorresponds to two years for a man of twenty. When the child is younger, the discrepancy is\nstill greater. The time elapsed between the third and seventh year probably represents a\nduration equivalent to fifteen or twenty years for a grown man.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Now, it is precisely at this age that a child builds up the framework into which all the events\nof his future life will fit, and in particular his moral code. This explains the considerable\namount of knowledge a child can accumulate during his first years. It would be highly\ndesirable for parents and educators to take this fact into consideration.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The moral education of a child is different from that given to a man. Indeed, for the very\nyoung it is important not to judge the gravity of a fault by its consequences. For a child a\nfault is serious in itself&mdash;absolutely and not relatively&mdash;because it has been decreed that it is\ngrave. Only the absolute character of a fault can impart to the child a true moral discipline\nwithout which progress is impossible.\n<\/p><p>\n\"It is impossible to model a child morally if this principle is not followed, for the faults are\nalmost always venial by their consequences. It is only during the most tender age that the\ncharacter can be formed\" (<i>From Human Destiny<\/i> by Lecomte du Nouy, pp. 208-209).\n<\/p><p>\nParents dress their children in the best clothes when children go out in \"company.\" They\ncannot so change their characters. What traits of character the child develops in the home, he\ntakes with him into society. The selfish, morose nature, or his cheerful, kind, radiant soul\ndeveloping in home environment goes with him when he joins the social group. If you want\nyour child to be courteous in society, teach him to be courteous in the home. \"If you please,\"\n\"thank you,\" \"pardon me,\" are terms of culture more applicable and more educative in the\nhome than in social circles. Into our schools and churches come too many children from\nhomes where the fundamental virtues of true manhood and beautiful womanhood are seldom\ntaught and more infrequently practised.\n<\/p><p>\nIn schools, in this Christian land, the teaching of Church dogma is forbidden, but the teaching\nof true citizenship&mdash;honesty, loyalty, the keeping of a promise, and other virtues that\ncontribute to the dignity of man&mdash;is not banned.\n<\/p><p>\nStudents reflecting these high ideals, recently made a trip to California. The <i>Deseret News<\/i>\nmade the following comments about them: \"Vigorous, ambitious, carefree youth bears slightly\nmore than its share of the criticism folks pass on to each other in these critical times, but when\nyouth acquits itself in such a way as to win the admiration and praise of many observers, the\noccasion should not be permitted to pass unnoticed.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Such a favorable impression was left with our California friends when the chosen music\nstudents of the Salt Lake area junior and senior high schools so becomingly upheld the lofty\nidealism of their schools, their homes, and their city when they participated recently in the\nMusical Educators National Convention at Santa Monica, California. Choral and orchestral\ngroups made up the Salt Lake entourage to the conclave.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Typical of the impression our youngsters left with their hosts is this tribute by the associate\nmanager of the hotel where the students of the Granite District were housed: 'It is seldom that\na hotel has an opportunity to have its house occupied with such delightful, well-mannered,\nclean-cut children as the MENC group that Mr. Moroni L. Jensen brought to Santa Monica . . .\nWe are writing this letter to let you know what a wonderful impression the children of Salt\nLake City and Mr. Jensen made.'\"\n<\/p><p>\nIf they had been delinquents, boisterous, unladylike, ungentlemanlike, the papers would have\ntold us about it. We thank these hotel people for paying this tribute to our boys and girls, who\nare truly representative children of good homes.\n<\/p><p>\nMan should so conduct himself as to merit the trust of his fellows. \"There is a unanimity of\nthought in this,\" writes a wise philosopher, \"which is to be found nowhere else except on the\nsubject of the ten commandments, but the effort made to impress this idea indelibly on the\nminds of children in the shape of automatic conditioned reflexes is so slight that one is aghast.\nThe equilibrium of the whole world, not only peace, but justice, commerce, industry, science,\nrests on the confidence in the integrity and in the word of men, and all the moral teaching\ngiven to youth in the course of ten or fifteen years of education and instruction certainly does\nnot represent more than a few hours, in certain cases a few days. The young are stuffed with\nmany useless details and the essential is passed over in silence.\" (The \"essential\" meaning\nmoral training, teaching them the dignity of true manhood.)\n<\/p><p>\n\"Farmers might as well be taught to grow flowers in borders without learning how to cultivate\na field; or young girls be taught the art of make-up without learning how to wash.\nExaminations deal with a quantity of facts destined to be forgotten in three months, or which\nare purely technical; children are trained to behave decently in public, but nobody dreams of\nmaking them repeat daily, as a prayer: 'Every promise is sacred. No one is obliged to give a\npledge, but he who breaks his given word is dishonored. He commits an unpardonable crime\nagainst his dignity; he betrays; he covers himself with shame; he excludes himself from\nhuman society.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"If this is not in reality a prayer it Is a creed which, by expressing faith in the dignity of Man\naddresses itself, beyond him, to God from whom we have received it.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe who is purported to have been the wisest American wrote years ago: \"Character is higher\nthan intellect. A great soul will be fit to live as well as to think.\" (Emerson.)\n<\/p><p>\nIn the Church, increased participation in church activity indicates a desire to be a partaker of\nspirituality, the highest acquisition of the soul, and young people desire it. I know there are\nmany who haven't that feeling, many who do not come, but you know, fellow workers, that\nthe young people like that which is good and true.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful for the sweet assurance that God is my Father, and I should like to have the\nyouth of Israel feel so close to him that they will approach him daily in secret prayer. I would\nhave them have the trust in him which the little blind girl had in her father. One day she was\nsitting on his lap in the train, and a friend sitting by said, \"Let me rest you,\" and he reached\nover and took the little child on his lap. The father said to her, \"Do you know who is holding\nyou?\" \"No,\" she replied, \"but you do.\"\n<\/p><p>\nJust so real should be the trust which our boys and girls have in their Father in heaven. If our\nyoung people will have this faith, and so approach the Lord, there are at least four great\nblessings which will come to them here and now.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first is <i>Gratitude<\/i>. Their souls will be filled with thanksgiving for what God has done for\nthem. They will find themselves rich in favors bestowed. The young man who closes the door\nbehind him, who draws the curtains, and there in silence pleads with God for help, should first\npour out his soul in gratitude for health, for friends, for loved ones, for the gospel, for the\nmanifestations of God's existence. He should first count his many blessings and name them\none by one.\n<\/p><p>\nThe second blessing of prayer is <i>Guidance<\/i>. I cannot conceive of a young man's going astray\nwho will kneel down by his bedside in the morning and pray to God to help him keep himself\nunspotted from the sins of the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26147\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26147)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26147)\">James 1:27 (JST)<\/a><\/span>). I think that a young girl will not go far wrong who will\nkneel down in the morning and pray that she might be kept pure and spotless during the\ncoming day. I cannot think that a Latter-day Saint will hold enmity in his heart if he will\nsincerely, in secret, pray God to remove from his heart all feelings of envy and malice toward\nany of his fellow men. Guidance? Yes, God will be there to guide and direct him who will\nseek him in faith with all his might and with all his soul.\n<\/p><p>\nThe third blessing is <i>Confidence<\/i>. All over this land there are thousands and tens of thousands\nof students who are struggling to get an education. In the Church, let us teach these students\nthat if they want to succeed in their lessons, they should seek their God; that the greatest\nTeacher known to the world stands near to guide them. Once the student feels that he can\napproach the Lord through prayer, he will receive confidence that he can get his lessons, that\nhe can write his speech, that he can stand up before his fellow students and deliver his\nmessage without fear of failure. Confidence comes through sincere prayer.\n<\/p><p>\nFinally, he will get <i>Inspiration<\/i>. It is not imagination, if we approach God sincerely seeking\nlight and guidance from him, our minds will be enlightened and our souls thrilled by his\nSpirit. Washington sought it; Lincoln received it; Joseph Smith knew it; and the testimony,\nthe evidence of the Prophet Joseph's inspiration is manifest to all who will but open their eyes\nto see and their hearts to understand.\n<\/p><p>\nHeaven guide you, our Youth, wherever you are. As long as you will keep yourselves pure\nand spotless and prayerfully and earnestly keep close to your Father in heaven, his Spirit will\nguide you, magnify you in your youth, and make you a power on the earth for good. Your\nFather in heaven is ever ready to give you help in time of need and give you comfort and\nstrength if you will approach him in purity, simplicity, and faith.\n<\/p><p>\nIn his poem, \"Anchored to the Infinite,\" Edwin Markham says: \n<\/p><p>\n\"The builder who first bridged Niagara's gorge,<br \/>\n     Before he swung his cable, shore to shore,<br \/>\n     Sent out across the gulf his venturing kite<br \/>\n     Bearing a slender cord for unseen hands<br \/>\n     To grasp upon the further cliff, and draw<br \/>\n     A greater cord, and a greater yet; <br \/>\n     'Til at the last across the chasm swung<br \/>\n     The cable&mdash;then a mighty bridge in air!<br \/>\n     So we may send our little timid thought<br \/>\n     Across the void, out to God's reaching hands&mdash;<br \/>\n     Send out our love and faith to thread the deep,<br \/>\n     Thought after thought until the little cord<br \/>\n     Has greatened to a chain no chance can break,<br \/>\n     And&mdash;we are anchored to the Infinite!\"\n<\/p><p>\nI repeat, God bless you, our Youth, that you may send out your thoughts in prayer and faith\nand receive the assurance that you are anchored to the Infinite, in God our Father and his\nHoly Son, the Redeemer of the world, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
