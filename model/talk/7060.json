En route we had a scheduled fueling stop at a remote mining community named Mt. Isa. As we entered the small airport, a woman and her two young children approached. She said, \u201cI am Judith Louden, a member of the Church, and these are my children. We thought you might be on this flight, so we have come to visit with you during your brief stopover.\u201d She explained that her husband was not a member of the Church and that she and the children were indeed the only members in the entire area.

Sister Louden whispered, \u201cMy prayer has been answered.\u201d She then asked how she might influence her husband to show an interest in the gospel. We counseled her to include him in their home Primary lesson each week and be to him a living testimony of the gospel. I mentioned we would send to her a subscription to the <span class=\"emphasis\">Children\u2019s Friend<\/span> and additional helps for her family teaching.

As I concluded, I said, \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll never know if Sister Louden\u2019s husband ever joined the Church, but he couldn\u2019t have found a better model to follow than his wife.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p39\" class=\"\">One of the leaders raised his hand, then stood and declared, \u201cBrother Monson, I am Richard Louden.
