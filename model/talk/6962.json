I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24905_000_018\"><a name=\"-24905_000_018\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-24905_000_018\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"43291\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43291)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43291)\">Luke 12:13, 15<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24905_000_018\"><a name=\"-24905_000_018\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-24905_000_018\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>In Conference Report, Apr. 1938, 103.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24905_000_018\"><a name=\"-24905_000_018\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-24905_000_018\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>In Conference Report, Oct. 1921, 3.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24905_000_018\"><a name=\"-24905_000_018\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-24905_000_018\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Pay Thy Debt, and Live \u2026 , <\/span>Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year (28 Feb. 1962), 10.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24905_000_018\"><a name=\"-24905_000_018\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote5-24905_000_018\">5.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">The Teachings of Harold B.
