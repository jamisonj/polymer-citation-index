Cawley of the U.S. Marines had been killed somewhere in Iraq. He was 41 years of age, leaving behind a wife and two small children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/war-and-peace.p5\" class=\"\">Twenty years ago Elder Cawley was a missionary of the Church in Japan. Like so many others, he had grown up in the Church, had played as a schoolboy, had passed the sacrament as a deacon, and had been found worthy to serve a mission, to teach the gospel of peace to the people of Japan. He returned home, served in the Marines, married, became a policeman, and was then recalled to active military duty, to which he responded without hesitation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/war-and-peace.p6\" class=\"\">His life, his mission, his military service, his death seem to represent the contradictions of the peace of the gospel and the tides of war.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/war-and-peace.p7\" class=\"\">And so I venture to say something about the war and the gospel we teach. I spoke of this somewhat in our October conference of 2001. When I came to this pulpit at that time, the war against terrorism had just begun. The present war is really an outgrowth and continuation of that conflict. Hopefully it is now drawing to a conclusion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/war-and-peace.p8\" class=\"\">As I discuss the matter, I seek the direction of the Holy Spirit.
