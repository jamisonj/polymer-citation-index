As I look forward and see this great number of men, many\nof whose faces are not familiar to me but many of them are, and when I try to figure in my\nmind the responsibility that rests upon them individually and collectively as the bearers of the\npriesthood, I wonder how I could make that plain, what words it would take to impress upon\nus all the dignity and responsibility of the Melchizedek Priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nI presume that all of us who are here today believe the things that President Richards has told\nus, that we believe that Jesus Christ is actually the Son of God.  He told Peter that upon that\ntestimony that he is, he would build his Church\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34875\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34875)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34875)\">Matt. 16:16-19<\/a><\/span>).\nI hope we have, as I have said more than\nonce from this pulpit, the testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, for as long as we do,\nand live true to it, no danger will ever befall the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe in the verity of the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith, that Christ appeared to him\nand gave him a commission, and that true to that commission he was finally authorized and\nempowered to reorganize the Church of Jesus Christ; that through the revelations which have\ncome to us through him we have a true conception of the purpose of life and of the gospel of\nJesus Christ. I believe, moreover, that the priesthood was restored through the Prophet Joseph\nSmith and that it has come down to us in an unbroken line, authoritative, and that only\nthrough the operation of that priesthood can the ordinances which are designed for the\nexaltation of men and women be performed in their behalf.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, this being true, this being the testimony of all who are here today, as I presume it is,\nthen we have a real responsibility, and I stand before you today representing a group of men\nin the priesthood whose major purpose it is to bear that testimony to the world&mdash;the seventies\nof the Church.  It happens, however, that in carrying that message to the world, we avail\nourselves of men who have not yet been ordained seventies and of sisters in the Church, and\nalso we use men who have perhaps been through the order of the seventy and become high\npriests, or at any rate who are high priests.  So we have a large force of men whom we use to\nspread this knowledge of the gospel to the peoples of the world.  The largest part of these\nmale missionaries is made up of the elders of the Church and many of them of rather limited\nexperience.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is the duty of the older members, the fathers, uncles, grandfathers, cousins, and so forth,\nwho have this testimony in their hearts, to establish it in the hearts of these growing young\nmen, so that at such time as they may come to us and offer their services that they may have\na living testimony that Christ is the Son of God, that the Church was authoritatively\norganized, that the priesthood is in the earth, all of which is essential to the exaltation of men.\n<\/p><p>\nIf every elder who goes into the mission field could go with that testimony, he would be a\npower of strength and vigor, and his example would be above reproach as he labors among\nthe people of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, who is going to impress these young people with this and how are we going to do it? \nWe all have that responsibility whether we be fathers of these young men, or relatives, or just\nfriends and acquaintances, or even strangers; when occasion may permit, we have the\nresponsibility of striving to instill in their hearts a firm and living testimony of the truth of\nthese things.\n<\/p><p>\nIt happens, occasionally, that young men go out who cannot say they know it.  Sister Ivins\nand I were on a train one time with a group going into the Central Atlantic States Mission. A\nvery outstanding young man was in that party.  In the testimony meeting that we held in\nRoanoke the night of our arrival, he said, \"I cannot tell you definitely that I know the gospel\nis true.\" But he believed it, and he sought that testimony.  I think it was about ten days or two\nweeks later, that we met him again in a testimony meeting. Then with all the fervor that one\ncould ask for, he bore testimony to the truth of the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\n\"If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27776\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27776)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27776)\">John 7:17<\/a><\/span>) the\nSavior said; and this elder had found it out.  Perhaps it would have been a bit better had he\nhad that testimony in his heart as he accepted his call for missionary service.\n<\/p><p>\nIt has been a long time since I first sat on the missionary committee with President McKay,\nwho was a Counselor then to President Grant, and after him with President Richards.  We\nhave seen many, many men come to us for interview and go into the mission field. It is my\ntestimony that most of them, brethren and sisters, are worthy of the call that is given them. \nOccasionally, however, we have problems with some of them, and the problems frequently\narise because, either they have not been properly taught or, having been taught, they have\nbeen a bit adverse and felt that they were being circumscribed in their liberties.\n<\/p><p>\nWe must not let them feel that way, brethren and sisters.  We must build in them a love for\nthe Church and the gospel of Jesus Christ, and we must present to them an attitude not of\ncriticism of the operation of the Church, but of approval, the testimony that there is actually\ntoday among the leaders of the Church inspiration.\n<\/p><p>\nI have lived in this Church a long time, and since I was eight years old I have been a baptized\nmember of the Church, and I have seen some of its practices change.  I cannot remember ever\nhearing of a change of the doctrine of the Church, but it has been possible to change some\nthings.  I remember when the Mutual Improvement Association came to St. George in its,\nshall I say, primeval condition, and I have watched it change its policies and practices, always\nfor the better.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are some people who feel that there never ought to be a change of that kind in the\nChurch, but it happens.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear testimony, too, that those changes in my opinion have been inspired.  But there are\nsome of us who feel that we cannot accept those things. We have no right, brethren and\nsisters, to teach our young, growing people that it should not have been done.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember meeting a boy years ago out in Shreveport, who came from a family that was\ndivided in that respect, a mother that was firm in her faith, a father that had an idea that\ncertain things should not have been changed, and I found that boy following the line of\nthinking which his father had instilled in his heart. Repeated promises on his part to refrain\nfrom worrying his companions with those teachings failed.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren and sisters, these are serious conditions, and who is responsible for them when\nthey exist in the hearts of boys and girls? Somebody, and usually somebody who holds the\nMelchizedek Priesthood, is responsible for it, brethren and sisters.  We have that great\nobligation to build faith in the leadership of the Church, faith in the revelations of God to\nguide this Church, and when we fail to do it, perhaps there will come a time when we may\nanswer for our failure.\n<\/p><p>\nI think that is one of our greatest responsibilities, today, brethren and sisters&mdash;to live the gospel\nof Jesus Christ in our homes, in our families, in our ministry among the people, in our\nbusiness relationships, so that growing men and women can see the results that may come\nfrom an inspired testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that the gospel has been\nrestored, that as has been said this morning, the Church is the custodian of the priesthood and\nthat we have the responsibility of carrying this message to the world.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are happy, brethren and sisters, in the contributions you are making of the services of\nyour sons and daughters. They are coming to us in great numbers and most of them are\neminently worthy. When they come to me, I hope you will have taught them that they must\nnot be afraid to tell the truth as some of them say they are. We have nothing but good will\ntoward those young people. Our sole and only purpose is to help them to see as they should\nsee, to live as they should live, and to serve as they should serve; and may God bless us all\nwith the power to so impress these young people with the truth of these grand and glorious\nteachings, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
