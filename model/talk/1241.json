Simpson, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1962, pp. 98-100<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brothers and sisters, how grateful I am for this opportunity of attending this glorious\nconference. I do not know when I have felt a more generous outpouring of the spirit of our\nHeavenly Father. Would it not be wonderful if the world's problems and differences could be\nsolved and decided under such a feeling of unity and warmth as we find here this morning? I\npray to my Heavenly Father that the expressions of these few minutes will be a direct\nreflection of the testimony that I feel in my heart.\n<\/p><p>\nLiving in this jet age of accelerated pace and challenge causes serious reflection on some\nfundamental issues. We might ask ourselves a few basic questions; for example, \"How can\nprecious time and energy be spent most profitably?\" \"What comes first?\" \"To what shall we\nturn our hand next?\" \"Does a loving Father really dwell in the heavens?\" These all-important\nquestions have been asked by practically every person who has ever lived. Sometimes we\navoid dedicating ourselves to the direction that common reason tells us to be right until a\ncircumstance forces the issue. I shall never forget a thought-provoking experience that came\nto me at the outbreak of World War II, and I would like to share it with you briefly: \n<\/p><p>\nThe British Empire had just declared war on the Axis powers. At the time I was a missionary\nin far-off New Zealand, and that country was busily engaged in adjusting itself to wartime\nfooting. Various projects were launched by the government in an attempt to make the people\nsense the seriousness of their situation. One beautiful morning I was walking with my\ncompanion down the main street of New Zealand's largest city, when our attention was\ncaptured by a group of low-level bombers approaching rapidly over the city. Their markings\nwere indistinct, and we thought to ourselves \"Might this be the enemy?\" Just at that moment\nthe bomb bays began to open up. It was a very ominous sight. Then, what appeared to be\nbombs were released from the bomb bays and everyone stood transfixed. Everyone stood in\namazement, and was very much relieved to see that these would-be-bombs disintegrated into\nthousands of leaflets, fluttering down over the city.\n<\/p><p>\nBeing tall, I was one of the first to reach a falling pamphlet, and bringing it\nquickly into focus, my companion and I read this brief but startling message: \"If this were a\nbomb, where would you be?\" Now, brothers and sisters, you can be certain that our thoughts\nwere very serious on that occasion, and I want to tell you that the gospel of Jesus Christ and\nits importance to mankind seemed foremost, above all else.\n<\/p><p>\nThe gospel, as set down by the Savior of the world, was never intended to be the least bit\nconfusing, for he is the author of truth and light. Our Heavenly Father has but one desire and\nthat is to have as many of his children as possible, regain his presence.\n<\/p><p>\nYou know, I had a business acquaintance, and he once complained that to him, religion had\nbecome a mass of confusion. He said that the road immediately ahead was covered with thick\nfog&mdash;that the bright goals which seemed so clear and discernible in his childhood, now\nseemed obscure and questionable. He was losing his faith! He was standing alone!\n<\/p><p>\nWe ofttimes lose sight of basic goals as we struggle against the adversary in this mortal realm\nof existence. Nothing would please him more than to have us distracted in our attempts to\nregain the presence of our Heavenly Father, and such was the plight of my friend.\n<\/p><p>\nOften we hear folks say, \"I can't see the forest for the trees.\" How important it is for us to\nascend a vantage point from time to time, above the fog that my friend referred to; there to\ncheck direction and relative position, there to decide on things of most importance; there to\nre-evaluate our goals.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord gave the key to all men nearly two thousand years ago when he said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will\ncome in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\n<\/p><p>\n\"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame,\nand am set down with my Father in his throne\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42320\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42320)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42320)\">Rev. 3:20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHow grateful we should be to have this key to live by. How grateful we should be that as we\nface the tremendous task of overcoming the imperfections of mortality, he assures us of his\npresence and sustaining help; but not without one very important stipulation, that the incentive\nmust come from us, for remember he said, \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock.\" In other\nwords, he is always there, ready to enter, ready to be with us, but we, too often, fail to\nrecognize the knock.\n<\/p><p>\nHow can any man look into the heavens and witness the order of his creations, without\nhearing that knock? How can any witness the wonders of this electronic and nuclear age\nwithout hearing the knock? How can we participate in the revealed wonders of medicine\nwithout indeed knowing that his mercy and love extend toward all men?\n<\/p><p>\nHe goes on to say, \". . . if any man hear my voice,\"&mdash;not just some special, select group of\nmen, but \"any man,\" any or all of more than three billion that live on the face of the earth,\nmay accept of this invitation freely.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him.\" What must we\ndo? It is up to us to open the door! He knocks; we recognize his voice; and then we open the\ndoor.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is not the Lord's plan to force his will upon anyone. Holman Hunt, the artist, felt inspired\nto capture this stirring scripture on canvas. One day he was showing his picture of \"Christ\nKnocking at the Door,\" to a friend, when the friend suddenly exclaimed, \"There is one thing\nwrong about your picture.\" \"What is it?\" inquired the artist. \"The door on which Jesus knocks\nhas no handle.\" \"Ah,\" replied Mr. Hunt, \"this is not a mistake. The handle is inside. It is from\nwithin, the door must be opened. Man must take the initiative.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYes, brothers and sisters, we are weak; \nwe do need help, we need help in overcoming. Where should we turn for spiritual and moral\nstrength? Should we desire to become a doctor, we do not hesitate to seek qualified doctors to\ntrain us. If our interest is in the field of law, we turn to those who are graduates in law, to\nbecome experts ourselves.\n<\/p><p>\nAlmost all men have the goal of our Heavenly Father's presence&mdash;so why not recognize the\nknock? Why not seek <i>his<\/i> counsel and listen to the voice? Let's open the door and let him in.\nLet's partake abundantly of this one great source of truth and light, for his\npromise rings ever true: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.\n<\/p><p>\n\"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42328\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42328)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42328)\">Rev. 21:6-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAfter we open the door, graciously accepting the help that is so necessary to our success, the\nLord gives us another great promise in the following verse, and how appropriate that it\nfollows his promise of help, for it is unlikely that man could ever achieve this promise on his\nown. He goes on to say: \n<\/p><p>\n\"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame,\nand am set down with my Father in his throne\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42322\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42322)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42322)\">Rev. 3:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, as the Lord draws close to us in fulfillment of his promise, his advice and counsel will\nbe direct and clear and undeviating from that original theme which has been the very core of\nhis message from the beginning of time. He will tell us that our overcoming can best be\naccomplished in terms of others; for example, the priesthood has been restored in our day.\nThousands of priesthood holders are here this morning.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, what can we do for ourselves with the priesthood? We only do for others with the\npriesthood. We bless others, we perform ordinances for others, we perform service for others.\nSuch is the admonition given by the Savior to all mankind. Matthew has recorded the Savior's\nwords as follows: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my\nbrethren, ye have done it unto me\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35203\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35203)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35203)\">Matt. 25:40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnother great prophet, speaking from this hemisphere, expressed it in this way: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your\nGod\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40305\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40305)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40305)\">Mosiah 2:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSelfishness and ingratitude are tools of destruction. The civilized world rocks and reels today\nbecause of selfish attitudes. I like the expression given in a poem which starts: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Lord, help me to live from day to day<br \/>\n     In such a self-forgetful way<br \/>\n     That even when I kneel to pray<br \/>\n     My prayer shall be of others.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then concludes: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Others, Lord, yes, others.<br \/>\n     Let this my motto be.<br \/>\n     Help me to live for others<br \/>\n     That I may live for Thee.\"\n<\/p><p>\nMay we constantly strive to be worthy, worthy of the blessings of our Heavenly Father. None\ncan do it alone. We must open the door wide, we must extend the arm of fellowship to those\nabout us, forgetting self, thinking of others, always others&mdash;not waiting until tomorrow, but\ntoday&mdash;for who can tell&mdash;\"If this were a bomb, where would you be?\"\n<\/p><p>\nBrothers and sisters, I know that God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ. This is his work,\nthe heavens have been opened, and a prophet stands at this day to receive revelation for the\npeoples of this earth. I bear that testimony to you.\n<\/p><p>\nGod grant us the vision to see the way clearly ahead is my humble prayer, in the name of his\nSon Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
