I encourage you to read the talks once again and to ponder the messages contained therein. I have found in my own life that I gain even more from these inspired sermons when I study them in greater depth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/god-be-with-you-till-we-meet-again.p7\" class=\"\">We have had unprecedented coverage of the conference, reaching across the continents and the oceans to people everywhere.

As I reflect upon my life\u2019s experiences, I thank Him for His many blessings to me. As I mentioned in my message this morning, I have felt His hand directing my efforts as I have tried earnestly to serve Him and to serve all of you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/god-be-with-you-till-we-meet-again.p10\" class=\"\">The office of the President of the Church is a demanding one. How grateful I am for my two faithful counselors, who serve by my side and who are always willing and exceptionally able to assist in the work which comes to the First Presidency. I express my gratitude as well for the noble men who comprise the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. They work tirelessly in the cause of the Master, with the members of the Quorums of the Seventy providing inspired assistance to them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/god-be-with-you-till-we-meet-again.p11\" class=\"\">I wish also to commend you, my brothers and sisters, wherever you are throughout the world, for all that you do in your wards and branches, your stakes and districts. As you willingly fulfill callings when you are asked, you are helping to build the kingdom of God on earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/god-be-with-you-till-we-meet-again.p12\" class=\"\">May we ever watch over one another, assisting in times of need. Let us not be critical and judgmental but let us be tolerant, ever emulating the Savior\u2019s example of loving-kindness. In that vein, may we willingly serve one another. May we pray for the inspiration to know of the needs of those around us, and then may we go forward and provide assistance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/god-be-with-you-till-we-meet-again.p13\" class=\"\">Let us be of good cheer as we go about our lives. Although we live in increasingly perilous times, the Lord loves us and is mindful of us. He is always on our side as we do what is right. He will help us in time of need. Difficulties come into our lives, problems we do not anticipate and which we would never choose. None of us is immune. The purpose of mortality is to learn and to grow to be more like our Father, and it is often during the difficult times that we learn the most, as painful as the lessons may be. Our lives can also be filled with joy as we follow the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/god-be-with-you-till-we-meet-again.p14\" class=\"\">The Lord admonished, \u201cBe of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10411_000_042\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"123686\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123686)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123686)\">John 16:33<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> What great happiness this knowledge should bring to us.
