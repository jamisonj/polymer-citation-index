We must be valiant in our testimony of Jesus. Each of us has many opportunities to proclaim our spiritual convictions to friends and neighbors, to fellow workers, and to casual acquaintances.

We also have a channel of personal testimony, which is direct to God. This has to do with His existence, our relationship to Him, and the truth of His restored gospel. This channel results in knowledge. These two channels are mutually reinforcing: knowledge encourages obedience (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51560\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51560)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51560)\">Deuteronomy 5:27<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51997\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51997)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51997)\">Moses 5:11<\/a><\/span>), and obedience enhances knowledge (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51654\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51654)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51654)\">John 7:17<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51955\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51955)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51955)\">D&amp;C 93:1<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/testimony.p40\" class=\"\">We all act upon or give obedience to knowledge.
