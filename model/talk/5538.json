Others are planning to go soon; still others have completed missions and are seeking an eternal companion. I am sobered by the realization that some of you will not reach these worthy goals because of other choices you are making now.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/making-the-right-choices.p5\" class=\"\">I am grateful this is a private priesthood meeting, for I have felt impressed to treat sensitive yet important matters. While they apply to all present, I particularly want to talk with you young men. I will speak as though you and I were alone in a private interview and no one else can hear us. My purpose is to help you learn how to make the right choices. That will help you develop strong feelings of self-worth. You will have confidence to do right and overcome strong negative peer pressure and bad influences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/making-the-right-choices.p6\" class=\"\">As a young boy, I felt that some things that I heard discussed by others at school about private parts of the body were wrong. Yet I wasn\u2019t really sure how wrong or why they were wrong. You may have similar feelings. Since in tonight\u2019s setting you cannot ask me anything, I will use some of the confidential questions most frequently asked by youth I have met across the world. I will answer them by what I have learned from the scriptures and the prophets. You then will have clear standards from which to make choices. I pray that as we talk the Holy Ghost will let you feel the truth of what is said. I know that as you listen and think of how our interview applies to you, there will come impressions regarding what to do about it in your own life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/making-the-right-choices.p7\" class=\"\"><span class=\"strong\">Question:<\/span> Could you give us some help about resisting peer pressure?

Individuals who do wrong want you to join them because they feel more comfortable in what they are doing when others do it also. They may also want to take advantage of you. It is natural to want to be accepted by peers, to be part of a group\u2014some even join gangs because of that desire to belong, but they lose their freedom, and some lose their lives. One of the hardest things for you to recognize is how truly strong you already are and how others silently respect you. We have great confidence in you. You don\u2019t need to compromise your standards to be accepted by good friends. The more obedient you are, the more you stand for true principles, the more the Lord can help you overcome temptation.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-94911_000_017\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"892\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 892)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(892)\">1 Cor. 10:13<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> You can also help others because they will feel your strength.

Why is sex before marriage wrong?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/making-the-right-choices.p13\" class=\"\"><span class=\"strong\">Answer:<\/span> Fundamental to the great plan of happiness and central to the teachings of the Savior is the family. A new family begins when a man and woman make sacred marriage vows and are legally bound together to become husband and wife, father and mother. The perfect beginning is through sealing in the temple. With marriage they commit the best of themselves to be absolutely loyal to each other and to invite children to be nurtured and taught. The father assumes his role as provider and protector, the mother her role as the heart of the home, with her tender, loving, nurturing influence. Together they strive to instill in themselves and their children principles such as prayer, obedience, love, giving of oneself, and the quest for knowledge.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/making-the-right-choices.p14\" class=\"\">Within the enduring covenant of marriage, the Lord permits husband and wife the expression of the sacred procreative powers in all their loveliness and beauty within the bounds He has set.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-94911_000_017\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Spencer W. Kimball, <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1974, p. 7.]<\/span><\/sup> One purpose of this private, sacred, intimate experience is to provide the physical bodies for the spirits Father in Heaven wants to experience mortality. Another reason for these powerful and beautiful feelings of love is to bind husband and wife together in loyalty, fidelity, consideration of each other, and common purpose.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/making-the-right-choices.p15\" class=\"\">However, those intimate acts are forbidden by the Lord outside the enduring commitment of marriage because they undermine His purposes.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-94911_000_017\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Boyd K. Packer, <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> July 1972, pp. 111\u201313.]<\/span><\/sup> Within the sacred covenant of marriage, such relationships are according to His plan. When experienced any other way, they are against His will. They cause serious emotional and spiritual harm. Even though participants do not realize that is happening now, they will later. Sexual immorality creates a barrier to the influence of the Holy Spirit with all its uplifting, enlightening, and empowering capabilities. It causes powerful physical and emotional stimulation. In time that creates an unquenchable appetite that drives the offender to ever more serious sin. It engenders selfishness and can produce aggressive acts such as brutality, abortion, sexual abuse, and violent crime. Such stimulation can lead to acts of homosexuality, and they are evil and absolutely wrong.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote9-94911_000_017\">9<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Spencer W.

It is also a transgression to intentionally stimulate these emotions within your own body.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote11-94911_000_017\">11<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Spencer W.

As a witness of Jesus Christ, I testify that is absolutely false. Satan particularly seeks to tempt one who has lived a pure, clean life to experiment through magazines, videocassettes, or movies with powerful images of a woman\u2019s body. He wants to stimulate appetite to cause experimentation that quickly results in intimacies and defilement. Powerful habits are formed which are difficult to break.

Decide what you will do and will not do. When temptation comes, do not change your standards. Do not abandon them when circumstances seem to justify an exception.

That\u2019s why the Church counsels you to go in groups and not to date while you are young. Later, as you prepare for marriage, remember that true love elevates, protects, respects, and enriches another. It motivates you to make sacrifices for the girl you love. Satan would promote counterfeit love, which is really lust. That is driven by hunger to satisfy personal appetite. Protect the one you love by controlling your emotions to the limits set by the Lord. You know how to be clean.

Should you have done any of this, repent now. It is wrong to violate these commandments of the Lord. It is worse to do nothing about it. Sin is like cancer in the body. It will never heal itself. It will become worse unless cured through repentance. Your parents can help strengthen you. Then you can become clean and pure by repentance under the guidance of the bishop. He may seem to be busy or unavailable. Tell him you are in trouble and need help.
