One year ago the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints issued a proclamation to the world concerning the family.

From the proclamation we read, \u201cIn the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life.\u201d The proclamation also reiterates to the world that \u201cmarriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator\u2019s plan for the eternal destiny of His children\u201d (\u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1995, 102).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p5\" class=\"\">From the earliest beginnings, God established the family and made it eternal.

How we conduct ourselves in this life will determine what we will be in all the eternities to come. To receive the blessings of the sealing that our Heavenly Father has given to us, we have to keep the commandments and conduct ourselves in such a way that our families will want to live with us in the eternities. The family relationships we have here on this earth are important, but they are much more important for their effect on our families for generations in mortality and throughout all eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p18\" class=\"\">By divine commandment, spouses are required to love each other above all others.

The proclamation states: \u201cBy divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20583\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20583)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20583)\">D&amp;C 83:2\u20134<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"2915\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2915)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2915)\">1 Tim. 5:8<\/a><\/span>]. [By divine design,] mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children.\u201d By divine design, husband and wife are equal partners in their marriage and parental responsibilities.

When families are functioning as designed by God, the relationships found therein are the most valued of mortality. The plan of the Father is that family love and companionship will continue into the eternities. Being one in a family carries a great responsibility of caring, loving, lifting, and strengthening each member of the family so that all can righteously endure to the end in mortality and dwell together throughout eternity. It is not enough just to save ourselves. It is equally important that parents, brothers, and sisters are saved in our families. If we return home alone to our Heavenly Father, we will be asked, \u201cWhere is the rest of the family?\u201d This is why we teach that families are forever. The eternal nature of an individual becomes the eternal nature of the family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p22\" class=\"\">The eternal nature of our body and our spirit is a question often pondered by those who live in mortality. All people who will ever live on earth are members of a human family and are eternal children of God, our loving Heavenly Father. After birth and tasting of death in mortality, all will be resurrected because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God the Father. Depending on our individual obedience to the laws, ordinances, and commandments of God, each mortal can have the blessing of attaining eternal life; that is, returning to live in the presence of their Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, having eternal increase for all the eternities to come. Through making and keeping the sacred covenants found in the temple ordinances, individuals can return to the presence of God and will be reunited with their families eternally.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p23\" class=\"\">The home is where we are nurtured and where we prepare ourselves for living in mortality. It is also where we prepare ourselves for death and for immortality because of our belief and understanding that there is life after death, not only for the individual but also for the family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p24\" class=\"\">Some of the greatest lessons of gospel principles about the eternal nature of the family are learned as we observe how members of the Church, when faced with adversity, apply gospel principles in their lives and in their homes. In the past year I have witnessed the blessings of joy which come to those who honor and revere the gospel teaching of the eternal family during times of adversity in their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p25\" class=\"\">A few months ago I had the opportunity of visiting a man who had been diagnosed with a terminal illness. As a devoted priesthood holder, he was confronted with the realities of mortality. He found strength, however, in the example of the Savior, who said, in the Lord\u2019s Prayer, \u201cAfter this manner therefore pray ye: \u2026 Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37647\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37647)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37647)\">Matt. 6:9\u201310<\/a><\/span>). My friend took courage in knowing that as Jesus was required to endure great pain and agony in the Garden of Gethsemane while completing the atoning sacrifice, He uttered the words, \u201cO my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37683\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37683)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37683)\">Matt. 26:42<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p26\" class=\"\">My friend came to accept the phrase \u201cThy will be done\u201d as he faced his own poignant trials and tribulations. As a faithful member of the Church, he was now confronted with some sobering concerns. Particularly touching were his questions, \u201cHave I done all that I need to do to faithfully endure to the end?\u201d \u201cWhat will death be like?\u201d \u201cWill my family be prepared to stand in faith and be self-reliant when I am gone?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p27\" class=\"\">We had the opportunity to discuss all three questions. They are clearly answered in the doctrine taught to us by our Savior. We discussed how he had spent his life striving to be faithful, to do what God asked of him, to be honest in his dealings with his fellowmen and all others, to care for and love his family. Isn\u2019t that what is meant by enduring to the end? We talked about what happens immediately after death, about what God has taught us about the world of spirits. It is a place of paradise and happiness for those who have lived righteous lives. It is not something to fear.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p28\" class=\"\">After our conversation, he called together his wife and the extended family\u2014children and grandchildren\u2014to teach them again the doctrine of the Atonement that all will be resurrected. Everyone came to understand that just as the Lord has said, while there will be mourning at the temporary separation, there is no sorrow for those who die in the Lord (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"42603\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42603)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42603)\">Rev. 14:13<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20531\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20531)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20531)\">D&amp;C 42:46<\/a><\/span>). His blessing promised him comfort and reassurance that all would be well, that he would not have pain, that he would have additional time to prepare his family for his departure\u2014even that he would know the time of his departure. The family related to me that on the night before he passed away, he said he would go on the morrow. He passed away the next afternoon at peace, with all his family at his side. This is the solace and comfort that comes to us when we understand the gospel plan and know that families are forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p29\" class=\"\">Contrast these events with an incident which happened to me when I was a young man in my early twenties. While serving in the Air Force, one of the pilots in my squadron crashed on a training mission and was killed. I was assigned to accompany my fallen comrade on his final journey home to be buried in Brooklyn. I had the honor of standing by his family during the viewing and funeral services and of representing our government in presenting the flag to his grieving widow at the graveside. The funeral service was dark and dismal. No mention was made of his goodness or his accomplishments. His name was never mentioned. At the conclusion of the services, his widow turned to me and asked, \u201cBob, what is really going to happen to Don?\u201d I was then able to give her the sweet doctrine of the Resurrection and the reality that, if baptized and sealed in the temple for time and all eternity, they could be together eternally. The clergyman standing next to her said, \u201cThat is the most beautiful doctrine I have ever heard.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p30\" class=\"\">The fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ brings great comfort in stressing times of mortality. It brings light where there is darkness and a calming influence where there is turmoil. It gives eternal hope where there is mortal despair. It is more than just beautiful doctrine. It is a reality in our lives that if we can be obedient and obtain the eternal rewards that God grants us, if we will draw nigh unto Him and embrace the eternal doctrine, we will be blessed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p31\" class=\"\">Another incident that has touched my life recently happened when a young man with a terminal illness passed away. He knew that his illness would first take away his manual dexterity and his ability to walk, then its progression would take his ability to speak, and finally his respiratory system would cease to function. But he also had faith that families are forever. With this knowledge, he spoke to each of his children through video recordings for use when he was gone. He produced recordings to be given to his sons and daughters at important, sacred occasions in their lives, such as baptisms, priesthood ordinations, and weddings. He spoke to them with the tender love of a father who knew that while his family was forever, for a time he would not physically be able to be with them, but spiritually he would never leave their side.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p32\" class=\"\">The examples of faith shown by steadfast widows and widowers, along with that of their children, after the passing of a spouse or parent are an inspiration to all of us. Great lessons can be learned as we observe their faith and obedience as they strive to remain faithful so that they can once again be together as families through eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p33\" class=\"\">The knowledge and understanding of the doctrine that God lives and Jesus is the Christ and that we have an opportunity to be resurrected and live in the presence of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, makes it possible to endure otherwise tragic events. This doctrine brings a brightness of hope into an otherwise dark and dreary world. It answers the simple questions of where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going. These are truths that must be taught and practiced in our homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-eternal-family.p34\" class=\"\">God lives. Jesus is the Christ. Through His Atonement we will all have the opportunity of being resurrected. This is not just an individual blessing; it is much more than that. It is a blessing to each one of us and to our families. That we may be eternally grateful, that we can live in the presence of God the Eternal Father and His Son Jesus Christ, that we may be together in the eternities to come, that we might understand the joy, and that we not only teach this doctrine but live true to it in our lives and in our families, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
