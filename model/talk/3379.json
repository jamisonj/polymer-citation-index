You will remember, of course, that when one of the Pharisees asked Jesus \u201cWhich is the great commandment in the law?\u201d that he responded, \u201cThou shalt love the lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cThis is the first and great commandment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cOn these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36723\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36723)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36723)\">Matt. 22:36\u201340<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p9\" class=\"\">As a ward bishop I was involved in the welfare program when it was first announced, and I have been involved in it ever since.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p10\" class=\"\">This long participation has taught me that the crowning aspect of a Christlike life is found in serving one\u2019s fellowmen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p11\" class=\"\">In the Church, serving and helping one\u2019s neighbor is not done only through spontaneous kindly deeds to our immediate families and next-door neighbors; it is also accomplished through the Church welfare program, which is based upon modern revelation through prophets of this dispensation. Its principles are eternal. They have been revealed and implemented, to some extent, where and whenever the Lord has established his church upon the earth. We read in the Book of Mormon, for example, that \u201cAlma commanded that the people of the church should impart of their substance, every one according to that which he had; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly; and of him that had but little, but little should be required; and to him that had not should be given.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd thus they should impart of their substance of their own free will and good desires towards God, and to those priests that stood in need, yea, and to every needy, naked soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd this he said unto them, having been commanded of God; and they did walk uprightly before God, imparting to one another both temporally and spiritually according to their needs and their wants\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40477\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40477)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40477)\">Mosiah 18:27\u201329<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p14\" class=\"\">(This was, as you will remember, in America among the Nephites about 147 <span class=\"small\">B.C.<\/span>)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p15\" class=\"\">In October 1936, the Presidency of the Church issued this statement, which continues today as the guiding precept of welfare services:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cOur primary purpose was to set up, in so far as it might be possible, a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole abolished, and independence, industry, thrift and self respect be once more established amongst our people. The aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves. Work is to be reenthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership\u201d (in Conference Report, Oct. 1936, p. 3; see also <span class=\"emphasis\">Welfare Services Handbook,<\/span> p. 1).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p17\" class=\"\">As a people and as a Church, we accept as fundamental truth the proposition that the responsibility for one\u2019s own economic maintenance rests (1) upon himself; (2) upon his family; and (3) upon the Church, if he is a faithful member thereof.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p18\" class=\"\">Welfare work divides itself into three main divisions. First is the basic doctrine of being self-sustaining to the full extent of one\u2019s ability. By applying the principles of personal and family preparedness, sometimes referred to as temporal welfare, we are to provide our own needs. So doing puts us in position to share our surplus with others. In his April 1937 conference talk, President J. Reuben Clark outlined the course of independence which should be followed by every member of the Church. He there said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cWhat may we as a people and as individuals do for ourselves to prepare to meet this oncoming disaster, which God in his wisdom may not turn aside from us? \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cLet us avoid debt as we would avoid a plague; where we are now in debt let us get out of debt; if not today, then tomorrow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cLet us straitly and strictly live within our incomes, and save a little.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cLet every head of every household see to it that he has on hand enough food and clothing, and, where possible, fuel also, for at least a year ahead\u201d (in Conference Report, Apr. 1937, p. 26).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p23\" class=\"\">When circumstances combine to require help, it is Church doctrine that one rely upon his family for assistance. Obviously, no one should become a charge upon the public when his relatives are able to care for him. Every consideration of kindness, of justice, of fairness, of the common good, and of humanity requires this.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p24\" class=\"\">President Stephen L Richards taught a principle which every family in the Church would do well to bear in mind:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cI think,\u201d said he, that \u201cmy food would choke me if [I] knew that while I could procure bread my aged father or mother or near kin were on public relief. I believe a decent family pride is a salutary thing with any people and in any nation \u2026 , a family pride in wholesome, self-reliant, and enterprising living\u2014a family pride that promotes the utmost solicitude for each member of the family. It wouldn\u2019t hurt my feelings to hear a family boast that through all vicissitudes they had come to each other\u2019s help and had never received public assistance. I have known brothers and sisters to put each other through school by hard, self-sacrificing toil. I cannot imagine any of these permitting their father and mother to come to public relief\u201d (in Conference Report, Oct. 1944, pp. 138\u201339).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p26\" class=\"\">Finally, aid is available from the Church. It has been so in all dispensations. Paul himself was a welfare worker, in a very modern sense of the term.

They bring about the desired end of establishing the Church and building up Zion. It is true, however, that when not properly applied, difficulties follow. Within two-and-a-half years after the original Church welfare plan was put in place by the First Presidency, President J. Reuben Clark made this significant statement in an address in Estes Park, Colorado, 20 June 1939:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p39\" class=\"\">The Church has found that the whole problem is essentially a question of spirituality, rather than of finance or economics [in getting Church welfare work accomplished]. Where the spirituality has been high, the Plan has succeeded; where the spirituality is low, the Plan has lagged. The Church has proved there is no substitute for the great commandments: \u2018Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy \u2026 might, mind, and strength, and thy neighbor as thyself\u2019 [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"17429\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17429)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17429)\">D&amp;C 59:5\u20136<\/a><\/span>]\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Church Welfare Plan: A Discussion,<\/span> General Church Welfare Committee, 1939, pp. 32\u201333).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p40\" class=\"\">While we have made great strides in the program since that day, the principle still applies. Everything we do in welfare services must be measured by its accomplishment in spiritual terms. Givers must give out of a righteous heart and with a willing spirit. Receivers must receive with thankfulness and gladness of heart. The Spirit must confirm a bishop\u2019s evaluation regarding assistance. It must lead a home teacher and a visiting teacher to know how to respond to needs of families to whom they are assigned. With righteous intent, participating in this great work sanctifies the soul and enlarges the mind. As we spiritually mature in fulfilling our welfare responsibilities, whatever they may be, we prepare ourselves to become \u201cpartakers of the divine nature\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"4942\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4942)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4942)\">2 Pet. 1:4<\/a><\/span>).
