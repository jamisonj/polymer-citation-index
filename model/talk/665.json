Reuben Clark, Jr., <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1953, pp. 38-40<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brothers and sisters: This is an humbling experience. I pray the Lord will bless me while I\nstand before you, and I ask that you be good enough to add your prayers to mine that I may\nsay something that will be useful, upbuilding, and encouraging to all of us.\n<\/p><p>\nI am partly in the unfortunate situation that Brother Romney found himself yesterday. Others\nthat have spoken have gone over my ground. However, I am not like him, I have not a good\ntalk in my coat pocket. Brother Lee and Brother Romney went over much of the ground some\nof which I shall try to cover this morning. I have made my peace with them.\n<\/p><p>\nSo far as we know, humankind have been afflicted with great crises since the grand council in\nheaven. We are in the midst of a great crisis now, and curiously, the crisis which we now\nface has in it and is a part of it, the great elemental principle that was in the first crisis that\noccurred in the council in heaven&mdash;the free agency of man.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to personalize that council a little more than I have usually thought. Two great\nrival personages were in that conference, one standing with the Father. As the chronology is\ngiven in the book, it appears that, first they found space in which to build an earth; then they\nprovided that this earth should be built; that the spirits should come here to prove themselves\nwhether they would obey the commandments of the Lord, and they were told of the rewards\nthat would come to them if they did, and the punishments if they did not.\n<\/p><p>\nThen the question arose with the Father, \"Whom shall I send?\" The plan called for\nredemption. One stood forth and said, \"I will redeem all mankind. Not one soul will be lost. I\nwill surely do it. So send me\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7194\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7194)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7194)\">Abr. 3:24-28<\/a><\/span>).\nThat plan, when analyzed, involved, as the Lord has told us\ntime and again, the destruction of our free agency. Just how we were to be redeemed under\nthe plan and yet destroy our free agency we are not told. The proposer of that plan said to our\nheavenly Father, \"Give me thine honor\" (see\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39033\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39033)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39033)\">Moses 4:1-2<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7197\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7197)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7197)\">Abr. 3:27<\/a><\/span>). And our heavenly\nFather has told us that that meant that he should surrender to the proposer, his power, and he,\nthe Father, become more or less a nonentity, I suppose.\n<\/p><p>\nThen the other Personage said, \"Send me, and the honor will be thine.\" The heavenly Father\nchose the latter, the Only Begotten, who was to be sent to this earth.\n<\/p><p>\nNow this first personage, Satan&mdash;I can understand that his proposal was based upon the\nproposition that since the Father was the Father of all his children and loved them, nothing\ncould be more satisfactory to the Father than the promise to redeem them all. It was a subtle\napproach, and, of course, God saw it. Satan was \"cast down\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42235\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42235)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42235)\">Rev. 12:9-10<\/a><\/span>), and with him went one-third of\nthe hosts of heaven (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42234\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42234)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42234)\">Rev. 12:4<\/a><\/span>).\nHe declared by his rebellion (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39034\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39034)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39034)\">Moses 4:3<\/a><\/span>)\neternal enmity toward the\nplan that was adopted, and from that time until now, constantly sought to build the empire,\nthe kingdom for which he planned, by leading us astray. He has never relented for a moment.\nHaving our agency, he was to lead us to do evil.\n<\/p><p>\nHe first struck at Adam and Eve in the garden and secured from them disobedience. There is\nmuch in the scripture that indicates that mere obedience, per se, irrespective of what the\nobedience involved, is a great virtue in itself. Obedience in spiritual matters requires that on\noccasion it shall be blind obedience because the Lord cannot explain to us all the things that\nhe asks us to do. We could not understand.\n<\/p><p>\nYou know, Satan won with Eve, but Eve, when she understood, gave a great hymn of praise\nthat she had fallen because now they would have seed, and could not have had seed had the\nfall not taken place (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39038\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39038)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39038)\">Moses 5:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAdam and Eve were thrust out of the garden of Eden; they became mortal, subject to\ntemporal death, but the Lord then said, and did as he said, that he would give to Adam the\ngospel plan by which the spirits that were to come here could live and gain the reward which\nhe had promised. That gospel plan he gave, and when he gave it, he said it would never be\ntaken away until the end of the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39040\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39040)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39040)\">Moses 5:59<\/a><\/span>).\nIt is my faith that the gospel plan has always been\nhere, that his priesthood has always been the earth, and that it will continue be so until the\nend comes. (While through the apostasy since the time of Christ, the priesthood was lost to\nthe people generally and to the Christian churches, yet there have always been on the earth\nfrom the beginning, servants of the Lord who have the priesthood. See: as to the descent of\nthe priesthood down through Moses (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13145\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13145)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13145)\">D&amp;C 84:6-17,25-26<\/a><\/span>);\nas to Moses, Elias, Elijah (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13175\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13175)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13175)\">D&amp;C 110:11-15<\/a><\/span>);\nas to the Apostle John (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27581\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27581)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27581)\">John 21:22-23<\/a><\/span>);\nand as to the Three Nephites (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5529\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5529)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5529)\">3 Ne. 28:1-10<\/a><\/span>).\nSee <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>, Smith, pp. 180-181.)\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Adam began to rear a family, Satan struck again. This time he divided the family\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39039\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39039)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39039)\">Moses 5:13<\/a><\/span>). Part\nof them became worldly and wicked, and that wickedness increased. Part of them were\nrighteous. Brother Lee, yesterday traced down the dispensations. There is no need of my\nretracing their course. These dispensations were, each of them, a crisis. The dispensation in\nwhich Enoch lived afforded Enoch a chance to demonstrate that he could do what no other\nleader of a dispensation has ever done&mdash;prepare a people to be taken into the presence of our\nheavenly Father. That was the greatest achievement of any leader of any dispensation.\n<\/p><p>\nBefore the Meridian of Time and the birth of the Messiah, mankind looked forward thereto.\nBefore that, all of the rituals pertaining to the gospel looked to the Messiah, to his birth, as\nBrother Romney told us. Since that time, we honor him, and our ritual, the sacrament, relates\nback to that time. We make covenants when we partake of the sacrament. But also, and ever\nsince that time, we have been told that there would be a Dispensation of the Fulness of\nTimes. And as Brother Lee pointed out, we now are in that dispensation, we are in the\ndispensation which is to prepare for the Second Coming, toward which all true Christians\nlook.\n<\/p><p>\nThe particular thing that I wish to say today is this: Being in that last dispensation,\nrepresenting our heavenly Father therein, we have great responsibilities. If the world is to be\nprepared for the Second Coming, we must do it. No one else has the knowledge. No one else\nhas the authority. The responsibility is ours. The last dispensation has welded together all of\nthe doctrines and principles of the gospel that were advanced in former dispensations. We\nhave the priesthood bestowed by heavenly hands. We have the restoration of the keys,\nconferred in the Kirtland Temple when Moses and Elias and Elijah came. We have all of the\nauthority, all of the principles that are necessary for the great work of\npreparation; and ours, I repeat, is the sole responsibility to go forward and see that our\nmission is carried out.\n<\/p><p>\nWe must live righteously. We must keep the commandments of the Lord. We must do his\nwork. He has told us what we are to do, and if we are to gain the salvation which we hope\nand expect to gain and meet our responsibilities, we must obey what he has told us to do.\n<\/p><p>\nMy brothers and sisters, if we think of this carefully, I am sure we cannot approach our work\nin the Church with lightmindedness. I am sure we shall have to be a prayerful people. I am\nsure we shall have to live in accordance with the commandments which he has given. I am\nsure we must use our utmost endeavors to build up the kingdom of God here on earth.\n<\/p><p>\nI hope, my brothers and sisters, that we shall not be remiss in anything that pertains to\nourselves or to our activities in the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nI add again my testimony, which I have borne time and again, that God lives, that Jesus is the\nChrist, that he came to earth, lived, moved among men, carried on his mission, that in due\ntime and in accordance with the plan, he was crucified, and lay in the tomb, and rose on the\nthird morning. I testify that Joseph was the Prophet through whom the Lord re-established his\nChurch here on earth, so ushering in this last Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, for the\ncarrying forward of which and the perfecting of which we are responsible, that the priesthood\ncame, that the gospel was fully restored.\n<\/p><p>\nI testify that those who followed the Prophet succeeded to his powers, to his rights and\nprerogatives and that has come down through to our present President, President David Oman\nMcKay. I testify that if we will follow the advice and the counsel of those who are placed\nover us, we shall carry forward the work which we are obliged to do&mdash;I say obliged, because\nwe are.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless each and every one of us and help us to do our part, I humbly pray, in\nthe name of Jesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
