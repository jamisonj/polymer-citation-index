Rising to the possibilities of the oath and covenant brings the greatest of all the gifts of God: eternal life. That is a purpose of the Melchizedek Priesthood. Through keeping the covenants as we receive the priesthood and renewing them in the temple ceremonies, we are promised by an oath made by our Heavenly Father, Elohim, that we will gain the fulness of His glory and live as He lives. We will have the blessing of being sealed in a family forever with the promise of eternal increase.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/faith-and-the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p7\" class=\"\">As you would expect, failing to claim such a blessing would bring tragic consequences.

There are at least two reasons why you should be confident rather than discouraged with the penalties that would follow either failing to keep the oath and covenant or deciding not to accept it. Whether you accept the oath and covenant and find it too difficult or if you fail to try, the penalty is the same. There is no question, therefore, that your best course and mine is to receive the holy priesthood and try with all of our hearts to keep its covenants. If we choose not to try, we would certainly lose the opportunity for eternal life. If we try and with God\u2019s help succeed, we will gain eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/faith-and-the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p18\" class=\"\">There is yet another reason to decide now that you will try with all your heart to qualify for that oath and covenant and have confidence that you will succeed.

He has known you since you were with Him in the spirit world. With His foreknowledge of your strength, He has allowed you to find the true Church of Jesus Christ and to be offered the priesthood. You can feel confidence because you have evidence of His confidence in you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/faith-and-the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p21\" class=\"\">Second, as you will try to keep your covenants, the Savior has promised His personal help.

He told me that at the end of every day while he was serving, he could barely make it upstairs to bed at night wondering if he would have the strength to face another day. Then in the morning, he would find his strength and his courage restored.

A young man hearing my words today can have confidence that by honoring his priesthood he will be protected against the temptation to sexual sin so prevalent in the world in which we live. It will be possible for the Aaronic Priesthood holder hearing me tonight, as his faith increases in the sure reward of eternal life through the eternal priesthood, that he will have the power to see in the daughters of God their true worth and in the promise of a posterity a reason to be pure and to stay clean.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/faith-and-the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p34\" class=\"\">In the same way, faith in the oath and covenant will lead us to develop the feelings of charity essential to an eternal family.

So have many of you. And so have many outside the Church. I was in the office of President Gordon\u00a0B. Hinckley when he was asked to take a phone call. He spoke briefly on the phone and then returned to our conversation. But he took a moment to explain. He said that the call was from the president of the United States, who was flying over Utah in Air Force One on his way to Washington. The president of the United States had called to thank President Hinckley for what priesthood holders had done in the aftermath of a hurricane. The president of the United States had said that it was a miracle that we were able to get so many people, so quickly, working together so well. He praised our people by saying that we knew how to do things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/faith-and-the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p36\" class=\"\">Perhaps the president of the United States was impressed with what he thought were our great organizational skills. That was part of the miracle. But the greater reason for the miracle was that hundreds and perhaps thousands of priesthood holders had such faith in the oath and covenant of the priesthood. It was not how they were organized that made the difference: faith in the oath and covenant of the priesthood impelled them to go long distances, stay long hours, and endure hardship as representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ in caring for those in great need.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/faith-and-the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p37\" class=\"\">They were in that process of giving priesthood service, developing the power and the spirit of charity necessary to become great husbands, fathers, sons, and brothers in families here and in families forever. Those instances of priesthood service have occurred in our outreach to people, as brothers and sisters in God\u2019s family across the earth, time and time again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/faith-and-the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p38\" class=\"\">My prayer is that you will decide tonight, and then every day, to go forward in faith in keeping your covenants with God and so claim the promise He has made to you with an oath. You can do it in simple things. When you meet with your quorum, you can decide to see them as brothers in the family of God. There will be someone in your quorum or priesthood group who is in need. He may not show it. You may not be able to see it with your eyes. But God knows and invites you to be His servant in helping him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/faith-and-the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p39\" class=\"\">You can be like the priesthood holder who every time I saw him in our priesthood service together would ask, \u201cHow\u2019s Grandma?\u201d He had never met my mother-in-law, as far as I know. But he somehow found out about her illness and her great age. I cannot tell you how much it meant to me to see the hand of God reaching out to me and my wife in consolation and comfort through a priesthood holder. You can have that same effect every time you gather with priesthood holders if you always think of your covenant to succor and help those whose hands hang down and who carry heavy burdens. As you do, you will be developing the very qualities which will qualify you to be a member of a family forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/faith-and-the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p40\" class=\"\">There is another thing you can do.
