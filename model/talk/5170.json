Some customers occasionally took unfair advantage of the young man, and parts were disappearing from the lot overnight. Vern was angry and vowed to catch someone and make an example of him. Vengeance would be his.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-more-excellent-way.p31\" class=\"\">Just after his father had started to recover from his illness, Vern was making his rounds of the yard one night at closing time. It was nearly dark. In a distant corner of the property, he caught sight of someone carrying a large piece of machinery toward the back fence. He ran like a champion athlete and caught the young thief. His first thought was to take out his frustrations with his fists and then drag the boy to the front office and call the police. His heart was full of anger and vengeance. He had caught his thief, and he intended to get his just dues.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-more-excellent-way.p32\" class=\"\">Out of nowhere, Vern\u2019s father came along, put his weak and infirm hand on his son\u2019s shoulder, and said, \u201cI see you\u2019re a bit upset, Vern. Can I handle this?\u201d He then walked over to the young would-be thief and put his arm around his shoulder, looked him in the eye for a moment, and said, \u201cSon, tell me, why are you doing this? Why were you trying to steal that transmission?\u201d Then Mr. Crowley started walking toward the office with his arm around the boy, asking questions about the young man\u2019s car problems as they walked. By the time they had arrived at the office, the father said, \u201cWell, I think your clutch is gone and that\u2019s causing your problem.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-more-excellent-way.p33\" class=\"\">In the meantime, Vern was fuming. \u201cWho cares about his clutch?\u201d he thought. \u201cLet\u2019s call the police and get this over with.\u201d But his father just kept talking. \u201cVern, get him a clutch. Get him a throwout bearing, too. And get him a pressure plate. That should take care of it.\u201d The father handed all of the parts to the young man who had attempted robbery and said, \u201cTake these. And here\u2019s the transmission, too. You don\u2019t have to steal, young man. Just ask for it. There\u2019s a way out of every problem.

The young man came back to the lot often. Voluntarily, month by month, he paid for all of the parts Vic Crowley had given him, including the transmission. During those visits he asked Vern why his dad was the way he was and why he did what he did. Vern told him something of their Latter-day Saint beliefs and how much his father loved the Lord and loved people. Eventually the would-be thief was baptized. Vern later said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard now to describe the feelings I had and what I went through in that experience. I, too, was young. I had caught my crook.
