Zion's standard is unfurled.<br \/>\nThe dawning of a brighter day<br \/>\nMajestic rises on the world.<br \/>\n<\/p><p>\nThese lines from a poet were not penned to herald Easter morn, although they might well\nhave been. They were written to announce the advent of a new gospel dispensation. They also\nappropriately symbolize the resurrection of the Christ. When His bruised and wounded body\narose from the sepulcher and put on the radiant garb of immortality, it was in truth the\ndawning of a new and brighter day for all the world.\n<\/p><p>\nThat event was the central fact in the life of the Savior. For it He was born; to prepare for it\nHe lived His matchless life; to substantiate its efficacy for all men, He endured more sorrow\nthan any other, a crueler death, carried a heavier burden &mdash; all to demonstrate the supreme\nhappiness and the most transcendently beautiful and desirable thing within the attainment of\nhumankind &mdash; eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Easter we celebrate this day in the Christian world, together with substantially all other\naspects of the life and ministry of the Redeemer was foretold by the prophets. I have counted\ntwo hundred twenty-two verses of scripture from the Bible alone which deal in a prophetic\nway with our Lord Jesus Christ. Surely there is significance in this voluminous foretelling of\nthe greatest thing in history. I look upon it as the supreme vindication of prophecy and the\nprophets. The Savior might have lived, died, and done His work without prediction of His\ncoming, but it is evident that that was not the plan. Being the author of faith, He caused that\nsacred principle to be introduced as the premise for His appearance in the flesh, and He left it\nwith men as the cornerstone in the foundation of His gospel. From it I draw the meaning of\nthis hour.\n<\/p><p>\nTo the followers of Christ everywhere I pose this question: Has anyone truly Christian faith\nwho does not believe the prophets? I suspect that some may not care to answer the question,\neven to themselves, but I know of no better way of testing our real allegiance to Christian\nprinciples.\n<\/p><p>\nThe prophets have had vital messages for us in days that are gone, as they have in the critical\ndays that are here. Had we understood and believed their words, many of our difficulties\nmight have been averted. They have given us counsel on every phase of our living. They have\ntold us the things that would make for happiness and success, and they have pointed out the\ncourses which lead to misery and failure. We should be deeply interested in their words now,\nas we are searching for causes and remedies, and when we are so urgently in need of\nformulas to unite and solidify our people and our efforts in the Herculean task before us.\nPainful as it may be, we must admit our mistakes before we can rectify them.\n<\/p><p>\nMost of our people recognize the necessity for spiritual support in this war. I believe there is\nno higher spirituality than that which is manifested in prophecy and also in its acceptance.\nGod speaks through His chosen servants. If we do not listen to them, it is likely we do not\nreally hear God at all, although I do not mean in any degree to deprecate individual\ncommunion with our Father through prayer. I have in mind divine pronouncement of\nprinciples and laws for the guidance of men and nations.\n<\/p><p>\nThis war began among Christian nations. It is true that China and Japan were involved before\nits outbreak, but its foundations were laid among peoples who had the Bible and, professedly\nat least, the churches of Christ. Had they listened to inspired prophets, it and many preceding\nwars would never have been begun. In the first place, they would have been convinced of the\nnecessity of adopting principles governing international relations which would have averted\nconflict, and in the second place they would have known from the beginning the futility of\nwar. Wars have been fought before to end war, and mankind should have learned long ago\nthat the war serum injected anywhere in the body of the universe is wholly ineffective as an\nantitoxin for the malady of human conflict. Surely it is time for investigation to be directed\nalong other lines to isolate the bacteria of this disease and provide a cure.\n<\/p><p>\nNow as I see it, those engaged in such investigations have become so engrossed in the use of\nmicroscopic technological methods that there has developed an adversity to the simple,\nobvious formulas which, whenever actually tried, have proved effective. Not long ago I heard\na prominent scientist declare that science would end war. He said that scientific genius would\ndevise such terrible killing devices that men would be afraid to go to war. This I doubt, first,\nbecause the defense can call to its aid the same science as the offense, and secondly, because I\nbelieve that fear will never be an adequate deterrent. We have record of wars resulting in the\ncomplete extermination of the opposing hosts, but I don't know that anybody looks forward to\nsuch a process of ending war.\n<\/p><p>\nSomehow there has developed a certain modern education which seems to have disdain for\nthe obvious, proceeding on the assumption that if it's simple and old, it can't be true. Such an\nattitude, which fortunately is by no means universal, has served greatly to retard the solution\nof many of our most important problems, chief among which is the question how men may\nlive together comfortably and in peace. All of us rejoice in the contribution science has made\nto the convenience and pleasure of our living. We are deeply grateful for the discoveries of\npatient, hard-working research men who have contributed so much to freedom from disease,\norganic efficiency and longevity of life. I noted a number of years ago that a poll of students\nplaced Louis Pasteur at the head of a list of great men, excluding religious leaders, who had\nmade contributions to mankind.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a pity it is that in the face of all these remarkable advances in health, sanitation,\ncomfort, and beauty that we have made so little progress in human relations. Someone has\npointed out that the greatest tragedy of the modern age was the tercentenary of Harvard\nUniversity in 1936, where scholars from all over the world met to appraise the progress of the\nworld for the past three hundred years and reached the solemn conclusion that, while man had\nmade most unusual and commendable progress in solving the mysteries of the universe,\nbringing under control the forces of nature, that in all this long period of time he had made\nno appreciable advance in the control of himself, his greed and his passions, and that he was\neven more prone to fight with other men than he had been centuries before. So it is evident\nthat the social studies carried forward by many conspicuously brilliant people have not helped\nus very much in our greatest difficulty.\n<\/p><p>\nNow that we are in a crisis we find ourselves groping for every straw that might indicate the\nproper direction of our national effort. We have tried and we are still trying\nexperiments by the score. We know that we need unity, loyalty, self-sacrifice, efficiency, and\nfaith. We plead and cry for these high qualities so essential to success, but they don't come\nin sufficient measure. Dissension, costly disputes, selfish interest, inefficiency, skepticism, and\ndoubt continue to retard our preparation to meet a peril that is so imminent as to make the\nbest things of life tremble in the balance. This is the situation. Is there a day or an hour\nnearer and better than now &mdash; right now &mdash; to meet the challenge? I believe there is not.\n<\/p><p>\nWhere can we look for the essential virtues our people need with greater hope and assurance\nthan to religion and the prophets? It is there that we find not only the outstanding examples\nbut the most potent factors for cohesion, solidarity, and unity. It is there that loyal devotion\nand self-sacrifice for a cause have been developed and shown their richest fruit. It is there that\nwe have been given the gospel of work, industry, frugality, and thrift. It is there that we have\nbeen taught the virtue of honesty and integrity; and it is there, and there alone, where we have\nlearned the meaning and vitality of faith. Did you ever stop to think where we would be if all\nthe learning, all the concepts, all the morality, all the idealism, and virtue that have come to\nus from the prophets should be swept away and annihilated? It seems to me a moment's\ncontemplation on such an awful state should immediately renew and enhance our appreciation \nof the inestimable contributions which have come to us through divinely inspired men.\n<\/p><p>\nNow I hope you will bear with me as I project a few specific applications of the great\nprinciples and doctrines which have been our heritage to our present situation. We named as\nour first need: Unity. How is it to come? We thought that the terrific shock of Pearl Harbor\nhad brought it. As the weeks passed and the force of the sudden impact subsided, we found\nthat we were mistaken. A hundred incidents which you know, and I have not time to mention,\nbear that out. Selfish interests still dominate much of our internal negotiations and activities.\nIt is vainly pointed out with irrefutable logic that these militate against our efficiency and\nsuccess. What is the answer? Brotherhood &mdash; the fraternity of men taught to us by the\nprophets. I know that some may say it is Utopian and unattainable, yet it is the very thing we\nare announcing in carefully worded charters as the panacea for the ills of the world. Why not\ntry it at home and demonstrate its efficacy before we attempt to spread it abroad? All that it\nentails is mutual consideration and the recognition of humankind as the family of God. The\nlatter is especially important. There are few, if any, stronger cohesive factors than kinship. We\ndo not establish kinship without parentage. We cannot estimate the value of the acceptance of\nGod as a universal Father.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are continually told that self-sacrifice is necessary to our success. Self-sacrifice is of the\nvery essence of the Christian religion. Its history is filled with instances of it. The early\nChristians, the monasterial life of the Middle Ages carried to excess in asceticism, the\nexploring missionaries, and our own Puritan fathers are but a few. This very day is in\ncommemoration of One who gave His life to teach self-sacrifice and altruistic service.\nSacrifice in its finer aspect is a spiritual concept. It elevates spiritual growth above material\ngain. It looks for its reward in things only of enduring worth. This concept, firmly implanted\nin the hearts of the people, is all we need to help us endure cheerfully whatever deprivation\nmay be necessary to aid our country. We need efficiency in all our endeavor. No one doubts\nit. Everyone is clamoring for it. Now efficiency, in the last analysis, has reference to\nmanpower. We speak of efficient machines and efficient organizations and efficient methods,\nbut it is men who make all these. Someone has well said, \"It is not the guns that win decisive\nbattles; it is the men behind the guns.\" Another has said about this crisis, \"It is self discipline\nor slavery.\" I don't intend to take the time to present facts revealed by the physical\nexaminations of our selectees. All of you have reads some of these reports, and you have\ngeneral knowledge of the vast number rejected for unfitness. One caustic critic has said,\n\"America is drunk. How could she be otherwise after having smoked or chewed three hundred\nforty-three million pounds of tobacco and swallowed more than one billion, six hundred\nfifty-four million gallons of malted liquor and one hundred twenty-four million gallons of\nspirituous liquor, nearly two billion gallons of beer and whiskey annually? \"The same article\nconcludes by the assertion, \"America is burning up its energy in pipes, cigars, and cigarettes,\ndrowning it in beer, wine, whiskey, and rum, and smothering it with luxurious living. . . The\nFifth Columnists who are doing America the most harm are the promoters of these . . . great\nevils to the damaging effects of which our military leaders are not yet awake.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIf these statements in any substantial degree represent the truth, what a deplorable calamity\nhas befallen us! Our war enemy himself could scarcely strike more terribly and effectively\nagainst our man power than these arch enemies of the race have already struck. With all the\nexpedients we can devise, it will take years to undo the damage. Never has a more deadly\nfallacy crept into any society than that more narcotics, more tobacco, more whiskey, and more\nlicentiousness will make better armies. This sophistry and diabolical propaganda is not the\nwork of religion and the prophets. It emanates from the enemies of religion and the enemies\nof men and the nation. Thank the Lord for the courage of Gene Tunney and a few others like\nhim who see the far-reaching and disastrous effects of these narcotics, and are brave enough\nto speak out against them and those who perpetrate them on our youth! I believe that the great\nmajority of all the homes in America from which the army boys have come would thank our\nCommander-in-Chief from the bottom of their hearts if he would make an order forbidding\nthe use of such poisons in our military establishments.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a difference it would have made, and would still make to our efficiency, if men would\nbut accept the concepts of the human body given to us by the prophets : &mdash; if they would look\nupon the body as the tabernacle of the spirit which dwells within it, and protect and preserve\nit from abuses and deleterious substances which militate against its organic efficiency. If they\nwould remember that it is an affront to God to violate the purity of these earthly temples of\nthe spirit, I am sure they would be more thoughtful in their care. How precious to the nation,\nnot to mention homes and loved ones, are the bodies of our youth! The revelations through\nthe prophets have told us long ago what is good for them and what is hurtful. Science has\nconfirmed divinely inspired formulas. The laws of health are inexorable. They cannot be\nviolated with impunity.\n<\/p><p>\nSo, in the interest of our boys, in the interest of our country's cause, I humbly appeal to all\nwho love them and to all who are the beneficiaries of their noble service, not to send them\ncigarettes and intoxicating liquors. In the end they will know that you were kind if you help\nthem to conserve their strength and vitality in wholesome, righteous living. Try to help them\nrealize that in the face of danger there is one thing they cannot hazard and that is their souls.\n<\/p><p>\nProphecy and religion supply the one most indispensable element in all our colossal endeavor,\nand that is faith &mdash; faith in the destiny of our democracy, faith in the triumph of righteousness\nover evil, and faith in the worth, the integrity, and the majesty of man.\n<\/p><p>\nWe live in a world of irreverence. Oh, I know that it is true that we have preserved forms of\nworship. Millions are invested in churches and cathedrals, and we in America, as in other\nChristian countries, maintain at great expense much of the formalism and pageantry of\nreligion. I know, too, that there are thousands of good men and women who love God and\nseek to order their lives in conformity with His teachings, but accounting for all these, there\nare relatively few &mdash; so very few &mdash;who have the simple, honest, humble faith to accept the\nWord of God as revealed to and spoken through His chosen prophets.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a great pity that it is so, because out of the words of the prophets we have received not\nonly our most profound understanding of man and the universe, but also the assurances and\npredictions that bring comfort, hope, confidence, joy, and a peace \"which passeth all\nunderstanding\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41218\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41218)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41218)\">Philip. 4:7<\/a><\/span>).\nIt is from the prophets that we learn of the glorious place and distinction\ngiven to man among all God's creations, that he was created in the image of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23455\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23455)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23455)\">Gen. 1:27<\/a><\/span>) and that he\nis not menial, nor low, nor of servile nature, but that he is of high estate, of the noblest\nlineage, endowed with the God-given gift of intelligence, the sublime and supreme investiture\nof both God and man. It is from the prophets that we learn that he is to be free, with the\nvoluntary power of choice, and that this free agency is essential to his development and\nprogression. And it is from the greatest of air the prophets, Jesus Himself, that we learn how\nman is to retain his freedom, for He said, \"... Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall\nmake you free\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27083\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27083)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27083)\">John 8:32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a difference it would make in the world today if only the people believed the prophets\nand knew these truths! Had we accepted their spiritual reality and the verity of their messages,\nthe tragedy that envelops the world today would never have been. But we thought it was\nchildish to believe in them. We looked upon them as visionary men whose words had no\nimport for our day. We didn't believe in a higher power that could look through the vista of\ntime and foresee the tragic things that would come to men out of their perversity, their\negotism, and their sin. We ignored all the warnings, and we laughed in the faces of these\nsolemn messengers from On High, because we wanted fun and lightheartedness and vanity\nand hundreds of other things to distract us from the serious things of life.\n<\/p><p>\nHow unfortunate it is that we did not recognize that there is no lasting happiness and peace\nexcept in goodness, and that the ways of God, the ways in which the prophets tried to lead us,\nare the only ways to joy and safety.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we had but followed the prophecies, we would have known from the very beginning of our\nnation that one of old had said that \"... this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall\npossess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under\nheaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22147\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22147)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22147)\">Ether 2:12<\/a><\/span>). Had we had that\nknowledge and believed it, we should have known all along where to have put our trust and\nwhat the course of our lives should be. There would have been no anxiety or misgivings\nconcerning the future of our beloved America, and there would be none now, could we but\nquickly come to the truth and accept the divine word.\n<\/p><p>\nI need not argue that it is the province of religion to bring to pass an acceptance of the\nprophecies. They are the constitution of the kingdom of God. No man truly enters into the\nkingdom who does not believe and follow the prophets.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is fortunate indeed that so many admire the teachings of Christ &mdash; kindness, mercy,\ntolerance, forgiveness, and the doctrine of the good neighbor, and altruistic service &mdash; but I\nfear that there are many who worship at the shrine of His teachings and attributes but deny\nthe sovereignty of the King. True religion teaches us that the most acceptable homage we can\nrender to the Savior is to acknowledge Him as God and pay Him the tribute of a good life.\nNo praise, no adoration can be substituted for this. One gift only is adequate, and that is the\ngiving of one's self.\n<\/p><p>\nNow it would seem that we have a long way to go to reach the goals the prophets have set\nfor us. We truly have. But there will never be a more propitious time to start the journey than\nnow. We need not be discouraged because the road seems long and hard. It will never be\neasier. We ought to feel happy that the promises which were given so long ago are still held\nout to us, and happy too that in spite of our mistakes of the past, through mercy, there is yet\ntime to turn from mistaken and unprofitable ways and direct the course of our lives, both\nindividual and national, into the straight ways that lead to truth and peace and security.\n<\/p><p>\nMy friends, I would not willingly give offense to a single soul this Easter day. I recognize the\nright of every man to his own views and opinions. What I have said has been prompted by\nlove of country and my fellow men. More than anything else I desire the blessings of God to\nattend our beloved America and the lofty causes for which she stands. I am sure that it is the\nburden of every prayer which is offered that our nation shall come to victory and glorious\ntriumph. My convictions, however, constrain me to say to you that it is the prayers of the\nrighteous which will be heard. Our Father exacts a contrite heart and a pure life for the\nbestowal of His blessings. It is for these I plead. If these are given, He will cause all the rest\nto follow. Oh, God, grant that it may be so!\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
