I think that when the Lord dwelt in the city of Enoch, without question he spoke in their congregations; and when in due course he will reign in millennial splendor on the earth, he will do exactly the same thing again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/think-on-these-things.p6\" class=\"\">But we also operate under the principle that the word of eternal truth which is given to the children of men, whether it comes by his own voice or the voice of his servants, it is the same. And I had it impressed upon me, when President Lee opened the conference yesterday, and again when President Romney bore the persuasive and powerful and true witness that has just come from his lips, that if the Lord himself were here, those statements which came from them are the very things that he would say at this time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/think-on-these-things.p7\" class=\"\">These brethren who stand in the First Presidency of the Church are the Lord\u2019s agents, his representatives.

I desire, if I may be so guided, to counsel the Latter-day Saints to take an affirmative, wholesome attitude toward world and national conditions; to turn their backs on everything that is evil and destructive; to look for that which is good and edifying in all things; to praise the Lord for his goodness and grace in giving us the glories and wonders of his everlasting gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/think-on-these-things.p9\" class=\"\">In view of all that prevails in the world, it might be easy to center our attention on negative or evil things, or to dissipate our energies on causes and enterprises of doubtful worth and questionable productivity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/think-on-these-things.p10\" class=\"\">I am fully aware of the divine decree to be actively engaged in a good cause; of the fact that every true principle which works for the freedom and blessing of mankind has the Lord\u2019s approval; of the need to sustain and support those who espouse proper causes and advocate true principles\u2014all of which things we also should do in the best and most beneficial way we can. The issue, I think, is not <span class=\"emphasis\">what <\/span>we should do but <span class=\"emphasis\">how <\/span>we should do it; and I maintain that the most beneficial and productive thing which Latter-day Saints can do to strengthen every good and proper cause is to live and teach the principles of the everlasting gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/think-on-these-things.p11\" class=\"\">There may be those who have special gifts and needs to serve in other fields, but as far as I am concerned, with the knowledge and testimony that I have, there is nothing I can do for the time and season of this mortal probation that is more important than to use all my strength, energy and ability in spreading and perfecting the cause of truth and righteousness, both in the Church and among our Father\u2019s other children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/think-on-these-things.p12\" class=\"\">I think the Latter-day Saints have a great obligation pressing in upon them to rejoice in the Lord, to praise him for his goodness and grace, to ponder his eternal truths in their hearts, and to set their hearts on righteousness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/think-on-these-things.p13\" class=\"\">Now for a text I take these words of Isaiah, words which he addressed to us, to the House of Israel, to the members of the Lord\u2019s Kingdom.

God is no respecter of persons. He esteemeth all flesh alike; and those only who keep his commandments find special favor with him. Salvation is free; it cannot be purchased with money; and those only are saved who abide the law upon which its receipt is predicated.

We must take an affirmative, wholesome approach to all things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/think-on-these-things.p23\" class=\"\">There is an eternal law, ordained by God himself before the foundations of the world, that every man shall reap as he sows. If we think evil thoughts, our tongues will utter unclean sayings. If we speak words of wickedness, we shall end up doing the works of wickedness. If our minds are centered on the carnality and evil of the world, then worldliness and unrighteousness will seem to us to be the normal way of life. If we ponder things related to sex immorality in our minds, we will soon think everybody is immoral and unclean and it will break down the barrier between us and the world. And so with every other unwholesome, unclean, impure, and ungodly course.

Brother Packer yesterday pleaded with eloquence that we sing the songs of Zion in order to center our thoughts on wholesome things. I would like to add that we can also\u2014after we have had the opening song\u2014call on ourselves to preach a sermon. I have preached many sermons walking along congested city streets, or tramping desert trails, or in lonely places, thus centering my mind on the Lord\u2019s affairs and the things of righteousness; and I might say they have been better sermons than I have ever preached to congregations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/think-on-these-things.p28\" class=\"\">If we are going to work out our salvation, we must rejoice in the Lord.
