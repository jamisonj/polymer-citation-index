Miraculous advances in medicine, science, and technology have improved the quality of life for many. Yet there is also evidence of great human suffering and distress. In addition to wars and rumors of wars, an increase in natural disasters\u2014including floods, fires, earthquakes, and disease\u2014is impacting the lives of millions worldwide.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/the-law-of-the-fast-a-personal-responsibility-to-care-for-the-poor-and-needy.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">Church leadership is aware of and vigilant regarding the well-being of God\u2019s children everywhere.

I cannot think of any law, any commandment, which, if kept faithfully, is easier to keep and which provides greater blessings than the law of the fast. When we fast and give an honest fast offering, we contribute to the Lord\u2019s storehouse what would have been expended on the cost of the meals. It does not require monetary sacrifice in excess of what would be expended normally. At the same time, we are promised the extraordinary blessings, as previously noted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/the-law-of-the-fast-a-personal-responsibility-to-care-for-the-poor-and-needy.p31\" class=\"\" id=\"p31\">The law of the fast applies to all Church members. Even young children can be taught to fast, beginning with one meal and then two, as they are able to understand and physically keep the law of the fast. Husbands and wives, single members, youth, and children should begin the fast with prayer, giving gratitude for blessings in their lives while seeking the Lord\u2019s blessings and strength through the fast period. Complete fulfillment of the law of the fast occurs when the fast offering is made to the Lord\u2019s agent, the bishop.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/the-law-of-the-fast-a-personal-responsibility-to-care-for-the-poor-and-needy.p32\" class=\"\" id=\"p32\">Bishops, you direct welfare in the ward. You have a divine mandate to seek out and care for the poor. With the support of the Relief Society president and Melchizedek Priesthood quorum leaders, your goal is to help members help themselves and become self-reliant. You minister to the temporal and spiritual needs of members by carefully using fast offerings as a temporary support and as a supplement to extended family and community resources. As you prayerfully exercise priesthood keys and discernment in helping the poor and needy, you will come to know that the correct use of fast offerings is intended to support life, not lifestyle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/the-law-of-the-fast-a-personal-responsibility-to-care-for-the-poor-and-needy.p33\" class=\"\" id=\"p33\">Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidents, you hold keys and have the power to administer in outward ordinances. You work with the bishop and instruct quorum members regarding their duties in the priesthood and in seeking out Church members to give them the opportunity to contribute to the fast. As you Aaronic Priesthood holders magnify your priesthood responsibilities and extend this opportunity to all Church members, you frequently facilitate the promised blessings of the fast to those who may need them the most. You will witness that the spirit of caring for the poor and needy has the power to soften otherwise hardened hearts and blesses the lives of those who may infrequently attend Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/the-law-of-the-fast-a-personal-responsibility-to-care-for-the-poor-and-needy.p34\" class=\"\" id=\"p34\">President Monson has said, \u201cThose bishops who organize their Aaronic Priesthood quorums to participate in the collection of fast offerings will find increased success in this sacred responsibility.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-10911_000_023\">8<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Thomas\u00a0S.

I invite each of us to become more like the Savior by caring for the poor and needy, by faithfully keeping the law of the fast, and by contributing a generous fast offering. I humbly testify that faithfully caring for the poor and needy is a reflection of spiritual maturity and will bless both the giver and the receiver. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3> <li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote1-10911_000_023\"><a name=\"1-10911_000_023\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote1-10911_000_023\">1.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"130125\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130125)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130125)\">Deuteronomy 15:11<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li><li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote2-10911_000_023\"><a name=\"2-10911_000_023\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote2-10911_000_023\">2.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>See<span class=\"emphasis\"> Handbook 2: Administering the Church<\/span> (2010), 2.2.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li><li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote3-10911_000_023\"><a name=\"3-10911_000_023\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote3-10911_000_023\">3.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Handbook 2,<\/span> 6.1.2.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li><li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote4-10911_000_023\"><a name=\"4-10911_000_023\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote4-10911_000_023\">4.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"130126\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130126)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130126)\">Isaiah 58:6\u20137<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li><li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote5-10911_000_023\"><a name=\"5-10911_000_023\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote5-10911_000_023\">5.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"130127\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130127)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130127)\">Isaiah 58:8\u201311<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li><li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote6-10911_000_023\"><a name=\"6-10911_000_023\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote6-10911_000_023\">6.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Harold\u00a0B.
