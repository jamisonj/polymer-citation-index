It will bring love, peace, and joy into your life. It should help you determine to be modest in your dress and in your speech. In the past year or so we have noticed a dramatic change in the way some of our young women are dressing. Styles in clothing change; fads come and go; but if the dress styles are immodest, it is important that our young women avoid them. When you dress modestly, you show respect for your Heavenly Father and for yourself. At this time, when dress fashions are styled after the skimpy clothing some of the current movie and music idols are wearing, it may be difficult to find modest apparel in clothing stores. However, it is possible, and it is important. The Apostle Paul declared: \u201cKnow ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? \u2026 The temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote10-25905_000_040\">10<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44432\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44432)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44432)\">1 Cor. 3:16\u201317<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> You know the truth; live it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/be-thou-an-example.p37\" class=\"\">Finally, you possess a testimony; share it.
