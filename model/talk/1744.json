There is\nbeauty in the mountains, the woods, and the lakes. There is beauty in the sea with its\nnever-ceasing tides; beauty in the skies filled with fleecy clouds, in the sunshine and in the rain;\nbeauty in the morning, the day, and the night. As the seasons come and go, we find beauty in the\nfreshness of spring bringing new life to all nature, and beauty in the glory of the summer.\nAutumn ushers in an array of color before the silent winter brings its blanket of white. There is\nbeauty everywhere if we look for the beautiful.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Order in universe<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThere is an exactness of order in the universe of which we become conscious. The days come\nand the nights follow. The tides rise and fall with regularity, the recurring lunar cycle of the\nmoon is exact; the seasons come and go in the sequence of nature. The stars in the sky follow\nexact repeated orders; the planets and their satellites perform precisely in their relation to their\nsuns. The biologist sees the wonders and the beauty of plant and animal life, and the chemist\ndiscovers the mysteries of the elements of the earth; but with or without scientific training, every\nperson becomes aware of a vast universe in which there is intricate exactness in all nature.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we observe the phenomena of the heavens and the earth, we can come to only one\nconclusion: these are the effects of some great cause. There can be no design without a designer\nand nothing built without a builder. For every effect there is a cause. There must be a guiding\nhand to regulate the universe in its precise order. Are we compelled to admit the reality of a\nSupreme Being? Millions of people in the world have this deep and abiding conviction.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Finding God as a reality<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIs God a creation of man's mind, or is man a creation of God? Men struggle with many\nfundamental questions, but the question as to whether or not God is a reality should take\nprecedence. The approach to the solution of this query differs from that given to scientific\nresearch. We are not dealing with a subject of the material realm, but rather of the spiritual.\n<\/p><p>\nIn order to find God as a reality, we must follow the course which he pointed out for the quest.\nThe path is one that leads upward; it takes faith and effort, and is not the easy course. For this\nreason many men will not devote themselves to the arduous task of proving to themselves the\nreality of God. On the contrary, some take the easy path and deny his existence or merely follow\nthe doubter's course of uncertainty. These are the atheists, infidels, free thinkers, skeptics, and\nagnostics.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Research of history<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe approach to the study of most subjects consists of the research of its history and all of the\nknown facts. If we start with history and turn to the commencement of the best known of the\nancient records, we read these words: \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23802\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23802)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23802)\">Gen. 1:1<\/a><\/span>) This statement forms the basis of the Hebrew belief in the creation, that earth did not\ncome about by chance; neither was it created by accident. It is the intentional creation of a\nSupreme Being for a definite and meaningful purpose.\n<\/p><p>\nMust we accept blindly this statement of creation? The writer of these words in the Pentateuch\ndid not witness the Creator at work but had the same conviction of faith as expressed at a later\ntime by the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews in these words: \"Now faith is the substance of\nthings hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24402\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24402)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24402)\">Heb. 11:1<\/a><\/span>) Sometimes faith means believing\na thing to be true where the evidence is not sufficient to establish knowledge. We must continue\nthe probe and follow the admonition: \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;\nknock, and it shall be opened unto you: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it\nshall be opened.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35999\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35999)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35999)\">Matt. 7:7-8<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Communication with God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAfter announcing that God created the heaven and the earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23803\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23803)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23803)\">Gen. 1:1<\/a><\/span>), the Old Testament relates that God\nconversed with our first parents, Adam and Eve, in the Garden of Eden. He gave them\ncommandments and he conversed with them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23810\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23810)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23810)\">Gen. 3:8-24<\/a><\/span>). No doubt Adam instructed his descendants,\nthrough eight generations to the father of Noah, in the things he had received from God by direct\nmanifestations (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39359\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39359)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39359)\">Moses 5:4-12<\/a><\/span>).\nNoah had direct communication with God and taught ten generations of his\ndescendants. God appeared personally to Abraham\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7271\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7271)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7271)\">Abr. 3:11<\/a><\/span>), who followed,\nas well as to Isaac (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23820\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23820)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23820)\">Gen. 26:1-5<\/a><\/span>)\nand Jacob (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23821\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23821)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23821)\">Gen. 32:30<\/a><\/span>).\nMoses became the leader of their descendants, and we remember the direct communion between\nGod and Moses (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22822\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22822)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22822)\">Ex. 33:11<\/a><\/span>),\nthe record of which has been preserved for all following generations.\n<\/p><p>\nThe New Testament also has recorded appearances of God. At the baptism of Jesus by John,\nthere was a manifestation; \"And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in\nwhom I am well pleased.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35973\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35973)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35973)\">Matt. 3:17<\/a><\/span>) And again at the transfiguration on the high mountain: \". .\n. a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my\nbeloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36019\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36019)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36019)\">Matt. 17:5-6<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nThese are only a few instances of the many appearances of God to his children as recorded in the\nOld and the New Testament. The scriptures of the western hemisphere also record\ncommunications of God. History amply documents the reality of God by his personal dealings\nwith men from generation to generation from the beginning.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Reason gives evidence<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe need not rely upon history alone for evidence of the existence of a Supreme Being;\nreasoning will also give us such evidence. One of the ancient arguments of the marketplace, put\nin syllogistic form, is this: Everything that is created has a creator. The earth was created;\ntherefore, the earth has a creator. Referring again to the Epistle to the Hebrews, the writer states\nin these words that God is the creator of the earth: \"For every house is builded by some man; but\nhe that built all things is God.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24396\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24396)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24396)\">Heb. 3:4<\/a><\/span>) The moving universe and all of its beauties and\nwonders are trying to teach us of the existence of God as the great creator.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Truth-seeker seeks cause<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nA scholar has said, \". . . though science has done all these things for man it cannot do for him\nwhat he only can do for himself. Science can teach but the individual only can learn, that is,\nlearning is an individual process that a person must apply to himself, no one can do it for him.\nNo person can learn for another. Science generally teaches there is a God, does it not? but to\n<i>discover<\/i> him is a problem for the individual to solve. The declaration of the atheist that there is\nno God proves nothing. He may sincerely believe we have no Father in Heaven, but certainly\ncannot <i>prove<\/i> there is none. Yes, we know that he does not know because there are individuals\nwho positively testify they do know.\" (Joseph F. Merrill, <i>The Truth-Seeker and Mormonism<\/i>, pp.\n104-105.)\n<\/p><p>\nIt has been said that God cannot be found with the instruments of science or in modern-day\nelectronics. The truth-seeker, however, cannot overlook an underlying power so overwhelming\nto the conscience that the existence of a Supreme Being becomes evident if he seeks for the\ncause of the effect.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Innate urge to worship<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMan has an innate urge to worship. In early times God spoke to Israel: \"I am the Lord thy God,\nwhich have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have\nno other gods before me.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22815\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22815)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22815)\">Ex. 20:2-3<\/a><\/span>) There is profound truth in the doctrine that runs all the\nway through sacred history that no man can worship more than one God. To worship one God is\nto have one supreme loyalty in one's life. If we had a consciousness of one God, the Eternal\nFather, we would have a consciousness of one world and one mankind under God, all being\nbrothers.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat causes people to have the urge to worship? There seems to be something inborn into the\nsoul of man that causes him to seek communion with God. In the Book of Job it is put this way:\n\"But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26740\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26740)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26740)\">Job 32:8<\/a><\/span>) This statement appears to be an allusion to man's creation. By this spirit he becomes\ncapable of understanding and reason, and consequently of discerning divine truth. By this spirit\nhe comes to know God.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Knowledge through revelation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn addition to the historical evidences of God and the human reasoning of his existence, the\nsurest knowledge of him comes through his revelations. From the beginning and throughout Old\nTestament and New Testament times, God manifested himself to men: first to Adam, then the\npatriarchs of his posterity to Noah, with whom he spoke and conversed. After Noah, he revealed\nhimself to those who followed: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and the prophets down to the\nministry of Christ. He spoke at the time of the baptism of Jesus and also at his transfiguration.\n<\/p><p>\nGod revealed himself to the leader of the group of people who left the old world at the time of\nthe Tower of Babel and came to the western hemisphere. Six hundred years before Christ, he\nspoke to Lehi, directing him and his family to journey to the American continent. God has\nrevealed himself in the present dispensation to the youth, Joseph Smith, who was privileged to\nbehold God the Eternal Father and his Son, Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nThus there have been revealed to man through the ages the personages comprising the Godhead:\nGod the Eternal Father, Jesus Christ, his Son, and the Holy Ghost. These three are referred to in\nChristendom as the Trinity, yet they are three distinct personages, as demonstrated on the\noccasion of the baptism of Jesus, when the voice of the Father was heard and the Holy Ghost\ndescended. (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35972\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35972)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35972)\">Matt. 3:16-17<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Learning requires effort<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt is the general rule that we do not get things of value unless we are willing to pay a price. The\nscholar does not become learned unless he puts forth the work and effort to succeed. If he is not\nwilling to do so, can he say there is no such thing as scholarship? Musicians, mathematicians,\nscientists, athletes, and skilled people in many fields spend years in study, practice, and hard\nwork to acquire their ability. Can others who are not willing to make the effort say there are no\nsuch things as music, mathematics, science, or athletics? It is just as foolish for man to say there\nis no God simply because he has not had the inclination to seek him.\n<\/p><p>\nHistory tells us there is a God. Science confirms the fact there is a Supreme Being. Human\nreasoning persuades us that there is a God. His own revelations to man leave no doubt as to his\nexistence. In order for an individual to obtain unwavering knowledge of the reality of God, he\nmust live the commandments and the doctrines announced by the Savior during his personal\nministry. \"Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any\nman will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of\nmyself.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28576\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28576)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28576)\">John 7:16-17<\/a><\/span>) In other words, those who are willing to make the search, apply\nthemselves, and do God's will, will have the knowledge come to them of the reality of God.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A divine plan<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhen a man has found God and understands his ways, he learns that nothing in the universe\ncame by chance, but all things resulted from a divinely prearranged plan. What a rich meaning\ncomes into his life! Understanding which surpasses worldly learning is his, the beauties of the\nworld become more beautiful, the order of the universe becomes more meaningful, and all of\nGod's creations are more understandable as he witnesses God's days come and go and the\nseasons follow each in their order. If all men could find God and follow his ways, the hearts of\nmen would be turned in love toward their brothers, and nations would be at peace.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear my witness that God lives, that he is our eternal Heavenly Father. I know that Jesus is the\nChrist, his Son, and Savior of the world. I know too that God reveals his will to his prophets\ntoday as he did in the dispensations of the past. May we seek God with a true desire to know\nhim, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
