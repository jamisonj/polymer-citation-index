We viewed its restoration. We gazed from West Berlin to East Berlin, now one Berlin, and reflected on the events which followed the wall\u2019s demise: a new mission of the Church established in Poland, another in Hungary, yet another in Greece, and a mission reestablished in Czechoslovakia. And now, official recognition of our Leningrad Branch in the Soviet Union. Who, except the Lord Himself, could have foreseen these historic events? It was He who declared, \u201cThis gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37357\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37357)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37357)\">Matt. 24:14<\/a><\/span>.)

In its gleaming glory, the temple seems to beckon to each who views its splendor, \u201cCome! Come to the house of the Lord.

First they thronged to the public open house, where reverently and quietly they viewed the interior of the temple and learned the purpose for its erection and of the blessings which the temple can provide.

From her hospital bed, which was wheeled into the celestial room, she not only basked in the spirit found there, but she also helped to provide that spirit.

In the revelation we now know as the 100th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord counseled: \u201cVerily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my friends Sidney and Joseph, your families are well; they are in mine hands, \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cTherefore, follow me, and listen to the counsel which I shall give unto you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, \u2026 I have much people in this place, in the regions round about; and an effectual door shall be opened \u2026 in this eastern land.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19299\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19299)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19299)\">D&amp;C 100:1\u20133<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p19\" class=\"\">Toward the people, the Prophet evidenced the same kind feelings that the Lord had shown to him and Sidney Rigdon.

Pratt went to Canada following a great prophecy uttered by Heber C. Kimball in which Brother Pratt was instructed to go to Toronto. He was told that he would there find people waiting for him who would receive the gospel, and that from there the gospel would spread into England, where a great work would be done. In Toronto he found President John Taylor, the Fieldings, and many others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p21\" class=\"\">In August of the next year, 1837, the Prophet Joseph Smith, with Sidney Rigdon and Thomas B.

He said: \u201cThis was as great a treat to me as I ever enjoyed.

From his journal, we learn of the family\u2019s experience in Canada during the year 1843.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p26\" class=\"\">Robert Gardner describes the day of their baptism: \u201cWe went about a mile and a half into the woods to find a suitable stream. We cut a hole through ice eighteen inches thick. My brother William baptized me. \u2026 I was confirmed while sitting on a log beside the stream. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cI cannot describe my feelings at the time and for a long time afterwards. I felt like a little child and was very careful of what I thought or said or did lest I might offend my Father in Heaven. Reading the Scriptures and secret prayer occupied my leisure time. I kept a pocket Testament constantly with me. When something on a page impressed me supporting Mormonism, I turned down a corner. Soon I could hardly find a desired passage. I had nearly all the pages turned down. I had no trouble believing the Book of Mormon. Everytime I took the book to read I had a burning testimony in my bosom of its truthfulness.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p28\" class=\"\">Archibald Gardner added: \u201c[My] mother \u2026 [accepted] the Gospel at once and whole heartedly, after hearing it. \u2026 Not long after contacting the new faith she became desperately ill, so ill that her life was despaired of. She insisted on being baptized. The neighbors said that if we put her in the water they would have us tried for murder as she would surely die. Nevertheless, well bundled up, and tucked into a sleigh, we drove her two miles to the place appointed. Here a hole was cut in the ice and she was baptized in the presence of a crowd of doubters who had come to witness her demise. She was taken home. Her bed was prepared but she said, \u2018No, I do not need to go to bed. I am quite well.\u2019 And she was.\u201d (Delilah G.

During the period 1959 to 1962, my family and I lived in Toronto, where I served as the mission president. We are witnesses to the love God has for the Saints in that area. May I describe some of these \u201cnever to be forgotten\u201d events?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p30\" class=\"\">One situation featured the Donald Mabey family. Brother Mabey had moved his family from Salt Lake City to North Bay, Ontario, because of a business transfer by his company. Don was an elder in the Church but had been less than fully active in priesthood callings. He was about thirty-five years of age at the time and had a lovely family. The North Bay Branch was a struggling unit desperately in need of priesthood leadership. When I attended that branch and recognized this fact, I held an interview with Brother Mabey and said to him, \u201cI am calling you to serve in the presidency of the North Bay Branch.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p31\" class=\"\">He replied, \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p32\" class=\"\">I asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p33\" class=\"\">He answered, \u201cI have never done it before.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p34\" class=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s no hindrance,\u201d I responded.

All of his family members have entered temple doors and have received temple blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p36\" class=\"\">Another evidence of faith took place when I first visited the St. Thomas Branch of the mission, situated about 120 miles from Toronto. My wife and I had been invited to attend the branch sacrament meeting and to speak to the members there. As we drove along a fashionable street, we saw many church buildings and wondered which one was ours. None was. We located the address which had been provided and discovered it to be a decrepit lodge hall. Our branch met in the basement of the lodge hall and was comprised of perhaps twenty-five members, twelve of whom were in attendance. The same individuals conducted the meeting, blessed and passed the sacrament, offered the prayers, and sang the songs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p37\" class=\"\">At the conclusion of the services, the branch president, Irving Wilson, asked if he could meet with me. At this meeting, he handed to me a copy of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era,<\/span> forerunner of today\u2019s <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign.<\/span> Pointing to a picture of one of our new chapels in Australia, President Wilson declared, \u201cThis is the building we need here in St. Thomas.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p38\" class=\"\">I smiled and responded, \u201cWhen we have enough members here to justify and to pay for such a building, I am sure we will have one.\u201d At that time, the local members were required to raise 30 percent of the cost of the site and the building, in addition to the payment of tithing and other offerings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p39\" class=\"\">He countered, \u201cOur children are growing to maturity. We need that building, and we need it now!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p40\" class=\"\">I provided encouragement for them to grow in numbers by their personal efforts to fellowship and teach. The outcome is a classic example of faith, coupled with effort and crowned with testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p41\" class=\"\">President Wilson requested six additional missionaries to be assigned to St. Thomas. When this was accomplished, he called the missionaries to a meeting in the back room of his small jewelry store, where they knelt in prayer. He then asked one elder to hand to him the yellow-page telephone directory, which was on a nearby table. President Wilson took the book in hand and observed, \u201cIf we are ever to have our dream building in St. Thomas, we will need a Latter-day Saint to design it. Since we do not have a member who is an architect, we will simply have to convert one.\u201d With his finger moving down the column of listed architects, he paused at one name and said, \u201cThis is the one we will invite to my home to hear the message of the Restoration.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p42\" class=\"\">President Wilson followed the same procedure with regard to plumbers, electricians, and craftsmen of every description. Nor did he neglect other professions, feeling a desire for a well-balanced branch. The individuals were invited to his home to meet the missionaries, the truth was taught, testimonies were borne and conversion resulted. Those newly baptized then repeated the procedure themselves, inviting others to listen, week after week and month after month.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p43\" class=\"\">The St. Thomas Branch experienced marvelous growth. Within two and one-half years, a site was obtained, a beautiful building was constructed, and an inspired dream became a living reality. That branch is now a thriving ward in a stake of Zion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p44\" class=\"\">When I reflect on the town of St. Thomas, I dwell not on the ward\u2019s hundreds of members and many dozens of families; rather, in memory I return to that sparse sacrament meeting in the lodge-hall basement and the Lord\u2019s promise, \u201cWhere two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37347\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37347)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37347)\">Matt. 18:20<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p45\" class=\"\">Temples like the Toronto Temple are built with stone, glass, wood, and metal. But they are also a product of faith and an example of sacrifice. The funds to build temples come from all tithe payers and consist of the widow\u2019s mite, children\u2019s pennies, and workmen\u2019s dollars\u2014all sanctified by faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p46\" class=\"\">Whenever I attend a temple dedication, I think of Brother and Sister Gustav and Margarete Wacker of Kingston, Ontario. He was once the branch president of the Kingston Branch. He was from the old country. He spoke English with a thick accent. He never owned or drove a car. He plied the trade of a barber. He made but little money cutting hair near an army base at Kingston. How he loved the missionaries! The highlight of his day would be when he had the privilege to cut the hair of a missionary. Never would there be a charge. When they would make a feeble attempt to pay him, he would say, \u201cOh no; it is a joy to cut the hair of a servant of the Lord.\u201d Indeed, he would reach deep into his pockets and give the missionaries all of his tips for the day. If it were raining, as it often does in Kingston, President Wacker would call a taxi and send the missionaries to their apartment by cab, while he, himself, at day\u2019s end would lock the small shop and walk home\u2014alone in the driving rain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p47\" class=\"\">I first met Gustav Wacker when I noticed that his tithing was far in excess of that expected from his potential income. My efforts to explain to him that the Lord required no more than a tenth fell on attentive but unconvinced ears. He simply responded that he loved to pay all he could to the Lord. It amounted to about a third of his income. His dear wife felt exactly as he did. Their unique manner of tithing payment continued.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p48\" class=\"\">Gustav and Margarete Wacker established a home that was a heaven. They were not blessed with children but mothered and fathered their many Church visitors. A sophisticated and learned Church leader from Ottawa told me, \u201cI like to visit the Wacker home. I come away refreshed in spirit and determined to ever live close to the Lord.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p49\" class=\"\">Did our Heavenly Father honor such abiding faith? The branch prospered. The membership outgrew the rented Slovakian Hall where they met and moved into a modern and lovely chapel of their own to which the branch members had contributed their share and more, that it might grace the city of Kingston. President and Sister Wacker had their prayers answered by serving a proselyting mission to their native Germany and later a temple mission to that beautiful temple in Washington, D.C. Then, in 1983, his mission in mortality concluded, Gustav Wacker peacefully passed away while being held in the loving arms of his eternal companion, dressed in his white temple suit, there in the Washington Temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/days-never-to-be-forgotten.p50\" class=\"\">All of this history and much more crowded my mind during the dedication services of the Toronto Temple. I reflected on the many nationalities represented by our members there.
