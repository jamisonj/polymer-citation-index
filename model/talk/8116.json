Here are just a few.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">The Church of Jesus Christ has always been led by living prophets and apostles. Though mortal and subject to human imperfection, the Lord\u2019s servants are inspired to help us avoid obstacles that are spiritually life threatening and to help us pass safely through mortality to our final, ultimate, heavenly destination.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">During my nearly 40 years of close association, I have been a personal witness as both quiet inspiration and profound revelation have moved to action the prophets and apostles, the other General Authorities, and the auxiliary leaders. While neither perfect nor infallible, these good men and women have been perfectly dedicated to leading the work of the Lord forward as He has directed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">And make no mistake about it: the Lord directs His Church through living prophets and apostles. This is the way He has always done His work. Indeed, the Savior taught, \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-12461_000_011\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131025\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131025)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131025)\">John 13:20<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> We cannot separate Christ from His servants.

They forget that the Lord\u2019s grace is sufficient to accomplish His work through mortals. Our leaders have the best intentions, but sometimes we make mistakes. This is not unique to Church relationships, as the same thing occurs in our relationships among friends, neighbors, and workplace associates and even between spouses and in families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">Looking for human weakness in others is rather easy. However, we make a serious mistake by noticing only the human nature of one another and then failing to see God\u2019s hand working through those He has called.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">Focusing on how the Lord inspires His chosen leaders and how He moves the Saints to do remarkable and extraordinary things despite their humanity is one way that we hold on to the gospel of Jesus Christ and stay safely aboard the Old Ship Zion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">A second truth is the doctrine of the plan of salvation. Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, God gave the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and many additional teachings to the Church. These include a knowledge of the plan of salvation, which is a map of where we came from, our purpose here on earth, and where we are going when we die. The plan also provides us with a unique, eternal perspective that we are God\u2019s spirit children. By understanding who our Heavenly Father is and our relationship to Him and to His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, we will accept Their commandments and make covenants with Them that will lead us back into Their eternal presence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">Every time I hold a newborn child, I find myself wondering: \u201cWho are you, little one? What will you become through the Atonement of Christ?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">We ask similarly reflective questions when someone we love dies: \u201cWhere are they? What are they seeing and experiencing? Does life continue? What will be the nature of our most cherished relationships in the great world of the spirits of the dead?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">In that world, our family has two granddaughters, Sara and Emily, and a grandson, Nathan. With each grandchild\u2019s passing, we as a family held on to the gospel truths with both hands. Our questions were answered with comfort and assurance through the Atonement of the Savior. Although we miss our grandchildren, we know they live, and we know we will see them again. How grateful we are for this spiritual understanding\u00a0in times of personal and familial turbulence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p22\" class=\"\" id=\"p22\">Another key truth in the Church is that Heavenly Father created Adam and Eve for a lofty purpose. It was their charge\u2014and, subsequently, the charge of their posterity\u2014to create mortal bodies for God\u2019s spirit children so they could experience mortality. By this process, Heavenly Father sends His spirit children to earth to learn and grow through the experiences of earth life. Because He loves His children, God sends heavenly messengers and Apostles to teach them about Jesus Christ\u2019s central role as our Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">Through the centuries, prophets have fulfilled their duty when they have warned people of the dangers before them. The Lord\u2019s Apostles are duty bound to watch, warn, and reach out to help those seeking answers to life\u2019s questions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p24\" class=\"\" id=\"p24\">Twenty years ago, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles issued \u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World.\u201d In that inspired document, we concluded with the following: \u201cWe warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity, who abuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God. Further, we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-12461_000_011\">5<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> or <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Nov. 2010, 129.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p25\" class=\"\" id=\"p25\">As Apostles, we reaffirm this solemn warning again today.

This helps us remain unspotted from the world, provides us with physical rest, and gives each of us the spiritual refreshment of worshipping the Father and the Son every Sunday.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-12461_000_011\">6<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"131027\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131027)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131027)\">Doctrine and Covenants 59:9\u201323<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> When we delight in the Sabbath day, it is a sign of our love for Them.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-12461_000_011\">7<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"131028\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131028)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131028)\">Isaiah 58:13\u201314<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p27\" class=\"\" id=\"p27\">As part of our efforts to make the Sabbath a delight, we have asked local leaders and Church members to remember that sacrament meeting is the Lord\u2019s and should be rooted and grounded in His teachings. The presentation of the ordinance of the sacrament is when we renew our covenants and reconfirm our love for the Savior and remember His sacrifice and His Atonement.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p28\" class=\"\" id=\"p28\">This same spirit of worship should permeate our monthly fast and testimony meetings. This sacrament meeting is for members to briefly express gratitude, love, and appreciation for our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the restored gospel and to bear personal witness of these things. Fast and testimony meeting is a time to share brief inspirational thoughts and bear solemn testimony. It is not a time to give a speech.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p29\" class=\"\" id=\"p29\">Young children should practice sharing their testimonies in Primary and with their parents in family home evening gatherings until they understand the important meaning of a testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p30\" class=\"\" id=\"p30\">The recent emphasis of making the Sabbath a delight is a direct result of inspiration from the Lord through the leaders of the Church. Ward council members should assist the bishopric several weeks in advance by reviewing music and topics that have been recommended for each sacrament meeting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p31\" class=\"\" id=\"p31\">All of us are blessed when the Sabbath is filled with love for the Lord at home and at church. When our children are taught in the ways of the Lord, they learn to feel and to respond to His Spirit. We will all desire\u00a0to attend each Sunday to partake of the sacrament when we feel the Spirit of the Lord. And all, young and old, who are carrying heavy burdens will feel the spiritual uplift and comfort that comes from a Sabbath day of devoted contemplation of our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p32\" class=\"\" id=\"p32\">Thankfully, Christ is always near, waiting and willing to help us when we pray for help and are willing to repent and come unto Him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p33\" class=\"\" id=\"p33\">Now, as we ponder just these few truths\u00a0that exist within the Old Ship Zion, let us stay on board and remember that, by definition, a ship is a vehicle, and the purpose of a vehicle is to take us to a destination.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p34\" class=\"\" id=\"p34\">Our ship\u2019s destination is the full blessings of the gospel, the kingdom of heaven, the celestial glory, and the presence of God!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/god-is-at-the-helm.p35\" class=\"\" id=\"p35\">God\u2019s plan is in place.
