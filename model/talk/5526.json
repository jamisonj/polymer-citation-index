Before the evening show of dancing and music from various island cultures, I went backstage to thank the performers. I arrived during those frantic moments before the show began. Scores of performers were hurrying through the last-minute tasks required to coordinate their efforts in a fast-moving performance. I wondered how the director would bring this turmoil to order in preparation for my brief remarks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/worship-through-music.p17\" class=\"\">It happened as if by miracle.

Last spring some of our children and fourteen of our grandchildren had a family outing in the mountains. One of our activities was a meeting to share experiences and testimonies. We gathered at the appointed time, but the little people were only gathered in body. The large spirits in those little bodies were clamoring for more of the exciting outdoor activities they had been enjoying. The cabin where we met was too small to contain them, and it seemed as if a dozen restless children and their outcries were ricocheting off the walls in every direction. Grandparents will appreciate the apprehension I felt at trying to sponsor something serious in that setting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/worship-through-music.p19\" class=\"\">Suddenly the instinctive wisdom of young mothers rescued our efforts. Two mothers began to sing a song familiar to the children. Others joined in, and within a few minutes the mood had changed and all spirits were subdued and receptive to spiritual things.

When the Lord\u2019s Apostles meet in modern times, the singing of hymns is still part of their meetings. The weekly meetings of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the Salt Lake Temple always begin with a hymn. Elder Russell M. Nelson plays the organ accompaniment. The First Presidency, who conduct these meetings, rotate the privilege of selecting the opening song. Most of us record the date each hymn is sung. According to my records, the opening song most frequently sung during the decade of my participation has been \u201cI Need Thee Every Hour\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 98). Picture the spiritual impact of a handful of the Lord\u2019s servants singing that song before praying for his guidance in fulfilling their mighty responsibilities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/worship-through-music.p35\" class=\"\">The veil is very thin in the temples, especially when we join in worshipping through music. At temple dedications I have seen more tears of joy elicited by music than by the spoken word. I have read accounts of angelic choirs joining in these hymns of praise, and I think I have experienced this on several occasions. In dedicatory sessions featuring beautiful and well-trained choirs of about thirty voices, there are times when I have heard what seemed to be ten times thirty voices praising God with a quality and intensity of feeling that can be experienced but not explained. Some who are listening today will know what I mean.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/worship-through-music.p36\" class=\"\">Sacred music has a unique capacity to communicate our feelings of love for the Lord.

We in the center stakes of Zion should renew our fervent participation in the singing of our hymns.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/worship-through-music.p50\" class=\"\">There are a few conventions all of us should observe as we worship through music. As we sing we should think about the messages of the words. Our hymns contain matchless doctrinal sermons, surpassed only by the scriptures in their truth and poetic impact.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/worship-through-music.p51\" class=\"\">We depend on our choristers and organists to lead us at the prescribed pace. Too slow or too fast can detract from a worshipful mood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/worship-through-music.p52\" class=\"\">We should be careful what music we use in settings where we desire to contribute to worship. Many musical numbers good for other wholesome settings are not appropriate for Church meetings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/worship-through-music.p53\" class=\"\">Our hymns have been chosen because they have been proven effective to invite the Spirit of the Lord. A daughter who plays the violin described that reality. \u201cI love to play classical music,\u201d she said, \u201cbut when I play our hymns, I can just feel the Spirit of the Lord in my practice room.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/worship-through-music.p54\" class=\"\">Soloists should remember that music in our worship services is not for demonstration but for worship.

This is why we are selective in the kinds of music and the kinds of instruments we use in our worship services. This is why we encourage our choirs to use the hymnbook as their basic resource. We can make selective use of other music that is in harmony with the spirit of our hymns, such as Charles Gounod\u2019s marvelous \u201cO Divine Redeemer,\u201d sung at the funeral of President Ezra Taft Benson. But a hymnbook\u2019s hymn is often the most inspiring and appropriate musical selection for a choir, a vocalist, or an instrumentalist (see Michael F. Moody, <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Aug. 1994, p. 79).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/worship-through-music.p56\" class=\"\">Sacred music can help us even where there is no formal performance. For example, when temptation comes, we can neutralize its effect by humming or repeating the words of a favorite hymn (see Boyd K. Packer, <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Jan. 1974, pp. 25\u201328).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/worship-through-music.p57\" class=\"\">Our hymns can work their miraculous effect even when the chorus of voices is few and even when hardly a sound can be heard. I felt this a few months ago as I participated in a musical performance that was unique in my church experience. I had been invited to speak at the Great Basin LDS Deaf Conference, hosted by the Salt Lake Valley (Deaf) Ward of the Salt Lake Park Stake. Over three hundred deaf brothers and sisters were in attendance. The members of the stake presidency and I were almost the only adults in the congregation who could hear and who attempted to sing audibly. The rest of that large assembly sang with their hands. Hardly a lip moved, and hardly a sound was heard except the organ and four faint voices from the stand. In the audience, all hands moved in unison with the leader as the audience signed \u201cThe Spirit of God like a fire is burning!\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 2). As we sang together, the Spirit of the Lord descended upon us, and we were made ready for prayer. Our sacred music is a powerful preparation for prayer and gospel teaching.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/worship-through-music.p58\" class=\"\">We need to make more use of our hymns to put us in tune with the Spirit of the Lord, to unify us, and to help us teach and learn our doctrine. We need to make better use of our hymns in missionary teaching, in gospel classes, in quorum meetings, in home evenings, and in home teaching visits. Music is an effective way to worship our Heavenly Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. We should use hymns when we need spiritual strength and inspiration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/worship-through-music.p59\" class=\"\">We who have \u201cfelt to sing the song of redeeming love\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10065\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10065)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10065)\">Alma 5:26<\/a><\/span>) need to keep singing that we may draw ever closer to him who has inspired sacred music and commanded that it be used to worship him. May we be diligent in doing so is my humble prayer, which I offer with a testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and of the divine calling of those we have sustained today. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
