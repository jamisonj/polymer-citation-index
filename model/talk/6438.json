The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account.

The conversion we must achieve requires us to be a good husband and father or a good wife and mother. Being a successful Church leader is not enough.

This is achieved not just by doing what is right, but by doing it for the right reason\u2014for the pure love of Christ. The Apostle Paul illustrated this in his famous teaching about the importance of charity (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"42\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42)\">1 Cor. 13<\/a><\/span>).

Finally, in the eleventh hour he sent others into the vineyard, promising that he would also pay them \u201cwhatsoever is right\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33570\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33570)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33570)\">Matt. 20:7<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-challenge-to-become.p31\" class=\"\">At the end of the day the owner of the vineyard gave the same wage to every worker, even to those who had come in the eleventh hour.

For present purposes its lesson is that the Master\u2019s reward in the Final Judgment will not be based on how long we have labored in the vineyard. We do not obtain our heavenly reward by punching a time clock. What is essential is that our labors in the workplace of the Lord have caused us to <span class=\"emphasis\">become<\/span> something. For some of us, this requires a longer time than for others. What is important in the end is what we have become by our labors. Many who come in the eleventh hour have been refined and prepared by the Lord in ways other than formal employment in the vineyard. These workers are like the prepared dry mix to which it is only necessary to \u201cadd water\u201d\u2014the perfecting ordinance of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost. With that addition\u2014even in the eleventh hour\u2014these workers are in the same state of development and qualified to receive the same reward as those who have labored long in the vineyard.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-challenge-to-become.p33\" class=\"\">This parable teaches us that we should never give up hope and loving associations with family members and friends whose fine qualities (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"38130\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38130)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38130)\">Moro. 7:5\u201314<\/a><\/span>) evidence their progress toward what a loving Father would have them become. Similarly, the power of the Atonement and the principle of repentance show that we should never give up on loved ones who now seem to be making many wrong choices.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-challenge-to-become.p34\" class=\"\">Instead of being judgmental about others, we should be concerned about ourselves. We must not give up hope. We must not stop striving. We are children of God, and it is possible for us to become what our Heavenly Father would have us become.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-challenge-to-become.p35\" class=\"\">How can we measure our progress? The scriptures suggest various ways. I will mention only two.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-challenge-to-become.p36\" class=\"\">After King Benjamin\u2019s great sermon, many of his hearers cried out that the Spirit of the Lord \u201chas wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40024\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40024)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40024)\">Mosiah 5:2<\/a><\/span>). If we are losing our desire to do evil, we are progressing toward our heavenly goal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-challenge-to-become.p37\" class=\"\">The Apostle Paul said that persons who have received the Spirit of God \u201chave the mind of Christ\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24)\">1 Cor. 2:16<\/a><\/span>). I understand this to mean that persons who are proceeding toward the needed conversion are beginning to see things as our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, see them. They are hearing His voice instead of the voice of the world, and they are doing things in His way instead of by the ways of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-challenge-to-become.p38\" class=\"\">I testify of Jesus Christ, our Savior and our Redeemer, whose Church this is. I testify with gratitude of the plan of the Father under which, through the Resurrection and Atonement of our Savior, we have the assurance of immortality and the opportunity to become what is necessary for eternal life.
