Afterwards the father stood to bear his testimony. He expressed thanks for this, his first son. He then said in a rather perplexed way that since the little fellow didn\u2019t seem to understand anything they said, he wished he knew just how to communicate with him. \u201cAll we can do,\u201d said he, \u201cis hold him, cuddle him, gently squeeze him, kiss him, and whisper thoughts of love in his ear.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p4\" class=\"\">After the meeting I went up to the new father and said that in his testimony he had given us a success pattern for raising healthy children. I hoped he would never forget it; even as his children grew to maturity I hoped he would continue the practice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p5\" class=\"\">Among the tragedies we see around us every day are the countless children and adults who are literally starving because they are not being fed a daily portion of love. We have in our midst thousands who would give anything to hear the words and feel the warmth of this expression. We have all seen the lonely and discouraged who have never been told.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p6\" class=\"\">A few years ago I had been assigned to tour a mission in another land. Before our first meeting with the missionaries, I asked the mission president if there were any particular problems I needed to attend to. He told me of one missionary who had made his mind up to go home early\u2014he was very unhappy. \u201cCould I help him?\u201d I asked. The president wasn\u2019t sure.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p7\" class=\"\">As I was shaking hands with the missionaries before the meeting, it wasn\u2019t hard to tell which one wanted to leave. I told the president if he didn\u2019t mind I\u2019d like to speak to the young man after the meeting. As I watched him during the meeting, about all I could think of was the big piece of gum he had in his mouth. After the meeting this tall young missionary came up to the stand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cCould we visit?\u201d I asked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p9\" class=\"\">His response was an inference that he couldn\u2019t care less.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p10\" class=\"\">We went to the side of the chapel. We sat together as I gave him my very best speech on why missionaries should not go home early. He kept looking out the window, paying absolutely no attention to me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p11\" class=\"\">Off and on we were in meetings together for two days. One time he even sat on the front row and read the newspaper as I talked. I was baffled and unnerved by him. By now it appeared to me that he should go home\u2014and soon! I\u2019d been praying for a way to reach him for two days, but to no avail.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p12\" class=\"\">The last night after our meeting I was visiting with some folks in the front of the chapel. Out of the corner of my eye I saw the elder. At that very moment I had a feeling about him enter my heart that I had not yet experienced. I excused myself, went over to him, took his hand, looked him in the eye, and said, \u201cElder, I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve become acquainted with you. I want you to know that I love you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p13\" class=\"\">Nothing more was said as we separated. As I started out the chapel door for our car, there he stood again. I took his hand again, put my arm around him, looked up in his eyes and said, \u201cWhat I said to you before, I really mean. I love you; please keep in touch with me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p14\" class=\"\">Spirit communicates to spirit. It was then that his eyes filled with tears and this boy said simply, \u201cBishop Peterson, in all my life I can never remember being told \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p15\" class=\"\">Now I knew why he was confused, disturbed, insecure, and wanted to leave the mission field.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p16\" class=\"\">In speaking of a son or daughter, some will say, \u201cHe ought to know I love him. Haven\u2019t I done everything for him? I buy him clothes, give him a warm home, an education, and so on.\u201d Make no false assumptions: unless the person feels that the need has been filled, the parent\u2019s responsibility has not been accomplished.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p17\" class=\"\">We must make an even clearer effort to communicate real love to a questioning child. The giving of love from a parent to a son or daughter must not be dependent on his or her performance. Ofttimes those we think deserve our love the least need it the most.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p18\" class=\"\">Remember this scriptural admonition to parents: \u201cAnd ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry, or naked; neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the devil, who is the master of sin, or who is the evil spirit which hath been spoken of by our fathers, he being an enemy to all righteousness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cBut ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40440\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40440)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40440)\">Mosiah 4:14\u201315<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-daily-portion-of-love.p20\" class=\"\">May I suggest that parents\u2019 teachings will be listened to more intently and be more closely heeded if they are preceded by and woven together with that golden fiber of love.

At the beginning of this new approach even a glassful could cause a drowning.
