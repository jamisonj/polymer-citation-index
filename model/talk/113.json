Lee, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1944, pp. 84-89<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nAs an example of the doubts and the vain philosophies in the minds of some of our young\npeople I want to read you a few statements contained in an article that appeared in a\npublication from our own state university during the last few weeks:\n<\/p><p>\nA YOUNG STUDENT'S IDEA\n<\/p><p>\nHeaven is for children. To the child's mind it is real. For the adult it belongs to the world of\nfantasy and make-believe. If we have become adults we have left the idea of heaven behind.\nPerhaps the only mature individual who finds the everyday exhilarating and promising is the\none who has supplanted his childhood beliefs in another worldly heaven with confidence in a\nheaven on earth. . . The modern world is concerned chiefly with ethics rather than with\ntheology, with better living than with the methodical analysis of the hereafter.\n<\/p><p>\nI suspect that that young student was thinking of the kind of heaven that too frequently is\npictured, which requires much hymn singing and ever so much praying with rows and rows of\nsaints kneeling in perpetual adoration as a continuous occupation; and perhaps his idea of God\nand the Creator is similar to that which has been expressed by one writer who\nspoke of God as \"a sleepless active energy that actuates all things, so small and yet so\ncomplex as to dwell in the wonderful energies of life and sound and electricity, in the vital\nprocesses of human and animal form, in the motivating influences of the human heart,\" and so\non. Such a one, who believes thus, would have no faith in the teachings of the scriptures or\nan understanding of their import. To one such the Church of Jesus Christ would be relegated\nto a mere organization of man, lacking either the reason for or the authority to administer the\nordinances of salvation.\n<\/p><p>\nHEAVEN A REALITY\n<\/p><p>\nHeaven, as we have usually conceived it, is the dwelling place of the righteous, after they\nhave left this earth life, and the place where God and Christ dwell. Of this happy state the\nApostle Paul said, \"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of\nman the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"105\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 105)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(105)\">1 Cor. 2:9<\/a><\/span>). The location of the place\nwas made clear by the revelations of the Lord to us in this day when he said that the earth\nwas to be the abiding place of those who were to inherit the celestial glory and that it would\nbe cleansed from impurity in order to become that holy place. How the earth was to be\nprepared for that condition is indicated in brief Visions recorded by a prophet who said he\n\"saw a new heaven and a new earth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42169\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42169)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42169)\">Rev. 21:1-4<\/a><\/span>).\nAnother said \"and the end shall\ncome and the heaven and the earth shall be consumed and pass away, and there shall be a\nnew heaven and a new earth\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11963\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11963)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11963)\">D&amp;C 29:23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Joseph, speaking of the condition in which the earth would then be, after that\ncleansing and that purification, in its immortal state, declared that the earth would be as a\ncrystal and a Urim and Thummim unto those who would dwell upon it\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12002\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12002)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12002)\">D&amp;C 77:1<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12058\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12058)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12058)\">D&amp;C 130:9<\/a><\/span>). The interim dwelling\nplace of the spirits, while this great change is taking place, is indicated in the revelation where\nthe Prophet speaks of \"a place of happiness called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace,\nwhere they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care and sorrow\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12003\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12003)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12003)\">D&amp;C 77:2<\/a><\/span>). This rest spoken\nof was not to be a condition of inactivity but rather was to be what the Lord called it, a place\nwhere men and women were to enjoy the \"fullness of his glory\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12006\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12006)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12006)\">D&amp;C 84:24<\/a><\/span>). To say that there would be\nno such a place as the state where one could have rewards or punishments for the things done\nin the flesh, would be to say that there would be no such a thing as a judgment; and to say\nthat there would be no judgment would be to deny that there was atonement for the sins of\nmankind or that Jesus Christ was the author of salvation, the plan by which man could be\nsanctified for that holy state. To say that there was no such a thing as the atonement would be\nto define sin merely as a philosophical formula. If one were to doubt in a life after death or in\na resurrection from the dead, as such a belief would imply, then man would be of all men\nmost miserable (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"121\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 121)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(121)\">1 Cor. 15:19<\/a><\/span>),\nbecause he lacks faith in that which would follow after her life here upon this\nearth.\n<\/p><p>\nI have tried to think how a man would guide his life if he had this sort of feeling and this \ndisbelief in heavenly things. Life, with its fleeting opportunities, it seems to\nme, would be a mad scramble for the satisfying of one's selfish ambitions and the seeking of\nworldly gain. Against that the Master declared himself in a parable where He spoke of the\nman of affluence who was seeking about for a place wherewith to bestow his goods:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I\nbestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods\nlaid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him,\nThou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be,\nwhich thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward\nGod (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31127\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31127)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31127)\">Luke 12:18-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFAITH IN HEAVENLY THINGS AN ANCHOR\n<\/p><p>\nWithout the discipline of the rewards and punishment that are spoken of in the plan of life \nand salvation, passions and appetites would go on unbridled; vice and crime would go on\nunchecked and wickedness would stalk our days. If the Church is but man-conceived, then our\ncare of the needy would not be for the spiritual and temporal welfare of those who are to be\nassisted, but our care would be extended, as is the case with so many public institutions,\nmerely with the political or the social or the economic welfare of the state or of the\nindividuals who administer it as the chief consideration.\n<\/p><p>\nI have a feeling that whenever we have among our leaders those who would say that the care\nof the needy should be left to public institutions and not to the Church, there we have men\nwho lack the spiritual insight into the spiritual values involved in caring for the unfortunate.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the parable of the Savior at the close of the great Sermon on the Mount He taught very\nplainly the doctrine that the storms of life would descend upon the wise as well as the foolish\nand by inference, upon the good as well as the bad, upon the rich and the poor, and that only\nthose would survive, when those tests and trials should come, who had built their house upon\nthe rock, because they had listened to the things which the Lord had taught them concerning\nthe Gospel plan (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33894\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33894)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33894)\">Matt. 7:24-27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn battle those with faith in heavenly things forbid a dangerous fatalism that ofttimes induces\ncarelessness and recklessness in combat as well as in private conduct. The kind of difficulty in\nwhich our young men today find themselves, the terrible struggles through which they are\npassing in battle, is revealed in an interesting bulletin we have just received from one of our\nchaplains down in the Italian area. He starts this bulletin by quoting from President Grant's\ngreat blessing to the boys in the military service some time ago. As I heard President Grant\ndeclare again a blessing upon our boys, I thought how well it would be if the bishops of\nwards and the presidents of stakes who have chaplains or our Coordinators from their stakes\nnow serving with the armed forces would write out that message and ask that they include it\nin their publications so that every boy in the service might have the chance to have the words\nand the power of that blessing.\n<\/p><p>\nEXPERIENCES OF BOYS IN THE ARMY\n<\/p><p>\nHere was the description of some of the conditions of four hundred fifty of our boys who\nwere in that African and Italian area:\n<\/p><p>\nTwo of our brethren in the infantry were killed during the month on the beachhead. The base\ncensor has informed us that their names may not yet be divulged. I recall the last time I saw\nthem. It was at a sacrament service in a make-shift medical dispensary in a town taken a short\ntime previously. One of them administered the sacrament. Our pioneer forefathers used to\nsing, \"And should we die before our journey's through, happy day, all is well. We then are\nfree from toil and sorrow, too, with the just we shall dwell.\" Those appropriate words,\n\"Come, Come Ye Saints,\" seem to particularly apply to our day. It probably will be welcome\nnews that *** who was formerly reported missing in action is now definitely known as a\nprisoner of war in Germany *** is in the hospital convalescing from a shell\nfragment wound in his leg. Lieutenant *** who was referred to last month as being\ngrateful for escaping with his life when a German one hundred fifty millimeter shell struck\nhis truck and failed to explode, is this month spending time in a hospital recuperating from\nthe after-effects of the thunderous jolt. *** has been released for duty again after\nrecovering from an encounter with a shell fragment. *** is still  having his injured foot looked\nafter by the medics but expects to be returned to duty shortly. *** had a brief career on\nwhite sheets while getting over the effects of a mortar  shell piece that crashed through his\nhelmet and grazed his scalp. *** fell down an eight-foot well shaft one dark night recently\nwhile under the range of enemy guns. *** is being treated for shrapnel under the arm.\n*** is being treated for frozen feet. Three other L.D.S. men have been hospitalized for\nminor illness and so on.\n<\/p><p>\nThen he quotes two brief statements from two of our boys who have written from distant\nstations:\n<\/p><p>\nAn artillery shell landed where I had most recently been. I don't know whether it was luck or\ninspiration that caused me to move, but whatever it was I am mighty thankful.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd another said this:\n<\/p><p>\nI have one of those pocket editions of the Book of Mormon. I have just completed reading it\nand let me say it is the best book I have ever read. I was astounded at the wonderful\nprophecies it contained. My testimony has certainly been increased since I read the Book of\nMormon. I can sincerely say the Gospel means more to me than anything else in all the\nworld.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I see the faith that such of our young men are exhibiting I say likewise, thank the Lord\nfor the power of the Gospel that they have had to guide them and keep them safe. I contrast\nthe words written into this statement of the young student, in expressing a disbelief in a\nheavenly reward, with the picture of a young man who stood on the prow of the vessel going\nover toward the invasion coast. As the ship neared the coast within two hours' distance the\nmen were becoming very nervous. The commanding officer was anxious as to the results of\nthe mental strain upon the men. This young man stepped forward and said,\n<\/p><p>\n\"Would you mind if I talk to the boys a few minutes?\" And one who heard his voice wrote\nhome to his father, a business man in the east, not a member of the Church and said, \"Father,\nthat boy talked to us for two hours, just a young man. He told us that even if our lives were\ntaken and we had lived good clean lives, we need not be concerned, because God had a\nreward for the faithful, and we weren't dead actually, but we lived again and our spirits were\nmore active than they could be here in mortality.\" He said, \"Father, when I inquired of that\nyoung man as to who he was, I found that he was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn my home the other night, I had a young man who spent eleven months in the Aleutian\nIslands, discharged because of shell-shock and injuries, recently baptized a member of the\nChurch. He told of having met some of our boys up in the Aleutians, who invited him to\ncome to their Sunday School. He said to me:\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Lee, the nearest thing I can describe in comparison to my feelings as I stood with\nthose boys and worshipped with them, was a feeling I used to have as a little child when I\nclung to the knees of my mother so that I wouldn't fall. Now the Gospel has meant just that\nto me. I cling to it as I used to cling to my mother, so I will not fall.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I saw this young man shattered somewhat and in a highly nervous state, because of the\nrecent shell-shock, and in his physical disability I thought of the many thousands of our boys\nwho may come home to us, some of them maimed and wounded as he, many of them\nwounded in their hearts, hurt in their thinking, and all of them needing sympathetic\nunderstanding and direction. I am asking this body of Priesthood&mdash;are we recognizing our\nresponsibility as Priesthood quorums of the Church to be the stay and the guide of these boys\nas they are now in service and to be that agency that will welcome them back into the\nfraternity of civilian life?\n<\/p><p>\nA PLEA FOR MORE SPIRITUAL FOOD\n<\/p><p>\nAs I thought of my own childhood experience and that which induced faith within me, I\nremember that in our sacrament meetings we didn't expect those from outside the ward to\ncome and speak to us except on special assignment. Every man was expected to prepare\nhimself so that when called he could stand up, as they said, \"and give a reason for the hope\nthat was within him\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2219\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2219)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2219)\">1 Pet. 3:15<\/a><\/span>),\nand I remember their testimonies. I remember their doctrinal discourses.\nI remember how I as a boy, grew upon that kind of spiritual food. I am asking today, are we\npartaking of a modern trend that makes of our sacrament meetings little else sometimes than a\nplace for political discussions or for concerts? This is a place and a time when we ought to do\nmore to teach the plain simple doctrines of the Gospel than we have ever done before. Our\nward teachers should be prepared to go out into the homes of those who have not been\nprivileged to come to sacrament meetings. So in all our activities may we be faithful. May we\nbe as the teachers of Zion. May we be as the Apostle Paul said to the Corinthians:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom,\ndeclaring unto you the testimony of God.\n<\/p><p>\nFor I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in\ndemonstration of the Spirit and of power:\n<\/p><p>\nThat your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"104\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 104)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(104)\">1 Cor. 2:1-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs the leaders of Israel, may we so study and prepare ourselves that we, like the Apostle\nPaul, may preach the doctrines not of the world but the doctrines of the Lord Jesus Christ,\nthat the faith of Israel might not be builded on the wisdom of man but on the power of the\nLord Jesus Christ, I humbly pray in His name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
