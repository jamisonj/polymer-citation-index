First, I refer to the way they believe in the Trinity. When the Prophet Joseph saw his vision, the whole Christian world believed in a God without body, parts, or passions. That means he had no eyes; he couldn\u2019t see. He had no ears; he couldn\u2019t hear. He had no mouth; he couldn\u2019t speak. Moses knew that this condition would prevail, for when he went to lead the children of Israel into the Promised Land, he told them that they would not remain there long, but that they would be scattered among the nations, and that they would worship gods made by the hands of man (that\u2019s man\u2019s doing) that could neither see, nor hear, nor taste, nor smell. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"21311\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21311)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21311)\">Deut. 4:26\u201328<\/a><\/span>.) That\u2019s exactly the kind of a god the whole Christian world was worshipping at the time Joseph Smith had his vision. But Moses didn\u2019t leave it at that. He said in the latter days (and we live in the latter days) that if they would seek after God they would surely find him. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"21312\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21312)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21312)\">Deut. 4:29<\/a><\/span>.) Joseph Smith sought after him and found him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-things-of-god-and-man.p12\" class=\"\">At one time the Prophet Joseph visited the President of the United States, and the President asked him the difference between his church and other churches, and the Prophet said, \u201cWe have the Holy Ghost.\u201d And when one has the Holy Ghost, he is laboring under the divine direction of God, the Eternal Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ. He is not dependent upon the ways of man, and as Paul pointed out, the ways of God are foolishness unto men because they can\u2019t comprehend them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-things-of-god-and-man.p13\" class=\"\">Compare, now, that idea of God with the experience of the Prophet Joseph. As a young man, he went into the woods to pray in answer to the invitation of the apostle James, \u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26286\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26286)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26286)\">James 1:5<\/a><\/span>.) And in answer to his prayer, a light descended from heaven, brighter than the noonday sun, and in the midst of that light were two glorious personages: the Father and the Son. The Father said to Joseph: \u201cThis is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30610\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30610)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30610)\">JS\u2014H 1:17<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-things-of-god-and-man.p14\" class=\"\">And then the Savior of the world, whose right it is to pass judgment upon the right and wrong of all individuals and groups, asked Joseph what he wanted to know, and he asked which of all the churches he should join. The Savior answered that he should join none of them, for they all taught for doctrine the precepts of men. And that is the reason for the thousand churches in the United States today\u2014it is because they follow the precepts of men rather than the revelations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-things-of-god-and-man.p15\" class=\"\">Now I would like to discuss a few of the differences in our concepts. They have changed many of the ordinances. For instance, they no longer baptize as Jesus was baptized when he went to John to be baptized of him. They went down into the waters of the Jordan, and John baptized him, and they came up out of the water. The apostle Paul said there is \u201cone Lord, one faith, one baptism.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21901\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21901)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21901)\">Eph. 4:5<\/a><\/span>.) And if that is true, you\u2019d think that everybody would want to follow the example of the Savior himself when he was baptized by immersion in the River Jordan.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-things-of-god-and-man.p16\" class=\"\">Today little children are sprinkled as infants by their ministers. That isn\u2019t an act of the child himself, it is an act of his parents. John, who was banished upon the Isle of Patmos, saw the great day when the dead, both small and great, would stand before God and would be judged according to the things that were written in the books, according to their works. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"42500\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42500)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42500)\">Rev. 20:12<\/a><\/span>.)
