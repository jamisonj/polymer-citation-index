She went with her family to the open house of the Brigham City Temple in Utah. In one of the rooms of that beautiful building, she looked around and asked, \u201cMommy, where is Jesus?\u201d Her mother explained that she would not see Jesus in the temple, but she would be able to feel His influence in her heart.

In the early years of my career, I worked hard to secure a tenured professorship at Stanford University. I thought I had made a good life for myself and for my family. We lived close to my wife\u2019s parents in very comfortable surroundings. By the world\u2019s standards, I had achieved success. But I was given by the Church the chance to leave California and go to Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho. My lifetime professional objectives might have been a pavilion dividing me from a loving Father who knew better than I did what my future could hold. But I was blessed to know that whatever success I had in my career and family life to that point was a gift from God. And so, like a child, I knelt in prayer to ask what I should do. I was able to hear a quiet voice in my mind that said, \u201cIt\u2019s my school.\u201d There was no pavilion shielding me from God. In faith and humility, I submitted my will to His and felt His care and closeness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/where-is-the-pavilion.p11\" class=\"\">My years at Ricks College, during which I tried to seek God\u2019s will and do it, kept the pavilion from covering me or obscuring God\u2019s active role in my life. As I sought to do His work, I felt close to Him and felt assurance that He knew of my affairs and cared deeply for my happiness. But as they had at Stanford, worldly motivations began to present themselves to me. One was an attractive job offer, extended just as I was finishing my fifth year as president of Ricks College. I considered the offer and prayed about it and even discussed it with the First Presidency. They responded with warmth and a little humor but certainly not with any direction. President Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball listened to me describe the offer I had received from a large corporation and said: \u201cWell, Hal, that sounds like a wonderful opportunity! And if we ever needed you, we\u2019d know where to find you.\u201d They would have known where to find me, but my desires for professional success might have created a pavilion that would make it hard for me to find God and harder for me to listen to and follow His invitations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/where-is-the-pavilion.p12\" class=\"\">My wife, sensing this, had a strong impression that we were not to leave Ricks College. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d But she insisted, wisely, that I must get my own revelation. And so I prayed again. This time I did receive direction, in the form of a voice in my mind that said, \u201cI\u2019ll <span class=\"emphasis\">let<\/span> you stay at Ricks College a little longer.\u201d My personal ambitions might have clouded my view of reality and made it hard for me to receive revelation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/where-is-the-pavilion.p13\" class=\"\">Thirty days after I was blessed with the inspired decision to turn down the job offer and stay at Ricks College, the Teton Dam burst nearby. God knew that dam would burst and that hundreds of people would need help. He let me seek counsel and gain His permission to stay at Ricks College. He knew all the reasons that my service might still be valuable at the college and in Rexburg. So I was there to ask Heavenly Father frequently in prayer that He would have me do those things that would help the people whose property and lives had been damaged. I spent hours working with other people to clear mud and water from homes. My desire to know and do His will gave me a soul-stretching opportunity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/where-is-the-pavilion.p14\" class=\"\">That incident illustrates another way we can create a barrier to knowing God\u2019s will or feeling His love for us: we can\u2019t insist on <span class=\"emphasis\">our<\/span> timetable when the Lord has His own. I thought I had spent enough time in my service in Rexburg and was in a hurry to move on.

While he attended meetings, she walked along the beautiful, empty beach. Her heart ready to burst, she prayed aloud. For the first time, she asked not for another child but for a divine errand. \u201cHeavenly Father,\u201d she cried, \u201cI will give you all of my time; please show me how to fill it.\u201d She expressed her willingness to take her family wherever they might be required to go. That prayer produced an unexpected feeling of peace. It did not satisfy her mind\u2019s craving for certainty, but for the first time in years, it calmed her heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/where-is-the-pavilion.p21\" class=\"\">The prayer removed the pavilion and opened the windows of heaven. Within two weeks she learned that she was expecting a child. The new baby was just one year old when a mission call came to my son and my daughter-in-law. Having promised to go and do anything, anywhere, she put fear aside and took her children overseas. In the mission field she had another child\u2014on a missionary transfer day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/where-is-the-pavilion.p22\" class=\"\">Submitting fully to heaven\u2019s will, as this young mother did, is essential to removing the spiritual pavilions we sometimes put over our heads.
