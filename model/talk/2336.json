These happenings, which occurred many years ago in Jerusalem, are recalled to us by the writings of the New Testament. His death, however, did not bring his personal ministry to a conclusion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/this-is-my-gospel.p5\" class=\"\">An account in the Book of Mormon, a second witness for Christ, gives us additional knowledge of the teachings of the Master.

There was thunder and lightning greater than had ever been known, and earthquakes rocked the earth. The city of Zarahemla was burned by fire, the city of Moroni sank into the sea and the inhabitants drowned, and the city of Moronihah was covered by a mountain. Highways were broken up, other cities destroyed, and many people were slain or carried away by the tempest. The raging storm and devastation continued for three hours, and the face of the whole land was changed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/this-is-my-gospel.p7\" class=\"\">As the tempest ceased, a thick darkness gathered, and for three days no light was seen.
