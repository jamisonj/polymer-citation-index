There are two important things you should know about Eva. One is that she was 11 years old in this story. And the other is that she absolutely, positively did <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> want to go and live with her great-aunt Rose. Not at all. No way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">But Eva\u2019s mother was going to have surgery that required a lengthy recovery. So Eva\u2019s parents were sending her to spend the summer with Great-Aunt Rose.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">In Eva\u2019s mind, there were a thousand reasons why this was a bad idea. For one thing, it would mean being away from her mother. It would also mean leaving her family and friends. And besides, she didn\u2019t even know Great-Aunt Rose. She was quite comfortable, thank you very much, right where she was.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">But no amount of arguing or eye-rolling could change the decision. So Eva packed up a suitcase and took the long drive with her father to Great-Aunt Rose\u2019s house.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">From the moment Eva stepped inside the house, she hated it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">Everything was so old! Every inch was packed with old books, strange-colored bottles, and plastic bins spilling over with beads, bows, and buttons.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">Great-Aunt Rose lived there alone; she had never married. The only other inhabitant was a gray cat who liked to find the highest point in every room and perch there, staring like a hungry tiger at everything below.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">Even the house itself seemed lonely. It was out in the countryside, where the houses are far apart. No one Eva\u2019s age lived within half a mile. That made Eva feel lonely too.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">At first she didn\u2019t pay much attention to Great-Aunt Rose. She mostly thought about her mother. Sometimes, she would stay awake at night, praying with all her soul that her mother would be well. And though it didn\u2019t happen right away, Eva began to feel that God was watching over her mother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">Word finally came that the operation was a success, and now all that was left for Eva to do was to endure till the end of summer. But oh, how she hated enduring!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">With her mind now at ease about her mother, Eva began to notice Great-Aunt Rose a little more. She was a large woman\u2014everything about her was large: her voice, her smile, her personality. It wasn\u2019t easy for her to get around, but she always sang and laughed while she worked, and the sound of her laughter filled the house. Every night she sat down on her overstuffed sofa, pulled out her scriptures, and read out loud. And as she read, she sometimes made comments like \u201cOh, he shouldn\u2019t have done that!\u201d or \u201cWhat wouldn\u2019t I give to have been there!\u201d or \u201cIsn\u2019t that the most beautiful thing you\u2019ve ever heard!\u201d And every evening as the two of them knelt by Eva\u2019s bed to pray, Great-Aunt Rose would say the most beautiful prayers, thanking her Heavenly Father for the blue jays and the spruce trees, the sunsets and the stars, and the \u201cwonder of being alive.\u201d It sounded to Eva as though Rose knew God as a friend.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">Over time, Eva made a surprising discovery: Great-Aunt Rose was quite possibly the happiest person she had ever known!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p22\" class=\"\" id=\"p22\">But how could that be?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">What did she have to be happy about?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p24\" class=\"\" id=\"p24\">She had never married, she had no children, she had no one to keep her company except that creepy cat, and she had a hard time doing simple things like tying her shoes and walking up stairs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p25\" class=\"\" id=\"p25\">When she went to town, she wore embarrassingly big, bright hats. But people didn\u2019t laugh at her. Instead, they crowded around her, wanting to talk to her. Rose had been a schoolteacher, and it wasn\u2019t uncommon for former students\u2014now grown up with children of their own\u2014to stop and chat. They thanked her for being a good influence in their lives. They often laughed. Sometimes they even cried.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p26\" class=\"\" id=\"p26\">As the summer progressed, Eva spent more and more time with Rose. They went on long walks, and Eva learned the difference between sparrows and finches. She picked wild elderberries and made marmalade from oranges. She learned about her great-great-grandmother who left her beloved homeland, sailed across an ocean, and walked across the plains to be with the Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p27\" class=\"\" id=\"p27\">Soon Eva made another startling discovery: not only was Great-Aunt Rose one of the happiest persons she knew, but Eva herself was happier whenever she was around her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p28\" class=\"\" id=\"p28\">The days of summer were passing more quickly now. Before Eva knew it, Great-Aunt Rose said it would soon be time for Eva to return home. Though Eva had been looking forward to that moment since the day she arrived, she wasn\u2019t quite sure how to feel about it now. She realized she was actually going to miss this strange old house with the stalker cat and her beloved great-aunt Rose.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p29\" class=\"\" id=\"p29\">The day before her father arrived to pick her up, Eva asked the question she had been wondering about for weeks: \u201cAunt Rose, why are you so happy?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p30\" class=\"\" id=\"p30\">Aunt Rose looked at her carefully and then guided her to a painting that hung in the front room. It had been a gift from a talented dear friend.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p31\" class=\"\" id=\"p31\">\u201cWhat do you see there?\u201d she asked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p32\" class=\"\" id=\"p32\">Eva had noticed the painting before, but she hadn\u2019t really looked at it closely. A girl in pioneer dress skipped along a bright blue path. The grass and trees were a vibrant green. Eva said, \u201cIt\u2019s a painting of a girl. Looks like she\u2019s skipping.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p33\" class=\"\" id=\"p33\">\u201cYes, it is a <span class=\"emphasis\">pioneer<\/span> girl skipping along happily,\u201d Aunt Rose said. \u201cI imagine there were many dark and dreary days for the pioneers. Their life was so hard\u2014we can\u2019t even imagine. But in this painting, everything is bright and hopeful. This girl has a spring in her step, and she is moving forward and upward.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p34\" class=\"\" id=\"p34\">Eva was silent, so Great-Aunt Rose continued: \u201cThere is enough that doesn\u2019t go right in life, so anyone can work themselves into a puddle of pessimism and a mess of melancholy. But I know people who, even when things don\u2019t work out, focus on the wonders and miracles of life. These folks are the happiest people I know.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p35\" class=\"\" id=\"p35\">\u201cBut,\u201d Eva said, \u201cyou can\u2019t just flip a switch and go from sad to happy.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p36\" class=\"\" id=\"p36\">\u201cNo, perhaps not,\u201d Aunt Rose smiled gently, \u201cbut God didn\u2019t design us to be sad.

And faith led to hope. And faith and hope gave me confidence that one day everything would make sense, that because of the Savior, all the wrongs would be made right. After that, I saw that the path before me wasn\u2019t as dreary and dusty as I had thought. I began to notice the bright blues, the verdant greens, and the fiery reds, and I decided I had a choice\u2014I could hang my head and drag my feet on the dusty road of self-pity, or I could have a little faith, put on a bright dress, slip on my dancing shoes, and skip down the path of life, singing as I went.\u201d Now her voice was skipping along like the girl in the painting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/a-summer-with-great-aunt-rose.p45\" class=\"\" id=\"p45\">Aunt Rose reached over to the end table and pulled her well-worn scriptures onto her lap. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was clinically depressed\u2014I\u2019m not sure you can talk yourself out of that.
