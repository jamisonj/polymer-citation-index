Our testimony of gospel truth should be reflected both in our words and in our deeds. And our testimonies are proclaimed and lived most powerfully in our own homes.

And with active, rambunctious boys, family home evening lessons did not always produce high levels of edification. At times Sister Bednar and I were exasperated because the righteous habits we worked so hard to foster did not seem to yield immediately the spiritual results we wanted and expected.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/more-diligent-and-concerned-at-home.p31\" class=\"\">Today if you could ask our adult sons what they remember about family prayer, scripture study, and family home evening, I believe I know how they would answer.

What they would say they remember is that as a family we were consistent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/more-diligent-and-concerned-at-home.p32\" class=\"\">Sister Bednar and I thought helping our sons understand the content of a particular lesson or a specific scripture was the ultimate outcome.

In fact, if you stand close to the canvas, all you can see is a mass of seemingly unrelated and unattractive streaks of yellow and gold and brown paint. However, as you gradually move away from the canvas, all of the individual brushstrokes combine together and produce a magnificent landscape of a wheat field. Many ordinary, individual brushstrokes work together to create a captivating and beautiful painting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/more-diligent-and-concerned-at-home.p34\" class=\"\">Each family prayer, each episode of family scripture study, and each family home evening is a brushstroke on the canvas of our souls. No one event may appear to be very impressive or memorable. But just as the yellow and gold and brown strokes of paint complement each other and produce an impressive masterpiece, so our consistency in doing seemingly small things can lead to significant spiritual results. \u201cWherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work.
