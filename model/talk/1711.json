Kimball, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1969, pp. 18-23<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay, brethren, brothers and sisters, and friends: \n<\/p><p>\nYou have heard the impressive message of the Prophet of the Lord. May I express the\nhope that you will give heed to his admonitions and follow him on the safe and sure way to\neternal life.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A stirring challenge<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I was a youngster, a Stirring challenge came to me that moved me not a little. I\ncannot remember who issued the challenge nor under what circumstances it came. I remember\nonly that it struck me like a \"bolt out of the blue heavens.\" The unknown voice postulated: \n<\/p><p>\n\"The 'Mormon Church' has stood its ground for the first two generations&mdash;but wait till the\nthird and fourth and succeeding generations come along! The first generation fired with a new\nreligion developed a great enthusiasm for it. Surrounded with bitterness, calumny of a hostile\nworld, persecuted 'from pillar to post,' they were forced to huddle together\nfor survival. There was good reason to expect they would live and die faithful to their\nespoused cause.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The second generation came along born to enthusiasts, zealots, devotees. They were born to\nmen and women who had developed great faith, were inured to hardships and sacrifices for\ntheir faith. They inherited from their parents and soaked up from religious homes the stuff of\nwhich the faithful are made. They had full reservoirs of strength and faith upon which to\ndraw.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But wait till the third and fourth generations come along,\" said the cynical voice. \"The fire\nwill have gone out&mdash;the devotion will have been diluted&mdash;the sacrifice will have been\nnullified&mdash;the world will have hovered over them and surrounded them and eroded\nthem&mdash;the faith will have been expended and the religious fervor leaked out.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Training makes the difference<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThat day I realized that I was a member of the third generation. That day I clenched\nmy growing fists. I gritted my teeth and made a firm commitment to myself that here was one\n\"third generation\" who would not fulfill that dire prediction.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, we are in the sixth and seventh generations from the original Church convert, and\nwe still find stalwarts in most branches of the family, hundreds in the mission fields,\nnumerous others in Church positions of responsibility. And I have come to realize that it is\nnot the generation number which makes the difference but the care and exactness with which\nparents teach and train and fortify their offspring.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Importance of water<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI grew up in a dry country. It seemed to me that hardly ever was there enough rain\nspread over the crop-growing period to carry us through the season&mdash;not enough water in the\nriver to distribute between the many hungry canals and the tens of thousands of thirsty acres,\nnot enough to irrigate all the crops.\n<\/p><p>\nWe learned to pray for rain&mdash;we always prayed for rain.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I was still very small, I knew that plants could not survive in a dry country more than\nabout two or three weeks without water. I knew how to harness up the old mare to a\nlizard&mdash;a forked log on which a barrel was placed&mdash;and I drove the animal to the \"big ditch,\" the\nUnion Canal, which was a block below our home. With a bucket, I scooped up water from\nthe small stream or the puddles and filled the barrel, and the horse dragged it back so I could\npour bucketsful of the precious liquid on the roses, the violets, and other flowers and the\nsmall shrubs and hedges and new trees. Water was like liquid gold, so reservoirs became the\nwarp and woof of the fabric of my life. Around the table, we talked of water, irrigation,\ncrops, floods, hot, dry weeks, and cloudless skies.\n<\/p><p>\nWe used to look for clouds somewhat as did Elijah and his people after the three-year\ndrought.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter the dramatic experience with the prophets of Baal, Elijah had gone to the top of Mt.\nCarmel and had said to King Ahab, \". . . there is a sound of abundance of rain.\" Elijah's\nservant had gone to a high spot and looked for promising clouds. The first six times he\nlooked, returned, and reported, \"There is nothing,\" but the seventh time he reported that there\nwas arising out of the sea a little cloud like a man's hand. Soon, the heavens were black with\nheavy pregnant clouds and \"there was a great rain\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1246\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1246)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1246)\">1 Kgs. 18:41-45<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Dams and reservoirs<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThrough the warm dry summers, we always seemed to be looking for dark, heavy\nclouds. And every year, the clouds did amass, and the thunderstorms did come, and the dry\nwashes did run for a few hours, and the river roared down its channel.\n<\/p><p>\nBut the canals were still empty, and the brush and rock dams were washed down the river by\nthe first raging torrent. Then came the call for the able-bodied men to rush to the heads of the\ncanals to build new dams, to get the canals full before the river water had all\nrun down to the sea. And when working in the flood, hauling brush and trees, rocks and dirt,\nhorses floundered and were sometimes drowned and men had narrow escapes.\n<\/p><p>\nYears later we built aprons of concrete that were protected by rock and wire sausages.\n<\/p><p>\nLater I learned that even dependable diversion dams were not enough. A reservoir was\nneeded&mdash;a high dam that would impound the fall, winter, and spring rains and keep them stored for\nthe later need.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Many kinds of reservoirs<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnd as I pondered, I came to realize that there were reservoirs of many\nkinds&mdash;reservoirs to store water, some to store food, as we do in our family welfare program, some\nlike the barns and bins set up by Joseph in the land of Egypt in which to store the seven years\nof plenty to carry them over the seven years of drought and famine\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23801\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23801)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23801)\">Gen. 41:14-57<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI realized that there should be reservoirs of knowledge to meet the future needs; reservoirs of\ncourage to overcome the floods of fear that put uncertainty in lives; storage of physical\nstrength to help us meet the frequent contaminations and contagions; reservoirs of goodness;\nreservoirs of stamina; reservoirs of faith. Yes, reservoirs of faith so that when the world\npresses in upon us, we stand firm and strong; when the temptations of a decaying world about\nus draw on our energies, sap our spiritual vitality, and seek to pull us down to the level of the\nworldly world, we need a storage of faith that can carry youth through the tantalizing teens\nand through the problems of later years. Faith to carry us over the dull, the difficult, the\nterrifying moments, disappointments, disillusionments, and years of adversity, want,\nconfusion, and frustration.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The work of parents<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnd who are to build these reservoirs? Is this not the reason that God gave to every\nchild two parents?\n<\/p><p>\nWho else but the forebears would clear the forests, plow the land, carve out the futures? Who\nelse would set up the businesses, dig the canals, survey the territory? Who else would plant\nthe orchards, start the vineyards, erect the homes?\n<\/p><p>\nIn his omniscience, our God gave to every child a father and mother to pioneer the way. And\nso it is those parents who sired them and bore them who are expected to lay foundations and\nto hold the hands through the tender years to build the barns and tanks and bins and\nreservoirs.\n<\/p><p>\nDid not the Lord, speaking of parents, say, \"And they shall also teach their children to pray,\nand to walk uprightly before the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15378\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15378)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15378)\">D&amp;C 68:28<\/a><\/span>)?\n<\/p><p>\nIs it not the work of the parents to build so their children can inhabit houses they did not\nbuild; eat the fruit from trees they did not plant and grapes from vines they did not start?\nParents should be soberly about their life's work of building reservoirs and helping to fill\nthem for the children who are yet too small to hoe, or dig, or plow.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Gratitude for parents<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful to my parents, for they made reservoirs for my brothers, my sisters, and\nmyself. They filled them with prayer habits, study, activities, positive services, and truth and\nrighteousness. Every morning and every night, we knelt at our chairs with backs to the table\nand prayed, taking turns. When I was married, the habit persisted, and our new family\ncontinued the practice.\n<\/p><p>\nSome parents are casual or careless or fail to do their duty. These constitute leaks in the\ndams. The story of Peter with his thumb in the dike may be a myth, but the moral is not a\nmyth.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Lehi and Sariah<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nLehi and Sariah built and filled reservoirs for their children. One said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the\nlearning of my father . . . having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of\nGod, therefore I make a record of my proceedings\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1649\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1649)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1649)\">1 Ne. 1:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThough two of the brothers ignored those teachings, using their own free agency, yet\nNephi and others of his brothers were strongly fortified and all their lives could draw heavily\non the reservoir built and filled by worthy parents.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Abraham built reservoir<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAbraham built such a reservoir for his son Isaac, and it seemed never to have leaked\ndry, for we find his son one of the patriarchs and always linked with the God of Abraham,\nthe God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And he seems to fit the words of Jeremiah: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river,\nand shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the\nyear of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26528\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26528)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26528)\">Jer. 17:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Enos' testimony<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJacob, another of the sons of Lehi, drew heavily from the storage inherited from his\nfather, and he passed the same to his son Enos, who bore testimony of it: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I, Enos, knowing my father that he was a just man&mdash;for he taught me in the nurture and\nadmonition of the Lord&mdash;and blessed be the name of my God for it.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk\ndeep into my heart\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21501\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21501)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21501)\">Enos 1:1,3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nEnos asked how such a miracle as forgiveness could possibly come, and the answer came\nfrom the Lord: \"Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard, nor seen\nthy faith hath made thee whole\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21503\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21503)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21503)\">Enos 1:8<\/a><\/span>).\nEnos was able to draw heavily on the reservoir of\nfaith his parents had set up for their children.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Example of two families<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOne day I met a delightful couple&mdash;faithful Latter-day Saints with a splendid family\nand a successful life. They told me of their family history. The husband was one of seven\nchildren of a family of active people, where the Lord was center in their lives. All but one of\nthe seven had remained faithful, filled honorable missions, married in the temple, and had\nsuccessful, happy families, as had their parents before them. The one had strayed and had\nmarital and other serious problems.\n<\/p><p>\nOn the other hand, the wife was one of seven children in a contemporary family where the\nChurch meant little in their lives, and they had bypassed tithing, prayers, and all church\nactivities, and had ignored the spiritual part of their lives. All seven of the children had been\nreared in the same household, subject to the same conditions, and all seven of them but this\none ignored their spiritual obligations, as their parents had done before them.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first parents had built and filled a high, strong reservoir of habits and qualities of faith\nfor their children. Both families had the same community backgrounds.\n<\/p><p>\nThe second family built no reservoir of spiritual strength but depended on the runoff. The\nuncertain little dams, like our brush and rock ones, had washed away when the torrents\nflooded. There were cracks in the dam and leaks in the reservoir. In the one family, six of the\nseven remained righteous; in the other, six of the seven followed the careless ways of the\nparents in unrighteousness and only one of the seven remained faithful.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord had commanded that \"he that observeth not his prayers before the Lord in the\nseason thereof, let him be had in remembrance before the judge of my people\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15382\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15382)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15382)\">D&amp;C 68:33<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd the Lord had also expressed concern and disapproval of his people in Zion who were\nidlers, \"and their children are also growing up in wickedness; they also seek not earnestly the\nriches of eternity, but their eyes are full of greediness\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15380\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15380)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15380)\">D&amp;C 68:31<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Reservoirs of two brothers<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAgain, as I remembered the so-called doomed third and fourth generations, there were\ntwo brothers of the second generation. Both had large families now in the sixth and seventh\ngenerations, running into many hundreds each. The one brother became disgruntled and the\nother remained faithful. The children of the one in their third generation\nbegan to fall away, as did their father. Activity reduced, there were only occasional temple\nmarriages, and few went on missions. Then in the fourth generation, there were no temple\nmarriages, no missions, few baptisms, and very little activity in spiritual things. The fifth\ngeneration deteriorated to rank apostasy. In the sixth generation, with just an occasional\nexception, the whole tribe was estranged from the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nThe ancestor had failed to keep his reservoir intact and full for his posterity to draw upon.\n<\/p><p>\nOn the other hand, the second brother remained faithful all his life and finally \"died in the\nharness.\" His third and fourth and fifth generations have also remained true and faithful with\na few exceptions. The majority of the posterity of the one was out of the faith like the\nparents, and the majority of the other followed the parents into activity and faith. Spiritual\nreservoirs!\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Building good homes<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAn editorial from the Church Section of the <i>Deseret News<\/i> reads: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Good homes must rate high in companionship between children and parents, in having a well\nordered household, with love between parents and between children and parents.\n<\/p><p>\n\"They must build righteous loyalties, good character, a willingness to work, a spirit of\nhumility, and an absence of unjust pride, and they must teach a deep and abiding faith in\nGod.\"\n<\/p><p>\nTo this end, the Lord has inspired his church to place a great new and increased emphasis on\nthat building process.\n<\/p><p>\nEvery family is urged to engage in regular night and morning family prayers and to devote at\nleast one evening a week at home in the sweet family togetherness undisturbed by the world\nor any of its allurements. They will plan to turn off the TV and radio, leave the telephone\nunanswered, cancel all calls or appointments, and spend a warm, homey evening together.\n<\/p><p>\nWhile one objective is reached by merely being together, yet the additional and greater value\ncan come from the lessons of life. The father will teach the children. Here they can learn\nintegrity, honor, dependableness, sacrifice, and faith in God. Life's experiences and the\nscriptures are the basis of the teaching and this, wrapped up in filial and parental love, makes\nan impact nothing else can make. Thus, reservoirs of righteousness are filled to carry children\nthrough the dark days of temptation and desire, of drought and skepticism. As they grow up,\nthe children cooperate in building this storage for themselves and the family. And so we have\nthe home evening and the family prayers and the simple things that have been taught to us all\nour days.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Damaged reservoir mended<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOne day, long ago, we crossed a boundary into a distant city where walls and curtains\nseparated people; and behind the walls, strange ideologies were taught and \"pernicious\ndoctrines\" promulgated every day in the schools and otherwise.\n<\/p><p>\nEvery day the children listened to schoolteachers with foreign and strange doctrines,\nphilosophies, and ideals.\n<\/p><p>\nSomeone said that \"constant dripping will wear away the hardest stone.\" This I knew, so I\nasked about the children:\n\"Do they retain their faith? Are they not overcome by the constant pressure of their teachers?\nHow can you be sure they will not leave you and the simple faith in God?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe answer was unmistakable. \"We mend the damaged reservoir every night,\" they said. \"We\nteach our children positive righteousness so that the false philosophies do not take hold, and\nshould any have taken lodgment in the day, we dislodge them at night. Our children are\ngrowing up in faith and righteousness in spite of the overwhelming pressures from outside.\"\n<\/p><p>\nGenerally, cracked dams can be mended and saved, and sand bags can hold back the flood;\nand reiterated truth, renewed prayer, gospel teachings, a flood of love, and parental interest\ncan save the child and keep him on the right path.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A spiritual umbrella<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI like to compare the home evening, family prayer, and other associated activities of\nthe Church for the saving of the family, when they are conscientiously carried out, with an\numbrella. If the umbrella is not opened up, it is little more than a cane and can give little\nprotection from the storms of nature. Likewise, God-given plans are of little value unless they\nare used.\n<\/p><p>\nThe umbrella spread out makes the silken material taut. When the rain falls, it runs off; when\nthe snow falls, it slides off; when the hail comes, it bounces off; when the wind blows, it is\ndiverted around the umbrella. And in like manner, this spiritual umbrella wards off the foes of\nignorance, superstition, skepticism, apostasy, immorality, and other forms of godlessness.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my prayer that we shall all spread our spiritual umbrellas for protection of our families\nand keep our reservoirs full of faith and integrity; and we can promise that the third and\nfourth generations and indeed the tenth and the fiftieth will still be faithful, worthy, and\nGod-fearing.\n<\/p><p>\nMay this be our happy blessing, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
