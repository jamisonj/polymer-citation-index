The First Presidency has announced that the responsibility for all youth programs rests with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and has given much of the temporal responsibility of the Church to the Presiding Bishopric. We as a Bishopric have enjoyed greatly our association with youth throughout the world, as well as with our associates in the Aaronic Priesthood and Young Women at headquarters. The fact that this change has taken place does not lessen our interest in or love for youth. We continue to feel that the youth of today are a royal generation with a great destiny and pray for the well-being and success of young people everywhere.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/follow-the-living-prophet.p4\" class=\"\">We continue to serve in the Aaronic Priesthood as it pertains to the temporal affairs of the kingdom. Within the past six weeks, I with one of my counselors have traveled to every area of the Church outside the United States and Canada presided over by a General Authority Area Supervisor. As we have become more intimately acquainted with the rapid growth of the Church in many countries, resulting in stress and strain on the temporal organization of the Church and its physical resources, we can clearly see why the Lord inspired his prophet to make the organizational changes he has in recent months.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/follow-the-living-prophet.p5\" class=\"\">I believe herein lies one of the most important and basic principles we should all be aware of.

They were restored by revelation to a prophet\u2014Joseph Smith\u2014and are led by a prophet today\u2014President Spencer W. Kimball. This I know to be true. I am so grateful for this knowledge.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/follow-the-living-prophet.p13\" class=\"\">All of the changes that have taken place during President Kimball\u2019s ministry are the result of revelation, the same revelation the Savior referred to as the foundation stone of his church. With all my heart I, with my counselors, accept President Kimball as a prophet of God and accept his direction in all things, not only willingly but enthusiastically; and we encourage all faithful members of the Church to do likewise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/follow-the-living-prophet.p14\" class=\"\">President Lee on several occasions gave wise counsel with respect to following the living prophet. I should like to quote from one of his Brigham Young University devotional addresses:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/follow-the-living-prophet.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cNow may I make a personal reference, which I\u2019ll try to treat in such a way as to preserve the confidentiality. It involved a beautiful, young wife and mother from a prominent family. She had gone away from her home and was now in the East. She had gone out into an area where she and her husband had taken up with those in the ghetto, and she wrote me a rather interesting letter, and I quote only a paragraph: \u2018Tomorrow my husband will shave off his long, full beard. Because of the request of the stake president and your direction in the <span class=\"emphasis\">Priesthood Bulletin,<\/span> he must not have the appearance of evil or rebellion if he is to get a recommend to go to the temple. I have wept anguished tears; the faces of Moses and Jacob were bearded, and to me the wisdom and spirituality of the old prophets reflected from the face of my own spiritual husband. It was like cutting out for me a symbol of the good things my generation has learned.\u2019 Then the letter concluded with a challenge to me: \u2018We are prepared for clear, specific, hard-line direction as youth. Wishy-washy implications are not heard very well here. We look to you to tell it straight.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/follow-the-living-prophet.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know whether she knew just what she was asking for when she asked me to tell it straight, but these are some things I wrote to her: \u2018In your letter you address me as, \u201cDear President Lee,\u201d and in your first sentence you refer to me as the Lord\u2019s prophet. Now, in your letter you tell me that you are saddened because with the shaving off of the beard and the cutting of the hair, which, to you, made your husband appear as the prophets Moses and Jacob, he would no longer bear that resemblance. I wonder if you might not be wiser to think of following the appearance of the prophets of today. President David O. McKay had no beard or long hair; neither did President Joseph Fielding Smith; and neither does your humble servant whom you have acknowledged as the Lord\u2019s prophet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/follow-the-living-prophet.p17\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018The inconsistency in your letter has made me reflect upon an experience that I had in the mission field when, in company with some missionaries and the mission president, we were at Carthage Jail, where the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph and his brother, Hyrum, took place. In that meeting there were recounted the events that led up to their martyrdom. Then the mission president made some significant comments. He said, \u201cWhen the Prophet Joseph Smith died there were many who died spiritually with Joseph.\u201d Likewise there were many who died spiritually with Brigham Young, and so with others of the presidents of the Church, because they chose to follow the man who had passed on, rather than giving allegiance to his successor upon whom the mantle of leadership had been given by the Lord\u2019s appointment.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/follow-the-living-prophet.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd then I asked her, \u2018Are you following, in looks, prophets who lived hundreds of years ago? Are you really true to your faith as a member of the Church in failing to look to those who preside in the Church today? Why is it that you want your husband to look like Moses and Jacob, rather than to look like the modern prophets to whom you are expressing allegiance? If you will give this sober thought, your tears will dry, and you\u2019ll begin to have some new thoughts.\u2019\u201d (\u201cBe Loyal to the Royal Within You.\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Speeches of the Year,<\/span> Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1974, pp. 97\u201398.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/follow-the-living-prophet.p19\" class=\"\">Another important lesson concerning following the direction of a living prophet can be found in 2 Kings, chapter 5. It tells of a great warrior and servant of the king of Syria whose name was Naaman. He had contracted leprosy. He was sent to the king of Israel, who later referred him to the prophet Elisha. We read in verses 9\u201314:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/follow-the-living-prophet.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cSo Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/follow-the-living-prophet.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/follow-the-living-prophet.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cBut Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/follow-the-living-prophet.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cAre not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?
