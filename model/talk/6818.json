To those brokenhearted parents who have been righteous, diligent, and prayerful in the teaching of their disobedient children, we say to you, the Good Shepherd is watching over them. God knows and understands your deep sorrow. There is hope. Take comfort in the words of Jeremiah, \u201cThy work shall be rewarded\u201d and your children can \u201ccome again from the land of the enemy.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote21-23905_000_024\">21<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26446\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26446)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26446)\">Jer. 31:16<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> I so testify and pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-23905_000_024\"><a name=\"-23905_000_024\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-23905_000_024\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"26445\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26445)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26445)\">Jer. 31:15\u201316<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-23905_000_024\"><a name=\"-23905_000_024\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-23905_000_024\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"11562\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11562)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11562)\">D&amp;C 68:25<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-23905_000_024\"><a name=\"-23905_000_024\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-23905_000_024\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"11563\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11563)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11563)\">D&amp;C 68:28<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-23905_000_024\"><a name=\"-23905_000_024\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-23905_000_024\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"11564\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11564)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11564)\">D&amp;C 68:28<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-23905_000_024\"><a name=\"-23905_000_024\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote5-23905_000_024\">5.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Howard W.
