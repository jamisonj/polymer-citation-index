I grew up in a small Mormon community. I was raised in a fine Latter-day Saint home. I was taught to love the Lord, to reverence His name, and to communicate with Him in prayer. I was very young when I learned that the Father and the Son had appeared to Joseph Smith. I believed as a boy and I have never doubted as a man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p6\" class=\"\">However, until I enlisted in the navy, I had not experienced the shock of meeting so many people who had never seen a Mormon or who had never heard of Mormonism. I soon realized how limited was my knowledge of the gospel. I was asked some pretty tough questions about the Church that I had difficulty answering. I was the only Mormon in our outfit and so there was no one with whom I could counsel. The only scripture I had was a small military copy of the Book of Mormon. I am ashamed to confess that I left Lehi and his family somewhere in the wilderness on a number of occasions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p7\" class=\"\">While I had grown up as an active member of the Church, I had felt no special need or urgency to study the scriptures and the writings of the prophets. When asked a question or when strong ridicule was directed at me and the Church, I could only state the personal beliefs I had learned from my family and teachers. I tried to compensate for my knowledge deficiency by being a good example of the principles I professed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p8\" class=\"\">After leaving the navy, I received a mission call. I still had not developed a real appetite for gospel knowledge. I had not equated understanding the holy scriptures with being a good Latter-day Saint. Following some brief training in the old mission home in Salt Lake, my companions and I were exposed to a few weeks of tracting in Texas while waiting for the ship that would take us to South Africa. That exposure expanded my vision of what I was going to be doing for the next two years. I gained a lot of humility in a hurry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p9\" class=\"\">An unusual quirk of fate changed my whole life as we sailed toward Cape Town. It was to be a twenty-eight-day voyage, but our ship developed boiler problems crossing the equator. Limping into the port of Recife, Brazil, we hit the rocks, gashing the ship\u2019s hull. A tugboat rescued us; but before we finally arrived in Cape Town, we had spent eighty-four days on board ship. I was fortunate enough to share quarters with a fine companion, Roy Stevens, who was a dedicated student of the gospel. His father had also been a missionary and had sent a large box of Church books with his son. It was during this confinement that a whole new world of gospel knowledge opened up to me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p10\" class=\"\">It was a time to study, to ponder, to pray. I read all the standard works from cover to cover, as well as <span class=\"emphasis\">Jesus the Christ<\/span> and several other Church books. On this voyage I received my witness from the Lord that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. It was here that I came to know that Jesus is the Christ. It was here I developed an insatiable appetite to know the eternal truths. What a pity I had waited so long. I had wasted so much time during military service. What a priceless treasure I had ignored! I am persuaded that we will be held accountable for how we use our discretionary time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p11\" class=\"\">There is so much we can learn from the example of the young Prophet Joseph Smith, whose persistent, prayerful study of the Holy Bible compelled him to seek the God of Heaven for divine guidance. This brought him to the threshold of the greatest revelation ever given to man since the mortal ministry of the Savior Himself. Throughout the Prophet\u2019s life, he continued to probe and ponder until he gained a mastery of the scriptures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p12\" class=\"\">Another young man, Spencer W. Kimball, was about fourteen when Susa Gates spoke at their stake conference. He recalls: \u201cShe gave a rousing talk on the reading of the scriptures; \u2026 then she stopped \u2026 to ask \u2026 us, \u2018How many of you have read the Bible through?\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p13\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 My accusing heart said to me, \u2018You, Spencer Kimball, you have never read that holy book. Why?\u2019 I looked around me \u2026 to see if I was alone in my failure to read the sacred book. Of the thousand people, there were perhaps a half dozen who proudly raised their hands. \u2026 When the meeting closed, I \u2026 rushed home \u2026 gritting my teeth and saying to myself, \u2018I will. I will.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p14\" class=\"\">He went home, got a coal-oil lamp, and climbed the stairs to his attic room. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, \u201cI opened my Bible and began [with] Genesis \u2026 and I read well into the night with Adam and Eve \u2026 and through the flood even to Abraham.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">President Kimball Speaks Out,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1981, pp. 92\u201393.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p15\" class=\"\">He continued to read a little each night. Although he didn\u2019t always understand what he was reading, he had made a commitment to himself. At the end of a year, he had finished. This achievement set a pattern for his life. The sermons and the writings of President Kimball convince us that he has labored long hours to gain his profound insights into the holy scriptures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p16\" class=\"\">I am convinced that families, even young children, can learn to love the scriptures. A few years ago when I was in Colorado Springs for a conference, I called on Mark McConkie, son of Elder and Sister Bruce R. McConkie, to address the question: \u201cHow did you develop a love for the scriptures?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p17\" class=\"\">As I recall, he said: \u201cI first developed a love for the scriptures from my mother. I remember she would teach me while she did her ironing. I felt how she loved the scriptures by the way she would speak about the prophets. How much she loved them! As I grew older, I would listen to the recordings of the scriptures. I wanted to know the scriptures like my father. Sometimes he would enter the room while I was listening and it would take him just a moment to identify the exact scripture I was listening to. I wanted to be able to do that.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p18\" class=\"\">You may remember the sweet experience shared by President Romney, who had been reading the Book of Mormon with his son. He related: \u201cI remember reading it with one of my lads when he was very young. \u2026 We were each reading aloud alternate paragraphs of those last three marvelous chapters of Second Nephi. I heard his voice breaking and thought he had a cold, but we went on to the end of the three chapters. As we finished he said to me, \u2018Daddy, do you ever cry when you read the Book of Mormon?\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p19\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018Yes, son,\u2019 I answered. \u2018Sometimes the spirit of the Lord so witnesses to my soul that the Book of Mormon is true that I do cry.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p20\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018that is what happened to me tonight.\u2019\u201d (In Conference Report, Apr. 1949, p. 41.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p21\" class=\"\">Some time later, I was reading a Jack London book with our youngest son Brandon, before going to bed. I recalled President Romney\u2019s story and thought, What an experience we\u2019re missing by not reading the standard works together. Before he leaves on his mission, I want him to become intimately acquainted with the great heroes of sacred literature and to pattern his life after them. We began to read just fifteen minutes or one chapter each day. What a choice experience! I commend it to you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p22\" class=\"\">All of our sacred records have come to us at high cost. When we consider the fiery furnace of conquest and persecution through which the Bible has passed, the great wonder is not whether it is complete or translated correctly, but a miracle that it has survived at all! Surely the Lord has preserved it for the salvation of his children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p23\" class=\"\">Laban\u2019s life was taken by divine command that the Nephite nation not \u201cdwindle \u2026 in unbelief.\u201d (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"1778\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1778)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1778)\">1 Ne. 4:13<\/a><\/span>.) Think of the travail of the Nephite prophets who kept the records of their people so future generations might profit from their experiences. Think of the millions of people who have lived at a time when there was no printing or translating capability or who, because of political oppression or illiteracy, have been denied access to the scriptures. Think about the blessings of living in this dispensation, when the holy scriptures are available to us. In 1981, the United Bible Societies distributed 444,000,000 complete copies or portions of the Bible throughout the world. By the end of 1982, the Book of Mormon or selected portions will be available in fifty-seven languages.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p24\" class=\"\">We are the beneficiaries of great sacrifice.

When I drink from a spring I like to get the water where it comes out of the ground, not down the stream after the cattle have waded in it. \u2026 I appreciate other people\u2019s interpretation, but when it comes to the gospel we ought to be acquainted with what the Lord says. \u2026 You ought to read the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants; and \u2026 all the scriptures with the idea of finding out what\u2019s in them and what the meaning is and not to prove some idea of your own. Just read them and plead with the Lord to let you understand what he had in mind when he wrote them.\u201d (Address delivered at Coordinators\u2019 Convention, Seminaries and Institutes of Religion, 13 Apr. 1973.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p34\" class=\"\">I fear there are far too many Latter-day Saints who do not have a testimony of the gospel from their own diligent efforts. Is it possible that you are living on the reflected light of others who have prayed and pondered the revelations of God? A testimony comes from personal endeavor.

You will not then be dependent on man for the knowledge of God; nor will there be any room for speculation. \u2026 For when men receive their instruction from Him that made them, they know how He will save them. \u2026 Again we say: Search the Scriptures, search the Prophets and learn what portion of them belongs to you.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> comp.
