We are convened in the largest of all priesthood meetings ever held in any dispensation. We rejoice in the attendance of all of those beyond the great Conference Center numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Meeting for the first time in this new, grand edifice is a great moment in the history of humanity. We are indebted to the Lord, who inspired President Gordon B. Hinckley with the prophetic vision that brought about its construction and made it all possible. We thank Bishop H. David Burton, Bishop Richard C. Edgley, Bishop Keith B. McMullin, and all who have had anything to do with its construction. Now that we have it, we must use it to strengthen the faith of our people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/the-power-of-self-mastery.p5\" class=\"\">Tonight, brethren, I should like to speak about the power of self-mastery in its larger sense. Self-mastery is essential to invoke the power of the priesthood of God. This is because this great, divine agency can only be exercised in righteousness. Self-mastery requires self-determination and strength of character. It enhances our own gifts and talents in a remarkable way. It is the power of noble manhood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/the-power-of-self-mastery.p6\" class=\"\">Every human soul, especially priesthood holders, has the challenge of controlling his or her thoughts, appetites, speech, temper, and desires. One of these may be a bad temper. When I was a boy, I had red hair. At times my mother accused me of having a temper to go with it. They used to call me \u201cRed.\u201d Those were fighting words. I think I have learned to control it. Those with red hair are not the only ones that must learn to control an unruly temper. Willpower is necessary so that irritations do not take over our emotions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/the-power-of-self-mastery.p7\" class=\"\">A local newspaper recently reported on a phenomenon accompanying the increased traffic on our roads: \u201cIt is the normal scenario of rush-hour traffic: honking, tailgating, obscene gestures. Even outright violence is on the increase in our driving.\u201d Sometimes tempers get out of control, and we call it \u201croad rage.\u201d I have often wondered why some men\u2019s personalities change when they get behind the steering wheel of their car, secured by glass and metal. In some way this seems to excuse their rude behavior. Road rage is not caused by traffic congestion but by attitude. As some drivers become impatient and overaggressive, they may lose control and cause serious injury, even death, to others on the highway.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/the-power-of-self-mastery.p8\" class=\"\">Self-mastery is a challenge for every individual. Only we can control our appetites and passions. Self-mastery cannot be bought by money or fame. It is the ultimate test of our character. It requires climbing out of the deep valleys of our lives and scaling our own Mount Everests.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/the-power-of-self-mastery.p9\" class=\"\">As full-time missionaries we learn great lessons in self-mastery. We learn to get up when we should get up, to work when we should work, and to go to bed when we should go to bed. Full-time missionaries are generally admired and even respected, though their message may not be as well received as we would like. The First Presidency and others of the General Authorities meet with many heads of state, ambassadors, and ministers from all over the world. Frequently, when the subject comes up, these men of great power and influence speak with admiration and respect for the missionaries they have seen in their homelands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/the-power-of-self-mastery.p10\" class=\"\">Our young elders are models of young manhood. When they come home, some are criticized as being self-righteous for maintaining a decent appearance and keeping their hair trimmed neatly. I cannot understand why a returned missionary is considered self-righteous if he tries to live the standards and principles he has taught as a representative of the Lord to the people where he has served. Of course returned missionaries are not expected to wear white shirts and ties all of the time. But wearing sloppy clothes and weird hairstyles to supposedly look trendy is not proper for one who holds the divine commission of the priesthood. Returned missionaries are an example to the young men of the Aaronic Priesthood, who will be the future missionaries. Often that which is <span class=\"emphasis\">seen<\/span> by the Aaronic Priesthood is more powerful and persuasive than what is <span class=\"emphasis\">said.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/the-power-of-self-mastery.p11\" class=\"\">Men and women often attempt to gain notice and approval of the group from whom they seek acceptance. Such peer pressure may cause them to do things they would not otherwise do. This is acting out of weakness, not strength. The Lord promises us through Moroni: \u201cAnd if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-20905_000_021\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22114\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22114)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22114)\">Ether 12:27<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/the-power-of-self-mastery.p12\" class=\"\">In its simplest terms, self-mastery is doing those things we should do and not doing those things we should not do. It requires strength, willpower, and honesty. As the traffic on the communications highway becomes a parking lot, we must depend more and more on our own personal moral filters to separate the good from the bad. Marvelous as it is in many ways, there is something hypnotic about using the Internet. I refer specifically to spending endless time in chat rooms or visiting the pornography sites.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/the-power-of-self-mastery.p13\" class=\"\">I now turn to mastery of our own private thoughts. In this realm, conscience is the only referee that can blow the whistle when we get out of control. If not bridled, our thoughts can run wild. Our minds are a part of us that really require discipline and control. I believe reading the scriptures is the best washing machine for unclean or uncontrolled thoughts. For those who are eligible and worthy, the sanctity of the holy temple can lift our thoughts above the earthy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/the-power-of-self-mastery.p14\" class=\"\">When I was participating in athletics and served in the military, I heard expressions that made me ashamed to hear them.

He purchased a baseball and practiced hour after hour, throwing at a neighbor\u2019s old barn. Often his arm would ache so much he could hardly \u2026 sleep at night.

At age 26, when he became an Apostle, he asked Professor Sims if he could teach him how to sing. After listening to him, Professor Sims replied, \u201cYes, you can learn to sing, but I would like to be forty miles away while you are doing it.\u201d This only challenged him to try harder.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote9-20905_000_021\">9<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Cameron, <span class=\"emphasis\">Tenacity,<\/span> 2.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/the-power-of-self-mastery.p27\" class=\"\">President Grant one time said, \u201cI have practiced on the \u2018Doxology\u2019<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote10-20905_000_021\">10<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cPraise God, from Whom All Blessings Flow,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 242.]<\/span><\/sup> between three and four hundred times, and there are only four lines, and I cannot sing it yet.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote11-20905_000_021\">11<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[In Conference Report, Apr. 1900, 61.]<\/span><\/sup> It is reported that on a trip to Arizona with Elder Rudger Clawson and Elder J.
