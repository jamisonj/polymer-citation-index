We were taking a heavy load of construction materials across several states.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p6\" class=\"\">In those days there were no seat-belt restrictions or infant car seats. My wife held our precious son in her arms. Her comment \u201cWe sure are high off the ground\u201d should have given me a clue about her feelings of apprehension.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p7\" class=\"\">As we made our descent over historic Donner Pass, a steep section of highway, the cab of the semi suddenly and unexpectedly filled with thick smoke. It was difficult to see, and we could hardly breathe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p8\" class=\"\">With a heavy rig, brakes alone are not enough to rapidly decrease speed. Using the engine brakes and gearing down, I frantically attempted to stop.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p9\" class=\"\">Just as I was pulling to the side of the road, but before we had come to a full stop, my wife opened the door of the cab and jumped out with our baby in her arms. I watched helplessly as they tumbled in the dirt.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p10\" class=\"\">As soon as I had the semi stopped, I bolted from the smoking cab. With adrenaline pumping, I ran through the rocks and weeds and held them in my arms. Jan\u2019s forearms and elbows were battered and bleeding, but thankfully she and our son were both breathing. I just held them close as the dust settled there on the side of the highway.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p11\" class=\"\">As my heartbeat normalized and I caught my breath, I blurted out, \u201cWhat in the world were you thinking? Do you know how dangerous that was? You could have been killed!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p12\" class=\"\">She looked back at me, with tears running down her smoke-smudged cheeks, and said something that pierced my heart and still rings in my ears: \u201cI was just trying to save our son.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p13\" class=\"\">I realized in that moment she thought the engine was on fire, fearing the truck would explode and we would die. I, however, knew it was an electrical failure\u2014hazardous but not fatal. I looked at my precious wife, softly rubbing the head of our infant son, and wondered what kind of woman would do something so courageous.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p14\" class=\"\">This situation could have been as emotionally hazardous as our literal engine failure. Gratefully, after enduring the silent treatment for a reasonable amount of time, each of us believing the other person was at fault, we finally expressed the emotions that were churning beneath our heated outbursts. Shared feelings of love and fear for the other\u2019s safety kept the hazardous incident from proving fatal to our cherished marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p15\" class=\"\">Paul warned, \u201cLet no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but [only] that which is good [and] edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129549\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129549)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129549)\">Ephesians 4:29<\/a><\/span>). His words resonate with a certain purity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p16\" class=\"\">What does the phrase \u201cno corrupt communication\u201d mean to you? We all regularly experience highly charged feelings of anger\u2014our own and others\u2019. We have seen unchecked anger erupt in public places. We have experienced it as a sort of emotional \u201celectrical short\u201d at sporting events, in the political arena, and even in our own homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p17\" class=\"\">Children sometimes speak to beloved parents with tongues as sharp as blades. Spouses, who have shared some of life\u2019s richest and most tender experiences, lose vision and patience with each other and raise their voices. All of us, though covenant children of a loving Heavenly Father, have regretted jumping headlong from the high seat of self-righteous judgment and have spoken with abrasive words before we understood a situation from another\u2019s perspective. We have all had the opportunity to learn how destructive words can take a situation from hazardous to fatal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p18\" class=\"\">A recent letter from the First Presidency states clearly, \u201cThe gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us to love and treat all people with kindness and civility\u2014even when we disagree\u201d (First Presidency letter, Jan. 10, 2014). What a masterful reminder that we can and should participate in continuing civil dialogue, especially when we view the world from differing perspectives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p19\" class=\"\">The writer of Proverbs counsels, \u201cA soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129550\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129550)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129550)\">Proverbs 15:1<\/a><\/span>). A \u201csoft answer\u201d consists of a reasoned response\u2014disciplined words from a humble heart. It does not mean we never speak directly or that we compromise doctrinal truth. Words that may be firm in information can be soft in spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p20\" class=\"\">The Book of Mormon contains a striking example of affirming language also given in the context of a marital disagreement. The sons of Sariah and Lehi had been sent back to Jerusalem to get the brass plates and had not returned. Sariah believed her sons were in harm\u2019s way, and she was filled with anger and needed someone to blame.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p21\" class=\"\">Listen to the story through the eyes of her son Nephi: \u201cFor [my mother] had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness; and she also had complained against my father, telling him that he was a visionary man; saying: Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129551\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129551)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129551)\">1\u00a0Nephi 5:2<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p22\" class=\"\">Now, let\u2019s consider what Sariah may have been thinking. She was filled with anxiety about her quarrelsome sons returning to the place where her husband\u2019s life had been threatened. She had traded her lovely home and friends for a tent in an isolated wilderness while still in her childbearing years. Pushed to the breaking point of her fears, Sariah seems to have jumped heroically, if not rationally, from the height of a hurtling truck in an attempt to protect her family. She expressed legitimate concerns to her husband in the language of anger and doubt and blame\u2014a language in which the entire human race seems to be surprisingly proficient.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p23\" class=\"\">The prophet Lehi listened to the fear that underpinned his wife\u2019s anger. Then he made a disciplined response in the language of compassion. First, he owned the truth of what things looked like from her perspective: \u201cAnd \u2026 my father spake unto her, saying: I know that I am a visionary man; \u2026 but [if I] had tarried at Jerusalem, [we would have] perished with my brethren\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129552\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129552)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129552)\">1\u00a0Nephi 5:4<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p24\" class=\"\">Then her husband addressed her fears concerning the welfare of their sons, as the Holy Ghost undoubtedly testified to him, saying:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cBut behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort my mother \u2026 concerning us\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129553\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129553)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129553)\">1\u00a0Nephi 5:5\u20136<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p27\" class=\"\">There exists today a great need for men and women to cultivate respect for each other across wide distances of belief and behavior and across deep canyons of conflicting agendas. It is impossible to know all that informs our minds and hearts or even to fully understand the context for the trials and choices we each face.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/what-are-you-thinking.p28\" class=\"\">Nevertheless, what would happen to the \u201ccorrupt communication\u201d Paul spoke about if our own position included empathy for another\u2019s experience first?
