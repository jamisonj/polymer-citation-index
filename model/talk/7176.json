It tells us of the plain and precious truths of the gospel and the reality and divinity of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice for all mankind. It informs us of the gathering of the house of Israel in the last days. It tells us of the purpose and principles of missionary work.

He said, \u201cWithout reservation I promise you that if each of you will observe this simple program, regardless of how many times you previously may have read the Book of Mormon, there will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Aug. 2005, 6).

Thoroughly discouraged after yet another failed attempt, Laman and Lemuel again wanted to give up on what they felt was an impossible task. Nephi, however, was unwavering in his commitment to obey the Lord\u2019s commandments. He reasoned with his brothers this way: \u201cLet us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44587\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44587)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44587)\">1 Ne. 4:1<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/blessings-resulting-from-reading-the-book-of-mormon.p35\" class=\"\">Approaching the assignment with faith in the Lord brought the desired result. As Nephi went forward to obtain the record, being led by the Spirit, Laban was delivered into his hands.

Now, with the brass plates in their possession, Nephi and his brothers could return to their father in the wilderness and continue their journey.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/blessings-resulting-from-reading-the-book-of-mormon.p36\" class=\"\">If we will approach President Hinckley\u2019s challenge with faith, we have the sure promise of our prophet of the blessings we will receive resulting from our study of the Book of Mormon.
