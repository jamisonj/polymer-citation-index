He must have had an unexplained urge, because he would not know really why he came. He might think it was to better his condition.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/having-been-born-of-goodly-parents.p7\" class=\"\">He fought in the American Revolution and was wounded. Many of us have ancestors who are reported to have fought in the Revolution, but few of them were wounded. This man was left for dead in the battle of Guilford County Courthouse in the Carolinas in March 1781. Thanks to good nursing he recovered and, as in all good endings, married his nurse. Four sons came to him, one of whom was Samuel, who was the youngest.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/having-been-born-of-goodly-parents.p8\" class=\"\">Samuel\u2019s sons, Francis, Alfred, and Eli, and their families joined the Church in 1832, about the time that my great-grandfather joined. They suffered through all the vicissitudes and the troubles and persecutions and mobbings of Jackson County, Far West, and Nauvoo, and finally came west. At Winter Quarters their father joined them. He had not joined the Church until this time but joined shortly afterward. Francis married a young woman by the name of Jane Vail Johnson. I shall speak of her later.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/having-been-born-of-goodly-parents.p9\" class=\"\">They all came to Utah and settled in Tooele County. They were just getting settled and making things go when they were called by President Brigham Young to St. George, and they went, like all good Latter-day Saints did in those days. But they had not been in St. George very long when they were called to settle in Meadow Valley. That is a place you folks probably have not heard about. It is now known as Panaca, in what they thought was southwestern Utah, but which actually later came to be Nevada. These people, obeying the call, again without question, were the first family to move to Meadow Valley, and they made a dugout house. Sister Young said that you may not know what a dugout house is. I replied that most of the folks would know: One digs a cubical hole in a hillside and covers it with a roof of wooden poles topped with clay.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/having-been-born-of-goodly-parents.p10\" class=\"\">Troubles of the few settlers with the Indians caused the authorities in St. George to give them permission to abandon the project, but Sister Jane Johnson Lee refused to leave. She said she was there to stay, and stay they did. Later two Indians came into her dugout home, and one of them, seeing a rifle in one corner of the room, demanded it. Sister Lee refused to give it to him. He started for the gun, but she struck him so hard with a piece of stove wood, it knocked him down. He staggered to his feet and drew his bow, aiming the arrow at her. She let him have another piece of wood, which smashed the bow and arrow. Both Indians departed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/having-been-born-of-goodly-parents.p11\" class=\"\">Two sons of this brave couple married sisters. Samuel Marion Lee married Margaret McMurrin, and Francis Lee, Jr., married Mary McMurrin. The McMurrins were converts from Scotland who had crossed the plains with the handcart companies. Brother McMurrin, a cooper, which is a man who makes barrels and bends wood, repaired many a handcart wheel en route, which helped get the carts to the valley but delayed him and his family. They also settled in Tooele. Each of the Lee brothers took his bride to Meadow Valley.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">I speak of Margaret\u2019s bravery.<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">Eleven times she placed<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">Her life upon the block<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">And offered it that<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">Children might be born.<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">No sterile chamber<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">Where the doctor waits,<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">The anesthetic cone<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">And nurse in readiness,<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">Could be her lot.<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">The cabin walls absorbed<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">The agonizing cries,<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">With Death close by.<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">He did not claim her life.<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">Instead he took each child\u2014<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">Each little one to heaven\u2014<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">All eleven.<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">Then came the twelfth.<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">For her the light burnedDim, then flickered low,<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">And out\u2014<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">But she had filled her life, and<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">Given all that she could give.<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">Her mission was performed;<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">A son was born,<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">The only child to live.<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">He was named his father\u2019s name\u2014<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">Samuel Lee.<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/having-been-born-of-goodly-parents.p39\" class=\"\">Mary McMurrin Lee took the child and let him nurse along with her own child, but after a time the strain was too great, so they took the baby to Salt Lake City to Grandmother McMurrin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/having-been-born-of-goodly-parents.p40\" class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll give him one last nursing,\u201d she said, and then laying him in his crib, she went back to Meadow Valley.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/having-been-born-of-goodly-parents.p41\" class=\"\">Under his grandmother\u2019s care the baby Samuel grew into a stalwart boy, and when sixteen went to Clifton, Idaho, in Cache Valley, where he worked on a farm and there later met Louisa Bingham.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/having-been-born-of-goodly-parents.p42\" class=\"\">The Bingham family, stalwart in the faith, were pioneers.
