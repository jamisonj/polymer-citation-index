This book was designed to play a prominent role in this \"great and marvelous\nwork.\"\n<\/p><p>\nJesus Christ had already chosen Joseph Smith to be his prophet, seer, and revelator, and had\nannounced that his gospel would be restored from heaven through that prophet, and also that\nhe had been selected to establish the true Church of Jesus Christ upon earth once again.\nAccompanied by God the Father, the Savior had appeared to that prophet in what is known as\n\"The First Vision\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30520\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30520)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30520)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis \"great and marvelous work\" that Jesus Christ declared to Joseph Smith and Oliver\nCowdery was about to come forth among, the children of men was the \"restitution of all\nthings, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8069\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8069)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8069)\">Acts 3:21<\/a><\/span>),\nwith all the gifts, powers, and priesthoods, and gospel ordinances requisite for the\nexaltation of the human family possessed by any and all former gospel dispensations. This\nwas to be the last dispensation, the dispensation of the fulness of times.\n<\/p><p>\nAccordingly, numerous ancient prophets brought to Joseph Smith the priesthoods, keys, and\npowers of their dispensations. Through direct revelation from the Savior, Joseph Smith\nestablished the Church and officially named it the Church of Jesus Christ. This church was\nendowed with power from God to carry forth the work of the Master and build a kingdom to\nwhich the Savior will eventually come to reign.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Book of Mormon<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJehovah, or Jesus Christ, began making preparations 2,500 years ago for this \"great and\nmarvelous work\" in the latter days by initiating a project to produce a holy scripture to testify\nto his divinity. Also, the scripture was destined to play a prominent role in helping to give the\ngospel of Jesus Christ to the honest in heart and bring them into his Church in the latter days.\nThis holy scripture is known as the Book of Mormon. Therefore, the Book of Mormon is the\nvoice of God to our generation.\n<\/p><p>\nNo holy scripture in the world is unique in as many ways as is the Book of Mormon.\n<\/p><p>\nFirst, Jesus Christ initiated its writing and through numerous revelations supervised its\nproduction, which is unique.\n<\/p><p>\nSecond, as early as 600 B.C. the Master proclaimed that this record would play a unique role\nin the latter days in testifying that he was the Christ, the Savior of the world, thereby\nsustaining the testimony of the Jews, the Holy Bible.\n<\/p><p>\nThird, through 1,000 years' time the prophets who wrote the book did so under the divine\nguidance of our Savior.\n<\/p><p>\nFourth, acting in accordance with revelation from Jesus Christ, the last two Nephite\nprophets&mdash;Mormon and Moroni&mdash;abridged the ancient records, making them suitable for use in our\nday. We know of no other similar occurrence in history; hence, unique.\n<\/p><p>\nFifth, the Book of Mormon is unique in its being translated from records of which an angel\nwas the custodian for 1,400 years before they were brought forth in a book.\n<\/p><p>\nSixth, the Book of Mormon stands alone in being the only book known to have been\ntranslated from ancient records delivered to an unlearned young man by an angel.\n<\/p><p>\nSeventh, the feat of translating the ancient record was also an unheard of achievement. Joseph\nSmith, assisted by Oliver Cowdery, translated the entire Book of Mormon of 522 printed\npages in approximately sixty days. The writing on the plates was in an ancient script called\n\"reformed Egyptian\" (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"37999\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37999)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37999)\">Morm. 9:32<\/a><\/span>),\na language that no mortal man through his own power\ncould decipher. Then how did Joseph Smith accomplish such a mammoth job in such a short\ntime? He has told us that he translated the Book of Mormon \"through the gift and power of\nGod and through the Urim and Thummim.\"\n<\/p><p>\nEighth, no other book in the world has been testified to as to its truthfulness and divinity by\nthe voice of an angel and by the voice of Jesus Christ other than the Book of Mormon.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Testimonies of divinity<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nLet us now pay particular attention to some remarkable testimonies regarding the truthfulness\nand divinity of the Book of Mormon. One of the strongest testimonies came directly from the\nmouth of Jesus Christ himself. In June 1829, the Savior spoke from heaven and declared: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . as your Lord and your God liveth it [the Book of Mormon] is true\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15316\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15316)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15316)\">D&amp;C 17:6<\/a><\/span>). I am\npositive that my Lord and God liveth&mdash;and so I am also positive that the Book of Mormon is\ntrue.\n<\/p><p>\nNo other book in the world has ever had a witness borne to it as dynamic and powerful as the\none the Master provided to sustain the Book of Mormon in what is known as \"The Testimony\nof Three Witnesses.\" The ancient American prophets had predicted that through the power of\nthe Lord the plates would be shown to three others\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3812\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3812)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3812)\">2 Ne. 27:12<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22274\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22274)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22274)\">Ether 5:2-4<\/a><\/span>)\nbesides the prophet to whom the records\nwould be given for the purpose of their bearing witness. Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer,\nand Martin Harris asked for that privilege.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Three Witnesses<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn June 1829, Jesus Christ spoke from heaven to the three men through the Prophet Joseph\nSmith, declaring: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . you shall have a view of the plates, and also of the breastplate, the sword of Laban,\n[and] the Urim and Thummim\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15315\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15315)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15315)\">D&amp;C 17:1<\/a><\/span>).\nThereupon the four men went into the\nwoods and kneeled down and prayed. In response, the Angel Moroni came down from heaven\nand showed these sacred objects to them.  He turned the sheets of the gold plates leaf by leaf\nand let them examine the inscriptions thereon. He described Joseph Smith's work in\ntranslating the Book of Mormon records. As he was doing so, the voice of Jesus Christ spoke\nfrom heaven and said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"These plates have been revealed by the power of God, and they have been translated by the\npower of God. The translation of them which you have seen is correct, and I command you to\nbear record of what you now see and hear\" (Cited in Preston Nibley,\n<i>The Witnesses of the Book of Mormon<\/i>, p. 8).\n<\/p><p>\nAfter the Angel Moroni left with the gold plates, the three men wrote their testimony, which\nis known as \"The Testimony of Three Witnesses\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43113\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43113)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43113)\">BM Three Wit.<\/a><\/span>). Their testimony states: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and\nhe brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings\nthereon . . . the voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn no other time in history has such an astounding event occurred. Never before nor since\nhave three men received their testimonies directly from an angel and from Jesus Christ, as did\nthese three men.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Believers and nonbelievers<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSince the coming forth of the Book of Mormon is so astounding, it has divided all people\nwho have come into contact with it into two definitely separate groups&mdash;believers and\nnonbelievers. Those who believe love it, enthusiastically testify to its divinity, and proclaim\nits great worth to humanity. Those who disbelieve it hate it. Many brilliant men have written\nviciously against it. No book has had as many attacks made upon it as has the Book of\nMormon.\n<\/p><p>\nOne may wonder why so many intelligent people have rejected the Book of Mormon. Perhaps\nit is because there is so much that they would call miraculous connected with its origin,\npreservation, coming forth, and translation.\n<\/p><p>\nApostle Paul explained that it is only through the operation of the Holy Spirit of God that\nspiritual things can be understood and received by man. Paul declared that \"the things of God\nknoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness\nunto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"490\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 490)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(490)\">1 Cor. 2:11,14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThus the ordinary man whose heart is not moved upon by the Holy Ghost regards the Book of\nMormon and all of the great and marvelous things that Jesus Christ did in its preparation and\nbringing forth as being fantastic, fabricated, and untrue. On the other hand, when the Holy\nGhost bears testimony to the heart and soul of a man of the divine nature of the Book of\nMormon, the spiritual-minded man knows the reality of the divine authenticity of that book,\nand this reality becomes very important in his whole being. He feels impelled continuously to\ntestify.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Formula of Moroni<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAny person in the world can know for sure that the Book of Mormon is true, that it is the\nword of God, if he will in all sincerity, humility, and faith follow the formula laid down in\nthe last chapter of Moroni: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the\nEternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a\nsincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you,\nby the power of the Holy Ghost.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38361\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38361)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38361)\">Moro. 10:4-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI bear my testimony that I know positively that the Book of Mormon is true. It is the word of\nGod. I am as sure of it as I am sure that I am alive, or as I am sure that I am speaking unto\nyou today. The Holy Ghost has borne powerful witness to my heart and mind of the\ntruthfulness of this divine book, and has filled my heart with a powerful love for it and an\nexceedingly great love for my Savior. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
