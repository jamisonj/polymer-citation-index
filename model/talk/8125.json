The temple the members attended is small, and unfortunately there were several members who, despite making the long 12-hour journey, were not able to enter the temple because it had exceeded the daily capacity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/tested-and-tempted-but-helped.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">A few days after this trip, I visited this stake and asked the president if I could talk with some of the members who were unable to attend the temple that day. One of the brothers I visited told me: \u201cElder, do not worry. I was at the house of the Lord. I sat on a bench in the garden and pondered in my mind the ordinances. Then I was given the opportunity to enter, but instead I allowed another brother, who had come to the temple for the first time to be sealed to his wife, to take my place. They then had the opportunity to attend two sessions that day. The Lord knows me, and He has blessed me, and we are fine.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/tested-and-tempted-but-helped.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">2. Smile. This small action can help those who are overwhelmed or burdened. During the priesthood session of this past April general conference, I was seated on the stand as one of the five newly called General Authorities. We were sitting where the sisters of the auxiliary presidencies are now seated. I was feeling very nervous and overwhelmed with my new call.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/tested-and-tempted-but-helped.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">When we were singing the intermediate hymn, I felt a strong impression that someone was watching me. I thought to myself: \u201cThere are more than 20,000 people in this building, and most of them are facing this way. Of course someone is watching you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/tested-and-tempted-but-helped.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">While I continued singing, I again felt the strong impression that someone was watching me. I looked over to the row where the Twelve Apostles were sitting and saw that President Russell\u00a0M. Nelson was turned all the way around in his seat, looking at where we were seated. I caught his eye, and he gave me a big smile. That smile brought peace to my overwhelmed heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/tested-and-tempted-but-helped.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">After His Resurrection, Jesus Christ visited His other sheep. He called and ordained twelve disciples, and with that authority, they ministered to the people. The Lord Jesus Christ Himself stood among them. The Lord asked them to kneel and pray. I am not sure if the newly called and ordained twelve disciples were overwhelmed with their calling, but the scripture says, \u201cIt came to pass that Jesus blessed them as they did pray unto him; and his countenance did <span class=\"emphasis\">smile<\/span> upon them, and the light of his countenance did shine upon them.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-12461_000_022\">5<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131123\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131123)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131123)\">3\u00a0Nephi 19:25<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added.]<\/span><\/sup> During the last general conference, a smile lightened my burdens in an immediate and extraordinary way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/tested-and-tempted-but-helped.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">3.

The cornerstone of God\u2019s plan is the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. At least once a week, we should meditate as President Joseph\u00a0F. Smith did on \u201cthe great and wonderful love made manifest by the Father and the Son in the coming of the Redeemer into the world.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-12461_000_022\">6<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131124\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131124)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131124)\">Doctrine and Covenants 138:3<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Inviting others to come to church and to worthily partake of the sacrament will allow more of Heavenly Father\u2019s children to reflect on the Atonement.
