We went everywhere together\u2014to the bank, the doctor, the Early Bird Garden Club, and to an endless procession of Church meetings. When it came to the gospel, Grandma was zealous. She would talk about the Church anytime and with anyone\u2014including her eldest granddaughter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p7\" class=\"\">I\u2019ll never forget an interchange she and I had one night as we drove home from yet another meeting. It began when I blurted out a question that flashed through my eight-year-old mind: \u201cGrandma, what if the gospel isn\u2019t true and we\u2019ve been going to all of these meetings for nothing?\u201d Charming little eight-year-old, wasn\u2019t I? \u201cSheri, you don\u2019t need to worry about that,\u201d she answered, \u201cbecause I know that the gospel is true.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p8\" class=\"\">I challenged her: \u201c<span class=\"emphasis\">How<\/span> can you know for sure?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p9\" class=\"\">Several seconds passed before she said slowly, \u201cI <span class=\"emphasis\">know<\/span> for sure that the gospel is true because the Holy Ghost has told me that Jesus Christ is our Savior and that this is His Church.\u201d She paused and then she added something I will never forget: \u201cAnd, Sheri, He\u2019ll tell you too, and when He does, your life can never be the same again.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p10\" class=\"\">I still vividly remember what happened next. A sensation unlike any I had ever experienced charged through my body, and then I began to cry. Though I didn\u2019t understand the reason for my outburst, I\u2019m sure Grandma realized exactly what was happening\u2014that the Spirit was bearing witness to me that what she had said was true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p11\" class=\"\">Tonight I am grateful to testify that during the intervening years I<span class=\"emphasis\"> have<\/span> come to know for myself that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and our Redeemer. And with that knowledge, my life has been changed forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p12\" class=\"\">Prophets, ancient and modern, have urged us to come unto Christ (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"38751\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38751)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38751)\">Moro. 10:30<\/a><\/span>). President Gordon B. Hinckley declared that \u201c[Jesus Christ] is the pivotal figure of our theology and our faith. Every Latter-day Saint has the responsibility to know \u2026 with a certainty beyond doubt that Jesus is the resurrected, living Son of the living God\u201d (\u201c\u2018Fear Not to Do Good,\u2019\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1983, 80).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p13\" class=\"\">The admonition to \u201ccome unto Christ\u201d is the hub around which everything in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and thus the Relief Society, revolves\u2014and for good reason. The verb <span class=\"emphasis\">come<\/span> implies action on <span class=\"emphasis\">our<\/span> part. In the familiar New Testament passage about the hereafter in which many plead their case with the Lord by listing all of their good deeds, Christ responds, \u201cI never knew you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37719\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37719)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37719)\">Matt. 7:23<\/a><\/span>). Joseph Smith\u2019s inspired translation of that same passage, however, notes a profound distinction\u2014\u201c<span class=\"emphasis\">[You]<\/span> never knew me\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37722\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37722)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37722)\">JST, Matt. 7:33<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added)\u2014placing responsibility for coming unto the Savior squarely upon our shoulders. Jesus Christ Himself has promised, \u201cDraw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20803\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20803)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20803)\">D&amp;C 88:63<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p14\" class=\"\">There are no disclaimers or exceptions in His invitation. <span class=\"emphasis\">We<\/span> are the ones who determine whether or not we will come unto Him. The drawing near, seeking, asking, and knocking are up to us. And the more we know about the Lord\u2014meaning the more we experience His mercy, devotion, and willingness to guide us even when we may not feel worthy of His direction\u2014the more confident we become that He <span class=\"emphasis\">will<\/span> respond to our petitions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p15\" class=\"\">As we increase our interaction with Him, we learn for ourselves that He will never betray us, never turn away, never change His criteria for coming unto Him. His attention is riveted on us, His brothers and sisters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p16\" class=\"\">There are many ways to draw near, seek, ask, and knock. If, for example, your prayers offered to Heavenly Father in the name of Christ have become a little casual, would you recommit yourself to meaningful prayer, offered in unrushed solitude and with a repentant heart? If you have not yet come to appreciate the peace and the power of temple worship, would you partake of the ordinances of the house of the Lord as often as your circumstances allow? If you have not yet found that immersion in the scriptures increases your sensitivity to the Spirit, would you consider incorporating the word of God into your life more consistently? Tonight would be a wonderful time to begin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p17\" class=\"\">These efforts and many others increase our connection with Jesus Christ. As our testimony of Him expands and matures, we begin to care more about life forever than life today, and we have no desire but to do what He needs us to do and to live as He has asked us to live. President Ezra Taft Benson taught that \u201cwhen you choose to follow Christ, you choose to be changed\u201d (\u201cBorn of God,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1985, 5). It is a lot like what Grandma told me: \u201cWhen you have a testimony of Jesus Christ, your life can never be the same again.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p18\" class=\"\">Not long ago I visited a ward on the exquisite Oregon coast. At the conclusion of sacrament meeting I was a little surprised when a woman approached me and asked, \u201cAre you the woman I think you are?\u201d Her question referred to my identity, but it is one that has haunted me. <span class=\"emphasis\">Am<\/span> I the woman I think I am, the woman I want to be? More importantly, am I the woman the Savior needs me to be?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p19\" class=\"\">There is a connection between my Oregon friend\u2019s question and the lesson I learned from Grandma. For there is a direct relationship between how we feel about Jesus Christ and how we see ourselves. We cannot increase our devotion to the Savior without also obtaining a greater sense of purpose, identity, and conviction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p20\" class=\"\">I <span class=\"emphasis\">love<\/span> Nauvoo. And every time I visit the City of Joseph, I walk to the end of Parley Street, where the Saints lined their wagons as they prepared to evacuate the city. There I try to imagine how our pioneer sisters must have felt as they loaded what little they could into a wagon, glanced a final time at their homes, and then followed their faith into the wilderness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p21\" class=\"\">I always weep on Parley Street, because I can\u2019t help but wonder, Would I have loaded that wagon? Would my testimony of a modern-day prophet and Jesus Christ have been strong enough that I would have given up everything and gone anywhere?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p22\" class=\"\">Perhaps none of us in this congregation will be called upon to suffer deprivation because of what we believe. But we have been called to live in a time when the chasm between the philosophies of men and the teachings of the Master gapes wider than ever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p23\" class=\"\">This is a day when the adversary has launched an all-out attack against womanhood, because he knows\u2014he absolutely knows\u2014that the influence of a righteous woman is enormous and that it spans generations. He would have us be disinterested in marriage and motherhood, confused by the world\u2019s view of men and women, too harried by the pace of life to really live the gospel and to let it penetrate our souls. At all costs, he wants to keep us at arm\u2019s length from Jesus Christ. For if we don\u2019t come unto Christ, meaning that we never turn our lives over to Him, we will go through our probation here on our own rather than experiencing what the Savior promised when He said, \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37729\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37729)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37729)\">Matt. 11:28<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p24\" class=\"\">Each day we stand at the end of our own Parley Street. The Lord needed the strength of the women of this Church as the seeds of the Restoration were planted and nourished. And He needs us today. He needs us to speak up for what is right, even when doing so is unpopular. He needs us to develop the spiritual maturity to hear the voice of the Lord and detect the deceptions of the adversary.

Regardless of your marital status, your age, or the language you speak, you are a beloved spirit daughter of Heavenly Father who is destined to play a critical part in the onward movement of the gospel kingdom. Eliza R. Snow proclaimed that \u201cit is the <span class=\"emphasis\">duty<\/span> of each one of us to be a holy woman. \u2026 There is no sister so isolated, and her sphere so narrow but what she can do a great deal towards establishing the Kingdom of God upon the earth\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Woman\u2019s Exponent,<\/span> 15 Sept. 1873, 62; emphasis added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p28\" class=\"\">Remember Grandma?
