That which caught and held my attention was not the beautifully designed sofa nor the comfortable-appearing chair that stood at its side. Neither was it the beautiful chandelier positioned overhead.

Such was my experience of some years ago when, as a mission president, I was afforded the privilege of guiding the activities of precious young men and women, even missionaries whom he had called.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/finishers-wanted.p70\" class=\"\">Some had problems, others required motivation; but one came to me in utter despair. He had made his decision to leave the mission field when but at the halfway mark. His bags were packed, his return ticket purchased. He came by to bid me farewell. We talked; we listened; we prayed. There remained hidden the actual reason for his decision to quit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/finishers-wanted.p71\" class=\"\">As we arose from our knees in the quiet of my office, the missionary began to weep. Flexing the muscle in his strong right arm, he blurted out, \u201cThis is my problem. All through school my muscle power qualified me for honors in football and track, but my mental power was neglected. President Monson, I\u2019m ashamed of my school record. It reveals that \u2018with effort\u2019 I have the capacity to read at but the level of the fourth grade. I can\u2019t even read the Book of Mormon. How then can I understand its contents and teach others its truths?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/finishers-wanted.p72\" class=\"\">The silence of the room was broken by my young nine-year-old son, who, without knocking, opened the door and, with surprise, apologetically said, \u201cExcuse me. I just wanted to put this book back on the shelf.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/finishers-wanted.p73\" class=\"\">He handed me the book. Its title: <span class=\"emphasis\">A Child\u2019s Story of the Book of Mormon, <\/span>by Dr. Deta P. Neeley. I turned to the foreword and read these words: \u201cThis book has been written with a scientifically controlled vocabulary to the level of the fourth grade.\u201d A sincere prayer from an honest heart had been dramatically answered.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/finishers-wanted.p74\" class=\"\">My missionary accepted the challenge to read the book. Half laughing, half crying, he declared, \u201cIt will be good to read something I can understand.\u201d Clouds of despair were dispelled by the sunshine of hope. He completed an honorable mission. He became a finisher.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/finishers-wanted.p75\" class=\"\">Today I think I shall once more walk by that furniture store in our city and again gaze at the small sign in the large show window, that I may indelibly impress upon my mind the true meaning of its words: \u201cFinishers Wanted.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/finishers-wanted.p76\" class=\"\">I pray humbly that each one of us may be a finisher in the race of life and thus qualify for that precious prize: eternal life with our Heavenly Father in the celestial kingdom. I testify that God lives, that this is his work, and ask that each may follow the example of his Son, a true finisher, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Note<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-03020_000_030\"><a name=\"-03020_000_030\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-03020_000_030\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Joe Darion, \u201cThe Impossible Dream,\u201d Sam Fox, Publisher, New York, 1965.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
