He asked each of us to give our very best efforts to assisting missionaries in finding persons to teach. He also asked that each stake president and each bishop \u201caccept full responsibility and accountability for the finding and friendshipping of investigators\u201d within their units (107).

I believe we acquire this desire in two steps.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p16\" class=\"\">First, we must have a firm testimony of the truth and importance of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.

I learned this lesson as a young man. I was assigned to visit a less-active member, a successful professional many years older than I. Looking back on my actions, I realize that I had very little loving concern for the man I visited. I acted out of duty, with a desire to report 100 percent on my home teaching. One evening, close to the end of a month, I phoned to ask if my companion and I could come right over and visit him. His chastening reply taught me an unforgettable lesson.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe I want you to come over this evening,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m tired.

Just as our desires must be pure and rooted in testimony and love, our actions must be directed by the Lord. It is His work, not ours, and it must be done in His way and on His timing, not ours. Otherwise, our efforts may be fated to frustration and failure.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p27\" class=\"\">All of us have family members or friends who need the gospel but are not now interested. To be effective, our efforts with them must be directed by the Lord so that we act in the way and at the time when they will be most receptive. We must pray for the Lord\u2019s help and directions so we can be instruments in His hands for one who is now ready\u2014one He would have us help today.

Revelation comes most often when we are on the move.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p33\" class=\"\">The Lord has given us this instruction as to <span class=\"emphasis\">who<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">how:<\/span> \u201cAnd let your preaching be \u2026 every man to his neighbor, in mildness and in meekness\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11113\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11113)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11113)\">D&amp;C 38:41<\/a><\/span>). \u201cNeighbors,\u201d of course, means not only those who live beside us and other friends and associates.

Its address is www.mormon.org. For missionaries, the value and use of this new resource will emerge with experience.
