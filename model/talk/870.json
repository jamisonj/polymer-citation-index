We are\nfearful that sometime we may depend upon ourselves alone, and we know that if we should\nour words would be as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"278\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 278)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(278)\">1 Cor. 13:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow I know that I cannot say anything that will be new to members of the Church. I cannot\nsay anything that has not been said many times before, and of course better said, but I am\nencouraged by the announcement of the President that we are favored this morning with the\npresence of many of our friends, both in the Tabernacle and in the radio and television\naudience, whom he has welcomed as our invited guests. May I assume that some of you, our\nbrothers and sisters who are not in the Church, might be interested in a very brief review of\nsome of the teachings and practices of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which\ndistinguish it, for it is somewhat unique.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are not Catholic, Protestant, nor Jewish, and yet this disclaimer should not be taken to\nmean we are not Christian. You who heard the powerful address of President Clark this\nmorning will know that we are Christians, for central to everything we believe and teach is\nour faith that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. We are grateful for our Judeo-Christian\nheritage, for the Holy Bible which we accept without reservation as the word of God, except\nas to some errors that have crept in through translation\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6708\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6708)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6708)\">A of F 1:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBut the difference between us and other churches lies in our faith in and proclamation of what\nwe believe to be the most important message that has come to this earth since Christ lived\namong men. We make that statement because we believe that the restoration of the gospel was\nintroduced by Jesus Christ personally, and therefore there could be no more important\nmessage.\n<\/p><p>\nNow when we say, as we do say, that there has been a divine restoration of the apostolic\nChurch, with all of the power and authority thereof, we are aware that it presupposes, and we\ndeclare, that there was a need for a restoration; that there had been an apostasy; that during\nthe middle and dark ages there was spiritual stagnation. If it is not true that there was an\napostasy, then our declaration of a restoration is superficial and meaningless. If it is true that\nthere has been a restoration, then all men everywhere should know of it, for the gospel of the\nkingdom must be preached to all the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34812\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34812)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34812)\">Matt. 24:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe apostles and prophets predicted an apostasy, and great historians such as Mosheim and\nEusebius record it as a fact. We are not alone among the churches in proclaiming a universal\napostasy. The Church of England frankly sets it forth in the following words: \n<\/p><p>\nSo that laity and clergy, learned and unlearned, all ages, sects, and degrees of men,\nwomen, and children of whole Christendom . . . have been at once drowned in\nabominable idolatry . . . and that by the space of eight hundred years and more.\n(Homily against Peril of Idolatry.)\n<\/p><p>\nJohn Wesley, one of the founders of Methodism, comments as follows on the early decline of\nspiritual power and the cessation of the divine gifts and graces within the Church: \n<\/p><p>\nIt does not appear that these extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit were common in the\nChurch for more than two or three centuries. We seldom hear of them after that fatal\nperiod when the Emperor Constantine called himself a Christian . . . From this time\nthey almost totally ceased, very few instances of the kind being found. The cause of\nthis was not, as has been supposed, because there was no more occasion for them,\nbecause all the world was become Christians. This is a miserable mistake; not a\ntwentieth part of it was then nominally Christian. The real cause of it was that the love\nof many, almost all Christians, so-called, was waxed cold\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34810\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34810)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34810)\">Matt. 24:12<\/a><\/span>). The Christians had no more\nof the spirit of Christ than the other heathens . . . This was the real cause why the\nextraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost were no longer to be found in the Christian\nchurch&mdash;because the Christians were turned heathens again, and only had a dead form\nleft (John Wesley's <i>Works<\/i>, Vol. VII, 89; 26-27).\n<\/p><p>\nPeter said the time would come when men would not endure sound doctrine, but after their\nown lusts they should heap unto themselves teachers having itching ears\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5123\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5123)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5123)\">2 Tim. 4:3<\/a><\/span>). The Apostle Paul\nwarned against the intrusion of falsehoods and said,\n<\/p><p>\nThat ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor\nby letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.<br \/>\nLet no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come\na falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;<br \/>\nWho opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped;\nso that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5037\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5037)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5037)\">2 Thes. 2:2-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJohn, on the Isle of Patmos, beheld the great dragon that should overcome the Church, and\nthat that dragon should have power in all nations, kindreds, and tongues\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42260\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42260)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42260)\">Rev. 13:7<\/a><\/span>). All of these things\nbeing predicted, and now recorded by the historians, justifies at least in a measure our\nstatement that following that apostasy there has been a restoration.\n<\/p><p>\nPerhaps you, our friends, ask what was restored that we did not have before? We humbly, but\nwithout equivocation, reply that the kingdom of God has been set up upon the earth,\norganized under his divine guidance&mdash;the very kingdom for which you and Christians in all\nnations and climes have been praying since Jesus first taught the Lord's Prayer to his apostles,\nthe central thought of which is, \"Thy kingdom come\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34763\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34763)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34763)\">Matt. 6:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe announce the organization of the kingdom which Jesus commanded all men to make the\nfirst object of their search when he said, \". . . seek ye first the kingdom of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34769\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34769)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34769)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>).\nWe believe this is the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times of which the Apostle Paul spoke,\n<\/p><p>\nThat in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all\nthings in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21683\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21683)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21683)\">Eph. 1:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow you, my friends, may think it presumptuous for us to claim that this is the Church and\nkingdom of God&mdash;and it would be presumptuous if we said men had organized it, or that\nmen were responsible for its restoration. That certainly men were chosen and had part in it is\ntrue. But it is not presumptuous to announce that the God of heaven has set up his kingdom\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10633\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10633)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10633)\">Dan. 2:44<\/a><\/span>),\nfor he did it pursuant to divine decree, and in harmony with what the apostles and prophets of\nold saw in holy vision.\n<\/p><p>\nIt has been said that history repeats itself, but someone recently observed: \"We learn from\nhistory that we do not learn from history.\" Christians have often wondered how the Jews\ncould have rejected Christ when they had been hoping and praying through the centuries for\nthe coming of the promised Messiah. Let us add to our prayer \"Thy kingdom come\"&mdash;also\ncenturies old&mdash;a petition that we may not reject it when it comes.\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe that this kingdom is now set up in order that the will of God might be done in the\nearth as it is in heaven (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34764\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34764)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34764)\">Matt. 6:10<\/a><\/span>),\nand that it is preparatory to the second coming of the Son of God. We\nbelieve it is the kingdom which Daniel saw. All of you will remember reading the story of the\nking of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, who had a dream in which he saw a great image with a\nhead of gold, shoulders and arms of silver, body of brass, legs of iron, and feet and toes of\niron and clay. You will remember that the king called in his wise men but could not get the\ninterpretation of his dream, that he sent for Daniel who, when asked if he could interpret the\ndream, said, \"There is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known what shall\nbe in the latter days\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10629\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10629)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10629)\">Dan. 2:28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen he said,\n<\/p><p>\nThou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom,\npower, and strength, and glory (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10630\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10630)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10630)\">Dan. 2:37<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHe went on to say the king had power and control over all things, and then he said, \"Thou art\nthis head of gold\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10631\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10631)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10631)\">Dan. 2:38<\/a><\/span>).\nThen Daniel, with prophetic insight, and in amazing detail, foresaw the\nrise and fall of the nations of the earth&mdash;the great Babylonian empire, represented by the\nhead of gold, the Medo-Persian empire, by the shoulders and arms of silver, the Greek, by the\nbrass, the divided kingdom of Rome, by the legs of iron, and the feet and toes which\nrepresented the divided kingdoms of Europe and the world, which would not cleave together,\nand, said Daniel, \". . . in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom,\nwhich shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10634\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10634)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10634)\">Dan. 2:44<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIs it presumptuous for us to say that that prophecy has been literally fulfilled? Do you not\nthink it likely that inasmuch as Daniel saw so accurately the rise and fall of these kingdoms,\neach in turn, that the latter part of his great prophetic declaration must be also fulfilled? If the\nkingdom of God is not on the earth, then we believe firmly that that part of Daniel's vision\nwill yet be fulfilled.\n<\/p><p>\nThat it has been and is being fulfilled in these latter days we humbly declare. We should like\nto say to you, our friends, that there is a way that you may know whether what we say is true\nor false. Paraphrasing an ancient prophet, we exhort you who hear these things that you ask\nGod the Eternal Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, if what we say is true, and if you will\nask in faith, he will reveal the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38266\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38266)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38266)\">Moro. 10:4<\/a><\/span>). That is a\npromise made under the inspiration of the Spirit of God to all who will hear and put it to the\ntest.\n<\/p><p>\nHundreds of thousands of people from almost every country have put it to the test, and over a\nmillion and a quarter of them will testify, each in his own tongue, that they did ask God the\nEternal Father whether these things are true, and that he did reveal the truth of it unto them. I\nhumbly and sincerely declare to you that God has revealed to me the truth of the prophet's\ndeclaration of the restoration of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, pursuant to John's\nrevelation when he said: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to\npreach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and\ntongue, and people,<br \/>\nSaying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his\njudgment is come (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42265\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42265)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42265)\">Rev. 14:6-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHumbly I bear witness to the truth of the declaration of the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints that that angel has flown; that Christ has appeared; that other heavenly\nbeings have visited the earth and restored the priesthood; that the kingdom of God is set up;\nand that the Savior will come to this earth and reign as King of kings and Lord of lords\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42267\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42267)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42267)\">Rev. 19:16<\/a><\/span>)\npursuant to promise, to which I testify humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
