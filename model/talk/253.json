And in order that I may\nget it before us properly, I intend to read statements from President Brigham Young and other\nAuthorities, because their statements will have far greater weight than anything that I might\nsay. What I am going to talk about is marriage.\n<\/p><p>\nPRESIDENT BRIGHAM YOUNG'S COUNSEL ON MARRIAGE\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Brigham Young, in giving a counsel to the members of the Church said:\n<\/p><p>\nWhen a man and woman have received their endowments and sealings, and then had children\nborn to them afterwards, those children are legal heirs to the kingdom and to all its blessings\nand promises, and they are the only ones that are on this earth. There is not a young man in\nour community who would not be willing to travel from here to England to be married right,\nif he understood things as they are; there is not a young woman in our community, who loves\nthe gospel and wishes its blessings, that would be married in any other way; they would live\nunmarried until they. . . were as old as Sarah before she had Isaac born to her. Many of our\nbrethren have married off their children without taking this into consideration, and thinking it\na matter of little importance. I wish we all understood this in the light in which heaven\nunderstands it (<i>Discourses of Brigham Young<\/i>, pp. 195-196, 1934 edition).\n<\/p><p>\nAgain:\n<\/p><p>\nBe careful, O ye mothers in Israel, and do not teach your daughters in the future, as many of\nthem have been taught, to marry out of Israel. Woe to you who do it; you will lose your\ncrowns as sure as God lives (<i>Ibid.<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I would hardly dare say that. Again:\n<\/p><p>\nWhat was the cause of the first, or one of the first, curses that came upon Israel? I will tell\nyou. One of the first transgressions of the family called Israel, was their going to other\nfamilies or other nations to select partners. This was one of the great mistakes made by the\nchildren of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, for they would go and marry with other families,\nalthough the Lord had forbidden them to do so, and had given them a very strict and stringent\nlaw on the subject. He commanded them not to marry among the Gentiles\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23513\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23513)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23513)\">Gen. 1:1-6<\/a><\/span>), but they did and\nwould do it. Inasmuch as they would not do what he required of them, then he gave them\nwhat I call a portion of the law of carnal commandments. This law told them what they might\nand whom they might not marry. It was referred to by the Savior and his\napostles, and it was a grievous yoke to place on the necks of any people; but as the children\nof this family would run after Babylon, and after the pride and the vanity and evils of the\nworld, and seek to introduce them into Israel, the Lord saw fit to place this burden upon\nthem (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, pp. 196-197).\n<\/p><p>\nAgain:\n<\/p><p>\nHow is it with you, sisters? Do you distinguish between a man of God and a man of the\nworld? It is one of the strangest things that happens in my existence, to think that any man or\nwoman can love a being that will not receive the truth of heaven. The love this gospel\nproduces is far above the love of women; it is the love of God&mdash;the love of eternity&mdash;of eternal\nlives (<i>Ibid.<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>\nADVICE TO MARRY IN THE CHURCH\n<\/p><p>\nNow this from President Joseph F. Smith:\n<\/p><p>\nI would rather go myself to the grave than to be associated with a wife outside of the bonds\nof the new and everlasting covenant. Now, I hold it just so sacred; but some members of the\nChurch do not so regard the matter. Some people feel that it does not make very much\ndifference whether a girl marries a man in the Church, full of the faith of the gospel, or an\nunbeliever. Some of our young people have married outside of the Church; but very few of\nthose who have done it have failed to come to grief. I would like to see Latter-day Saint men\nmarry Latter-day Saint women; and Methodists marry Methodists, Catholics marry Catholics;\nand Presbyterians marry Presbyterians, and so on to the limit. Let them keep within the pale\nof their own faith and church, and marry and intermarry there, and let the Latter-day Saints\ndo the same thing in their Church. Then we will see who comes out best in the end.\n(<i>Gospel Doctrine<\/i>, p. 380, 1919 edition).\n<\/p><p>\nThis from Elder Orson Pratt, which was delivered by appointment and endorsed by President\nBrigham Young:\n<\/p><p>\nWe cannot feel justified in closing this article on the subject of marriage without saying a few\nwords to unmarried females in this Church.\n<\/p><p>\n(May I pause at this point long enough to say that while he is speaking to females, it is just as\ntrue of males, and we could insert that term just as well as to speak of females, so keep that\nin mind.)\n<\/p><p>\nYou will clearly perceive, from the revelation which God has given, that you can never\nobtain a fulness of glory, without being married to a righteous man for time and for all\neternity. If you marry a man who receives not the gospel, you lay a foundation for sorrow in\nthis world, besides losing the privilege of enjoying the society of a husband in eternity. You\nforfeit your right to an endless increase of immortal lives. And even the children which you\nmay be favoured with in this life, will not be entrusted to your charge in eternity, but you\nwill be left in that world without a husband, without a family, without a kingdom, without\nany means of enlarging yourselves, being subject to the principalities and powers who are\ncounted worthy of families, and kingdoms, and thrones, and the increase of dominions\nforever. To them you will be servants and angels&mdash;that is, provided that your conduct should\nbe such as to secure this measure of glory. Can it be possible that any females, after knowing\nthese things, will suffer themselves to keep company with persons out of this Church?\n<\/p><p>\nIt matters not how great the morality of such persons may be, nor how kind they may be to\nyou, they are not numbered with the people of God; they are not in the way of salvation, they\ncannot save themselves nor their families, and after what God has revealed upon this subject,\nyou cannot be justified, for one moment, in keeping their company. It would be infinitely\nbetter for you to suffer poverty and tribulation with the people of God, than to place\nyourselves under the power of those who will not embrace the great truth of heaven. By\nmarrying an unbeliever, you place yourselves in open disobedience to the command of God\nrequiring his people to gather together. Do you expect to be saved in direct violation of the\ncommand of heaven? (<i>Millennial Star<\/i>, XV: 584).\n<\/p><p>\nONLY COVENANTS MADE BY GOD ARE ETERNAL\n<\/p><p>\nI have some other quotations on another phase, but I want to refer now to what the Lord has\nsaid in a revelation to the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nWill I accept of an offering, saith the Lord, that is not made in my name? Or will I receive at\nyour hands that which I have not appointed? And will I appoint unto you, saith the Lord,\nexcept it be by law, even as I and my Father ordained unto you, before the world was? I am\nthe Lord thy God; and I give unto you this commandment&mdash;that no man shall come unto the\nFather but by me or by my word, which is my law, saith the Lord. And everything that is in\nthe world, whether it be ordained of men, by thrones, or principalities, or powers, or things of\nname, whatsoever they may be, that are not by me or by my word, saith the Lord, shall be\nthrown down, and shall not remain after men are dead, neither in nor after the resurrection,\nsaith the Lord your God. For whatsoever things remain are by me; and whatsoever things are\nnot by me shall be shaken and destroyed\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12319\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12319)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12319)\">D&amp;C 132:9-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I challenge anybody on the face of the earth to disprove this argument. I say it is sound.\nIt is common sense. It is the gospel of Jesus Christ. It cannot be successfully disputed. That\nbeing true, then the Lord says:\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my\nword, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant\nand marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world;\ntherefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world. Therefore, when\nthey are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are appointed\nangels in heaven; which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy\nof a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12320\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12320)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12320)\">D&amp;C 132:15-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIMPORTANCE OF ETERNAL MARRIAGE\n<\/p><p>\nThere is much more here, and you are acquainted with it. I do not need to read it, but I want\nto call your attention to the fact that a great many of our beautiful girls and our fine young\nmen that have been born under the covenant are being married out of the Church and out of\nthe temple of God. Furthermore, I have discovered by reading the newspapers that the parents\nof many of these young people seem to rejoice in it, and so they put big articles and fine\npictures in the papers in regard to the entertainments, the receptions, that are going to be\ngiven, and they seem to be very proud of the fact that their daughters are to\nbe married or their sons are to be married and they are going to be married by some minister\nof some other church, maybe by a bishop of this Church who can only marry them for\ntime&mdash;he cannot marry them for eternity&mdash;and they seem to be happy about it. I do not know\nhow they can, in the face of all that the Lord has revealed. For every contract, every bond,\nevery covenant that is made that is not according to the Lord's will and commandment, and\nenforced by his law will of necessity come to an end\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12318\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12318)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12318)\">D&amp;C 132:7<\/a><\/span>). These young people who seem to be so\nhappy now, when they rise in the resurrection, and find themselves in the condition in which\nthey will find themselves, then there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth,\nbitterness of soul, and they have brought it upon themselves because of their lack of faith and\nunderstanding of the gospel, and from, I am sorry to say, the encouragement they have\nreceived many times from their own parents.\n<\/p><p>\nI am quite satisfied in my own mind that the parents are not teaching their children in the\nhome the importance of marriage as the Lord has revealed it. Out in the world they have a\nfalse notion about marriage, because they have not the guidance of the Holy Ghost, and they\ncannot understand and properly interpret the scriptures.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first marriage that was ever performed in this world, that is on this earth, let me say; not\nin this world, but on this earth&mdash;was performed before there was any death. What the Lord\nsaid in answering the question of the Jews:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34098\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34098)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34098)\">Matt. 19:6<\/a><\/span>),\n<\/p><p>\nmeans nothing more nor less than this: that where God joins in marriage, man cannot put it\nasunder. And the Lord never does anything just for time. Everything is for eternity.\n<\/p><p>\nTEMPLE FOR WORTHY MEMBERS\n<\/p><p>\nTo those who are satisfied with a marriage for time only, I want to raise a warning voice, to\nboth parents and to the children who have that sort of idea. Of course there are people who\nare not worthy to go to the temple, and therefore should not go to the temple. No one should\ngo to the temple except those who are worthy, as the Lord has said, \"who have overcome by\nfaith,\" and are cleansed and are just and true\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12271\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12271)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12271)\">D&amp;C 76:53<\/a><\/span>).\nThen they can go to the temple. If they are\nunclean, if they lack the faith, they had better stay out until they get the faith and are clean.\n<\/p><p>\nI wanted to say those few things.\n<\/p><p>\nLORD'S COMMAND TO MULTIPLY\n<\/p><p>\nNow, just for a moment or two in regard to another matter closely connected with this. When\nyoung people are married properly, the Lord commands them to multiply\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23514\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23514)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23514)\">Gen. 1:28<\/a><\/span>).\nNow that is not in accord with the teachings of the world, nor the practice of the world,\nespecially the practice, and so I want to read one or two other passages now; this from\nPresident Young:\n<\/p><p>\nThere are multitudes of pure and holy spirits waiting to take tabernacles, now what is our\nduty?&mdash;To prepare tabernacles for them; to take a course that will not tend to drive those\nspirits into the families of the wicked, where they will be trained in wickedness, debauchery,\nand every species of crime. It is the duty of every righteous man and woman to prepare\ntabernacles for all the spirits they can.\n<\/p><p>\nTo check the increase of our race has its advocates among the influential and powerful circles\nof society in our nation and in other nations. The same practice existed forty-five years ago,\nand various devices were used by married persons to prevent the expenses and responsibilities\nof a family of children, which they must have incurred had they suffered nature's laws to rule\npre-eminent. That which was practiced then in fear and against reproving conscience, is now\nboldly trumpeted abroad as one of the best means of ameliorating the miseries and sorrows of\nhumanity. Infanticide is very prevalent in our nation. It is a crime that comes within the\npurview of the law, and is therefore not so boldly practiced as is the other equally great\ncrime, which, no doubt, to a great extent, prevents the necessity of infanticide. The unnatural\nstyle of living, the extensive use of narcotics, the attempt to destroy and dry up the fountains\nof life, are fast destroying the American element of the nation; it is passing away before the\nincrease of the more healthy, robust, honest, and less sinful class of the people which are\npouring into the country daily from the old world (<i>Discourses of Brigham Young<\/i>, p. 197,\n1943 edition).\n<\/p><p>\nNow I think you bishops, you presidents of stakes, and you presidents of the quorums of the\npriesthood, ought to consider these things most carefully, and be prepared to teach the people\nthat which the Lord would have them taught, and when our teachers go to visit them in their\nhomes, let them teach the revelations of the Living God and magnify their callings. This I\npray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
