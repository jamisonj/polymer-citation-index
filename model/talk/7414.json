As I have expressed gratitude to my Heavenly Father for these marvelous blessings and opportunities, I have realized, perhaps more than ever before, how critical the formative years of my life were.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p7\" class=\"\">Many of the most important and life-changing moments of my life occurred when I was a young man. The lessons I learned then formed my character and shaped my destiny. Without them, I would be a very different man and in a very different place than I am today. This evening, I would like to talk for a few minutes about some of these experiences and what I learned from them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p8\" class=\"\">I\u2019ll never forget one high school football game against a rival school. I played the wingback position, and my assignment was to either block the linebacker or try to get open so the quarterback could throw me the ball. The reason I remember this particular game so well is because the fellow on the other side of the line\u2014the man I was supposed to block\u2014was a giant.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p9\" class=\"\">I wasn\u2019t exactly the tallest athlete in the world. But I think this other guy may have been. I remember looking up at him, thinking he probably weighed as much as two of me. Keep in mind, when I played we didn\u2019t have the protective gear that players have today. My helmet was made of leather, and it didn\u2019t have a face guard.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p10\" class=\"\">The more I thought about it, the more I came to a sobering realization: if I ever let him catch me, I could be cheering for my team the rest of the season from a hospital bed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p11\" class=\"\">Lucky for me, I was fast. And for the better part of the first half, I managed to avoid him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p12\" class=\"\">Except for one play.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p13\" class=\"\">Our quarterback dropped back to pass. I was open. He threw the ball, and it sailed towards me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p14\" class=\"\">The only problem was that I could hear a lumbering gallop behind me. In a moment of clarity, I thought that if I caught the ball there was a distinct possibility I could be eating my meals through a tube. But the ball was heading for me, and my team was depending on me. So I reached out, and\u2014at the last instant\u2014I looked up.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p15\" class=\"\">And there he was.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p16\" class=\"\">I remember the ball hitting my hands. I remember struggling to hang on to it. I remember the sound of the ball falling to the turf. After that, I\u2019m not exactly sure what happened, because the giant hit me so hard I wasn\u2019t sure what planet I was on. One thing I did remember was a deep voice coming from behind a dark haze: \u201cServes you right for being on the wrong team.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p17\" class=\"\">William McKinley Oswald was my high school football coach. He was a great coach and had a profound influence on my life. But I think he could have learned his method of motivating players from an army drill sergeant.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p18\" class=\"\">That day, during his half-time speech, Coach Oswald reminded the whole team about the pass I had dropped. Then he pointed right at me and said, \u201cHow could you do that?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p19\" class=\"\">He wasn\u2019t speaking with his inside voice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cI want to know what made you drop that pass.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p21\" class=\"\">I stammered for a moment and then finally decided to tell the truth. \u201cI took my eye off the ball,\u201d I said.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p22\" class=\"\">The coach looked at me and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right; you took your eye off the ball. Don\u2019t ever do that again. That kind of mistake loses ball games.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p23\" class=\"\">I respected Coach Oswald, and in spite of how terrible I felt, I made up my mind to do what Coach said. I vowed to never take my eye off the ball again, even if it meant getting pounded to Mongolia by the giant on the other side of the line.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p24\" class=\"\">We headed back onto the field and started the second half. It was a close game, and even though my team had played well, we were behind by four points late in the fourth quarter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p25\" class=\"\">The quarterback called my number on the next play. I went out again, and again I was open. The ball headed towards me. But this time, the giant was in front of me and in perfect position to intercept the pass.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p26\" class=\"\">He reached up, but the ball sailed through his hands. I jumped high, never taking my eye off the ball; stabbed at it; and pulled it down for the game-winning touchdown.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p27\" class=\"\">I don\u2019t remember much about the celebration after, but I do remember the look on Coach Oswald\u2019s face.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cWay to keep your eye on the ball,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p29\" class=\"\">I think I smiled for a week.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p30\" class=\"\">I have known many great men and women. Although they have different backgrounds, talents, and perspectives, they all have this in common: they work diligently and persistently towards achieving their goals. It\u2019s easy to get distracted and lose focus on the things that are most important in life. I\u2019ve tried to remember the lessons I learned from Coach Oswald and prioritize values that are important to me so that I can keep my eye focused on things that really matter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p31\" class=\"\">I urge you to examine your life.

It was the Rocky Mountain Conference championship game, and the play called for me to run the ball up the middle to score the go-ahead touchdown. I took the handoff and plunged into the line. I knew I was close to the goal line, but I didn\u2019t know how close. Although I was pinned at the bottom of the pile, I reached my fingers forward a couple of inches and I could feel it. The goal line was two inches away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p35\" class=\"\">At that moment I was tempted to push the ball forward. I could have done it. And when the refs finally pulled the players off the pile, I would have been a hero. No one would have ever known.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p36\" class=\"\">I had dreamed of this moment from the time I was a boy. And it was right there within my reach. But then I remembered the words of my mother. \u201cJoseph,\u201d she had often said to me, \u201cdo what is right, no matter the consequence. Do what is right and things will turn out OK.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p37\" class=\"\">I wanted so desperately to score that touchdown. But more than being a hero in the eyes of my friends, I wanted to be a hero in the eyes of my mother. And so I left the ball where it was\u2014two inches from the goal line.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p38\" class=\"\">I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but this was a defining experience. Had I moved the ball, I could have been a champion for a moment, but the reward of temporary glory would have carried with it too steep and too lasting a price. It would have engraved upon my conscience a scar that would have stayed with me the remainder of my life. I knew I must do what is right.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p39\" class=\"\">The Light of Christ helps us to discern right from wrong. When we allow temptations to drown out the still voice of our conscience\u2014that is when decisions become difficult.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p40\" class=\"\">My parents taught me to react quickly when temptation comes and to say \u201cNo!\u201d instantly and emphatically. I recommend that same counsel to you. Avoid temptations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p41\" class=\"\">Another lesson I learned was the joy of service to others. I have spoken before of how my father, who was the bishop of our ward, had me load up my wagon and deliver needed food and supplies to the homes of those families who were in need. He wasn\u2019t alone in his desire to reach out to those in distress.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p42\" class=\"\">Seventy-five years ago, Bishop William F. Perschon presided over the Fourth Ward of the Pioneer Stake in Salt Lake City. He was a German immigrant, a convert to the Church, and he spoke with a thick accent. He was a fine businessman, but what most distinguished him was his great compassion for others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p43\" class=\"\">Each week during priesthood meeting, Bishop Perschon had the Aaronic Priesthood bearers recite the following phrase: \u201cPriesthood means service; bearing the priesthood, I will serve.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p44\" class=\"\">It wasn\u2019t merely a slogan. When widows needed assistance, Bishop Perschon and the Aaronic Priesthood were there to help. When a chapel was being built, Bishop Perschon and the Aaronic Priesthood were there. When the sugar beets and potatoes at the welfare farm needed weeding or harvesting, Bishop Perschon and the Aaronic Priesthood were there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p45\" class=\"\">Later, William Perschon served in the stake presidency, where he influenced a young bishop by the name of Thomas S. Monson. In the 1950s, Bishop Perschon was called to preside over the Swiss-Austrian Mission and played an instrumental role in building the first \u201coverseas\u201d temple, located in Bern, Switzerland.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/lifes-lessons-learned.p46\" class=\"\">You could scarcely think of Bishop Perschon without thinking of his concern and compassion for others and his untiring commitment to teach that same quality to others. Of the young men in the Aaronic Priesthood over whom he presided as bishop, 29 went on to become bishops themselves. Ten served in stake presidencies. Five became mission presidents, three accepted calls as temple presidents, and two served as General Authorities.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-00605_000_020\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Letter from Elder Glen L.
