Hanks, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1967, pp. 57-61<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nWith President Tanner, I too believe in prayer, and learned long ago that there are occasions\nwhen, perhaps not very literally but with utmost earnestness, we say, \"Lord, help me now,\"\nand I pray to that effect this morning.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Youth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe are told that this broadcast is going to beloved Britain, and so it is appropriate that I\nbegin by noting that in the foyer of a church building in a British city a time ago, I happened\nby a group of older ladies who were discussing somewhat critically the behavior of several\nyoung members of the congregation who had just walked noisily by.  I had observed the\nincident and had thought the young people a bit exuberant, but not objectionably so.  The\nladies disagreed. As I passed by I heard one of them disapprovingly say, \"Ah, well, what can\nyou expect from this younger generation, anyway!\"\n<\/p><p>\nI did not agree with her implication, but I take her rhetorical question very seriously,\nbelieving that the answer is of vital significance.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat can be expected of this younger generation?\n<\/p><p>\nThere are few questions more important.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>In the population<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn the first place, there are so many young people.  Most of us have heard the statement,\nsometimes uttered in solemn and hushed tones, half in apprehension, half in resignation, that\nsoon 50 percent of the population will be under age 25.\n<\/p><p>\nThe statistic is correct, the prospect sobering.  Some who speak of it do so almost as if they\nexpected that when the magic mark is reached, the older generation will relinquish their\nresponsibilities and succumb, and the young will then automatically take over] Of course, it\nwill not happen that way.  But there really are so many of them! And they are so important.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Publicity<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat kind of people are they?\n<\/p><p>\nA small, raucous, rebellious, sometimes harmless&mdash;in some cases very dangerous&mdash;minority\ngets most of the publicity.  The hippies, the drug adventurers, the motorcycle brigade, the\nflower crowd, the politically unstable, the lawless get so much press attention that there is an\nunquestionable effect on the style of life and the way of thinking of multitudes of youngsters\neverywhere.\n<\/p><p>\nSpeaking of the discontented ones, a writer has recently said: \"So far I have seen or heard\nvery little in the way of constructive suggestions from them.  What fruitful insights and\nprograms have they to offer us?  I can't help wondering [as they criticize their adult\ngeneration] if they ever wonder what <i>their<\/i> children will have to thank <i>them<\/i> for.  For fouling\ntheir chromosomes with LSD? For dropping out and copping out at a time when society was\nnever in greater need of their participation?  What are their credentials for billing themselves\nas the take-over generation?\" (Albert Rosenfeld.)\n<\/p><p>\nWe cannot afford to underestimate or ignore their influence.\n<\/p><p>\nBut obstreperous and well publicized as they are, they constitute a small minority of the\nyoung generation.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Competent youth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe solid majority of our young people want to do well, are doing well, and intend to do well\nwith the great challenges facing them.\n<\/p><p>\nAcross the world I have found them threading their way resolutely through the maze of a\ncivilization often characterized by conflict and inconsistency, a civilization that could not exist\nexcept upon indispensable foundations in good homes, stable marriages, happy families,\nexemplary parents, yet increasingly beset by disrupted family life, contention, divorce, parents\nwho do not teach or discipline or set a good example.  The young are sensitive; they see the\ngap that exists between our stated convictions and our conduct, and they are bewildered,\nsometimes embittered.  They say that the adult generation condemns a promiscuity it\nfrequently practices, preaches peace and supports war, counsels the priority of the spiritual but\nin fact seeks first the material, talks of love but acts in self-interest, and generally represents a\nhypocrisy that cannot be admired.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Responsibility<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn all of this our generation must acknowledge some measure of guilt.\n<\/p><p>\nBut the young people can and do also take heart and direction from the unselfishness and\nsacrifice they observe in the adult generation.  They see much patience and patriotism,\ngoodness and truth, and beauty and brotherly love all about them.  They appreciate the values\nof good homes and parents who care.  They love God and their country.  They want to live\nwholesome and happy lives.  Their insights are sometimes remarkable.  I heard one of them\nsay about another, \"His parents don't like him.  He can do anything he wants.\"\n<\/p><p>\nLet me tell you about two or three of them whom I have recently met.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Resources of youth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOver the jungles of Vietnam a few months ago Brother Hinckley and I sat buckled in\nbulkhead seats in what the flying men call the \"Gooney Bird\"&mdash;the old C-47.  Alongside me\nwas a 19-year-old corporal who was serving with distinction as a chaplain's assistant.  He told\nme how he had become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Capacity for faith and action<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"I didn't like my way of life or my associations or my prospects for the future,\" he said.  \"I\nknew I was missing something.  So one day when I was 16, I went into a grove of trees near\nmy home in Colorado.  I didn't know much about prayer or God.  I had never heard of\nJoseph Smith.  I just stood there and looked up and said, 'God, I am ready for you, if you are\nready for me.'\"\n<\/p><p>\nThere was no voice, no vision, no startling experience, just sweet peace and assurance in his\nheart.\n<\/p><p>\nWithin hours, through the help of the Lord, as he testified to me, he was in touch with people\nwho introduced him to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.  His life since is a stirring youthful\nexpression of faith and great promise.  He was ready for God, and God was ready for him.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Dauntless steadfastness<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn Hong Kong I asked a young Mormon missionary how he was getting along in his efforts to\nmaster the difficult Cantonese language.  \"Just fine,\" he said.  And when I expressed mild\nsurprise at his optimism and faith in the face of heavy obstacles, he told me of the courage\nwith which his parents had met a deep personal tragedy.\n<\/p><p>\n\"With an example like that,\" he said, \"you wouldn't expect me to whine or whimper about the\nblessing of learning this choice language and teaching the gospel to this wonderful people,\nwould you, Brother Hanks?\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Heroic acceptance of trouble in \"my time\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nA high school student leader was called on to speak extemporaneously in a church meeting. \nHe responded with good feeling and good sense. He spoke briefly about the\nconflict in which our country is engaged; then with a tear in his eye, he electrified and moved\nus emotionally when he said, right off the top of his heart, \"If there has to be trouble, thank\nGod it can be in my time. I don't want my little brother or the son I hope someday to have to\nhave to fight a war on these or other shores.  If there has to be trouble, thank God it can be\nin my time.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWell, what can we expect from the younger generation?  Everything good, creative, decent,\nwholesome, uplifting, if we help them, and if somehow they come to a knowledge of what\nmakes for happiness, makes for joy.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Cultivate the attributes we honor<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nPlato said, \"What is honored in a country will be cultivated there.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Pericles said, \"The young draw strength not from twice-told arguments, but from the\nbusy spectacle of our great city's life as we have it before us day by day.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHow can we help them?\n<\/p><p>\nWe can be more consistent in our lives.  We can provide a better example. We can repent. \nWe can obey the commandments of God.  We can teach them.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Charity out of a pure heart<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nDo you remember the stirring statement of the Apostle Paul to his young brother in the\ngospel, Timothy: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . the end of the commandment [I suppose he meant the result of obedience to the\ncommandments] is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith\nunfeigned\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2829\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2829)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2829)\">1 Tim. 1:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe promise is valid and personally relevant to all of us.  Paul&mdash;he of great intellect and\nstrong training and shattering experience; he who had persecuted, and then been turned\naround, and who thereafter gave his full measure to the better way&mdash;he knew the really\nimportant values of life.  His testimony to Timothy was that in good conscience, in\nwholesome, happy relationships with our families and fellowmen, and in the true faith that\ngrants us confidence in the presence of God lie the real blessings of life.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Conscience \"spark of celestial\" light<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIs good conscience important?  It is a prize beyond expression! And conscience is more than a\nlocal standard or the accumulation of the mores and traditions of a community or a society or\na generation.  Whatever else it is, it is the voice of God speaking to us, inspiring moral\nobligation.  Washington called it \"that little spark of celestial fire.\" It is true that we can\ndesensitize our conscience, as it were. In the Book of Mormon we read of a group to whom\nGod had spoken \"in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1643\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1643)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1643)\">1 Ne. 17:45<\/a><\/span>). It is also said\nthat there are those who have become \"dead as to things pertaining unto righteousness\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9075\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9075)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9075)\">Alma 5:42<\/a><\/span>).  As we\ncan desensitize a conscience, so to speak, so we can prepare ourselves better to hear the voice\nof the Lord by stripping off what the poet called the layers of \"muddy vesture and decay,\" by\nceasing to sin and learning to obey.  There is the privilege of learning true values and living\nto them.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"When I do good I feel good\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAbraham Lincoln is credited with a simple summation of conscience and the way to live with\njoy: \"When I do good I feel good, and when I don't do good I don't feel good.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNo one can be truly happy who has a bad conscience, and bad conscience is the inevitable\nresult of conduct below the level of our understanding.\n<\/p><p>\n\"We live in a universe of moral law. We can choose evil and get what we want right now and\nthen pay for it afterward. Or we can choose good and pay for it first, before we get it.\"\n(Fosdick.) So it is with a life of honesty and responsibility, of sexual purity, of integrity, of\nselfless service. The blessing is substantial and sweet and satisfying&mdash;worth everything,\nworth working and waiting for.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Marks of moral and spiritual maturity<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Paul spoke of charity out of the \"pure heart\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2830\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2830)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2830)\">1 Tim. 1:5<\/a><\/span>), I believe he was talking\nabout the sense of honest, unselfish concern for others that is the mark of moral and spiritual\nmaturity. To accept the responsibilities as well as the benefits of loving, loyal membership in\na family is a high challenge to a teenager tempted on all sides by other peer and worldly\nloyalties.  To truly care about others, to be considerate and kind and responsible reflects true\nmaturity.  The rebel group we have mentioned is expressing the selfishness of babyhood and\nthe rebelliousness of early youth.  In babies and in children these are natural expressions of\nstages of living, which, sublimated and disciplined as maturity comes, become appropriate\nself-concern and self-reliance.  In a generation charged with major responsibilities amid great\ncomplexities, these characteristics are not worthy. Beyond the give me and the \"let me alone,\ndon't tell me what to do\" stages is that level of life which leads us to say, \"How can I help? \nWhat can I do to be useful? Where am I needed?\" It is on this level, we bear testimony, that\nthe real contribution and happiness of life can be found.\n<\/p><p>\nI read recently of the development of \"breeder reactors,\" which produce vast amounts of\nenergy from a given amount of fuel and \"breed\" or produce more fuel than they use while\nthey are doing it.  Life is meant to be like that. We are meant to appreciate and use the good\nthings of our inheritance and to leave a greater store behind us.\n<\/p><p>\nWith good conscience and a genuine concern for others, we need faith in Almighty God. \nJesus told the lawyer that the first and great commandment is to \"love the Lord thy God with\nall thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the second is like unto it,\" he said. \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35735\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35735)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35735)\">Matt. 22:37,39<\/a><\/span>). All other commandments depend upon this.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Capacity to cope with adversity<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn a generation represented by youth who refuse to whine and whimper in the face of great\ndifficulties, who can thank God for trouble in their time if it has to come, there is great and\nglorious promise.  But I believe the summation of the best in them, or in any of us, is in that\nattitude which motivated one of their number to say, \"God, I am ready for you, if you are\nready for me.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHave you said that, in your own way, and really meant it?\n<\/p><p>\nThe problems of our day are very great.  Many of the voices we have traditionally been able\nto count on are silent or confused.  In the world of theology and religion there is uncertainty\nand controversy. Faith seems to wane, spirits to sag.  We worry about what men say.  Perhaps\nit is time to cease to worry so much about what men say and ask ourselves, \"What has God\nsaid?\" More important than what our neighbors are doing, or what the rest are doing, is what\nhas God done.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"To obey better than sacrifice . . .\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nLong ago there was a young man who, though \"little in (his) own eyes,\" was chosen king of\nall Israel.  The humble Saul was ready for God; and when the prophet of God had anointed\nhim, he \"turned into another man.\" The Spirit of the Lord came upon him. \"God gave him\nanother heart.\" While he listened to the Lord and his prophets, he led with great strength.\nWhen he became willful and stubborn and rebellious, he ceased to be useful and he lost his\nplace.  \"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry\"\n(see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"2563\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2563)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2563)\">1 Sam. 10:1-27<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2564\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2564)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2564)\">1 Sam. 15:1-35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA young man named Solomon loved the Lord and earnestly said to him, \". . .

In his moment of great agony\nand torment before Calvary, he laid his life on the altar and said, as we have learned: \n<\/p><p>\n\"O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as\nthou wilt\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35748\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35748)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35748)\">Matt. 26:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHe was saying, as one of his humble young disciples said in a grove of trees in Colorado a\nlittle time ago, \"God, I am, ready for you, if you are ready for me.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>For youth of promise&mdash;great responsibility<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTo the younger generation, our admonition and loving invitation is that you accept the\nresponsibilities of your great promise.
