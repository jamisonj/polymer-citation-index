Surely our prayer is to see the world made a better place in which to live, to see more care and concern for one another, and to see the cause of peace and reassurance increased in every direction and extended to all people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-beacon-in-the-harbor-of-peace.p5\" class=\"\">In the pursuit of such peace and reassurance, may I quote a great voice from the past. He said: \u201c[In order to make the world] a better place \u2026 to live, \u2026 the first and most important step is to choose as a leader one whose leadership is infallible, whose teachings when practiced have never failed. In \u2026 [any] tempestuous sea of uncertainty, the pilot must be one who through the storm can see the beacon in the harbor of peace\u201d (David O.

Because many reject those teachings, that is all the more reason why sincere believers in the gospel of Jesus Christ should proclaim its truth and show by example the power and peace of a righteous, gentle life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-beacon-in-the-harbor-of-peace.p9\" class=\"\">Consider, for example, this instruction from Christ to his disciples.

For example, we can all be a little more forgiving. In latter-day revelation the Lord said: \u201cMy disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-beacon-in-the-harbor-of-peace.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-beacon-in-the-harbor-of-peace.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cI, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19636\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19636)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19636)\">D&amp;C 64:8\u201310<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-beacon-in-the-harbor-of-peace.p16\" class=\"\">In the majesty of his life and the example of his teachings, Christ gave us much counsel with secure promises always attached.

Christ\u2019s voice was pure and pervaded with sympathy. Even the severity of his sternest injunctions was expressed with an unutterable love. (Frederic W.

As Christ\u2019s disciples had set out on one of their frequent journeys across the Sea of Galilee, the night was dark and the elements were strong and contrary. The waves were boisterous and the wind was bold, and these mortal, frail men were frightened. Unfortunately there was no one with them to calm and save them, for Jesus had been left alone upon the shore.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-beacon-in-the-harbor-of-peace.p19\" class=\"\">As always, he was watching over them. He loved them and cared for them. In their moment of greatest extremity they looked and saw in the darkness an image in a fluttering robe, walking toward them on the ridges of the sea. They cried out in terror at the sight, thinking that it was a phantom that walked upon the waves. And through the storm and darkness to them\u2014as so often to us, when, amid the darknesses of life, the ocean seems so great and our little boats so small\u2014there came the ultimate and reassuring voice of peace with this simple declaration, \u201cIt is I; be not afraid.\u201d Peter exclaimed, \u201cLord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.\u201d And Christ\u2019s answer to him was the same as to all of us: \u201cCome.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-beacon-in-the-harbor-of-peace.p20\" class=\"\">Peter sprang over the vessel\u2019s side and into the troubled waves, and while his eyes were fixed upon the Lord, the wind might toss his hair and the spray might drench his robes, but all was well. Only when with wavering faith he removed his glance from the Master to look at the furious waves and the black gulf beneath him, only then did he begin to sink. Again, like most of us, he cried, \u201cLord, save me.\u201d Nor did Jesus fail him. He stretched out his hand and grasped the drowning disciple with the gentle rebuke, \u201cO thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-beacon-in-the-harbor-of-peace.p21\" class=\"\">Then safely aboard their little craft, they saw the wind fall and the crash of the waves become a ripple. Soon they were at their haven, their safe port, where all would one day hope to be. The crew as well as his disciples were filled with deep amazement. Some of them addressed him by a title which I declare today: \u201cTruly thou art the Son of God.\u201d (Adapted from Farrar, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Life of Christ,<\/span> pp. 310\u201313; see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"37461\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37461)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37461)\">Matt. 14:22\u201323<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-beacon-in-the-harbor-of-peace.p22\" class=\"\">It is my firm belief that if as individual people, as families, communities, and nations, we could, like Peter, fix our eyes on Jesus, we too might walk triumphantly over \u201cthe swelling waves of disbelief\u201d and remain \u201cunterrified amid the rising winds of doubt.\u201d But if we turn away our eyes from him in whom we must believe, as it is so easy to do and the world is so much tempted to do, if we look to the power and fury of those terrible and destructive elements around us rather than to him who can help and save us, then we shall inevitably sink in a sea of conflict and sorrow and despair.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-beacon-in-the-harbor-of-peace.p23\" class=\"\">At such times when we feel the floods are threatening to drown us and the deep is going to swallow up the tossed vessel of our faith, I pray we may always hear amid the storm and the darkness that sweet utterance of the Savior of the world: \u201cBe of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37462\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37462)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37462)\">Matt. 14:27<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-beacon-in-the-harbor-of-peace.p24\" class=\"\">In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
