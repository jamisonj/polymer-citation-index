Admit Christ into your heart and he will save you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p4\" class=\"\">Then he quoted Ephesians 2:8 for his clinching argument: \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21847\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21847)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21847)\">Eph. 2:8<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p5\" class=\"\">Then he gave his final advice: \u201cIs this too much to ask of you?

Join with us in Christian faith and you shall be saved.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p6\" class=\"\">I wonder how many people have been lulled into a false sense of security by such teaching. As a missionary knocking at the doors of people, I had literally hundreds of people tell me that they were not interested in learning more about Jesus Christ, for they were already saved. The shocking thing about this is that they were right. What that minister said was true, but the difficulty is that it was not the <span class=\"emphasis\">whole <\/span>truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p7\" class=\"\">I am personally concerned about this problem because I realize how much damage partial truth can do.

Generally it means they are saved from death. This type of general salvation comes to all people by the grace of God alone. General salvation comes regardless of obedience to gospel principles or laws and results solely in resurrection from the dead. In this respect, salvation is synonymous with immortality, in that the resurrected person will live forever. Resurrection comes to every person born into this world through the sacrifice made by Jesus Christ, whether one confesses Christ or not. Whether a person is wicked or righteous, each person will receive the gift of immortality through Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p9\" class=\"\">As Paul explained to the Corinthian Greeks:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cBut now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cFor since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cFor as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"546\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 546)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(546)\">1 Cor. 15:20\u201322<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p13\" class=\"\">All mankind will thus receive general salvation, excepting the sons of perdition.

There is an additional salvation that God has planned for his children. This additional salvation is an individual salvation and is conditioned not only upon grace, but also upon obedience to gospel law. One of the prophets in the Book of Mormon explained why he and his associates were so concerned about teaching more about Jesus Christ, as he wrote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cFor we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3885\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3885)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3885)\">2 Ne. 25:23<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p18\" class=\"\">That full reconciliation to God is extremely important to me. It is the idea of a personal atonement or reconciliation that can bring me back into the presence of God as one of his covenant sons that appeals to me. That kind of conditional salvation I call exaltation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p19\" class=\"\">Exaltation comes as a gift from God, dependent upon my obedience to God\u2019s law. No works I do solely of my own power can bring this to pass. Only by the grace of God has this course been opened to me, but only through obedience to the laws of God can I claim my inheritance in the celestial kingdom of my Heavenly Father as a son within his family. I cannot be exalted in my sins, but must work until I overcome them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p20\" class=\"\">Amulek the prophet explained this most clearly as he said of God:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their sins; for I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore, how can ye be saved, except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven?

When he comes to Salt Lake City he usually drops into my office to say hello. I love to visit with him, for he always leaves me with a new gem of thought.

This eternal preservation of my family relationship can be my inheritance in God\u2019s kingdom if I will pay the price to achieve it. Even those in the celestial kingdom who have not paid the full price of obedience to attain such further exaltation will have immortality only and not eternal life within God\u2019s family organization.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p29\" class=\"\">Thus, full salvation in its true and full meaning is synonymous with exaltation and eternal life. This inheritance within the actual family of God the Eternal Father, through Jesus Christ, is the burden of the scriptures and should be the goal of every man, woman, and child born upon this earth. This full salvation is obtained only in and through the family unit preserved throughout eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p30\" class=\"\">When the angel Moroni came to give Joseph Smith his first instruction in restoring the gospel in this dispensation, he quoted the prophet Malachi with a little variation from the way it is written in the Bible:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cFor behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly shall burn as stubble; for they that come shall burn them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30561\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30561)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30561)\">JS\u2014H 1:37<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/salvation-and-exaltation.p32\" class=\"\">In order to understand this passage of scripture, for <span class=\"emphasis\">root <\/span>read \u201cprogenitors\u201d or \u201cancestors\u201d and for <span class=\"emphasis\">branch <\/span>read \u201cposterity\u201d or \u201cchildren.\u201d Unless, then, through obedience to the laws of God you can qualify yourself to go to the temple and have your family sealed to you, you will live forever separately and singly in an unmarried state.
