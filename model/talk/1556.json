Hunter, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1967, pp. 115-118<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nThe greatest search of our time is the search for personal identity and for human dignity. Each\nof us wants life to be worthwhile and to have real meaning&mdash;a personal meaning&mdash;in the\nliving we do from day to day. There is a search being made by people everywhere, a search\nas important as life itself for self-respect, for self-fulfillment, and for emotional maturity.\nMuch of our character and nature, as individuals, depends upon how and to what ends we\nconduct this search. Too many of us turn the direction of our lives to tragic goals and\ndistorted purposes. The friends we choose, the choices we make, and what we do about these\nchoices are the determining guide lines that form and mold our lives; but choices alone are\nnot enough. The best goals, the best of friends, and the best of opportunities are all\nmeaningless unless they are translated into reality through our daily actions.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Gospel of imperatives<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nBelief must be realized in personal achievement. Real Christians must understand that the\ngospel of Jesus Christ is not just a gospel of belief; it is a plan of action. His gospel is a\ngospel of imperatives, and the very nature of its substance is a call to action. He did not say\n\"observe\" my gospel; he said \"live\" it! He did not say, \"Note its beautiful structure and\nimagery\", he said, \"Go, do, see, feel, give, believe!\" The gospel of Jesus Christ is full of\nimperatives, words that call for personal commitment and action&mdash;obligatory, binding,\ncompulsory.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is never achievement in any field of endeavor unless it is preceded by a strong sense of\npurpose. There must be reasons for action and guides for action in the form of real goals and\nobjectives. That is why we are given a plan of salvation and progression. Because the gospel\nis a long-range even an eternal&mdash;goal, it must be broken up into short-range, immediate\nobjectives that can be achieved today and tomorrow and the next day. The gospel imperatives\nconstitute an immediate challenge to action in our lives right now, today, as well as a plan for\naction eternally.\n<\/p><p>\nNotice the forceful expression Jesus gave to his teachings; he said: \"Ask, and it will be given\nyou; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it\nshall be opened\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35701\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35701)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35701)\">Matt. 7:7-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you and pray\nfor them that despitefully use you\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35686\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35686)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35686)\">Matt. 5:44<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Gospel of action<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI believe he would have endorsed the modern addition to an ancient scripture: \"And with all\nthy getting (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41477\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41477)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41477)\">Prov. 4:7<\/a><\/span>), get going!\" His principles are briefly paraphrased. \"Do unto others as you would\nhave them do unto you\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35707\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35707)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35707)\">Matt. 7:12<\/a><\/span>). \"Go the second mile\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35685\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35685)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35685)\">Matt. 5:41<\/a><\/span>). \"If you want to know whether what I say is\ntrue (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28327\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28327)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28327)\">John 7:17<\/a><\/span>), try it out!\" This is what we mean by gospel imperatives. They are words that challenge\nto action&mdash;\"Go, do, pray, repent, love, find, give, consider, provide,\" and a host of others.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the most dynamic challenges in the scriptures comes at the end of King Benjamin's\naddress to his people as he concludes his ministry and turns the reigns of government over to\nhis son, Mosiah. Standing on the tower he built to address the people, he guides them through\nthe fundamentals of the gospel and commits them to the wisdom, power, and purposes of\nGod, making this most important challenge: \". . . and now, if you believe all these things see\nthat ye do them\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40358\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40358)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40358)\">Mosiah 4:10<\/a><\/span>). The sincerity of their belief must be demonstrated in the\nverity in their actions.\n<\/p><p>\nAction is one of the chief foundations of personal testimony. The surest witness is that which\ncomes firsthand out of personal experience. When the Jews challenged the doctrine\nJesus taught in the temple, he answered, \". . . my doctrine is not mine, but\nhis that sent me.\" Then he added the key to personal testimony, \"If any man will do his will,\nhe shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28325\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28325)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28325)\">John 7:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nDo we hear the imperative in this declaration of the Savior? \"If any man will <i>do<\/i> . . . he will\n<i>know!<\/i>\" John caught the significance of this imperative and emphasized its meaning in his\ngospel. He said, \"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he\nwalked\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1085\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1085)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1085)\">1 Jn. 2:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMerely saying, accepting, believing are not enough. They are incomplete until that which they\nimply is translated into the dynamic action of daily living. This, then, is the finest source of\npersonal testimony. One knows because he has experienced. He does not have to say, \"Brother\nJones says it is true, and I believe him.\" He can say, \"I have lived this principle in my own\nlife, and I know through personal experience that it works. I have felt its influence, tested its\npractical usefulness, and know that it is good. I can testify of my own knowledge that it is a\ntrue principle.\"\n<\/p><p>\nMany people carry such a testimony in their own lives and do not recognize its worth.\nRecently a young lady said, \"I do not have a testimony of the gospel. I wish I did. I accept its\nteachings. I know they work in my life. I see them working in the lives of others. If only the\nLord would answer my prayers and give me a testimony, I would be one of the happiest\npersons alive!\" What this young lady wanted was a miraculous intervention; yet she had\nalready seen the miracle of the gospel enlarging and uplifting her own life. The Lord <i>had<\/i>\nanswered her prayers. She <i>did<\/i> have a testimony, but she did not recognize it for what it was.\nOf such, Jesus said, \". . . they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they\nunderstand.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and\nshall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35724\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35724)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35724)\">Matt. 13:13-14<\/a><\/span>). The\ngospel is the way of life. It is practical, plain, and simple. It is a gospel of action, even to the\ntiny day-to-day actions that make up the art of living.\n<\/p><p>\nElder Adam S. Bennion, when he was with us, used to say, \"Important as knowing is, there is\na more important field, and that is the field of doing. Life is always bigger than learning. It is\na wonderful thing to know, but it is better to do.\" This, of course, is the meaning of the\nbiblical injunction, \"Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26201\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26201)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26201)\">James 1:22<\/a><\/span>), which is\nanother gospel imperative.\n<\/p><p>\nThis gospel imperative expresses the very nature of Church education. The doctrine of making\nhearers into doers of the word extends to the point at which we believe that what we know\nand do in the gospel needs to become ingrained into the very nature of our being. Nels L.\nNelson expresses this gospel imperative in one of his books defining the Mormon concept of\neducation in these words: \"The only kind of education which squares with the ideals of\nMormonism is that which trains a man to do. If it be asked, to do what, the answer is,\n<i>to do the things that need to be done<\/i> . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"True education is therefore training a man to do his part in the social world . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . knowledge is only half of intelligence. To stop here is to be falsely educated. If,\nhowever, the truth perceived becomes a dynamic fact in a man's character; if it is\nincorporated into his mental attitude, and reacts immediately upon his life; if, in short, it\nceases to be something <i>in<\/i> a man and becomes the man himself changing the very . . .\n[character of his soul, then knowledge has passed over into power&mdash;or character&mdash;or\nwisdom&mdash;or, to adopt the term used by Joseph Smith, has passed over into intelligence, and\nit is such a process alone that represents true education.\" (Nels L. Nelson,\n<i>Scientific Aspects of Mormonism<\/i> [New York and London: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1904], pp. 151-52.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Factors of action<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIf the gospel of Jesus Christ is truly to become a part of ourselves, then there are several\nthings we must keep in mind in putting the gospel imperatives into action.\n<\/p><p>\nFirst, it is essential to remember that it is more important to be able to <i>think<\/i> and hence to <i>act<\/i>\nin terms of gospel principles and teachings than it is to merely memorize gospel facts.\nRemember the injunction from Proverbs: \"Wisdom is the principle thing; therefore get\nwisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41478\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41478)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41478)\">Prov. 4:7<\/a><\/span>). Solomon's great blessing\nwas \"an understanding heart\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1238\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1238)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1238)\">1 Kgs. 3:12<\/a><\/span>). We should study gospel principles with the purpose of\nunderstanding how they apply and may be used in our life today, not just to be able to\nremember them.\n<\/p><p>\nSecond, don't be afraid to put them into action. Courage&mdash;and this is as true of spiritual\ncourage as it is of physical courage&mdash;is not acting in the absence of fear. Courage is acting\nin spite of fear. If we stood tall in the gospel, we would soon find that it is easier to act than\nit is to remain idle or to cower in a corner.\n<\/p><p>\nThird, remember that our attitudes are most important tools to success. Knowledge is power\nonly when it is used constructively. We should extend a positive belief in the gospel into a\npositive belief in our own ability to live the gospel as an effective factor in our lives and in\nthe lives of those about us. Businessmen have proven that the difference between the\nsuccessful and the unsuccessful usually reduces down to a difference in attitudes. This is just\nas true of gospel living. \"As [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he\" ought to be a prime tenet\nin every gospel lesson (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41482\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41482)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41482)\">Prov. 23:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFourth, be assured that one kind of ability we must have is \"stick-ability.\" No matter how\ngood the beginning, success comes only to those who \"endure to the end.\"\n<\/p><p>\nFifth, whenever we tackle a gospel imperative, immediate goals will help us master it. Our\ndecision to read scripture becomes quite practical when we decide to read a chapter at night\nbefore we go to sleep. We should set up long-range and eternal goals, to be sure&mdash;they will\nbe the guides and inspiration of a lifetime; but we should not forget the countless little\nimmediate objectives to be won tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. To win and pass\nthese objectives marks our progress toward the greater goals and insures happiness and the\nfeelings of success along the way.\n<\/p><p>\nGospel imperatives are action words challenging every Latter-day Saint to gospel living. They\nare the active pathway to personal participation in the laws of the gospel, and every one leads\nto rewards and blessings. An example of this may be found in the blessing attached to one of\nthese gospel imperatives. It reads, \"And all saints who remember to keep and do these\nsayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and\nmarrow to their bones\n<\/p><p>\n\"And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15008\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15008)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15008)\">D&amp;C 89:18-19<\/a><\/span>).\nSuch are the blessings promised, and there are many more, each to its own gospel\nimperative. They are imperatives because they call to action, and every positive action in the\ngospel plan makes better and happier men and women.\n<\/p><p>\nI never think of gospel imperatives without remembering the story of Mary Fielding Smith,\nthat indomitable pioneer mother who was the wife and widow of the Patriarch Hyrum Smith\nbrother of the Prophet. I am sure you are all familiar with the story of her struggles to bring\nher little family to the valley of the Great Salt Lake. Well, one of the highlights in that story\nfor me is also the signature of gospel imperatives. One spring as they opened the potato pits\nshe had her boys get a load of the best potatoes, which she took to the tithing office.\n<\/p><p>\nShe was met at the steps of the office by one of the clerks, who remonstrated as the boys\nbegan to unload the potatoes. \"Widow Smith,\" he said, remembering no doubt her trials and\nsacrifices, \"it's a shame that you should have to pay tithing.\" He added a number of other\nthings her son did not care to repeat, chided her for paying her tithing, and called her\nanything but wise and prudent; he said that there were others able to work who were\nsupported from the tithing office. The little widow drew herself up to her\nfull height and said, \"William, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Would you deny me a\nblessing? If I did not pay my tithing, I should expect the Lord to withhold his blessings from\nme. I pay my tithing, not only because it is a law of God but because I expect a blessing by\ndoing it. By keeping this and other laws, I expect to prosper and to be able to provide for my\nfamily.\" (<i>Life of Joseph F. Smith<\/i>, pp. 158-59.)\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the goal of gospel imperatives, \"to be able to prosper and provide for our families.\"\nThe abundance of the good and worthwhile things of life comes from following them. I bear\nyou my testimony that in them lies the wisdom of eternity. It is my witness that God lives,\nthat Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. My appeal is to each of us, and the hundreds\nof thousands of persons who joined with us by viewing this conference today, to catch the\nvision of and follow the admonition contained in the key to all imperatives: \"For every one\nthat asketh, receiveth and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be\nopened\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5707\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5707)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5707)\">3 Ne. 14:8<\/a><\/span>). This is my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
