As a young nine-year-old boy, I asked my mother if I could take my Christmas gift, a new bow and arrow set, and go up on the hill behind our home to hunt for rabbits. It was late in the afternoon, and Mother was reluctant, but with my coaxing she agreed to let me go, but only if I was back home before dark.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p5\" class=\"\">As I reached the top of the hill, I put an arrow on the bow and started walking quietly through the sage and chaparral bushes, hoping to see a rabbit feeding at the base of the brush where the tender grass was still green.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p6\" class=\"\">I was startled by a large jackrabbit that jumped out from a sage bush right in front of me. I pulled back on the bow, taking a quick aim, and let the arrow fly at the fleeing, darting rabbit. The arrow missed, and the rabbit disappeared through the brush ahead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p7\" class=\"\">I went to where I thought the arrow had hit the ground to retrieve it. Only three arrows came with the bow, and I didn\u2019t want to lose this one. I looked where the arrow was supposed to be, but it wasn\u2019t there. I looked all around the area where I was sure it landed, but I couldn\u2019t find it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p8\" class=\"\">The sun was setting in the west; I knew that it would be dark in about 30 minutes, and I didn\u2019t want to be late getting home. I searched again the area where the arrow should have been, looking carefully under every bush, but it was not to be found.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p9\" class=\"\">Time was running out, and I needed to start for home to get there before dark. I decided to pray and ask Heavenly Father to help me find the arrow. I dropped to my knees, closed my eyes, and prayed to my Father in Heaven. I told Him I didn\u2019t want to lose my new arrow, and I asked Him to show me where to find it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p10\" class=\"\">While still on my knees, I opened my eyes, and there in the sagebrush immediately in front of me, at eye level, I saw the colored feathers of the arrow partly hidden by the branches. I grabbed the arrow and began to run for home, arriving there just before dark.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p11\" class=\"\">I will never forget that special experience.

The windswept Chatham Islands are located in the South Pacific Ocean about 500 miles east of Christchurch. A hardy and resourceful 650 people lived there, isolated in the lonely, harsh environment of those days; and a young, inexperienced, and newly qualified doctor was responsible for their medical care.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p22\" class=\"\">An eight-year-old boy, Shane, had sustained a serious head injury 40 miles away on the far side of the island. He was being rushed in across the swamps and along the beaches on the backseat of an old, rusty car to the four-bed cottage hospital. He was unconscious.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p23\" class=\"\">The young doctor was unprepared to handle such a case, with little experience and having only the most basic of surgical instruments. Shane was in a critical condition. There was obvious bleeding inside his fractured skull\u2014and blood clotting could fatally compress his brain. The doctor had never even seen a brain operation, but he knew he had to perform the delicate surgery immediately\u2014or watch a little boy die.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p24\" class=\"\">There were blood donors to be called in, blood to be cross matched, an anesthetic to be prepared.

More calls to the neurosurgeon for direction and reassurance were made, and his advice was followed in every exact detail. After six hours of anxiety and pressure, the surgery was completed, the hemorrhage of blood into the brain cavity ceased, and a successful outcome was achieved. Serenity replaced chaos. It was around midnight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p29\" class=\"\">The doctor was a young father. He thought about his family and the blessings they enjoyed.

He was grateful for the presence of an unseen expert who imparted of His far-greater knowledge freely in his time of need.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p30\" class=\"\">At the critical time in a desperate situation, the Lord provided the guidance and the ability for a young, inexperienced doctor to perform a miracle and preserve the life of a small boy, who was precious before the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p31\" class=\"\">Neil Hutchison was the young doctor who prayed for help and had the faith to rely on the Lord and the neurosurgeon, enabling him to perform a miracle under the most difficult of conditions.
