The army of the devil exploits all kinds of sinful practices, and promotes his cause through every kind of printed, audio, and visual means. Perhaps the most cunning of all their methods is the spirit of apathy and indifference that they use to penetrate the minds and the hearts of mankind, to dull their feelings towards God, His Son Jesus Christ, and His church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-making-of-a-missionary.p6\" class=\"\">The great prophet Mormon taught: \u201cWherefore, all things which are good cometh of God; and that which is evil cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth against him continually, and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil continually.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38402\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38402)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38402)\">Moro. 7:12<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-making-of-a-missionary.p7\" class=\"\">Based on my experience, I believe that if the Saints and missionaries are to build up the Church at the much faster rate that President Kimball has called for, we must all strive to prepare ourselves to become better gospel teachers. I often see the great joy that comes into the life of the new member of the Church when he is baptized. At each baptismal service I am reminded of the tremendous amount of individual preparation that is required by both member and missionary to bring about the conversion of one soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-making-of-a-missionary.p8\" class=\"\">I have asked myself, \u201cWhat can we as parents and leaders do to more effectively teach our youth how to defend the principles of righteousness?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-making-of-a-missionary.p9\" class=\"\">Better training and preparation seem to me to be the best answer. Realizing that I would need all the help I could get to give my first conference talk, I went to my wonderful missionaries and asked them to help me by answering a few questions about their pre-mission preparation.

Young people, why not make the best investment of your life by spending more of your time now to study and learn for yourself the ways of the Lord?

Shortly after we arrived in Toronto we were preparing the children to enroll in their schools. My five-year-old son was to start kindergarten, but on the first day he was afraid to go. My wife and I were concerned, and I was impressed to invite my son to come into my office and sit in what the missionaries call the \u201chot seat,\u201d and we would have an interview.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-making-of-a-missionary.p18\" class=\"\">He climbed up into the big black chair, and I asked, \u201cSon, how can I help you?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-making-of-a-missionary.p19\" class=\"\">I shall never forget as long as I live the look of real concern on his face.

I said, \u201cCraig, you have a friend that will always be with you. Let\u2019s kneel down together and ask Him to help you.\u201d We did, and Craig assigned me to say the prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-making-of-a-missionary.p21\" class=\"\">The Lord helped Craig find his courage in this experience.

He had found his confidence and made some friends, and I was the one that missed that very special experience each morning with my little boy. I hope that this choice learning experience while on this mission will remain with Craig and become a source of strength to him when he is called to serve the Lord on a mission of his own.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-making-of-a-missionary.p23\" class=\"\">Fathers, you are the first-line priesthood leader, and almost without exception my missionaries expressed their love and respect for you.

Where will I go when I die?\u201d Today I have suggested to the members and missionaries of the Church that we all strive harder to prepare ourselves to be better able to share and to teach to you what we know to be true. We love you, and ask you to please listen to our message, for we teach the true gospel of Jesus Christ by the power of the only divinely recognized priesthood on this earth today. We can answer your questions, and we will place before you the evidence that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth, so you can decide for yourself if we teach to you the truth. We will give to you the Book of Mormon, that you might read for yourself to know that this second witness of the Lord Jesus Christ is in very deed the word of God like unto the Bible, and it testifies to the truthfulness of our message.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-making-of-a-missionary.p31\" class=\"\">My dear friends, no people on this earth are striving harder to prepare themselves to be able to effectively teach the gospel of Jesus Christ than are the members of this church, and we ask you to please take time to listen to the glorious message of the Restoration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-making-of-a-missionary.p32\" class=\"\">I testify to you that we are the only true church of Jesus Christ on the earth today, and one of our great missions in this life as members of the Church is to share the gospel truths with all of our Heavenly Father\u2019s children.
