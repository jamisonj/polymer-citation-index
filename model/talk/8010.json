One of the most famous arches there is called Delicate Arch. We decided to walk about 1.5 miles (2 km), climbing the mountain in order to reach the arch.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/lets-not-take-the-wrong-way.p10\" class=\"\">We started off on our pathway with great enthusiasm, but after walking a short stretch, the others needed to rest. Because of my desire to get there, I decided to continue on alone. Without paying attention to the path I ought to take, I followed a man in front of me who seemed to be moving forward with great surety. The pathway became more and more difficult, and I had to jump from one rock to another. Because of the difficulty, I was sure the women in my group would never make it. Suddenly I saw Delicate Arch, but to my great surprise, I saw that it was in an area inaccessible to me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/lets-not-take-the-wrong-way.p11\" class=\"\">With great frustration, I decided to go back. I waited impatiently until we met up again. My immediate question was \u201cDid you reach Delicate Arch?\u201d They happily told me that they had. They explained that they had followed the signs showing the way, and with care and effort, they had reached their destination.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/lets-not-take-the-wrong-way.p12\" class=\"\">Unfortunately, I had taken the wrong way.
