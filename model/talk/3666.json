You probably have never heard of her.

Then, at the age of thirty-nine, her husband passed away and she was left a widow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/five-million-members-a-milestone-and-not-a-summit.p27\" class=\"\">Her sister, Grace, had married her husband\u2019s brother, David. In 1919, during the terrible influenza epidemic, David was seriously stricken, and then his wife, Grace, became ill. Caroline cared for them and their children as well as her own. In the midst of these afflictions, Grace gave birth to a son, and then she died within a few hours. Caroline took the tiny infant to her own home and there nurtured it and saved the child\u2019s life. Three weeks later her own daughter, Annie, passed away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/five-million-members-a-milestone-and-not-a-summit.p28\" class=\"\">By now Caroline had lost two of her own children, her husband, and her sister. The strain was too much. She collapsed. She came out of that collapse with a serious case of diabetes. But she did not slow down. She continued to care for her sister\u2019s baby; and her brother-in-law, the child\u2019s father, came each day to see the little boy. David Harman and Caroline were later married, and there were now thirteen children in their home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/five-million-members-a-milestone-and-not-a-summit.p29\" class=\"\">Then five years later David suffered a catastrophe that tried to the very depths those who agonized with him. On one occasion he used a strong disinfectant in preparing seed for planting. This got on his body, and the effects were disastrous. The skin and flesh sloughed off his bones. His tongue and teeth dropped out. The caustic solution literally ate him alive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/five-million-members-a-milestone-and-not-a-summit.p30\" class=\"\">Caroline nursed him in this terrible illness, and when he died she was left with five of her own and eight of her sister\u2019s children, and a farm of 280 acres where she and the children plowed, sowed, irrigated, and harvested to bring in enough to provide for their needs. At this time she also was Relief Society president, a position she held for eighteen years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/five-million-members-a-milestone-and-not-a-summit.p31\" class=\"\">While caring for her large family and in extending the hand of charity to others, she would bake eight loaves of bread a day and wash forty loads of clothes a week. She canned fruits and vegetables by the ton, and cared for a thousand laying hens to provide a little cash. Self-reliance was her standard. Idleness she regarded as sin. She cared for her own and reached out to others in a spirit of kindness that would permit no one of whom she was aware to go hungry, unclothed, or cold.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/five-million-members-a-milestone-and-not-a-summit.p32\" class=\"\">She later married Eugene Robison, who, not long afterward, suffered a stroke.

The habits of industry and hard work which she instilled in her children rewarded their efforts through the years. Her sister\u2019s tiny baby, whom she nurtured from the hour of his birth, together with his brothers and sisters, all acting out of a sense of love and gratitude, have given to the university a substantial bequest to make possible the beautiful building which will carry her name.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/five-million-members-a-milestone-and-not-a-summit.p34\" class=\"\">It is well to remember men and women who have made outstanding contributions in terms of science, education, business, and the arts.
