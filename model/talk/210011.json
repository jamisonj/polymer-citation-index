And it seems to me that if there is one delusion more pernicious than another it is that very doctrine, which seems to be a fundamental principle of all the various Christian sects. You will find, go where you will in the Christian world and listen to any of the great preachers of the day, that this is the common topic of discourse. Jesus Christ is preached&#x2014;which is quite right, I am very glad that he is&#x2014;as the Savior of the world. So we testify as Latter-day Saints. In connection, however, with this great truth which is proclaimed to the inhabitants of the earth by men professing to be sent of God, is preached the great error that mere belief in the work which Jesus Christ wrought out is sufficient for the salvation of the people. The inhabitants of the earth are informed that it is not by any works of righteousness which they may perform that they can gain any favor whatever in the sight of God,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"74921\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 74921)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(74921)\">Eph. 2:9<\/a><\/span> but it is the righteousness of Christ alone which is acceptable to the Father and which they can gain the benefit of if they simply believe in him. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n230\"> When we search the Scriptures and read the sayings of Jesus Christ, and of his servants whom he sent forth to preach the Gospel, we do not find any such statement as this.

But we do not find that in proclaiming faith in the Lord Jesus Christ to that generation they informed the people that a mere belief in Christ was all that was needful; we find that, in addition to teaching the principle of faith in God and in his Son Jesus Christ, they taught the people it was necessary to observe certain rules, and commandments, to obey certain forms and ordinances, to comply with certain conditions that they might obtain the benefit of the shedding of Christ's blood. We find by searching the New Testament, which contains some of the teachings of the apostles and some of their letters to the churches, that the doctrine was held forth by them that &#x201C;the blood of Christ cleanseth us from all sin.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"78525\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 78525)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(78525)\">1 Jn. 1:7<\/a><\/span> We find that this applied, as they taught it, not only to what is called original sin, but also to actual sin.

Who sent them? Who told them to do this sprinkling? Did God the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Ghost? No. Did any person to whom God has spoken, having authority from God to ordain, appoint them to that office? No. Why! Because for hundreds of years communication with the eternal world has been shut off, inasmuch as the people who profess the Christian religion have not even believed in the doctrine of present communication with God. They have been contented with the old revelations contained in the book we call the Bible, which contains a few of the things that God revealed hundreds of years ago. They do not believe in having communication with the heavens. How did they get this authority, then? When did a man ever get authority from God to sprinkle and call it baptism, or to baptize an infant in any form?
