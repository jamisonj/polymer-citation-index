The miles seem long, the minutes slow, the events of the day protracted and tedious. Eventually, however, familiar scenes come into view. They may be hills or valleys, country landscapes or towering buildings, a teeming thoroughfare or a quiet neighborhood street. Whatever the scene, its familiarity quickens the traveler\u2019s step, invigorates his wearied soul, and restores sweet feelings of anticipation and peace. At long last, he is home again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/welcome-home.p6\" class=\"\">In our mobile, bustling world, this experience of the homeward journey is repeated daily in the lives of millions of people. If we look closely, we can learn much about mortality from such a common occurrence. One thing is certain\u2014we make a colossal mistake if we approach this mortal journey frivolously or take whatever path presents itself without thought as to where it leads. As one beloved Apostle has observed: \u201cTruly, of all the errors mortals could make, God\u2019s plan of salvation is the wrong thing to be wrong about! No error could be more enormous or more everlasting in its consequences!\u201d (Neal A.
