Lee, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1945, pp. 164-167<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nWhen one is called as the last speaker at the end of the seventh session of a general\nconference, when thirty-three of the finest minds in the Church have spoken, he isn't\nconcerned about what he may have planned to speak, but he is concerned only about saying in\nthose few minutes allotted him what his Heavenly Father would like to have him say. That is\nmy prayer in these few moments.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE QUESTION OF A DYING WOMAN\n<\/p><p>\nI heard a story told from one of the war fronts where our advancing soldiers were going into\nthe land of a people who were fleeing from the ruthless enemy. These people believed in and\nworshipped a pagan god. As the conquering army made up of the allied nations advanced\ntoward the stricken town, they met long lines of refugees with few or no belongings, fleeing\nfrom the enemy. The chaplain was called to administer aid to an old lady who had fallen,\nunable to go farther. She was in her dying moments. He knelt at her side to administer\nphysical and spiritual aid. He told her about the Savior of the world, how the Savior had\ncome and died for mankind, how he came as the Prince of Peace and how he ministered\namong those who were sick, needy, and afflicted, how he organized a work that had become a\ngreat work. This work had gone throughout the world under the banner of Christianity. As he\nfinished his story of comfort, as he thought, to this dying woman, she looked up at him with\ndying eyes and asked, \"Where have you Christians been all this time?\"\n<\/p><p>\nFACTORS IN HELPING OUR BOYS IN THE SERVICE\n<\/p><p>\nAs I thought of that question I thought of a visit I had with two of our Latter-day Saint\nmarines who had just come back from the terrible fighting over Tarawa and others of the\nislands of the Pacific. They had found themselves through all these trying times in company\nwith twenty-five Latter-day Saint boys. One of these two boys had been set apart by Brother\nBrown as the M.I.A. group leader and had ministered as the leader and the father of the\ngroup. As he told me about these boys, he said, \"We kept most of them clean and sweet, but\nthere are some of them that have slipped away from us. They have taken up\nhabits that have not been good. I felt it was my responsibility, and I have done what I could\nto save some of them.\" Then I asked them this question, \"Tell me, you two who have lived\namong these boys, what is the reason that some of our boys have kept themselves straight and\nothers of our boys have slipped away from us?\" Let me tell you what they said without any\nhesitancy: \"The boys who have kept themselves clean have had regular correspondence with\ntheir wards and their priesthood quorums, and the boys who have fallen away from us are the\nones who have never had a letter from their priesthood quorums or from their ward bishop.\"\nAs I heard this simple testimony to the rightness of the instruction that you heard from this\nstand when this war had only just begun, and when I remembered that the priesthood of\nAlmighty God was the power given by him to more than two hundred thousand of us to work\nand act in his name for the salvation of the souls of men&mdash;I paraphrased the words of that\ndying old pagan woman, \"Where have the priesthood quorums been all this time?\" I am\nhopeful that our boys won't return home without having had their quorums make some\ncontact and some tie to which they can come when they do return.\n<\/p><p>\nI think if we could sum up the feelings of our boys as they return to us and have them tell us\nwhat it was that kept them firm and steadfast, they would say two things: First, that they have\nhad an interest in life, and second, that they have believed there was someone at home who\nwas concerned about them.\n<\/p><p>\nI listened to a doctor recently who said that the medical journals reported that the boys who\nhad become mentally unbalanced in large majority, were the boys who had broken homes,\nwhose wives or sweethearts had been unfaithful at home.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have heard much in this conference about our boys. We have heard but little about our\ngirls. How much preparation are you making for the girl who has changed during this trying\nperiod? How much concerned are you that she will \"come home\"? And I am talking to the\nones that live in your homes, for they, too, during this period, have gone through a most\ndifficult time.\n<\/p><p>\nWORK BEING DONE BY L.D.S. SOLDIERS\n<\/p><p>\nShall I tell you what the boys have been doing among themselves to keep going and to help\neach other to come back to the point of sanity and rehabilitation after they have been through\nthe struggle of war? Perhaps if I can give you three things that they have told us repeatedly\nmaybe you bishops, you priesthood quorum presidents, you stake presidents, will take from\ntheir lessons, something to help you to build on the foundation that must be builded upon for\ntheir salvation. In the first place, we don't know how the boys are coming back, nor what\nthey will truly need. We are sure that when they come back they will be a little bit more of\nthat which they were before they left. If they loved God and home and\ncountry a little before they went away, they will come back loving God still more and\nknowing him to be a reality, loving home more and with more faith. If they were boastful\nbefore they went into the war, they will come back unbearable braggarts. If they were\ninclined to immorality when they left us, they will come back slimy in their sinning, just as\nsure as we are here.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is what they have done in their own little groups to try to help stabilize each other: In\nthe first place, they have organized themselves into what they call ward teaching groups. At\nFort Lowry, near Denver, down at Oak Knoll Hospital, for example, where our boys are\ncoming back, they are sending out in pairs from their groups, those who are faithful, to visit\nthe boys who will not come to their meetings, who have taken up habits that are keeping\nthem out of sight. They talk to these boys and ask them, \"Are you morally clean? Are you\nkeeping the Word of Wisdom? Are you writing home to your parents? Are you true to your\npriesthood?\" When I asked them, \"Isn't that pretty plain language to talk to these boys,\" they\nreplied, \"But how are we going to help these boys if we don't know what is the matter with\nthem?\"\n<\/p><p>\nAre you as courageous, you ward teachers? Do you really want to help? Then you must do\nthe kind of ward teaching that the Lord said we were to do, if you are to help. The next thing\nthey do is to teach the gospel. They don't preach sermons in great generalities. They are\nsearching into the scriptures. During these last few months, when I have had a somewhat\nintimate contact with the youth of the Church, I have found that they are hungry for the\nteachings of the gospel, and they tell me that rarely in the sacrament meetings where they\nattend do they hear the gospel taught to the members.\n<\/p><p>\nPREPARATION FOR RETURN HOME OF SOLDIERS\n<\/p><p>\nNow, if you want to help these boys when they come back, may I ask that you do like my\nlittle bishop friend who sits here on the front seat who came as a convert from another\nChurch and who is now a bishop in one of our stakes? He says to speakers who come to his\nmeetings, \"We want speakers who come to our ward to preach the gospel. We would prefer\nyou not come than to have you come and not preach the gospel to our people.\" May I urge\nthat you take a leaf out of his book, and the books of our boys.\n<\/p><p>\nThe third thing they are doing is to make sure that every boy of the group is given some\nresponsibility in their group organization. Does that suggest anything to you? When these\nboys come home, will you take them to your hearts and see that they are given something to\ndo, some activity that challenges their abilities and makes them feel they are a part of their\nChurch community to which they want to belong, as quickly and as rapidly as possible?\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to understand these things and build the defense, the refuge\nfrom the storm that the Lord said a stake of Zion was expected to be\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12194\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12194)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12194)\">D&amp;C 115:6<\/a><\/span>), where before his\njudgments would descend in their mighty power, this people might build a protection from\nthose storms of adversity.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord help us so to do I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
