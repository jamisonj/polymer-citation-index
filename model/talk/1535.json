Taylor, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1967, p. 37-39<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMost persons in the world today are striving for recognition. They want to be respected and\nhave the world look up to them. They would like to feel that they are wanted and needed.\nThey wish to be loved. As strong as this desire is, President McKay has emphasized that there\nis a virtue that exceeds being loved, when he taught: \"To be trusted is a greater compliment\nthan to be loved.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Attributes of trustworthiness<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nA person in whom trust can be placed is one who must be loyal, steadfast, and dependable.\nBefore he can be loyal to others, he must first be loyal to himself.\n<\/p><p>\nOur Heavenly Father has granted man the privilege of making decisions, the right to choose\nbetween good and evil; the glorious principle of free  agency. A person living\na wholesome, clean life may have the Spirit of the Lord in making his choices and decisions.\nHe must remain firm, steadfast, and unwavering in the decisions he has made and considers to\nbe right, if he would have peace within himself and be loyal to himself. The wise man\nShakespeare expressed the thought in these words: \n<\/p><p>\n\"To thine own self be true,<br \/>\n         And it must follow, as the night the day,<br \/>\n         Thou canst not then be false to any man.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;         (<i>Hamlet<\/i>, Act I, sc. 3.)\n<\/p><p>\nMany centuries ago the Lord taught the children of Israel through Moses that if they wished\nto have their days prolonged upon the earth, they would honor their father and their mother.\nThat was wise counsel, and still applies to us today. In honoring our parents, it is\ncontemplated that we will be obedient and loyal to them.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the Lord made known to the Church through revelation in the year 1831, he charged the\nbrethren to be loyal to their wives. These are his words: \"Thou shalt love thy wife with all\nthy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14932\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14932)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14932)\">D&amp;C 42:22<\/a><\/span>). Yet there are some who\nhave not followed the counsel of the Lord and who have allowed their affections and loyalties\nto stray into forbidden paths. Separation, divorce, and heartache have been the result of such\ndisobedience.\n<\/p><p>\nThrough obedience, we have been privileged to come to this earth and to enjoy the many\nwonderful opportunities and blessings that come to us here in mortal life. People are born and\nlive in many different lands and countries. The Lord has decreed that we shall be loyal to the\ncountry in which we dwell and will abide by the laws of the land, as long as those laws are\nfounded upon just principles. Loyalty to country is an admirable quality.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Loyalty and its fruits<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nUpon man has been placed the responsibility of preparing himself, so that he can earn a\nlivelihood for his wife and his family. He may establish his own business and provide work\nfor himself, or he may seek and secure employment from others. As he works he comes to\nrealize the satisfaction and happiness that comes from useful and productive labor. Loyalty to\nhis employer is fundamental to his conscience and peace of mind. One has aptly pointed out:\n\"Loyalty consists in giving faithful allegiance and untiring service to the concern that\nfurnishes you with bread and butter. It consists in working during business hours and after\nbusiness hours and before business hours for the best interests of your concern. It consists in\ndoing everything within your power to figure out some new method that will advance the\ninterests of your employer.\" Knox 117\n<\/p><p>\nA feeling of loyalty may not be apparent immediately. It may take time to develop and strive\nfor, through experiences, the necessary courage to display the kind of loyalty we would hope\nfor.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Savior told Peter, one of his beloved associates and companions, that before the\nnight was ended and the cock would crow, he would deny Christ three times, Peter was\nastonished, and inwardly might have been indignant, as he cried out: \"Though I should die\nwith thee, yet will I not deny thee\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35747\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35747)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35747)\">Matt. 26:35<\/a><\/span>). Nevertheless, three times during the long\nnight, as different individuals confronted Peter with the accusation that he was an associate of\nJesus, he loudly and emphatically denied any acquaintance with Christ (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35751\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35751)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35751)\">Matt. 26:69-74<\/a><\/span>). Just as he uttered his\nfinal denial, the cock crowed. Peter then remorsefully recalled the words of Jesus \"And he\nwent out, and wept bitterly\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35752\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35752)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35752)\">Matt. 26:75<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFrom this experience, sad to Peter, he gained courage and throughout the remainder of his\nlife, in spite of persecution and even torture, he was loyal to the memory of the Savior and\nhis teachings.\n<\/p><p>\nJudas Iscariot learned through torment and remorse the bitter lesson that can come from\ndisloyalty, when he betrayed the Master for 30 pieces of silver (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35746\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35746)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35746)\">Matt. 26:14-16<\/a><\/span>). Disloyalty to righteousness\nresults in unhappiness.\n<\/p><p>\nIf loyalty is misapplied, or even if it is given to an evil cause or person, the\nresult will be evil. Satan and his rebellious hosts are zealous and loyal, but to an evil cause.\nUngodlike and unchristianlike communistic forces are active in the world today, attempting to\nimpose their will on others, which is an unrighteous cause. To follow them can bring only\nsorrow and disaster.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is also a danger in being over loyal to an individual, rather than to the cause such a one\nrepresents. Lyman Wight was a devoted friend and associate of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and\nwhen the Prophet was unjustly placed in the dungeon at Liberty Jail, Wight in company with\nother close friends accompanied Joseph. Following the Prophet's martyrdom, Wight declared:\n\"The only man who can handle me is dead.\" He became rebellious and unmanageable and\nrefused to follow the leadership of Brigham Young and the Twelve. Finally he led a group of\nhis followers to Texas, where he sank into obscurity and oblivion, while the faithful followers\nof the Prophet Joseph, who believed in him, not only as a man and a Prophet, and in the\ngospel principles he taught, followed his successors, Brigham Young and the Twelve,\nwestward, where Brigham Young and the brethren rose to fame and founded a great\ncommonwealth.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Loyalty to the prophet<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Joseph was thrust in prison at Carthage, at his side was his ever-loyal and faithful elder\nbrother, Hyrum. Joseph knew and had predicted that his life would not be spared. He had\nattempted to dissuade Hyrum from accompanying him. But Hyrum, with a strong conviction\nin his heart that his brother was the Prophet, called by the Lord, loyally insisted on sharing the\ntrials and dangers, even though it would mean the giving of his own life. His love for and\nallegiance to his younger brother is a heartwarming example of true loyalty. In a tribute paid\nto them by their associated, it was said: \"In life they were not divided, and in death they were\nnot separated\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15077\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15077)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15077)\">D&amp;C 135:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Loyalty a principle of action<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nLoyalty is a principle of action. One must be loyal to something, a cause, a person, a\nprinciple; one must give one's best for that to which one is loyal. But, if one is satisfied to do\none's duty only, one is but half loyal. When one, however, is willing to go beyond the call of\nduty, to go the \"second mile\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35684\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35684)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35684)\">Matt. 5:41<\/a><\/span>), to do more than that for which duty calls, then one is truly\nloyal.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Loyalty, a manifestation of faith<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAs Latter-day Saints we have in the gospel the greatest cause in all the world to which to be\nloyal. We also have true prophets of God to lead and guide us, and a country that guarantees\nus the right to be loyal to all of them. Shall we not be true to our sacred trust?\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless us as individuals with powers of discernment, that we may make proper\ndecisions, righteous decisions: then, with a display of will power and courage, be loyal to\nthose convictions.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we be loyal to the country in which we live, to the Church in which we enjoy\nmembership, its teachings and its leaders. May we love and be loyal to our parents, our\nhusbands, wives, and families. May we be loyal and true to ourselves and the trusts that are\nplaced in us, so that when the question is raised: \"Who's on the Lord's side?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22777\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22777)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22777)\">Ex. 32:26<\/a><\/span>) we can step\nforward with confidence, knowing that we have kept the faith, have justified the confidence\nand trust placed in us, to the end that we will realize the truth and significance of great\nteaching that \"to be trusted is a greater compliment than to be loved,\" for which I pray in the\nname of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
