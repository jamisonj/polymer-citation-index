All of these buildings had one important factor in common: the Spirit of God was present; the love of the Savior could be felt as we assembled as a branch or ward family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-fruits-of-the-first-vision.p7\" class=\"\">The Zwickau chapel had an old air-driven organ. Every Sunday a young man was assigned to push up and down the sturdy lever operating the bellows to make the organ work. Even before I was an Aaronic Priesthood bearer, I sometimes had the great privilege to assist in this important task.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-fruits-of-the-first-vision.p8\" class=\"\">While the congregation sang our beloved hymns of the Restoration, I pumped with all my strength so the organ would not run out of wind. The eyes of the organist unmistakably indicated whether I was doing fine or needed to increase my efforts quickly. I always felt honored by the importance of this duty and the trust that the organist had placed in me. It was a wonderful feeling of accomplishment to have a responsibility and to be part of this great work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-fruits-of-the-first-vision.p9\" class=\"\">There was an additional benefit that came from this assignment: the bellows operator sat in a seat that offered a great view of a stained-glass window that beautified the front part of the chapel. The stained glass portrayed the First Vision, with Joseph Smith kneeling in the Sacred Grove, looking up toward heaven and into a pillar of light.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-fruits-of-the-first-vision.p10\" class=\"\">During the hymns of the congregation and even during talks and testimonies given by our members, I often looked at this depiction of a most sacred moment in world history. In my mind\u2019s eye I saw Joseph receiving knowledge, witness, and divine instructions as he became a blessed instrument in the hand of our Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-fruits-of-the-first-vision.p11\" class=\"\">I felt a special spirit while looking at the beautiful scene in this window picture of a believing young boy in a sacred grove who made a courageous decision to earnestly pray to our Heavenly Father, who listened and responded lovingly to him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-fruits-of-the-first-vision.p12\" class=\"\">Here I was, a young boy in post\u2013World War II Germany, living in a city in ruins, thousands of miles away from Palmyra in North America and more than a hundred years after the event actually took place. By the universal power of the Holy Ghost, I felt in my heart and in my mind that it was true, that Joseph Smith saw God and Jesus Christ and heard Their voices. The Spirit of God comforted my soul at this young age with an assurance of the reality of this sacred moment that resulted in the beginning of a worldwide movement destined to \u201croll forth, until it has filled the whole earth\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44202\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44202)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44202)\">D&amp;C 65:2<\/a><\/span>).

God has spoken to mankind again!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-fruits-of-the-first-vision.p13\" class=\"\">Looking back, I am grateful for so many friends who helped me in my youth to gain a testimony of the restored Church of Jesus Christ. First I exercised simple faith in their testimonies, and then I received the divine witness of the Spirit to my mind and to my heart. I count Joseph Smith among those whose testimony of Christ helped me to develop my own testimony of the Savior. Before I recognized the tutoring of the Spirit testifying to me that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, my youthful heart felt that he was a friend of God and would therefore, quite naturally, also be a friend of mine. I knew I could trust Joseph Smith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-fruits-of-the-first-vision.p14\" class=\"\">The scriptures teach us that spiritual gifts are given to those who ask of God, who love Him, and who keep His commandments (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44203\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44203)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44203)\">D&amp;C 46:9<\/a><\/span>). \u201cAll have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-fruits-of-the-first-vision.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cTo some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44204\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44204)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44204)\">D&amp;C 46:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-fruits-of-the-first-vision.p16\" class=\"\">Today I know that my young testimony benefited greatly from the testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith and many friends in the Church who knew \u201cby the Holy Ghost \u2026 that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44205\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44205)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44205)\">D&amp;C 46:13<\/a><\/span>). Their good examples, caring love, and helping hands blessed me to receive another special gift of the Spirit described in the scriptures as I was yearning for more light and truth: \u201cTo others it is given to believe on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue [faithfully]\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44206\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44206)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44206)\">D&amp;C 46:14<\/a><\/span>).
