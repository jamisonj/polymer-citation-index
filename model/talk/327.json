I wondered if, in the Church as a\nwhole, we realize the value of the testimony of the Spirit. It was Moroni who said that by the\nHoly Ghost we might know the truth of all things\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38238\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38238)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38238)\">Moro. 10:5<\/a><\/span>).\nIn our Church we are rich with knowledge and testimony through the Holy Ghost.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus said to his disciples:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away,\nthe Comforter will not come unto you\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27334\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27334)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27334)\">John 16:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he\nmay abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not,\nneither knoweth him, but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in\nyou (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27328\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27328)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27328)\">John 14:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen we are told that he shall teach us all things\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27329\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27329)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27329)\">John 14:26<\/a><\/span>),\nand by the Holy Ghost we might know the truth of all things.\n<\/p><p>\nNine years after my grandfather, Franklin D. Richards, had been baptized a member of the\nChurch, during which time he had filled five missions in the United States, had come up\nthrough the grades of the priesthood to the office of high priest and was then serving as a\nmember of the presidency of the European Mission, he records in his journal the following:\n\"Most of all things, this day, I desire the Holy Spirit, which giveth life, yea life, more\nabundantly to both body and spirit.\" This is the power by which this kingdom grows.\n<\/p><p>\nYou will remember how Peter denied the Christ thrice\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34239\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34239)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34239)\">Matt. 26:75<\/a><\/span>)\nbefore he received the Holy Ghost, but\nafter he received the Holy Ghost, when he was commanded that he should no more preach\nChrist, and him crucified (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"158\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 158)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(158)\">1 Cor. 2:2<\/a><\/span>),\nin the streets of Jerusalem, Peter replied, \"Whom shall men obey?\nGod or man?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7596\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7596)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7596)\">Acts 4:19<\/a><\/span>). And he considered himself not worthy to be crucified as was his Lord. This is\nthe testimony of the Spirit and the power by which this kingdom is growing in the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nDEVELOPMENT OF GIFT OF THE SPIRIT\n<\/p><p>\nYou will recall the admonition of the Apostle Paul to his brother, Timothy, when he put him\nin remembrance that he should stir up the gift of God which he had received by the laying on\nof his, Paul's, hands (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5099\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5099)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5099)\">2 Tim. 1:6<\/a><\/span>).\nWas this idle talk, or do we receive the Spirit of God by the laying on\nof hands of his servants? If so, should we not all seek to stir up the gift of the Spirit that he\nmight guide and direct us?\n<\/p><p>\nI cannot conceive that any Latter-day Saint can be without a testimony of the divinity of this\nwork if he will but consider what has been accomplished in the Church because of the gift of\nthe Spirit of God which is in it.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is said that during the twenties, when the elders were being persecuted in Great Britain, the\ngovernment sent an officer here to investigate the \"Mormon problem\" and see what it was that\nmade them so determined to carry their message to other nations. When he returned his report\nwas that the \"black secret\" of Mormonism was the individual testimony of its members. And\nsurely, brothers and sisters, this is the \"black secret\" of Mormonism. You can travel\nthroughout the wards and stakes of Zion and the missions of the Church or go where you\nwill, and wherever you find Latter-day Saints who have received the gift of the Spirit by the\nlaying on of hands, this spirit is evidenced through their activities in the Church. A power is\nthere that cannot be found anywhere else in all the world.\n<\/p><p>\nLETTER FROM CONVERT\n<\/p><p>\nWe received a letter at the Presiding Bishop's office a few days ago from a young convert to\nthe Church through meeting our boys in the armed forces. He sent in a substantial amount of\ntithing. Then he bore his testimony in his letter, and I would like to read a portion of that\ntestimony to you today. He wrote:\n<\/p><p>\nBefore closing I would like to mention that I have gained a very strong testimony of very\nmany great, wonderful, and glorious things, since being baptized. I could not make this letter\nlong enough to bear my testimony, but I would like to say that I know, with a sincerity, that I\nhave God's blessing upon enclosing this money. It is a glorious inspiration when you see the\nroad of life, the direction of God's path, and the beam of his eternal goodness. These things I\nhave; these things I shall never forsake. With these, I have eternal happiness. Although this\nmoney which I am sending is termed in the thought of \"coins,\" I know, we know, that\nactually it is a symbolic but compact measurement of one-tenth of what the Lord has given\nand provided me as a blessing in life. Although this measurement is earthly, it has a spiritual\nmeaning, the same as all of God's ordinances. This ordinance I feel pleasured, humble, and\nprivileged to offer and perform.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord said that he had never given a temporal\ncommandment unto his children, that all of his commandments are spiritual\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12438\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12438)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12438)\">D&amp;C 29:34<\/a><\/span>), and this new\nconvert to the Church feels the power and the spirit of it; and I thought of this when my\nfather, President George F. Richards, was talking on the law of tithing this morning.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE LAW OF TITHING\n<\/p><p>\nI read in the last \"Kiplinger Letter\" that contributions to the churches were falling off because\nof financial conditions in the nations. But, as the Presiding Bishop of the Church, I can say to\nyou that the contributions in this Church are not falling off. They are increasing because there\nis spiritual power and meaning in the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember while in the mission field, Sister Richards and I were invited by a member of\nanother church to attend a lecture by an itinerant preacher who was going through the land\nexplaining to the churches how they could get out of debt. His program was that they should\nturn to the Lord's way of paying their tithes and their offerings, and if they would just do it\nfor ten months, their churches could all get out of debt. After the meeting I had the privilege\nof being introduced to him, and I told him I would like to bear testimony that he was getting\nnear the truth, that we had been preaching the law all our lives. Then I added, \"But what I\ncannot understand, Reverend, is that if tithing is the Lord's law of blessing his people, why\nyou do not ask them to pay their tithing all their lives, so that they, can have the blessing of\nthe Lord, instead of for only ten months.\" He replied, \"Mr. Richards, we cannot go quite that\nfar, yet.\" Now this is the difference between a man-made system and one where the Lord puts\ninto it the breath of life (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23529\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23529)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23529)\">Gen. 2:7<\/a><\/span>),\nthe Spirit of God, the Spirit by which we know the truth of all\nthings (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12552\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12552)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12552)\">D&amp;C 124:97<\/a><\/span>).\nWe do not send out any collectors in this Church for tithing. We do for fast offerings\nand for donations to build meetinghouses, as you know; but if you could be in our office, you\nwould see the number of men who come in years after their tithing is due to make settlement,\nbecause the Lord continues to speak to their souls through the power of the spirit of the Lord\nuntil they cannot find peace. We have gone back&mdash;not ten years&mdash;but twenty and more\nyears to give credit to the brethren on their tithing record. The spirit of the Lord is a better\ncollector than anyone in the world. We have ministers come in our office to inquire how we\nrun the tithing system in our Church, and when we tell them that all the wards and branches\nsend in all the money they receive to us, and we send back what their allowance is, they\nshake their heads and say, \"They wouldn't do that in our church. The local organizations\nwould take out what they need, first; and if there were any left they might send it to\nheadquarters.\"\n<\/p><p>\nTHE POWER OF A TESTIMONY\n<\/p><p>\nWell, that same spirit carries through in all the activities of the Church. The testimony of the\nSpirit of God is the most marvelous thing I know of in this world, and I would rather see that\ntestimony planted in the hearts of my children than anything I know of today.\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Ballard used to tell about the colonizer in the northwest who had learned what a\nmarvelous work we had done in colonizing, and came down here to write a treatise on it, to\nsee if he could make it work. After trying it he said, \"Mr. Ballard, you tell us what is wrong\nwith it. You read it over. I have tried it, but it just will not work for me.\" Brother Ballard\nread it and said, \"You have here a perfect corpse. If someone would just breathe into it the\nbreath of life, it would work.\" Now you know what the breath of life is.\n<\/p><p>\nWe were in the temple on Wednesday for seven hours and twenty minutes with the mission\npresidents. One of them told of his father in Canada who was sent up there to colonize when\nhe was a mere lad, by the President of the Church. He has wanted to return for years, and his\nson asked him why he did not come back. He said, \"I cannot return until the President of the\nChurch gives me my release.\" And I have met many others all up and down these valleys who\nhave had similar experiences. When they came here in the early days, they would have gladly\nremained in Salt Lake with the body of the Church and the brothers and sisters they had\nknown, save for one thing and that is the testimony of the Spirit of God. When they were\ncalled by his servants to settle other localities, they were true to their call. This is the spirit by\nwhich the Church has accomplished so much.\n<\/p><p>\nFAITH OF MISSIONARIES\n<\/p><p>\nWhile I was in Idaho recently, a stake president told me of a trip he and his wife had just\nmade to Texas. They wrote their missionary boy that they would pick him up&mdash;of course, they\nwould make arrangements with the mission president&mdash;and take him up to Chicago on a trip\nwith them. But when they got there, the boy said, \"No, Father, I could not be a quitter. I\ncould not leave my mission. I cannot go on the trip with you. You and Mother go on and\nhave a good time and leave me here in my missionary work.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSome of you have heard Bishop Isaacson tell a similar story about his boy. When he went\neast to make arrangements with his company so he could come into the Presiding Bishopric,\nhe wrote his boy in Boston that he and the boy's mother were coming up to visit him, and the\nboy wrote back and said, \"Well, Father, I would surely like to see you and Mother, but just\nremember I will not have much time to spend with you. I cannot spare it from my missionary\nwork.\"\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Smith, this morning, referred to the seventy odd thousand missionaries who have\ngone out for this Church. I dare say that out of that seventy thousand you could not have\nfound a half dozen who would have deserted their missionary call for all the money in this\nworld or for any position that might have been offered to them. Is there any power in the\nworld that can plant such feelings in the hearts of the children of men? Do you think Joseph\nSmith could have done it, that Brigham Young could have done it, that President Smith could\ndo it? No, that is the power of the testimony of the Holy Ghost.\n<\/p><p>\nSome of my Dutch friends, a man and his wife, came into the office the other day, and they\nsaid, \"Brother Richards, we have filled one mission together, but we would surely like to go\non another.\" Then he said, \"If we sell our home and our automobile, we can finance\nourselves.\" Is there any other cause in this world for which men would ask for the privilege\nof selling all they have&mdash;even to their homes&mdash;other than that they might bear witness to\nthe truth of this great Latter-day work? Much more could be said about sacrifices for\nmissionary work.\n<\/p><p>\nLOYALTY TO CHURCH LEADERS\n<\/p><p>\nSome of you will remember hearing President Anthony W. Ivins in a priesthood meeting here\nin this Tabernacle, tell how many times he had sold all he had that he might answer the call\nof his Church, and move on, even down into the colonies of Mexico, that great leader who\ncould have been such a political leader here. Why did he go? Would he have chosen or\nelected to go of himself? No, he went because of a testimony of the Spirit of God that burned\nin his soul, and that is the power by which the kingdom is growing.\n<\/p><p>\nYou have heard President Grant tell how he was offered a salary of forty thousand dollars to\naffiliate himself with an insurance company in the East, when he was but a young man. But\nhe was called of God to be an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, and he could not accept the\ninsurance company's offer. I want to tell you that some of our leaders today have given up\npositions that were worth just about ten times as much as the allowance they are getting from\nthe Church to live on. They did not ask for the privilege to serve thus, and they did not ask\nwhat they were going to receive. They were called by the voice of the Lord's anointed and\nthat is all that mattered, because in their soul was a testimony of the Spirit of God, \n<\/p><p>\nMay God help us so to live and labor and teach that this testimony may ever live in the hearts\nof our boys and our girls, the youth of Zion, I humbly pray, in the name of the Lord, Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
