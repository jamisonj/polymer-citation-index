Looking back at a time that passed all too quickly, I can now see that each day was filled with precious little moments full of opportunity to help our children hear the \u201cvoice of gladness\u201d in the gospel. Children are always learning from us. They are learning what is important by what we choose to do as well as what we choose not to do. Casual, infrequent family prayers, scripture study, and family home evenings will not be enough to fortify our children. Where will children learn the gospel and standards such as chastity, integrity, and honesty if not at home? These values can be reinforced at church, but parents are the most capable and most effective in teaching them to their children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/a-voice-of-gladness-for-our-children.p18\" class=\"\">Understanding who these children are and their potential in God\u2019s kingdom can help us have a greater desire to meet the challenges more patiently\u2014more lovingly.
