He suffered and paid the price for our sins if we would repent. He gave up His life, and He conquered death and rose from the grave that we all will live again. He is the Light and Life of the World. As King Benjamin taught, if we \u201cshould render all the thanks and praise which [our] whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created [us], and has kept and preserved [us], and \u2026 should serve him with all [our] whole souls yet [we] would be unprofitable servants\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40163\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40163)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40163)\">Mosiah 2:20\u201321<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/give-thanks-in-all-things.p9\" class=\"\">We give thanks for the revealed truths that provide a standard against which to measure all things.

Speaking at the dedication of his ward chapel, a Filipino bishop expressed his gratitude for the gospel message that came into his life about 10 years ago. He described how it rescued him from a life of selfishness, excess, and abusive practices and made him a good husband and father. He testified of the blessings that had come to him from paying his tithing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/give-thanks-in-all-things.p13\" class=\"\">Speaking at a leadership meeting, a counselor in a stake presidency who is a lawyer and community leader said: \u201cI can declare to the whole world without mental reservation that the greatest thing that ever happened in my life is my becoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

We have learned the importance of challenging members to abandon cultural traditions that are contrary to gospel commandments and covenants and to live so that they and their posterity \u201care no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; \u2026 built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21589\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21589)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21589)\">Eph. 2:19\u201320<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/give-thanks-in-all-things.p16\" class=\"\">People who do this become part of the worldwide gospel culture of commandments and covenants and ordinances and blessings.

Such followers of Christ are found in every land where the gospel and the Church have been established. We have many of them in the Philippines, and we are working to encourage more of them. We do this by growing from centers of strength, concentrating our teaching where there are sufficiently large groups of committed members to provide the friendshipping, the teachings, the role models, and the needed assistance to the struggling newly born members who are just learning what the gospel asks of us and gives to us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>IV.<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/give-thanks-in-all-things.p18\" class=\"\">The revelations, for which we are grateful, show that we should even give thanks for our afflictions because they turn our hearts to God and give us opportunities to prepare for what God would have us become.

Pioneers like President John Taylor, who witnessed the murder of their prophet and experienced prolonged persecution and incredible hardships for their faith, praised God and thanked Him. Through their challenges and the courageous and inspired actions they took to meet them, they grew in faith and in spiritual stature. Through their afflictions they became what God desired them to become, and they laid the foundation of the great work that blesses our lives today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/give-thanks-in-all-things.p22\" class=\"\">Like the pioneers, we should thank God for our adversities and pray for guidance in meeting them.

Nevertheless, I often heard her say that the Lord consecrated that affliction for her gain because her husband\u2019s death compelled her to develop her talents and serve and become something that she could never have become without that seeming tragedy.
