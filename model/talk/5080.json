Knowing our relationship to our Heavenly Father helps us understand the divine nature that is in us and our potential. The doctrine of the fatherhood of God lays a solid foundation for self-esteem. The hymn titled \u201cI Am a Child of God\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 301) states this doctrine in simple terms. Can a person who understands his divine parenthood lack self-esteem?

President Brigham Young wisely recognized that \u201cthe time of youth and early manhood is the proper time\u201d to gain mastery over bodily appetites and passions.

This revelation has been scrutinized and ignored, attacked and defended, ridiculed and praised. Meanwhile, faithful Saints have observed it as a token of their obedience to God.
