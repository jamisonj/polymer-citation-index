He said, as he escaped with his life, and that barely, that he had been ill with fright. He said, \u201cMy voice quavered, my heart palpitated, my mouth was dry; I was really frightened.

Subsequently in that same marvelous chapter, Christ defined his gospel in some beautiful and to me eternally significant words: \u201cBehold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you\u2014that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/every-man-in-his-own-place.p6\" class=\"\">It is my earnest conviction that we came here for the same reason.

One who comes to mind was a well-dressed, good-looking young man, sharp, well-spoken, and contemporary in every constructive way, but he was obviously deeply distressed as he rose to offer a greeting in behalf of the university student body of which he was president. His audience was made up of regents and trustees of institutions of higher education meeting in conference at his school. The group had listened to a series of speeches from educators, noting with approval the abandonment on college and university campuses of the doctrine of <span class=\"emphasis\">in loco parentis, <\/span>a term that means, as you may know, \u201cstanding in the place of a parent.\u201d The schools, the speakers said, no longer accept the responsibility of standing in the place of a parent to the students who attend them.

While a few activists have had the chief attention, every student in the affected schools has been influenced by the breakdown of the rules that once governed the lives of undergraduates.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/every-man-in-his-own-place.p26\" class=\"\">Only a few years ago most colleges made a vigorous effort to enforce regulations governing dormitory standards and hours, student dress, sexual behavior, drinking, and chaperonage. Now in many institutions all of this has changed.

Outside Chattanooga, Tennessee, is a place known as Missionary Ridge. During the Civil War a numerically superior Southern force was dug in on the Ridge, protecting it against Northern attack. The defenders were well fortified and strongly entrenched, holding strategic positions that would seem to make them invulnerable. Yet the hill was lost. Why? The soldiers on Missionary Ridge were so isolated from each other that they had lost touch with each other. They could not hear their leaders through the din. Plainly visible to them were the large numbers of the enemy coming up the hill to attack them. Feeling alone and frightened, a few individual defenders panicked and surrendered and were soon joined by large numbers of their fellows. The battle was lost. They were not cowards; they thought they were alone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/every-man-in-his-own-place.p29\" class=\"\">How very parallel are some of the scenes of conflict we see going on around us! God\u2019s choice young sons and daughters are being subjected to the new social arrangements and pressures currently in vogue. Many are cut off from any supportive roots.

What if they have no place to turn to for refuge, for strength, encouragement, instruction? What if they have no parents to whom they feel they can go for reassurance, forgiveness, unconditional love?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/every-man-in-his-own-place.p30\" class=\"\">O! the implications are so clear for those of us who have been granted stewardship among the children of God\u2014for parents, teachers, leaders, neighbors, concerned adults, advisers, home teachers!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/every-man-in-his-own-place.p31\" class=\"\">Of late I have found myself thanking God more fervently than ever before for the gospel and the Church.
