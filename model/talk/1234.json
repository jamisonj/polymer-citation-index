Lee, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1962, pp. 79-83<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nPresident McKay, as I now come to announce the first tangible step forward that the Church\nwill see on a church-wide basis, I am reminded of something you said when you came to the\nfirst regional meeting of the church welfare plan held in 1936 down in the old Pioneer Stake\nHall where all the stake presidents of this area were called together. You sat through an hour\nor two of what must have been somewhat of a painful discussion of the details of beginning\nthis far-reaching new welfare movement. You asked no questions, you made no comment, but\nat the conclusion you made this statement in something of a parable which I should like to\napply tonight to this correlation movement.\n<\/p><p>\n\"An engineer pulled his train into a station one dark and stormy night, and while the engineer\nwas out oiling his engine and getting ready for the next run, a timid passenger left his place\nin the train and walked up to the engineer and asked, 'Aren't you afraid to pull your train out\ninto the dark tonight, raining and storming like it is?' Without looking up, the engineer\nreplied, 'I am not pulling my engine out into the dark tonight.' 'Why,' said the passenger,\n'it's pitch dark outside the lights of the station. I should think that with the responsibility of\nthese four or five hundred passengers depending upon your handling of the\ntrain, you would be a nervous wreck.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"For an answer the engineer pointed up to the bright headlight and he said, 'Do you see that\nlight up there? That throws out an intense white light a thousand yards ahead on the track.\nWhen I pull out of the station tonight, I will be running my engine only to the first circle of\nthat light, a thousand yards away, and when I get to the outer circle of that light it will still\nbe out another thousand yards in front of me. All through this dark night I will not be running\nin one foot of darkness all the way.'\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen President McKay said, \"Now, brethren, the first goal of this welfare program is October\n1936, the first harvest time. That is the first circle of light. And when we get to October, the\nlight will be out ahead of us, and I can promise you one thing, that all through this night of\nuncertainty when we are trying to establish the security of our people in a temporal way, this\nChurch will be running in light of the revelations that come from God, all the way.\" We have\nseen that prediction completely fulfilled.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first light that the Lord gave us as to how we should instruct his Church in all matters\npertaining to his kingdom was given in that same revelation from which Elder Romney has\nread. It pertained to the holding of a stake quarterly conference, as we have come to know it.\nThis is what the Lord said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Every elder, priest, teacher, or deacon is to be ordained according to the gifts and callings of\nGod unto him; and he is to be ordained by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is in the one\nwho ordains him.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen he added: \"The several elders composing this church of Christ are to meet in conference\nonce in three months or from time to time as said conferences shall direct or appoint\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14099\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14099)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14099)\">D&amp;C 20:60-61<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat assignment to hold quarterly conferences with the elders of the Church was followed\nthen by another pertinent instruction which impressed the need for the constant attendance of\nteachers that were to come from the headquarters of the Church to instruct, at the conferences,\nthe elders of the Church, which clearly indicated that the Lord intended that a stake quarterly\nconference was to be primarily a training school for leaders, as well as the Church\nmembership generally. Note, now, this instruction which verifies that conclusion: \n<\/p><p>\n\"It shall be the duty of the several churches, composing the church of Christ, to send one or\nmore of their teachers to attend the several conferences held by the elders of the church\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14100\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14100)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14100)\">D&amp;C 20:81<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nRepeatedly church members have asked as to how, with the rapid growth of the Church, the\nGeneral Authorities could continue to keep contact with and to properly direct the work. To\nillustrate what some have posed as a difficult administrative hurdle: in the twenty-one years\nsince I became a member of the General Authorities, we have increased 222 stakes and about\ntwenty missions more than we had when I became a member of the Council of the Twelve.\nThis means that when multiplied by four conferences in each stake each year, that we are now\nhaving just short of 900 more stake conferences to hold generally than we were holding\ntwenty-one years ago. Hence, the question as to how the General Authorities were going to\nkeep contact with the stakes of the Church being multiplied at that rate and likewise keep a\nclose supervision of the missions.\n<\/p><p>\nIn a revelation to President John Taylor the Lord answered that question, and you will note\nhow clearly he said it: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . Let not your hearts be troubled, neither be ye concerned about the management and\norganization of my Church and Priesthood and the accomplishment of my work. Fear not and\nobserve my laws and I will reveal unto you, from time to time, through the channels that I\nhave appointed . . . (I want you to mark that) . . . <i>through the channels that I have appointed<\/i>,\neverything that shall be necessary for the future development and perfection of my Church,\nfor the adjustment and the rolling forth of my kingdom, and for the building up and the\nestablishment of my Zion, for ye are my Priesthood and I am your God\" (B. H. Roberts,\n<i>Seventy's Course of Theology<\/i>, vol. 1, p. 10).\n<\/p><p>\nWe who are working closely together in the development of a more effective\ncorrelation have had the unmistakable evidence of divine direction through the channels by\nwhich the Lord told President John Taylor he would reveal himself and the development and\nthe rolling forth of the work of the Lord. Now to understand what we mean by that you have\nbut to kneel with President McKay in our council meetings and to hear him pray with a\nfervor that thrills every man of the council who kneels with him, \"Heavenly Father, keep the\nchannel of communication open between thee and us.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe relationship of the expanding organization and development of the correlation courses of\nstudy of the auxiliary organizations as explained by Elder Hinckley and Elder Evans have\nbeen done through the all-church coordinating council which is comprised of the heads of all\nthe auxiliaries, the Presiding Bishop, and the administrator of the church school system.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have now gone forward as the brethren have explained in consultation with the all-church\ncoordinating council together with four members of the twelve and executive secretaries\nwhich make up our research staff. It is now becoming increasingly clear that not only the\n\"<i>what<\/i>\" to teach in the curricula of the Church is important in the coordinating of courses of\nstudy and the activity programs of the Church, but it is just as important, and, in fact, going\nhand in hand must be the \"<i>how<\/i>\" of leadership training in stakes and missions.\n<\/p><p>\nKeeping in mind what the Lord has clearly instructed as to leadership training in the stake\nconferences every three months, the light of spiritual guidance as to the next steps ahead\nbegins to break through.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first step in this new development came last spring when the Presidency and the twelve\ndecided that beginning in 1963, General Authorities would attend only two of the stake\nconferences annually in each stake. At the same time President McKay warned of the\nimportance and the absolute necessity of the General Authorities having the conduct for all\nstake conferences under their close supervision.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom the first announcement of the new correlation program, there has been constant inquiry\nmade as to where the general auxiliary boards were to function, and always, with our limited\nview at the beginning, we answered, \"Well, when we get to that problem, the answer will\ncome.\" Now the answer has come. Beginning with 1963, alternating with conferences attended\nby the General Authorities, general auxiliary board representatives will be assigned by the\nFirst Presidency to attend these other two stake conferences each year.\n<\/p><p>\nFor the conferences during the first half of the year, one representative from the Relief\nSociety and one from the Primary general board will go to each stake conference as assigned.\nDuring the last half of the year, alternating with quarterly conferences attended by the General\nAuthorities, one representative from the Sunday School and one from the MIA general board\nwill attend the stake conferences as assigned by the First Presidency. The general plan for\nthese conferences attended by the general auxiliary board representatives as is now being\nformulated will be something like this: These quarterly conferences attended by auxiliary\nboard representatives will take the place of what have been called the annual conventions\nheretofore held by each general board in each stake or on a regional basis. There will be no\nsuch annual conventions in this new conference program. Instead, the quarterly conference,\nwhere general board representatives attend, will take the place of these annual auxiliary\nconventions.\n<\/p><p>\nThe emphasis now at these conferences attended by general board representatives will be on\nleadership training and not on curricula presentation. The introduction of courses of study and\nthe activities for the coming year by each auxiliary will be, hereafter, announced and\ndeveloped at the annual conferences held by each auxiliary at church headquarters&mdash;June\nconference for the MIA then for the Primary, Relief Society, and Sunday School conferences\non schedules as followed in the past.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, to give you some idea of the suggested schedule that will be followed at these stake\nconferences attended by the auxiliaries, and this is just a rough sketch of how it may work: \n<\/p><p>\nOn Saturday morning each auxiliary representative, beginning probably about 9:00 o'clock,\nwill begin a series of training sessions and problem discussions with their respective\norganization leaders separately, and they will carry out a predetermined program which has\nbeen worked out in consultation with the advisers to each auxiliary; these advisers, of course,\nbeing made up of members of the twelve and then approved by the Presidency and the\nTwelve. Toward the evening and probably about 7:00 o'clock on Saturday, both auxiliary\nrepresentatives will then meet with stake and ward priesthood leaders, the stake presidency,\nprobably, the high council, and ward bishoprics, and there in that meeting these two auxiliary\nrepresentatives will present to priesthood leaders, a predetermined and approved program of\ninstruction and explanation. This meeting will be presided over by the stake president.\n<\/p><p>\nOn Sunday, at both general sessions held at 10:00 am and 2:00 pm, both auxiliary\nrepresentatives will attend and will participate in both sessions as a team, so that now as they\ncome to you instead of presenting their program as separate and sometimes unrelated and\nuncorrelated units, they will come to you, for example, in the first of these conferences in\n1963, the Primary representing the children's program and the Relief Society representing the\nmother's program. How much more important will this kind of teamwork so presented mean\nto the church membership as both mother and child programs are related to each other.\n<\/p><p>\nThey will carry out a program and demonstrate the harmony of the auxiliary programs as they\nrelate to the priesthood and the home. This kind of meeting with the whole church\nmembership in the general sessions will give the auxiliary representatives the opportunity to\nmeet the maximum of the total stake membership and to impress the essential co-operation\nbetween the auxiliary organizations, the priesthood, and the home.\n<\/p><p>\nWhile both auxiliary representatives will participate in both sessions, one session might\nfeature, for example, in the case of the Relief Society and Primary, the Singing Mothers who\ncould be assigned the music at one session and the primary children singing chorus at the\nother session. At both these sessions the stake president will preside.\n<\/p><p>\nAt the other stake conferences attended by General Authorities during the first half of the\nyear, the missionary work and the welfare program will be stressed. It is likely that\nrepresentatives of these two phases of the work may be assigned to accompany the visiting\nGeneral Authority. That organization and the details thereof have yet to be announced.\n<\/p><p>\nAt the conferences during the last half of the year, attended by General Authorities, the\npriesthood correlation or the enlargement of ward teaching as Elder Romney has explained it\nand genealogical and temple work will be stressed. It is conceivable that a program of training\nand instruction in genealogical work might be considered through the whole of Saturday, just\nas the program of the auxiliaries will be developed, if they so desire. It is also likely that\nrepresentatives of these two phases of vital church programs may be assigned to accompany\nthe visiting General Authority.\n<\/p><p>\nThus you see that every phase of the Lord's work will receive attention, with a full\ncorrelation of courses of study and activities and with stress being placed on the training of\nand the instruction of local stake and ward leaders.\n<\/p><p>\nOne concluding thought, and may I say, something of a testimony&mdash;President McKay\nsometime ago in talking to the Presidency and the twelve, urged us to give time for more\nmeditation so that we could tune in with spiritual forces that we had a right to and should\nexpect to direct us in our work. He said, \"The best time for me is early in the morning when\nmy mind and body are rested. But when the inspiration comes, and it can come just as clearly\nas though you were taking down a telephone and dialing in for information; when the Lord\ntells you what to do, you have to have the courage to do what he instructs you.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt is that, President McKay, which has been one of the most humbling experiences of this last\nyear. Under your assignment, I bear humble witness to the Church I have sought that with all\nthe faith I could muster, I have importuned the Lord. Sometimes the startling\nnature of my assignment has required courage almost beyond my strength. I come to you\ntonight subdued in spirit, I come to you with a sincere witness that the Lord is revealing and\nworking through channels that he has appointed. Don't you ever let anybody tell you, the\nmembership of the Church, that the Lord is not today revealing and directing and developing\nplans which are needed to concentrate the entire forces of this Church to meet the challenge\nof the insidious forces at work to thwart and to tear down and to undermine the church and\nkingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear you my solemn witness that I know that God is directing this work today and revealing\nhis mind and will. The light is shining through, and if we can get the priesthood now to come\nalive and to put into full gear the full strength of the priesthood, we shall see some of the\nmost wonderful developments and some of the greatest things happen to the forces which the\nLord can set in motion that we have ever known in this dispensation.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us and help me, President McKay, that I will not fail in the assignment which you\nhave given to me, and may we all be so close to the veil that forces beyond sight can be near\nus to comfort us, to guide us, and when we would be weak and almost to fall, that we might\nnot fail in the responsibility which the Lord has given to us, I pray and bear my solemn\ntestimony, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
