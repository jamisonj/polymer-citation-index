I believe it was one of the few times, if not the only time, that we General Authorities were asked by the Brethren to treat a certain subject at a stake conference. That week I went to Richfield, and Brother Clifford Young went over to Monroe. They had a chorus of young folks from the school sing at Richfield while I was there in the morning and then they went over to Monroe in the afternoon and sang where Brother Young was. It happened that I talked about the assigned subject in the morning, and Clifford talked about it in the afternoon. When we made our report to the Council of the Twelve, Brother Young said it had been a fine occasion; the only bad thing about it was that those students had had to listen to the same subject twice. President George F. Richards, then president of the Twelve, said, \u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t worry about that. I don\u2019t suppose they knew you were talking about the same subject.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p5\" class=\"\">I believe that in the remarks I shall now make, you will be able to understand that I am talking about the same subject the Brethren covered this morning in that wonderful presentation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p6\" class=\"\">As Bishop Brown said, the Welfare Services Department of the Church comprises the three programs: the original welfare program, which he characterized as the production program, the personal services, and the health services. Of these three programs, the first organized was the old welfare program, now termed the Production-Distribution program. This program concerns the implementation of the Lord\u2019s declaration, \u201cIn the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23879\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23879)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23879)\">Gen. 3:19<\/a><\/span>); and also the second great commandment, \u201cThou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33268\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33268)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33268)\">Mark 12:31<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p7\" class=\"\">You know, of course, how these commandments were implemented anciently.

Our more active involvement in this program will be greatly appreciated and will be of great value.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p69\" class=\"\">We must never forget that our primary purpose in this welfare program is to do away with the \u201ccurse of idleness,\u201d abolish \u201cthe evils of a dole,\u201d and to establish once more amongst our people \u201cindustry, thrift and self respect\u201d; that \u201cWork is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership.\u201d (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Conference Report,<\/span> Oct. 1936, p. 3.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p70\" class=\"\">In the welfare production phase of the program, our record is a little better. \u201cEvery ward and stake\u201d said the Presidency, \u201cis expected to face the necessity, not only of providing for its own, but of helping other wards and stakes.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Conference Report,<\/span> Oct. 1936, p. 4.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p71\" class=\"\">The implementing of this charge requires that every ward, by itself or in cooperation with other wards, acquire a production facility. During the first five years\u2014from 1936 to 1941\u2014Elder Melvin J. Ballard and President Lee (then a stake president) went throughout the stakes of the Church organizing welfare regions and teaching the program. Thereafter, each year for fifteen years, I was assigned by the Brethren to meet with stake and ward leadership of all stakes in the United States and Canada. This, with my traveling companions, I did. Our responsibility was to teach the program, assign a production budget for the ensuing year, and to urge each bishop, individually or in cooperation with other bishops, to acquire a production project.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p72\" class=\"\">During those years, a welfare committee representative was regularly assigned to accompany General Authorities to stake conferences to hold welfare meetings and teach the program.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p73\" class=\"\">The procedural method for teaching Church welfare has now changed, but the objectives of the program remain the same. Its principles are eternal. It is the gospel in its perfection\u2014the united order, toward which we move.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p74\" class=\"\">The most recent available information is that about 73 percent of the wards in the United States and Canada are involved in welfare production projects. This leaves about 27 percent\u2014over a thousand wards\u2014that are not. Brethren\u2014you stake presidents and bishops\u2014will you please take steps to see that this void is filled?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p75\" class=\"\">Let us look about us, brethren, and try to understand the signs of the times. We must try to realize that the time approaches of which the Lord spoke when he said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p76\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, this is the preparation wherewith I prepare you, and the foundation, and the ensample which I give unto you, whereby you may accomplish the commandments which are given you;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p77\" class=\"\">\u201cThat through my providence, notwithstanding the tribulation which shall descend upon you, that the church may stand independent above all other creatures beneath the celestial world.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16501\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16501)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16501)\">D&amp;C 78:13\u201314<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p78\" class=\"\">Let us move rapidly into a position to fill our welfare budget assignments with commodities produced on our own projects rather than with cash.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p79\" class=\"\">What has been said in these remarks so far concerns but one aspect of the Welfare Services department. The other programs are of like import.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p80\" class=\"\">The relief, encouragement, comfort, rehabilitation, homes supplied, companionships established, hope and peace inspired, and other charitable and benevolent services rendered through our social services program are incalculable. No money value can be placed upon them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p81\" class=\"\">Our most recently established program\u2014health services\u2014is rendering a spectacular service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p82\" class=\"\">We have been introduced to some of the activities of these programs this morning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p83\" class=\"\">One of the by-products of these programs is substantial financial relief to other sources upon which the cost of the services we render would fall if we did not perform them voluntarily. For example, during the period July 1, 1974, through June 30, 1975, we rendered through our Welfare Services\u2014exclusive of indirect assistance such as capital expenditures and overhead\u2014assistance of a cash value in excess of $20 million.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p84\" class=\"\">Church membership in the United States is about one percent of the total population. This means that if all others rendered assistance in the way we do, it would equate to at least two billion dollars.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p85\" class=\"\">As we quicken our pace in gathering members into the fold in areas where the fundamentals of Welfare Services are not understood nor practiced, we need experienced help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p86\" class=\"\">We, therefore, request the assistance of you stake presidents and bishops in identifying mature, experienced priesthood leaders and their wives who may be called on full-time missions as Welfare Services missionaries. These couples will assist priesthood leaders, in developing areas of the Church, by teaching basic Welfare Services principles and by supervising health and agriculture missionaries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">The Welfare Services missionary couples should meet the following qualifications:<\/p>\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The brother should have served as a bishop, stake president, or in some other similar Church position in which he has had firsthand experience in administering Welfare Services.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>They should not now have dependent children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>They should be financially, physically, and emotionally prepared to serve an eighteen- to twenty-four-month mission in areas such as Latin America, Asia, and the islands of the Pacific.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">4.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>They must meet all standards of worthiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/welfare-services.p92\" class=\"\">Especially needed are those with language skills or the ability to quickly learn a language.
