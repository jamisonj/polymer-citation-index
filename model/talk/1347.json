McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1964, pp. 4-6<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brethren and sisters:\n<\/p><p>\nOnly at the last moment have I given in to the pleas of the doctors and members of the\nfamily not to put the added strain on my heart by attempting to go over to the Tabernacle to\nmeet with you in this conference. However, I am with you in spirit and watching the\nproceedings of the meeting over television.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is over fifty-eight years ago that I stood at the pulpit in the Tabernacle for the first time as\none of the General Authorities of the Church. I remember well then my trembling and\nhumility at facing such an audience and accepting a position as one of the General\nAuthorities. The passing of over one half a century has made it no easier to discharge the\nresponsibility that one holds as a General Authority. This morning, as then and during the\nintervening years, I ask for your sympathy and prayers.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Blessings of the Decade<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nEvidences of progress in the Church give us true cause for rejoicing. The Lord has blessed us\nwith eventful and prosperous years during the past decade. The loyalty of the\nmembers to the ideals and teachings of the Man of Galilee has been evidenced in many ways:\nby the response of tens of thousands to the message of the restored gospel as proclaimed by\nmessengers at home and abroad; by ready and willing response to \"calls\" and \"assignments\";\nand by increased tithes and offerings. Surely with these and other equally meritorious services\nthe Lord is pleased, for he has said, \". . . this is my work and my glory&mdash;to bring to pass the\nimmortality and eternal life of man\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39214\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39214)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39214)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Eternal Vigilance and Righteous Effort the Price of Peace<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nBut let us ever remember that peace and progress are attained only at the price of eternal\nvigilance and constant righteous efforts. The forces of evil and misery are still rampant in the\nworld and must be resisted. The powers of darkness have increased in accordance with the\nspread of the gospel. Whole nations are declaring atheism to be the law of the land. Atheism\nhas become the greatest weapon Satan has to use, and its evil influence is bringing\ndegradation to millions throughout the world. Even at this moment as the sun throws warm,\ngenial rays on snowcapped summits and frost-covered valleys of this western land, the public\npress tells of increasing activity on the part of the evil one. Warlike activities and\ninternational misunderstandings prevent the establishing of peace and divert man's inventive\ngenius from the paths of science, art, and literature, and apply it to human retardation and the\nholocaust of war.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Peace When . . .<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe rising sun can dispel the darkness of night, but it cannot banish the blackness of malice,\nhatred, bigotry, and selfishness from the hearts of humanity. Happiness and peace will come\nto earth only as the light of love and human compassion enter the souls of men.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"With Healing In His Wings\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt was for this purpose that Christ, the Son of righteousness, \"with healing in his wings\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32783\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32783)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32783)\">Mal. 4:2<\/a><\/span>), came\nin the Meridian of Time. Through him wickedness shall be overcome, hatred, enmity, strife,\npoverty, and war abolished. This will be accomplished only by a slow but never-failing\nprocess of changing men's mental and spiritual attitude. The ways and habits of the world\ndepend upon the thoughts and soul-convictions of men and women. If, therefore, we would\nchange the world, we must first change people's thoughts. Only to the extent that men desire\npeace and brotherhood can the world be made better. No peace, even though temporarily\nobtained, will be permanent, whether to individuals or nations, unless it is built upon the solid\nfoundation of eternal principles.\n<\/p><p>\nMen may yearn for peace, cry for peace, and work for peace, but there will be no peace until\nthey follow the path pointed out by the Living Christ. He is the true light of men's lives.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Mission of the Church to Establish Peace<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is to establish peace. The\nLiving Christ is its head. Under him tens of thousands of men in the Church are divinely\nauthorized to represent him in variously assigned positions. It is the duty of these\nrepresentatives to manifest brotherly love, first toward one another, then toward all mankind;\nto seek unity, harmony, and peace in organizations within the Church, and then by precept\nand example extend these virtues throughout the world.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that each day may find members of the Church truer, purer, nobler than the last, that\nthey, with intellect and hearts united, may hasten the day when \". . . the Lord will bless his\npeople with peace\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41843\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41843)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41843)\">Ps. 29:11<\/a><\/span>)\nthat they may \". . . lift up an ensign of peace, and make a\nproclamation of peace unto the ends of the earth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14478\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14478)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14478)\">D&amp;C 105:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Blessings of Peace for the Righteous<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI invoke upon the righteous everywhere our Father's blessings that peace may be in their\nhearts and in their homes, that unity may strengthen their ranks, that they may be blessed with\nthe desire and means to teach others, that goodness may come into the lives of men\nthroughout the earth, that our Father's kingdom may be enlarged and\nmagnified, that his sons and daughters in all the world may find fellowship with the Saints,\nthat the designs of the wicked may be frustrated and the purposes of the sinful come to\nnaught, that unrighteous dominion shall be broken, and that truth shall govern the earth, that\nGod's people&mdash;those who keep his commandments&mdash;may become as a light set upon a hill\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35312\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35312)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35312)\">Matt. 5:14<\/a><\/span>),\nan ensign to the nations (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25251\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25251)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25251)\">Isa. 5:26<\/a><\/span>),\nin anticipation of the long-awaited day when the Prince of Peace\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25253\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25253)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25253)\">Isa. 9:6<\/a><\/span>)\nshall reign as King of Kings and Lord of Lords (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42372\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42372)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42372)\">Rev. 19:16<\/a><\/span>).\nThis is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ.
