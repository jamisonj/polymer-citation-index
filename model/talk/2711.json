There is a very provoking and a very disturbing question about those who died without baptism. What about them? If there is none other name given under heaven whereby man must be saved (and that is true), and they have lived and died without even hearing that name, and if baptism is essential (and it is), and they died without even the invitation to accept it, where are they now?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-redemption-of-the-dead.p18\" class=\"\">That is hard to explain. It describes most of the human family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-redemption-of-the-dead.p19\" class=\"\">There are several religions larger than most Christian denominations, and together they are larger than all of them combined.

What is the answer for them?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-redemption-of-the-dead.p20\" class=\"\">That is a most disturbing question. What power would establish one Lord and one baptism, and then allow it to be that most of the human family never comes within its influence? With that question unanswered, the vast majority of the human family must be admitted to be lost, and against any reasonable application of the law of justice or of mercy, either. How could Christianity itself be sustained?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-redemption-of-the-dead.p21\" class=\"\">When you find the true church you will find the answer to that disturbing question.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-redemption-of-the-dead.p22\" class=\"\">If a church has no answer for that, how can it lay claim to be His Church?

There must, they supposed, be other names whereby man could be saved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-redemption-of-the-dead.p25\" class=\"\">The answer to that puzzling challenge could not be invented by men, but was <span class=\"emphasis\">revealed.<\/span> I underline the word <span class=\"emphasis\">revealed.<\/span> Revelation too is an essential characteristic of His Church. Communication with Him through revelation was established when the Church was established. It has not ceased and it is constant in the Church today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-redemption-of-the-dead.p26\" class=\"\">As I address myself to the question of those who died without baptism, I do so with the deepest reverence, for it touches on a sacred work. Little known to the world, we move obediently forward in a work that is so marvelous in its prospects, transcendent above what man might have dreamed of, supernal, inspired, and true. In it lies the answer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-redemption-of-the-dead.p27\" class=\"\">In the earliest days of the Church the Prophet was given direction through revelation that work should commence on the building of a temple, akin to the temples that had been constructed anciently.

With proper authority an individual could be baptized for and in behalf of someone who had never had the opportunity. That individual would then accept or reject the baptism, according to his own desire.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-redemption-of-the-dead.p30\" class=\"\">This work came as a great reaffirmation of something very basic that the Christian world now only partly believes: and that is that there is life after death.
