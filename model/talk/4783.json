My wife, Kathy, says she always knew I would receive a life sentence of some type, but neither of us dreamed it would be something so rewarding!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-eye-single-to-the-glory-of-god.p4\" class=\"\">No one can stand at this pulpit for the first time\u2014where so many truly great men and women have stood over the years\u2014without experiencing a strong sense of his personal inadequacy and an overwhelming desire to express appreciation. I feel both today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-eye-single-to-the-glory-of-god.p5\" class=\"\">I want to express appreciation to my friends and neighbors in the little mountain valley where I was born and where I have chosen to live my life thus far\u2014also, to my noble ancestors and my living extended family. I am constantly aware of their goodness and their interest in me. I sincerely thank my parents, who continue to work on a project that began at my birth forty-seven years ago. I am especially indebted to my companion. Her support, love, and cheerful disposition make my life very enjoyable. She would want you to know of her own strong conviction of the truthfulness of the restored gospel. Together we have been blessed with eight delightful children, whose development and happiness are our primary concerns. I love each one of them very much.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-eye-single-to-the-glory-of-god.p6\" class=\"\">I am also very grateful for the blessing of daily association with the General Authorities of the Church. I pledge to these dedicated men my loyalty, my love, and my untiring efforts in building up God\u2019s kingdom. I promise them also that I will always heed the Lord\u2019s admonition contained in the Doctrine and Covenants: \u201cTherefore, strengthen your brethren in all your conversation, in all your prayers, in all your exhortations, and in all your doings.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19097\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19097)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19097)\">D&amp;C 108:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-eye-single-to-the-glory-of-god.p7\" class=\"\">Finally, I am very grateful for each of you, my brothers and sisters all over the world, who have come to a knowledge of the Redeemer and are part of His Church.

I speak of one of these today: the necessity of performing our earthly labors with \u201can eye single to the glory of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18927\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18927)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18927)\">D&amp;C 4:5<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-eye-single-to-the-glory-of-god.p10\" class=\"\">The temptation to seek personal recognition and reward from our service to others is ever-present. The pattern was established in the pre-earth life by Satan himself. There, when the Father explained His plan of salvation for the inhabitants of this earth and the need for a redeemer, Satan responded by saying: \u201cBehold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39757\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39757)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39757)\">Moses 4:1<\/a><\/span>.)

Such members, for instance, care little about receiving credit or recognition for their good deeds. They are more interested in feeding the Lord\u2019s sheep than in counting them. In fact, they frequently find their greatest happiness in serving anonymously, thereby leaving the beneficiaries of their kindness with no one to thank or praise except the Lord. In this regard, we can perhaps learn a lesson from our Christian brothers and sisters in the Amish communities of Pennsylvania. It is reported that their writers frequently compose and publish poetry and religious literature anonymously, so as to deflect attention from themselves and ensure that only God receives the glory.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-eye-single-to-the-glory-of-god.p13\" class=\"\">There is something particularly noble about the good works of those who act without restraint or compulsion and with no expectation of reward or recognition.

Without special occasion, except the joy of doing something nice for someone, she hid a tasty bedtime treat under my pillow.

Their concern is focused on the opportunities for service that church callings present, rather than on gaining personal notoriety. Such members, who serve competently and quietly, regardless of whether they are the \u201chighest\u201d or the \u201cleast\u201d in the kingdom, are probably those that the Apostle Paul had in mind when he wrote, \u201cAnd those members of the body [meaning the Church], which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"819\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 819)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(819)\">1 Cor. 12:23<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/an-eye-single-to-the-glory-of-god.p16\" class=\"\">The merit of rendering faithful service, regardless of one\u2019s position in the Church, was tenderly brought to my attention several years ago during the funeral service of a man who had done much good in his life without ever being recognized with a high church office.
