My wife and I purposely arrived several hours early. As we explored the beautiful gardens and well-kept streets of the MTC, we couldn\u2019t help but notice the happiness that radiated from the faces of hundreds of young elders and sisters, each focused on acquiring new language skills and learning to better appreciate his or her purpose as a missionary.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/small-and-simple-things.p6\" class=\"\">As I paused to fully take in this remarkable sight, I reflected upon the words of Alma when he commanded his son Helaman to keep a history of his people as part of the records which had been entrusted with him and to keep all these things sacred so that they would one day go forth unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/small-and-simple-things.p7\" class=\"\">Alma then told him:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/small-and-simple-things.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cNow ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/small-and-simple-things.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125716\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125716)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125716)\">Alma 37:6\u20137<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/small-and-simple-things.p10\" class=\"\">The innocence and youth of our missionaries exemplify the Lord\u2019s way\u2014that those who are humble may \u201cinvite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service<\/span> [2004], 1).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/small-and-simple-things.p11\" class=\"\">As members of the Church, we are able, through our own small and simple things, to \u201c[convince] many of the error of their ways\u201d and help bring \u201cthem to the knowledge of their God unto the salvation of their souls\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125717\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125717)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125717)\">Alma 37:8<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/small-and-simple-things.p12\" class=\"\">On one occasion I accompanied a stake president and bishop to visit a less-active member. We taught him, in a very simple way, about the blessings of the Sabbath. We expressed to him our sincere love. He responded, \u201cAll I needed was to have someone come and give me an <span class=\"emphasis\">abrazo,<\/span>\u201d or hug. I immediately stood up and embraced him. The next day was Sunday.

She had decided to stop coming to church. One of the visiting teachers asked Martha if they could sing a hymn together this one last time, and she agreed. As they sang, something special happened. Little by little, the Spirit began to fill the room. Each of them felt it. Martha\u2019s heart began to soften. With her eyes filled with tears, she expressed to her visiting teachers the feelings of her heart. At that moment, she realized that she knew that the gospel was true. She now thanked her visiting teachers and expressed a desire for them to return. From that day forward, she received them with joy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/small-and-simple-things.p14\" class=\"\">Martha began to attend church with her young daughter. For years they attended regularly, with Martha never losing hope that her husband might eventually choose to join them. At last the day came when the Lord touched his heart, and he began to attend with them, as did their other daughter soon thereafter. This family began to feel the true joy that comes from having gospel blessings in their home. Martha has since served faithfully as our ward Relief Society president, and her husband has served well in several callings within the stake. All this began with the singing of a hymn, a small and simple thing that touched Martha\u2019s heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/small-and-simple-things.p15\" class=\"\">Naaman was a captain of the host of the king of Syria, an honorable man, a mighty man in valor, but he was also a leper (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"125718\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125718)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125718)\">2\u00a0Kings 5:1<\/a><\/span>).
