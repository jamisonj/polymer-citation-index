McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1959, pp. 87-90<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nThis is an historic occasion. The young men of the Aaronic Priesthood in attendance will\nremember this, as we all shall.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have just received a report of the attendance as follows: In the Salt Lake Tabernacle\n7,563; in the Assembly Hall, Barratt Hall, and grounds, 2,285; in the 204 groups reporting in,\n38,516; making a total reported to this moment of 48,364, every one of whom holds the\nPriesthood, which is an authorization to represent our Father in Heaven in whatever position\nor assignment each may be placed, and to do it authoritatively.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a humbling experience, even to have the privilege of being one of those 48,000 men of\nthe Priesthood&mdash;a power in the land and a power never so greatly needed in the history of\nthe world to thwart the plans and schemes of the Adversary as today. God grant that we may\nhave wisdom and knowledge and most of all, divine guidance as we perform our duties\nassigned to us.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are a few details that we should like to mention, and ask for the Bishops' cooperation\nin making more effective the work.\n<\/p><p>\nBut before so doing, I wish to say a word about our servicemen mentioned in the beginning,\ntwenty-one of whom flew in to attend this meeting tonight. I said we should have something\nmore to say. A short time ago we received a letter from a group of service boys, a part of\nwhich I wish to read. They are aboard the United States steamship \"The Pine Island.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"On behalf of the group aboard the U.S.S. Pine Island we would like to take this time to write\nto you with humbleness and sincerity in our hearts . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"We a few of the Lord's servants striving to do the work that we have to do before the\nsecond coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Through your words, guidance, and leadership and\nthe help of our Father in Heaven, and if we live worthy we will be able to do this work\nwhich is here for us to do . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"We are now touring the Pacific Ocean for six months, visiting different lands and people.\nWe learn a lot of the ways of other people. How they live and what they do, their religion.\nWe find out personally how important missionary work really is and how much has to be\ndone yet. Most of these people do not even know that there is a Father in Heaven.\n<\/p><p>\n\"We do our very best, especially over here to set examples of the Church and to live as\nrighteously as we possibly can, to live the commandments of the Lord and the teachings of\nour Church; to give unto all of those desiring to attend our meeting of worship, to let them\npartake of the spirit and blessings we receive at our little group meetings.\n<\/p><p>\n\"We hope that we have not kept you from some important task with the time spent reading\nour letter. We just wanted to write to you to let you know that we are always thinking of you\nand our prayers are with you. We thank you for your time. May God bless and help you in all\nthings you are in need of.\n<\/p><p>\n                         Very Humbly Yours,\n<\/p><p>\n                         (signed) Edwin E. Bigler, Elder<br \/>\n                         L. D. S. Group Leader<br \/>\n                         U. S. S. Pine Island (Pacific Ocean)<br \/>\n                         Elder Danny G. Davis, Secretary\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt is not easy for the boys in the service to live up to the ideals of the Priesthood, especially if\nthey have been tempted before they went into the service. It is not easy for the Elders who\nare in the missionary field, either, especially if they have been tempted before they go into the\nmission field, and I emphasize that exception.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung men and young women who grow up through their teens and keep themselves\nunspotted from the world (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26135\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26135)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26135)\">James 1:27<\/a><\/span>)\ncan resist temptation in the field and in the service, or wherever\nthey are. It is not difficult when they meet temptation.\n<\/p><p>\nBut some of our young men and our young women fail to live up to the standards of the\nPriesthood and they slip and fall. They ask forgiveness and go into the field and are tempted,\nand they are tempted, and they fall again. It is just as necessary for young men and young\nwomen to live up to the principles in their high school training here at home,\nand some of them are narrow in their training and teaching, as it is for them to keep\nthemselves pure and unspotted when they go into the field.\n<\/p><p>\nYou cannot tamper with the Evil One. Resist temptation, resist the Devil and he will flee\nfrom you (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26137\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26137)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26137)\">James 4:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior on the Mount gave us the greatest example in all the world and the 48,000 men\ntonight must ever have him in mind as their ideal. Just after the Savior's baptism, he was led\nup to the mount that is known now as the Mount of Temptation. I do not know whether that\nis where he stood, where he fasted for forty days, or not. But it was on some mount that he\nwent, and after fasting forty days, the Tempter came to him, so we are told, and as the\nTempter always does, he struck at him in what the Tempter thought was his weakest point.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter having fasted, the Tempter thought he would be hungry, and the first temptation, you\nwill remember was, \"If,\" and he said it sarcastically, \"If thou be the Son of God,\" referring to\nthe testimony of the Father when he said, \"This is my beloved Son,\"&mdash;\"If thou be the Son of\nGod, command that these stones be made bread.\" And there is a stone there in that area which\nis not unlike a Jewish wheat-loaf, so that would make the temptation of it appeal all the\nstronger. Christ's answer was: \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that\nproceedeth out of the mouth of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34926\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34926)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34926)\">Matt. 4:3-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe next temptation quoted scripture also. It was an appeal to vanity, an appeal to gain\nascendancy over our fellows: \"If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down . . .\" (from a\npinnacle of the temple) \". . . for it is written . . .\" (and the Devil can cite scripture for his\npurpose) \". . . for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their\nhands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.\" And the\nanswer was, \"Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34929\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34929)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34929)\">Matt. 4:6-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe third temptation was of love, of wealth and power. The tempter took Jesus to a high\nmountain and showed him the things of the world and the power thereof. He was not sarcastic\nin this temptation. He was pleading, for the resistance of the Savior had weakened the\nTempter's powers. He showed him the things of the world. \"All these things will I give thee,\nif thou wilt fall down and worship me.\" Rising in the majesty of his divinity, Jesus said: \"Get\nthee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt\nthou serve.\" And the Tempter slunk away; and we are told that angels came and administered\nto the Lord (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34930\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34930)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34930)\">Matt. 4:8-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is your story, young man. Your weakest point will be the point at which the Devil tries\nto tempt you, will try to win you, and if you have made it weak before you have undertaken\nto serve the Lord, he will add to that weakness. Resist him and you will gain in strength. He\nwill tempt you in another point. Resist him and he becomes weaker and you become stronger,\nuntil you can say, no matter what your surroundings may be, \"Get thee behind me, Satan: for\nit is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31502\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31502)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31502)\">Luke 4:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I mention this because there are too many broken hearts in our Church, because men,\nsome of whom hold the Priesthood and prominent positions, are tempted right wherein they\nare weak, and they forget that they have made covenants with the Lord and step aside from\nthe path of virtue and discretion and will break their wives' hearts because of foolish\nindulgence and because of their yielding.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have one of the most sacred covenants in all the world pertaining to the happiness of the\nhome, and there are men within the sound of my voice who have forgotten how sacred that\ncovenant is. The Brethren of the Twelve, the General Authorities of the Church, the stake\nauthorities, are urging youth everywhere to go to the temple to be married. Don't you go to\nthat temple unless you are ready to accept the covenants that you make.\n<\/p><p>\nMarriage in the temple is one of the most beautiful things in all the world. A couple is led\nthere by love, the divinest attribute of the human soul. A young man looks upon that bride,\nrightfully, who will be the mother of his children, as being as pure as a snowflake, as \nspotless as a sunbeam, as worthy of motherhood as any virgin. And I will tell you\nthat it is a glorious thing for a woman thus to bear the robes and be the pride of a young\nElder's heart, one who trusts her to be the head of his household.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd she trusts him as being as worthy of fatherhood as she of motherhood, and rightfully, too,\nbecause on his shoulders are the robes of the Holy Priesthood, testifying to his young bride\nand to all, that he is as worthy of fatherhood as she of motherhood.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd together they stand in the House of the Lord and testify, covenant before him that each\nwill be true to the covenants they make that day, each keeping himself or herself to the other\nand none else. That is the highest ideal of marriage ever given to man. If those covenants\nwere kept as sacred as sacred covenants should be kept, there would be fewer broken hearts\namong wives and fewer among the husbands, when wives forget. A covenant is a sacred\nthing, and a man who is married in the temple, has no right to be looking at young women,\nwhether they are in the choir or in the Relief Society or on the General Board, or doing any\nof the duties of the Church. You have a covenant to be true to that wife.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren of the Priesthood, keep it true, be true to it.\n<\/p><p>\n\"It's easy enough to be prudent,<br \/>\nWhen nothing tempts you to stray,<br \/>\nWhen without or within no voice of sin<br \/>\nIs luring your soul away.<br \/>\nBut it's only a negative virtue<br \/>\nUntil it is tried by fire,<br \/>\nAnd the life that is worth the honor of earth,<br \/>\nIs the life that resists desire.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBy the cynic, the sad, the fallen<br \/>\nWho had no strength for the strife,<br \/>\nThe world's highway is cumbered today; <br \/>\nThey make up the item of life.<br \/>\nBut the virtue that conquers passion<br \/>\nAnd the sorrow that hides in a smile,<br \/>\nIt is these that are worth the homage of earth<br \/>\nFor we find them but once in a while.\"\n<\/p><p>\n               &mdash;<i>Ella Wheeler Wilcox<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nI plead with the army assembled tonight in this Priesthood meeting, to keep true to the\ncovenants made in the House of God. You have no right to neglect your wives and go and\nseek the company of others who seem to be more attractive to you because you are thrown\nwith them in daily life, in your business affairs, or in Church affairs. This may seem general,\nbut while I speak to you, a wife with her tears and her pleadings comes to me now, asking,\n\"Won't you just say a prayer, won't you offer a prayer to try to bring my husband back?\"\nWell, she may have been to blame for the trouble she said she was partly to blame&mdash;but I\nknow he was to blame, for he is a man who holds the Priesthood and he has no right to break\nhis covenants. We have too many divorces in the Church, and men, I think we are to blame\nfor most of them&mdash;not all, but most of them.\n<\/p><p>\nWith regard to temple work, bishops, be more careful about issuing recommends. First, in the\ndetails: Many persons come to the temples with recommends incompletely prepared, lacking\nessential information, often without indication as to the purpose of the ordinance.\n<\/p><p>\nNext: Missionaries not infrequently come to the Mission Home without temple recommends.\nThat should never be, bishops. Most of them, not having received their endowments, must go\nto the temple, and the program at the Mission Home provides for at least two temple sessions.\n<\/p><p>\nPlease be careful, bishops and stake presidencies, for we ask that you give special attention to\nthe correction of these two matters and save much inconvenience, expense, and time to temple\nand general office staff and the people of the Church as well.\n<\/p><p>\nI see that the time is gone and I must not detain you longer.\n<\/p><p>\nIf you will have your testimonies strengthened, to have it revealed to you now individually\nthat Christ is aiding you in your work, guiding his Church, well the best way to do that is to\nfollow the admonition of my brethren who have spoken to you tonight&mdash;doing your duty, as\nPresident Moyle urged, attending to missionary work, no matter what the cost may be or how\nmany hours you have to spend.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is an old saying that \"man's extremity is God's opportunity.\" You remember the story I\nhave told about James McMurrin, who had to fill an appointment in Falkirk,\nScotland, on Sunday. He was in Burntisland Saturday night and he had a sixpence or a\nshilling in his pocket to pay for his boat ride across the Leith Walk to Edinborough. When\nthat was spent he was alone. The only way he could get to Falkirk was by the one train that\nwas then running between Edinborough and Glasgow.\n<\/p><p>\nHe had an appointment with the Branch in Edinborough from ten to twelve. He filled that\nappointment. When they asked him to go to lunch, he said, \"No, thank you, I have to be in\nFalkirk and I have to take the train that leaves at one o'clock\"&mdash;or thereabouts. One by one the\nSaints bade him goodbye, all but Brother Robertson, who was president of the Branch.\n\"Why,\" he said, \"Well, if ye canna go hame with me, I'll gae ye Scotch convoy,\" and together\nthey walked across Princess Street down to Waverly Station, and crossed under the glass\ncovered canopy, over to the gate from which the train was to leave.\n<\/p><p>\nThe only possible way that Brother McMurrin could have kept his appointment that night was\nto get that train. He had faith that the Lord would open up his way. He did not ask anyone\nfor a shilling, nor for sixpence, nor for twopence, nor for two and six, and as the time\napproached, Brother Robertson said, \"Well, Brother McMurrin, it is time just to get your\nticket, so I will say good-bye.\" \"Goodbye, Brother Robertson,\" and Brother McMurrin was\nleft alone. There was his extremity.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Father,\"&mdash;I will give you his words as he gave them to me \"Father, I have come just as far as\nI can in fulfilling my duty. Open up the way that I may get on this train and go to Falkirk.\"\nHe had in mind, he said, that the gatekeeper would probably let him go through. He did not\nthink of the fact that the gatekeeper was a Scotchman. He would never do that. What\nhappened? Brother Robertson had just returned to the steps leading up to Princess Street and\nthe thought came to him, \"I wonder if Brother McMurrin has enough money.\" Quickly\nretracing his steps, he walked across the station, pulled out of his pocket a two and six piece,\nand said, \"Here, Brother McMurrin, perhaps you need this.\" \"Thank you, Brother Robertson, I\nneed that to get my ticket.\" \"Man's extremity is God's opportunity.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYou brethren in the Church will come against the wall. It seems to be across your path. It\nmay be morally. You cannot overcome it, or you cannot get through it, you cannot see. You\ncan walk from here to that wall, having faith that God will give you a ladder, or show you a\nhidden ladder or an opening, and he will do it, if you will walk just as far as you can in the\nperformance of your duty. No matter what it is or how difficult your duty, do it; walk that\ndistance, and then say in all sincerity and faith, \"Father, help me. Open up the way for me.\nGive me strength to do my duty, give me strength to overcome temptation.\"\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us as men representing him through the Priesthood, the Holy Priesthood, to do our\nduty and do it well, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
