Evans, it was my pleasure to attend the dedication of the temple in\nLondon, England, and I appreciated the privilege.\n<\/p><p>\nTwo of the most frequent questions asked of us as we travel are, \"What is your creed?\" and\n\"What distinguishes your Church from others?\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe do not have a written creed in the usual sense of the word. However, we do have a\nconcise and authoritative statement of the beliefs of the Latter-day Saints given by the Prophet\nJoseph Smith, in the early days of the Church, known as the Articles of Faith. In that\nstatement we declare our faith in God the Father, in Jesus Christ his Son, and in the Holy\nGhost (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6723\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6723)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6723)\">A of F 1:1<\/a><\/span>);\nknown generally as the Holy Trinity. We declare our conviction that men will be held\naccountable for their own sins and will not be answerable for the sins of others,\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6724\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6724)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6724)\">A of F 1:2<\/a><\/span>), that there are\ncertain principles and ordinances that must be believed and observed by those who would fain\nsalvation (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6726\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6726)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6726)\">A of F 1:4<\/a><\/span>),\nand that those principles and ordinances must be taught and administered by men\nwho have authority (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6728\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6728)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6728)\">A of F 1:5<\/a><\/span>)\nin the apostolic Church as organized in the Meridian of Time\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6729\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6729)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6729)\">A of F 1:6<\/a><\/span>), of which\nJesus Christ was, and is, the chief cornerstone\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21698\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21698)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21698)\">Eph. 2:20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn this declaration we affirm our faith in the atonement of Christ and its universal\napplicability (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6725\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6725)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6725)\">A of F 1:3<\/a><\/span>).\nWe believe that he will come again, that there will be a thousand years of\nuniversal peace (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6736\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6736)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6736)\">A of F 1:10<\/a><\/span>).\nWe make the statement that we believe in sacred scriptures, ancient and\nmodern (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6732\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6732)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6732)\">A of F 1:8<\/a><\/span>);\nthat we believe that men are entitled to freedom of religious belief\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6737\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6737)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6737)\">A of F 1:11<\/a><\/span>).\nWe honor and\nsustain the laws of the land (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6738\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6738)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6738)\">A of F 1:12<\/a><\/span>).\nWe commit ourselves to Christ's standard of moral conduct\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6739\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6739)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6739)\">A of F 1:13<\/a><\/span>), and\nservice based on love of God and of fellow men\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34878\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34878)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34878)\">Matt. 22:36-39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs many sermons have been preached and much has been written on each of these articles, I\nshall not elucidate, but I should like to refer for a moment to the Ninth Article of Faith.\n<\/p><p>\n\"We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He\nwill yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6734\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6734)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6734)\">A of F 1:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis simple and forthright statement of faith in revelation has elicited the criticism of some of\nour friends, because it includes past, current, and future revelation.  Many other churches\nprofess belief in the revelations recorded in the Bible, but they do not believe that God still\nreveals his will through chosen prophets on the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nWe declare that the line of communication between heaven and earth is open, and operating,\nas anciently. We believe that revelation is continuous and expedient\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6730\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6730)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6730)\">A of F 1:7<\/a><\/span>), and is suited to the times\nin which it is given.  When we make that statement, it follows that we believe in scriptures\nother than the Holy Bible, because divine revelation is the word of God, and his word is\nscripture. We unequivocally declare our faith in the Bible as the word of God, and we specify\nthe King James version thereof.\n<\/p><p>\nOur acceptance of other revelation does not diminish our faith in the Old and New\nTestaments.  On the contrary, our belief in the Bible is strengthened and our understanding of\nit clarified by these new corroborative revelations.\n<\/p><p>\nAmong the volumes of scripture in which we believe, the one most frequently referred to by\nfriends and critics is the Book of Mormon. It has had the largest circulation and has elicited\nmore comment during the past century, favorable and otherwise, than any other modern book.\n<\/p><p>\nThis book is an inspired text, having been written by various prophets who lived in America\nat the times of which they write. It is a sacred record of the ancient inhabitants of America,\ncovering in the main that portion of their history from about 600 B.C. to 400 A.D.\n<\/p><p>\nIts message was inscribed on metallic plates by various authors.  These\nwritings were abridged by the Prophet Mormon, one of the last survivors of a dwindling race. \nIt is therefore known as the Book of Mormon.  He entrusted the plates to his son, Moroni,\nwho was the last of the Nephite historians. Moroni deposited the plates in a stone box on a\nhillside and some fourteen hundred years later he, at that time a resurrected being, revealed\ntheir hiding place to Joseph Smith, the prophet, who translated what is said to be reformed\nEgyptian characters into English by the gift and power of God.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is doubtless this element of the miraculous which disturbs many who hear of this record\nand causes some to shrug it off without further interest. It seems strange to us that believers\nin the Judeo-Christian Bible should be skeptical of the miraculous.\n<\/p><p>\nMiracles form an important part of the Old and the New Testaments. The story of the earth\nlife of Jesus of Nazareth continues to grip the hearts and intrigue the minds of men, largely\nbecause of the miracle of his birth, the almost daily miracles he performed during his\nministry, and the transcendent miracle of his resurrection and ascension. Moreover, he left his\napostles and disciples with a promise of a miraculous reappearance in the last days. \nParaphrasing the Apostle Paul we ask, \"Why should it be thought a thing incredible that God\nshould reveal his will to his servants, the prophets, as he promised to do\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7831\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7831)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7831)\">Acts 26:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOne remarkable fact about this book is its continued popularity and appeal. One hundred\nthirty years after the first edition was published, it is still a best seller, over thirty-five\nthousand copies being printed in English each year, and other thousands distributed in the\ntwenty-seven different languages into which it has been translated.  Nearly three million\ncopies of this book have been distributed in almost all countries of the world in the last\ncentury.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, we do believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6733\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6733)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6733)\">A of F 1:8<\/a><\/span>), and we believe in the\nmiraculous that was involved in its preservation and production. There have been many who\nhave sought to discredit it, many things have been written against it, but in more recent times\nsome of our friends who have made a careful study of the book have made statements which\nare significant I shall refer to one or two taken from a little book called,\n<i>The Book of Mormon Message and Evidences<\/i> by Dr. Franklin S. Harris, Jr. Charles H. Hull, professor of\nAmerican history in Cornell University wrote: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I am perfectly willing to say to anyone that I suppose the Book of Mormon to be one of the\nmost famous and widely discussed books ever published in America.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSays a Rochester newspaper, \"The book itself remains on which was founded the greatest\nreligion of the continent and the century.  It was not the book itself, but the wonderful\ninfluence it had on America that counted.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd a former Secretary of Agriculture, who had read the book carefully said, \"Of all the\nAmerican books of the nineteenth century, it seems probable that the Book of Mormon was\nthe most powerful.  It reached perhaps only one percent of the United States, but it affected\nthis one percent so powerfully and lastingly that all the people of the United States have been\naffected, especially by its contribution, in opening one of our great frontiers.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow, our declaration regarding the Book of Mormon is a solemn one. If it is false, it is\nalmost blasphemous.  If it is true, then all who believe it are under a solemn obligation to its\nauthor to proclaim its truth.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the prophets of that book emphasized this fact in the following words, and I read from\nSecond Nephi: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the\nearth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it\nbe through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life\naccording to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to\npass the resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3621\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3621)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3621)\">2 Ne. 2:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd further in his same book, after reciting the miraculous events in the history of the\nIsraelites, he said,\n<\/p><p>\n\"I say unto you, that as these things are true, and as the Lord God liveth,\nthere is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have\nspoken, whereby man can be saved\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3628\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3628)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3628)\">2 Ne. 25:20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is the message of the Book of Mormon that has caused people from almost all nations of\nthe earth to accept it as the word of God.  Its inspiring theme and divine message, from the\ntitle page to the last chapter, constitutes the testimony or witness of a whole nation of people\nthat Jesus is the Christ (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43128\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43128)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43128)\">BM Title Page<\/a><\/span>),\nthe Son of God, the Creator of the world, the Redeemer of mankind.\nIt bears witness to the efficacy of the atonement, of its universal application and its value to\nall individuals who will accept his word and keep his commandments.\n<\/p><p>\nWe urge our friends to examine the book itself, to check its claims, listen to its message and\nto feel of its spirit. Yes, we believe in continued revelation, ancient, continuous, current, and\nfuture.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd personally, I wish to bear my testimony with those that have already been borne that the\nChurch today, the kingdom of God, is being led by revelation.  God is not the author of\nconfusion (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"302\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 302)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(302)\">1 Cor. 14:33<\/a><\/span>).\nHe does not work in dark places. He makes it known to the world when he\nappoints a prophet, and I testify that I know as I know I live, that this Church today is guided\nby prophecy and by revelation, and that these men whom we honor are prophets of God.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that he may help us to live as though we believed it, to be true to ourselves, to them\nand to God, by carrying out the instructions they give, and living the gospel of Jesus Christ, I\npray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
