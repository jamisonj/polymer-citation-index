We have been greatly stirred by our famous and beloved Tabernacle Choir as they, too, have used their rich talents to bless us with heavenly symphonies. And we are deeply grateful to the other groups of singers: they have enriched our services and made them pleasing to us and to the Lord. And to all others who have contributed we are deeply grateful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/a-program-for-man.p5\" class=\"\">We have made some changes in the General Authorities, and we hope all of our people are sympathetic and approve in their hearts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/a-program-for-man.p6\" class=\"\">The sermons from the Brethren have developed almost every theme and subject, and they have been rich and full of meat. We have been greatly pleased with all of their contributions. May we mention a few:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/a-program-for-man.p7\" class=\"\">President Tanner has relived for us the area conferences of Europe. We have carried similar ones to the Orient and South America and Mexico and the South Seas.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/a-program-for-man.p8\" class=\"\">President Romney has given us the word of the Lord on honesty and integrity and companion themes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/a-program-for-man.p9\" class=\"\">In between the choir\u2019s presentations, we have heard excerpts from the sermons of our beloved brother, the apostle Paul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/a-program-for-man.p10\" class=\"\">We were given a picture of the temptations of Jesus, and we have seen, with the eyes of an apostle, the families that are forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/a-program-for-man.p11\" class=\"\">We have partly relived the Bicentennial through the eyes of one of the Brethren.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/a-program-for-man.p12\" class=\"\">Delightful experiences from life have been used by the Brethren to point the way and direct our footsteps, and great lessons have been taught by parable, quotation, and exhortation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/a-program-for-man.p13\" class=\"\">The standards of the Church have been emphasized over and over, with warm appeals from the Brethren for us to live God\u2019s commandments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/a-program-for-man.p14\" class=\"\">We have been taught as fathers and mothers and bishops how to prepare missionaries to attain excellence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/a-program-for-man.p15\" class=\"\">One of our favorite songs has these words from the Master: \u201cHe marked the path and led the way, And every point defines To life and light and endless day Where God\u2019s full presence shines.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 68.)

He was not a member of the Church and evidently had never known the pull and the pressure one feels when one has a positive assurance that the Lord is <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> playing games, but rather has a serious program for man and for his glory. The Lord knows what He is doing, and all His moves are appropriate and right.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/a-program-for-man.p35\" class=\"\">And I was surprised also that any man would wonder and question the work of the Lord.
