He struggled with alcohol and in his darkest moods could become harsh and accusing. He normally didn\u2019t object to Mom serving in the ward. She worked in Primary for 38 years, and during much of that time she served in Young Women. She carried a heavy load. Her marriage was difficult, and I now know that she was discouraged at times, but I didn\u2019t know it then.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/how-has-relief-society-blessed-your-life.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cI didn\u2019t realize until later that the sisters in our ward were her strength. She didn\u2019t work in the Relief Society leadership, but she always attended the meetings, and she loved her friends there. I never thought of them as the ladies of Relief Society; they were simply Mom\u2019s sisters. They cared about her and loved her. She had all brothers and all sons. She found the sisters she wanted and needed in our ward. I know she shared her feelings with them\u2014feelings she couldn\u2019t express anywhere else. None of that seemed \u2018Relief Society\u2019 to me then, but I understand now that it was.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-24911_000_014\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Personal correspondence.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/how-has-relief-society-blessed-your-life.p6\" class=\"\">This son\u2019s memory of Relief Society touched my heart.

Since the earliest days of the Church, our mothers and daughters have been taught of their obligations to those in distress. They have been schooled in the finer points of homemaking, encouraged in their spiritual development, and guided in the realization of their full potential as women.
