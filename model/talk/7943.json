In the Book of Mormon, the 17th chapter of Alma, we read the account of Alma\u2019s joy as he once more saw the sons of Mosiah and noted their steadfastness in the cause of truth. The record tells us, \u201cThey had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/come-all-ye-sons-of-god.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cBut this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-10705_000_027\">4<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124131\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124131)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124131)\">Alma 17:2\u20133<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/come-all-ye-sons-of-god.p20\" class=\"\">Brethren, <span class=\"strong\">search the scriptures with diligence.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/come-all-ye-sons-of-god.p21\" class=\"\">Second in our formula: <span class=\"strong\">plan your life with purpose.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/come-all-ye-sons-of-god.p22\" class=\"\">Perhaps no generation of youth has faced such far-reaching decisions as the youth of today.

In addition to spiritual preparation, a wise parent will provide the means whereby a young son might commence his personal missionary fund.

Eventually there comes that glorious day when the bishop and stake president invite the young man in for a visit.

He was short in stature but tall in testimony. Not long after his arrival, together with his companion, he called at the home of Elmer Pollard in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. Feeling sorry for the young men who, during a blinding blizzard, were going house to house, Mr.\u00a0Pollard invited the missionaries into his home. They presented to him their message. He did not catch the spirit. In due time he asked that they leave and not return. His last words to the elders as they departed his front porch were spoken in derision: \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me you actually believe Joseph Smith was a prophet of God!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/come-all-ye-sons-of-god.p32\" class=\"\">The door was shut.

Let\u2019s return and bear our testimonies to him.\u201d At first the more experienced missionary hesitated but finally agreed to accompany his companion. Fear struck their hearts as they approached the door from which they had just been ejected. They knocked, confronted Mr.\u00a0Pollard, spent an agonizing moment, and then with power borne of the Spirit, our inexperienced missionary spoke: \u201cMr.\u00a0Pollard, you said we didn\u2019t really believe Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I testify to you that Joseph <span class=\"emphasis\">was<\/span> a prophet. He <span class=\"emphasis\">did<\/span> translate the Book of Mormon. He saw God the Father and Jesus the Son.

Resounding in my ears I heard the words \u2018Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I know it. I know it. I know it.\u2019 The next day I telephoned the missionaries and asked them to return.
