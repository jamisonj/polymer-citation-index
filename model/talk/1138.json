I\nam very thankful for this glorious song [\"I Know that My Redeemer Lives\" sung by Dennis\nClancy, a Scotsman] we have just heard. I am sure it has made each one of us thrill with the\ntestimony that we have of the divinity of the Savior and of our great love for him. I am sure\ntoo that you have been greatly delighted and benefited by these illuminating and stimulating\naddresses that have been given by Brother [Franklin D.] Richards and Brother [Gordon B.]\nHinckley on our missionary program.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to talk with you for a few moments about another phase of this missionary\nprogram. I have in mind the responsibility we have of fellowshipping our new members. I\nhave often thought that instruction in the gospel without fellowship in the Church is as\nincomplete as baptism without confirmation. It is utter folly for us to avoid or ignore the\nresponsibility we have of properly fellowshipping those who are brought into the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been impressed with one other thing, too, about our missionary program, and that is\nthat conversion cannot he limited only to instruction in the gospel doctrines. Conversion must\ninclude an acceptance of us as a people and an acceptance of our way of life and of our mode\nof worship. How can a person be fully converted to us and our work just by studying the\nBible or any of the scriptures? The people must come into our meetings; they must become a\npart of us; they must see what we are doing. We must assimilate them. We must make them a\npart of us, and when we do that, then they really become converted and help to build the\nkingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nYou remember how Paul wrote to the Ephesians: \"Now therefore ye are no\nmore strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of\nGod\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21721\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21721)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21721)\">Eph. 2:19<\/a><\/span>).\nThey, very obviously, had a fellowship program in that day. It was very\nnecessary that the new converts Paul and his associates made should be fellowshipped with\nthe rest of the Saints, and it was all-important that the rest of the Saints be willing to\nfellowship them and take them into their arms and make them a part of them.\n<\/p><p>\nUnfortunately, at times we have missed out on that in our day. I have sometimes thought as I\nhave heard some of the stories I have listened to that we almost had established an Iron\nCurtain in some areas. There can be no Iron Curtains in this Church. When the people are\nbrought into the Church, we must receive them, and we must do more than merely shake\nhands with them and say, \"How do you do.\" We must make them a part of our organizations.\nThey must fit into our program. We must assign them activities. They must learn early to help\nbuild the kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, as I see this fellowship program with respect to the missions, it begins with the\nmissionaries. The missionaries themselves, whether stake or full-time, must begin the\nfellowship program by bringing their new investigators into our Church meetings as early in\nthe teaching process as is possible so that the new investigators may be introduced to the\nbishopric, may be introduced to others in the ward, may see our way of conducting our\nworship, may see the class of people we have in our membership, may get the feel and the\nspirit of the Latter-day Saints. That is a part of the conversion process, and as the missionaries\ndo that, they will find that it will be easier to teach them.\n<\/p><p>\nThen also, as early as possible in the teaching process, it is all-important that the coordinator\ncouples whom you have been asked to appoint be introduced to these investigators so that\nthey may become \"friends in court,\" so to speak, and then when the time for baptism arrives,\nthat this coordinator couple be present at the baptism and be there to help welcome them into\nthe Church and to help them in the process of further assimilation.\n<\/p><p>\nThe First Presidency have told us that, whenever it is feasible, our new converts should be\nconfirmed in the Fast meeting. If it is not feasible then the new convert being baptized should\nbe confirmed, as we say, at the water's edge. But where it is possible to have it arranged for\nthe Fast meeting, the confirmation act may become a beautiful act of assimilation.\n<\/p><p>\nI have thought often that it would be wonderful if, when the time of confirmation arrived, and\nit was in the Fast meeting, the bishop would announce to the congregation, \"Brothers and\nsisters, we have the missionaries with us here this afternoon. Yesterday, they baptized the\nfamily of Brother and Sister John Jones. We are now ready to welcome them into the Church\nby confirming them members of the Church. We would like to invite the missionaries to come\nforward now and join us in the circle.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI have thought what a wonderful thing it would be if the three members of the bishopric and\nthe missionaries who were there would stand together in the circle and then call Brother John\nJones to take the chair. The bishopric and the elders jointly would lay their hands upon his\nhead while one of the missionaries actually was voice in the confirmation.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I have thought what a wonderful thing it would be after that if the bishop would reach\nout his hand and welcome Brother Jones and extend him the hand of fellowship. Then the\nother members of the family would be confirmed and welcomed in the same way.\n<\/p><p>\nI think it would be wonderful after the confirmation of a family of that kind for the\nmissionaries to present to the bishop then and there, the certificate of baptism and\nconfirmation for each and for the bishop to stand up in the Fast meeting, and say, \"We have\nall now witnessed the confirmation of the family of Brother and Sister John Jones. We have\ntheir certificates of baptism and confirmation. All who are willing to receive them now as\nmembers of our ward and full-fledged members of our Church, will you signify?\"\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to see them actually vote to bring them in just as if they were new members\nmoving in from another ward or another stake. It is a part of the assimilation\nprocess. It makes these people feel more a part of things.\n<\/p><p>\nThen I would like to see the brother in charge of the Senior Aaronic Priesthood work in the\nward approach this newly baptized and confirmed brother at the close of the Fast meeting and\nsay, \"Brother Jones, I am Brother Smith, and I have charge of the senior work for the Aaronic\nPriesthood in this ward. Now that you are a member of the Church you become automatically\neligible to join the work for the senior brethren in the Aaronic Priesthood. Our meeting will\nbe held next Sunday morning at 9:30. I would like to come for you next Sunday about 9:15\nand bring you to this first meeting and introduce you there to the rest of the members so that\nyou can begin to feel a part of our group.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI believe that as soon as feasible, that man should be ordained a deacon in the Aaronic\nPriesthood so that he will have the sense of belonging, so that he will feel a part of the\npriesthood. If he is worthy to be baptized, surely he should be worthy to be ordained to the\npriesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nAll of this is part of the assimilation process. I believe, if I may go back a few steps, that it\nwould be a wonderful thing for the Relief Society people to be brought into the assimilation\nprogram even before baptism. Is there any reason why Sister Jones, the investigator, could not\nbe invited to come to Relief Society and be escorted there by one of the class leaders, or by\none of the officers in the Relief Society? And then as she is baptized, she is already in the\nhabit of coming to Relief Society. She will just continue on. It eases the process of transition.\nShe is already in the Relief Society. She will now continue to be in the Relief Society.\n<\/p><p>\nThe same thing is true with the Sunday School and with the Sacrament meeting. The\nmissionaries and the coordinating couple will introduce these people to the Sunday School and\nto the Sacrament meeting even before baptism. They will begin to get them into the habit of\ncoming. The transition is made easy because they continue doing the things they have already\nbeen doing. And likewise with the Primary and the MIA. They are some of the finest\nmissionary organizations we have in the whole Church and have brought thousands of people\ninto the Church. Their contacts may well begin before baptism.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we all work together, not only on the conversion process but also on the fellowship process,\nwe will hold on to our converts. But would it not be a terrible tragedy if we were to bring\nthousands into the Church and then lose a number of them because we failed to do our work\nin fellowshipping these new people as they come in?\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren of the priesthood, I appeal to you. Fellowship these new people. Let them feel a part\nof us. Let them fit into our organizations. As they grow in faith, they will want to grow in\nworks. We must all remember that faith without works is dead. It is so true of our\nassimilation or fellowship program. These people may be full of faith as they come into the\nChurch, but if they are left without works or activity will their faith not die?\n<\/p><p>\nI talked with one couple one time who complained because they had been told by the bishop\nthat they could not be assigned to any work for six months after baptism, and I thought what\na tragedy. Faith without works is dead and faith without activity can die in new converts.\nTherefore we need to give them work. We need to give them activity.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, if I may take just a moment or two more, I would like to talk about another phase of\nthis fellowship program. The fellowship program has been marvelously successful with\nrespect to new converts through the missionary program. Brethren, it can be equally\nsuccessful with respect to the reactivation program. As people are being reactivated into the\nChurch, again we must learn to fellowship them, just as we will fellowship new converts. The\nreactivated are just as much in need of feeling a part of things as the new convert, and there\nare many reactivated people who will feel just as strange in the Church surroundings as will a\nnew convert. Some of them may feel more strange because they have a past record that would\nmake them feel ill at ease as they come into the meetings.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd as they are reactivated, are they going to be left cold, off to themselves?\nIf we are going to erect an Iron Curtain against a man just because he happens to smell of\ncigarettes, are we going to convert him to the gospel? We must fellowship the reactivated\nones just as much as we need to fellowship the newly converted ones.\n<\/p><p>\nSo I invite your attention, brethren to a twofold fellowship program in the Church: first, a\nsincere effort to fellowship all these new converts who are coming in; and second, a sincere\neffort to fellowship the reactivated ones as we bring them in. Fellowship means salvation.\nWithout it we may lose these reactivated ones, and we may lose our new converts.\n<\/p><p>\nSo brethren, let us organize into a great fellowship movement. Let us hold out the hand of\nfellowship to every one of these reactivated ones, and the new converts. Let us fellowship\nthem through the organizations and make them a part of us because the Lord so directs. They\nare to be \". . . fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21722\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21722)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21722)\">Eph. 2:19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat we may accomplish this is my humble and earnest desire in the name of the Lord Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
