Nathan had served in the Russian-speaking Baltic Mission. He loved the people and knew it was a privilege to serve the Lord. Three months after I officiated at his eternal marriage to his sweetheart, Jennifer, this accident took his life. Nathan\u2019s being taken so suddenly from our mortal presence has turned each of our hearts and minds to the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. While it is impossible for me to put into words the full meaning of the Atonement of Christ, I pray that I can explain what His Atonement means to me and our family and what it might also mean to you and yours.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/the-atonement-and-the-value-of-one-soul.p6\" class=\"\">The Savior\u2019s precious birth, life, Atonement in the Garden of Gethsemane, suffering on the cross, burial in Joseph\u2019s tomb, and glorious Resurrection all became a renewed reality for us. The Savior\u2019s Resurrection assures all of us that someday we, too, will follow Him and experience our own resurrection. What peace, what comfort this great gift is which comes through the loving grace of Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. Because of Him we know we can be with Nathan again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/the-atonement-and-the-value-of-one-soul.p7\" class=\"\">There is no greater expression of love than the heroic Atonement performed by the Son of God. Were it not for the plan of our Heavenly Father, established before the world began, in a very real sense, all mankind\u2014past, present, and future\u2014would have been left without the hope of eternal progression. As a result of Adam\u2019s transgression, mortals were separated from God (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43322\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43322)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43322)\">Rom. 6:23<\/a><\/span>) and would be forever unless a way was found to break the bands of death. This would not be easy, for it required the vicarious sacrifice of one who was sinless and who could therefore take upon Himself the sins of all mankind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/the-atonement-and-the-value-of-one-soul.p8\" class=\"\">Thankfully, Jesus Christ courageously fulfilled this sacrifice in ancient Jerusalem. There in the quiet isolation of the Garden of Gethsemane, He knelt among the gnarled olive trees, and in some incredible way that none of us can fully comprehend, the Savior took upon Himself the sins of the world. Even though His life was pure and free of sin, He paid the ultimate penalty for sin\u2014yours, mine, and everyone who has ever lived. His mental, emotional, and spiritual anguish were so great they caused Him to bleed from every pore (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43299\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43299)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43299)\">Luke 22:44<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43539\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43539)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43539)\">D&amp;C 19:18<\/a><\/span>). And yet Jesus suffered willingly so that we might all have the opportunity to be washed clean\u2014through having faith in Him, repenting of our sins, being baptized by proper priesthood authority, receiving the purifying gift of the Holy Ghost by confirmation, and accepting all other essential ordinances. Without the Atonement of the Lord, none of these blessings would be available to us, and we could not become worthy and prepared to return to dwell in the presence of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/the-atonement-and-the-value-of-one-soul.p9\" class=\"\">The Savior later endured the agony of inquisition, cruel beatings, and death by crucifixion on the cross at Calvary. Recently, there has been a great deal of commentary about this, none of which has made clear the singular point that no one had the power to take the Savior\u2019s life from Him. He gave it as a ransom for us all. As the Son of God, He had the power to alter the situation. Yet the scriptures clearly state that He yielded Himself to scourging, humiliation, suffering, and finally crucifixion because of His great love towards the children of men (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43386\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43386)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43386)\">1 Ne. 19:9\u201310<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/the-atonement-and-the-value-of-one-soul.p10\" class=\"\">The Atonement of Jesus Christ was an indispensable part of our Heavenly Father\u2019s plan for His Son\u2019s earthly mission and for our salvation. How grateful we should be that our Heavenly Father did not intercede but rather withheld His fatherly instinct to rescue His Beloved Son. Because of His eternal love for you and for me, He allowed Jesus to complete His foreordained mission to become our Redeemer. The gift of resurrection and immortality is given freely through the loving grace of Jesus Christ to all people of all ages, regardless of their good or evil acts. And to those who choose to love the Lord and who show their love and faith in Him by keeping His commandments and qualifying for the full blessings of the Atonement, He offers the additional promise of exaltation and eternal life, which is the blessing of living in the presence of God and His Beloved Son forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/the-atonement-and-the-value-of-one-soul.p11\" class=\"\">We often sing a hymn that expresses what I feel when I consider the Savior\u2019s benevolent, atoning sacrifice:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Confused at the grace that so fully he proffers me.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I tremble to know that for me he was crucified,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">That for me, a sinner, he suffered, he bled and died.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/the-atonement-and-the-value-of-one-soul.p16\" class=\"\">(\u201cI Stand All Amazed,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns, <\/span>no. 193)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/the-atonement-and-the-value-of-one-soul.p17\" class=\"\">Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind, is not dead.

Our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. This experience began the restoration of powerful doctrinal truths that had been lost for centuries. Among those truths that had been dimmed by the darkness of apostasy was the stirring reality that we are all the spirit sons and daughters of a loving God who is our Father. We are part of His family. He is not a father in some allegorical or poetic sense. He is literally the Father of our spirits. He cares for each one of us. Though this world has a way of diminishing and demeaning men and women, the reality is we are all of royal, divine lineage. In that unprecedented appearance of the Father and the Son in the Sacred Grove, the very first word spoken by the Father of us all was the personal name of Joseph. Such is our Father\u2019s personal relationship with each of us. He knows our names and yearns for us to become worthy to return to live with Him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/the-atonement-and-the-value-of-one-soul.p19\" class=\"\">Through the Prophet Joseph Smith came the Restoration of the gospel.

I believe our Heavenly Father\u2019s everlasting purpose for His children is generally achieved by the small and simple things we do for one another. At the heart of the English word <span class=\"emphasis\">atonement<\/span> is the word <span class=\"emphasis\">one.<\/span> If all mankind understood this, there would never be anyone with whom we would not be concerned, regardless of age, race, gender, religion, or social or economic standing.

We do not want God to weep because we did not do all we could to share with His children the revealed truths of the gospel. I pray that every one of our youth will seek to know the blessings of the Atonement and that they will strive to be worthy to serve the Lord in the mission field. Surely many more senior couples and others whose health will permit would eagerly desire to serve the Lord as missionaries if they would ponder over the meaning of the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ. It was Jesus who said, \u201cIf \u2026 you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be <span class=\"emphasis\">one<\/span> soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43536\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43536)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43536)\">D&amp;C 18:15<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added).
