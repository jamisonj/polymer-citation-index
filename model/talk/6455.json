Indeed, it is a rare jewel to be treasured and a rare jewel to be shared. There are 60,000 full-time missionaries engaged in the sharing process. Their efforts, coupled with those of stake missionaries and members, yielded some 300,000 new converts last year.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p8\" class=\"\">But this is not enough.

Increased member involvement is the only way to increase our current conversion rate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p17\" class=\"\">We have heard all of this many times. Why don\u2019t we do better in providing referrals? It is not laziness, because Latter-day Saints are not lazy people. I believe that the fear of rejection or the fear of hurting a friendship are the more common restraints to sharing the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p18\" class=\"\">But are these fears valid? When you extend to a friend an invitation to meet with the missionaries, you are offering to share something that is most valuable and cherished. Is that offensive? Sister Oaks and I have not found this to be the case. In fact, we have found that when we offer to share the gospel, friendships are strengthened, even though the friends may not embrace the gospel message.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p19\" class=\"\">Consider that you are invited to a friend\u2019s house for breakfast. On the table you see a large pitcher of freshly squeezed orange juice from which your host fills his glass. But he offers you none. Finally, you ask, \u201cCould I have a glass of orange juice?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p20\" class=\"\">He replies, \u201cOh, I am sorry. I was afraid you might not like orange juice, and I didn\u2019t want to offend you by offering you something you didn\u2019t desire.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p21\" class=\"\">Now, that sounds absurd, but it is not too different from the way we hesitate to offer up something far sweeter than orange juice. I have often worried how I would answer some friend about my hesitancy when I meet him beyond the veil.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p22\" class=\"\">A story related by Elder Christoffel Golden, of South Africa, refreshed my concerns. He was recently in Lusaka, Zambia, attending a meeting of new converts. A well-spoken, well-dressed stranger with a Book of Mormon in hand walked in. He stated he had driven past the chapel many times and had wondered what church met there and what they taught for doctrine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p23\" class=\"\">At the conclusion of the meeting, this gentleman stood up, raised his copy of the Book of Mormon high in the air, and asked, \u201cWhy have you kept this book hidden from the people of Lusaka? Why have you kept it a secret?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p24\" class=\"\">As I heard this story, I flinched that one day some friend might ask me, \u201cWhy have you kept this Book of Mormon, with its message of truth and salvation, a secret?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p25\" class=\"\">My reply, \u201cI was afraid I would damage our friendship,\u201d will not be very satisfying to either me or my friend.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p26\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, I pray that we may put our fears and our hesitancy behind us and no more keep secret the great treasure that is ours.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p27\" class=\"\">One last thought regarding missionary work: During my short time in southeast Africa, I have been overwhelmed by the remarkable service rendered by senior couple missionaries. Daily, they make significant contributions to the strengthening of the members and to rolling that stone, cut without hands, forward on its eternal course. What a mighty team for righteousness they make when joined with the younger missionaries and the local members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p28\" class=\"\">Whether in leadership, proselyting, temple, humanitarian, welfare, or Church education service, the contribution of these experienced, testimony-bearing souls is beyond measure. And without exception I see them deriving great personal satisfaction from their service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p29\" class=\"\">If you are retired, or retirement eligible, and wondering what useful things you might do with the rest of your life, contact your bishop. Let him share with you his exciting list of missionary opportunities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p30\" class=\"\">Today, take your spouse by the hand and see if you don\u2019t agree that the best thing for all concerned, including your grandchildren, would be for you to accept an assignment to serve the Lord as missionaries. This is His work, and He beckons us to join Him in it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sharing-the-gospel.p31\" class=\"\">I testify that God, our Eternal Father, and His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, live. Christ came to earth and fulfilled His calling as the Redeemer of all mankind. I testify that His gospel has been restored in its fulness and that there is a living prophet, Gordon B.
