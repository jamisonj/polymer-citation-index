To provide a safe place for love, there must be this kind of commitment.

How inspiring it is, for example, to hear Elder David B. Haight tell of times he has cooked the dinner so that his wife could attend her Spanish class. Growth can come for both partners when husband and wife develop the kind of love that allows the other to turn potential into perfection and talent into testimony. A strong marriage takes strong individuals equally committed to calling forth the best in themselves as well as in their eternal partner. A husband must give his support if a wife is to adequately use the gifts God has given her. A wife must give her support if her husband is to lead the family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A marriage made safe by both love and consecration can allow for a variety of opinions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For a man and wife to become one there are many differences, large and small, that must be accommodated or resolved. In a marriage relationship that is secure, differences need not lead to discord. They can be openly considered until a satisfactory solution is reached because the premises are agreed upon: both the husband and wife are committed to love one another, to build the kingdom of God, and to establish an eternal family unit. All considerations are made in light of these three basic commitments\u2014these are the \u201cgivens.\u201d When they are held inviolate, the marriage remains intact, even though the process of resolution may involve considerable discussion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>While visiting in the home of her younger sister, a woman observed one such discussion. A difference of opinion was resolved in a kindly, open exchange between the husband and wife. The woman later confided that such a discussion could not have occurred in her home \u201cbecause,\u201d she said, \u201cwe cannot afford to have differences aired, for even a small problem challenges our relationship.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some marriage relationships are little more than an amicable truce; but if such couples were to lay the foundation stones of commitment and trust, of consecration and love, they could build a safe place where individuals can be heard, and where love can grow and can encompass and integrate differing points of view.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Each child has the love and interest of both mother and father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>When children are treated fairly, there is no cause for jealousy because there is no partiality. Reading the Book of Mormon, we find that whenever the people were truly committed to the Lord and had the Holy Ghost in their midst, the conditions described were similar. We read of such an example in 4 Nephi when \u201cevery man did deal justly one with another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cAnd they had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, \u2026 but they were all \u2026 partakers of the heavenly gift\u201d of love.

A home is strengthened by work when workers receive respect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p27\" class=\"\">Often a woman who is feeling discouraged about her lot lacks nothing more than appreciation from those she serves. It is easy for a family to grow accustomed to the pleasant circumstances of a home and fail to remember the management necessary or the energy and skills required to keep a house running smoothly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p28\" class=\"\">It may be that there is need to appreciate the mother who is giving all she can to the upkeep of a home but is still not able to maintain order. Perhaps in addition to a recognition of what she does accomplish, an assessment of what might be required to achieve the desired results would bring about a realization that other members of the family must help\u2014either with specific duties or with a change in their living habits to make the housework easier.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p29\" class=\"\">An orderly home is conducive to happiness. But the achievement and maintenance of order, while the primary responsibility of the mother, should be the concern of the whole family. When a mother is required to work outside the home, the cooperation of the family, of the whole household, is often critical.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p30\" class=\"\">It is sometimes the case that a husband or father fails to be honored for the work he does. Because he is gone from the home and the family does not see him at his work, they may not acknowledge the full significance of his contribution. A family home evening could be devoted to learning about a father\u2019s employment, giving him opportunity to explain all that he does. It may provide not only knowledge but also a clearer understanding of his efforts. The wages earned by a man are necessary, but his family\u2019s pride in his work is often more valued by him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p31\" class=\"\">Young family members can also learn to have regard for work through being given significant tasks for which they must assume responsibility. The home is a safe place for children to learn how to work because mistakes can be corrected before they become serious, and they can be forgiven. It is the fortunate child whose parent teaches him the value of doing a job well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p32\" class=\"\">While we may not know what vocation our children will choose when they are grown, we can begin to prepare them for success. Under the direction of loving parents, an apprenticeship can be served by them in learning responsibility for tools and equipment, following instructions, and working thoughtfully and cheerfully, and keeping at the assignment until it is successfully completed. These fulfill the prerequisites for most vocational training programs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p33\" class=\"\">Work becomes service when it is given gladly, often unsolicited, and for the purpose of filling another\u2019s need. I know that service should be learned in a home. And I am very certain that it blesses the home where it is found.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p34\" class=\"\">One family stands out in my mind. My friend had been the recipient and observer of kindly acts of service by her neighbor. Tenderly and efficiently she saw her care for the sick, notice the shy, cheer the downhearted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p35\" class=\"\">One day, while she was attending a lecture, a mother sitting near her rose hurriedly to take a child out who had become ill. As my friend went to see if she might be of assistance, there was another woman there already. Her manner of helping was quiet and quick, knowing just what to do, and it reminded my friend so much of her neighbor that she finally asked if, by chance, she knew her neighbor, only to find that they were sisters. In that family they had learned the meaning of service. By its selfless nature, service within a family increases spirituality and strengthens bonds of love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p36\" class=\"\">Accountability is a necessary condition of work. Responsibility brings system to the workings of a family and order to a marriage. Defining responsibilities and planning a method of reporting back fosters freedom from family discord and is also a meaningful stage in developing personal discipline.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p37\" class=\"\">If accountability is to be a learning experience, it must be taken seriously; even small children can recognize when their best efforts are treated patronizingly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p38\" class=\"\">Evening and morning prayers become reports when one understands accountability. Family home evening discussions of projects planned and accomplished can give each family member a feeling of belonging and being needed. There is no better way to prepare family members for service in the Church, or in the world of work, and, most importantly, in their relationships with our Father in Heaven than to be accountable in meaningful responsibilities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p39\" class=\"\">The basic welfare principles fortify and secure. Through them, the home becomes a stronghold, a protection against society\u2019s offenses, a haven in time of storm. A family begins with individuals\u2014with two people who become one, and as children are added, in the spiritual arithmetic of family unity, they will still be one. Parents can provide a protecting shelter, a safe place, and children are made strong by the bonds of their love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p40\" class=\"\">Although a family unit is a part of an extended family and participates in the larger circle of the Church, as an eternal organization it must be complete. It must stand alone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p41\" class=\"\">In a profound sense, however, a family is not alone. When it is consecrated to the Lord\u2019s work, his Spirit will always be with them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p42\" class=\"\">Should difficulties arise that require a family to receive temporary assistance, they know that this can be a blessing from the Lord and that the power is within them to rebuild their resources.

Upon release from his mission assignment, he suffered a severe and disabling stroke. Rather than turning to thoughts of complaint, self-pity, or rejection, his wife rose to the trial of this newest experience by drawing upon the strength of the gospel that had always been a part of their lives, as she lovingly reassured: \u201cThis is the time for which we have been preparing. We have the foundation of the gospel principles, and I am going to do all I can to make this the happiest time of our lives together.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/a-safe-place-for-marriages-and-families.p45\" class=\"\">Relief is only temporary, but welfare is eternal. Mortal life may be limited in both duration and scope, but principles are everlasting.
