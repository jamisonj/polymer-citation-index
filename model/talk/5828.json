Church classes provide a place where we can repeatedly experience the very things that brought us into the waters of baptism, where we learn doctrine and receive the ratifying witness of its truth, where we come to understand how doctrine is applied in the reality of our daily lives and accept the challenge to change our behavior accordingly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-ordinary-classroom-a-powerful-place-for-steady-and-continued-growth.p8\" class=\"\">The fundamental curriculum for all classes in the Church is the scriptures<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-96911_000_006\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Instructions for Priesthood and Auxiliary Leaders on Curriculum<\/span> (1994), 1.]<\/span><\/sup>\u2014they contain the unchanging doctrines of the kingdom of God.

Perhaps approach an admired teacher, asking him to observe and offer suggestions?

His story of activity, complete inactivity, and a return to activity included the description of two classrooms. He said: \u201cWhen I was about 15, I started to have a lot of questions about the Church. I thought maybe there would be a chance to talk about my questions at church, but it didn\u2019t happen. In priesthood it seemed like most of the time everybody talked about the game the night before. Sunday School was about the same\u2014maybe a little lesson thrown in during the last five minutes where the teacher asked questions, and it was kind of \u2018guess-the-right-answer-from-the-manual-time.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-ordinary-classroom-a-powerful-place-for-steady-and-continued-growth.p14\" class=\"\">Well, other things happened\u2014late Saturday nights, a switch to an earlier meeting schedule\u2014and soon the young man\u2019s attendance dropped to nothing.

He didn\u2019t waste a minute. He asked important questions. Everyone had their scriptures. They looked up verses. Shared ideas. They listened to each other. They talked about problems at school and how they fit in with the lesson. You could tell that the people in the class were all different, but they had one amazing thing in common\u2014they were all interested in learning the gospel.
