On that occasion I mentioned a small sign I had seen on another pulpit. The words on the sign were these: \u201cWho stands at this pulpit, let him be humble.\u201d I assure you that I was humbled by my call to the Twelve at that time. However, as I stand at <span class=\"emphasis\">this<\/span> pulpit today, I address you from the absolute depths of humility. I feel very keenly my dependence upon the Lord. I humbly seek the guidance of the Spirit as I share with you the feelings of my heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p6\" class=\"\">Just two months ago we said farewell to our dear friend and leader Gordon\u00a0B. Hinckley, the 15th President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an outstanding ambassador of truth to the entire world and beloved of all. We miss him. More than 53,000 men, women, and children journeyed to the beautiful Hall of the Prophets in this very building to pay their last respects to this giant of the Lord, who now belongs to the ages.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p7\" class=\"\">With the passing of President Hinckley, the First Presidency was dissolved. President Eyring and I, who served as counselors to President Hinckley, returned to our places in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and that quorum became the presiding authority of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p8\" class=\"\">On Saturday, February 2, 2008, funeral services for President Hinckley were held in this magnificent Conference Center\u2014a building which will ever stand as a monument to his foresight and vision. During the funeral, beautiful and loving tributes were paid to this man of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p9\" class=\"\">The following day, all 14 ordained Apostles living on the earth assembled in an upper room of the Salt Lake Temple. We met in a spirit of fasting and prayer. During that solemn and sacred gathering, the Presidency of the Church was reorganized in accordance with well-established precedent, after the pattern which the Lord Himself put in place.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p10\" class=\"\">Members of the Church around the world convened yesterday in a solemn assembly. You raised your hands in a sustaining vote to approve the action which was taken in that meeting in the temple to which I have just referred. As your hands were raised toward heaven, my heart was touched. I felt your love and support, as well as your commitment to the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p11\" class=\"\">I know without question, my brothers and sisters, that God lives. I testify to you that this is His work. I testify as well that our Savior Jesus Christ is at the head of this Church, which bears His name. I know that the sweetest experience in all this life is to feel His promptings as He directs us in the furtherance of His work. I felt those promptings as a young bishop, guided to the homes where there was spiritual\u2014or perhaps temporal\u2014want. I felt them again as a mission president in Toronto, Canada, working with wonderful missionaries who were a living witness and testimony to the world that this work is divine and that we are led by a prophet. I have felt them throughout my service in the Twelve and in the First Presidency and now as President of the Church. I testify that each one of us can feel the Lord\u2019s inspiration as we live worthily and strive to serve Him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p12\" class=\"\">I am keenly aware of the 15 men who preceded me as President of the Church. Many of them I have known personally. I have had the blessing and privilege of serving as a counselor to three of them. I am grateful for the abiding legacy left by each one of those 15 men. I have the sure knowledge, as I am confident they had, that God directs His prophet. My earnest prayer is that I might continue to be a worthy instrument in His hands to carry on this great work and to fulfill the tremendous responsibilities which come with the office of President.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p13\" class=\"\">I thank the Lord for wonderful counselors. President Henry\u00a0B. Eyring and President Dieter\u00a0F. Uchtdorf are men of great ability and sound understanding. They are counselors in the true sense of the word. I value their judgment. I believe they have been prepared by the Lord for the positions they now occupy. I love the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and treasure my association with them. They, too, are dedicated to the work of the Lord and are spending their lives in His service. I look forward to serving with Elder Christofferson, who has now been called to that quorum and who has received your sustaining vote. He, too, has been prepared for the position to which he has been called. It has also been a joy to serve with the members of the quorums of the Seventy and with the Presiding Bishopric. New members of the Seventy have been called and were sustained yesterday, and I look forward to associating with them in the work of the Master.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p14\" class=\"\">A sweet spirit of unity exists among the General Authorities.

I can say, as did Nephi of old, that I was born of goodly parents, whose own parents and grandparents were gathered out of the lands of Sweden and Scotland and England by dedicated missionaries. As those missionaries bore humble testimonies, they touched the hearts and the spirits of my forebears. After joining the Church, these noble men, women, and children made their way to the valley of the Great Salt Lake. Many were the trials and heartaches they encountered along the way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p16\" class=\"\">In the spring of 1848, my great-great-grandparents, Charles Stewart Miller and Mary McGowan Miller, who had joined the Church in their native Scotland, left their home in Rutherglen, Scotland, and journeyed to St. Louis, Missouri, with a group of Saints, arriving there in 1849. One of their 11 children, Margaret, would become my great-grandmother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p17\" class=\"\">While the family was in St. Louis working to earn enough money to complete their journey to the Salt Lake Valley, a plague of cholera swept through the area, leaving death and heartache in its wake. The Miller family was hard hit. In the space of two weeks, four of the family members succumbed. The first, on June 22, 1849, was 18-year-old William. Five days later Mary McGowan Miller, my great-great-grandmother and the mother of the family, died. Two days afterward, 15-year-old Archibald passed away, and five days after his death, my great-great-grandfather, Charles Stewart Miller, father of the family, succumbed. The children who survived were left orphans, including my great-grandmother Margaret, who was 13 years old at the time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p18\" class=\"\">Because of so many deaths in the area, there were no caskets available, at any price, in which to bury the deceased family members. The older surviving boys dismantled the family\u2019s oxen pens in order to make caskets for the family members who had passed away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p19\" class=\"\">Little is recorded of the heartache and struggles of the nine remaining Miller children as they continued to work and save for that journey their parents and brothers would never make. We know that they left St. Louis in the spring of 1850 with four oxen and one wagon, arriving finally in the Salt Lake Valley that same year.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p20\" class=\"\">Others of my ancestors faced similar hardships. Through it all, however, their testimonies remained steadfast and firm. From all of them I received a legacy of total dedication to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Because of these faithful souls, I stand before you today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p21\" class=\"\">I thank my Father in Heaven for my sweet companion, Frances. This October she and I will celebrate 60 wonderful years of marriage. Although my Church service began at an early age, she has never once complained when I\u2019ve left home to attend meetings or to fulfill an assignment. For many years my assignments as a member of the Twelve took me away from Salt Lake City often\u2014sometimes for five weeks at a time\u2014leaving her alone to care for our small children and our home. Beginning when I was called as a bishop at the age of 22, we have seldom had the luxury of sitting together during a Church service. I could not have asked for a more loyal, loving, and understanding companion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p22\" class=\"\">I express gratitude to my Heavenly Father for our three children and their companions, for eight wonderful grandchildren, and for four beautiful great-grandchildren.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/looking-back-and-moving-forward.p23\" class=\"\">It\u2019s difficult for me to find the words to convey to you, my brothers and sisters, my heartfelt appreciation for the lives you live, for the good you do, for the testimonies you bear.
