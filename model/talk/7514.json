He has called upon the women of the Church to stand together for righteousness. He has said that if we are united and speak with one voice, our strength will be incalculable. I have expressed to him my confidence that the women of this Church will stand strong and immovable in our faith in Jesus Christ and His restored gospel; strong and immovable in upholding, nourishing, and protecting our families; and strong and immovable in providing relief. May the Lord bless us as we do this most essential work of women is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-00611_000_041\"><a name=\"-00611_000_041\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-00611_000_041\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cStanding Strong and Immovable,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,<\/span> Jan. 10, 2004, 20.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-00611_000_041\"><a name=\"-00611_000_041\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-00611_000_041\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,<\/span> Jan. 10, 2004, 20.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-00611_000_041\"><a name=\"-00611_000_041\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-00611_000_041\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>See \u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Oct. 2004, 49; <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1995, 102.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-00611_000_041\"><a name=\"-00611_000_041\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-00611_000_041\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>See Online Etymology Dictionary, \u201crelief,\u201d \u201crelieve,\u201d www.etymonline.com.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-00611_000_041\"><a name=\"-00611_000_041\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote5-00611_000_041\">5.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 4:567.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-00611_000_041\"><a name=\"-00611_000_041\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote6-00611_000_041\">6.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 5:25.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-00611_000_041\"><a name=\"-00611_000_041\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote7-00611_000_041\">7.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Evidences and Reconciliations,<\/span> arr.
