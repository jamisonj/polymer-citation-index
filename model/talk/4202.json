I grow ever <span class=\"emphasis\">more<\/span> concerned that they understand us.

And that assurance can be affirmed to others. Of this I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
