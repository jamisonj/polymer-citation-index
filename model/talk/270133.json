They have of late acknowledged that the law\n  was misconstrued, and tantalized our feelings with it, and have entirely forsaken us, and have\n  forfeited their oaths and their bonds; and we have a come-back on them, for they are co-workers\n  with the mob.<\/p>\n  <div class=\"topic \">Change of Public Opinion<\/div>\n  <p class=\"std\">As nigh as we can learn, the public mind has been for a long time turning in our favor, and the\n  majority in now friendly; and the lawyers can no longer browbeat us by saying that this or that is\n  a matter of public opinion, for public opinion is not willing to brook it; for it is beginning to look\n  with feelings of indignation against our oppressors, and to say that the &ldquo;Mormons&rdquo; were not in the\n  fault in the least. We think that truth, honor, virtue and innocence will eventually come out\n  triumphant. We should have taken a habeas corpus before the high judge and escaped the mob in\n  a summary way; but unfortunately for us, the timber of the wall being very hard, our auger handles\n  gave out, and hindered us longer than we expected; we applied to a friend, and a very slight\n  incautious act gave rise to some suspicions, and before we could fully succeed, our plan was\n  discovered; we had everything in readiness, but the last stone, and we could have made our escape\n  in one minute, and should have succeeded admirably, had it not been for a little imprudence or\n  over-anxiety on the part of our friend.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">The sheriff and jailer did not blame us for our attempt; it was a fine breach, and cost the county\n  a round sum; but public opinion says that we ought to have been permitted to have made our escape;\n  that then the disgrace would have been on us, but now it must come on the state; that there cannot\n  be any charge sustained against us; and that the conduct of the mob, the murders committed at\n  Haun&rsquo;s Mills, and the exterminating order of the governor, and the one-sided, rascally proceedings\n  of the legislature, have damned the state of Missouri to all eternity.<span class=\"footRef\">1<\/span> I would just name also that\n  General Atchison has proved himself as contemptible as any of them.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">We have tried for a long time to get our lawyers to draw us some petitions to the supreme judges\n  of this state, but they<\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"111534\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 111534)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(111534)\">Mosiah 3:5<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"111928\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 111928)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(111928)\">Alma 13:7<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"113683\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 113683)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(113683)\">D&amp;C 39:1<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"116889\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 116889)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(116889)\">Moses 7:31<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
