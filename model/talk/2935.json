President Kimball reminded us in the April 1976 welfare session of general conference of the words of the Lord:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/a-call-to-action.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cWhy call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31986\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31986)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31986)\">Luke 6:46<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/a-call-to-action.p6\" class=\"\">On February 2 of this year, at a historic meeting of the General Welfare Services Committee of the Church, President Marion G.

In a regular weekly ward welfare services committee meeting she reported that an elderly widow was having trouble coping with life after the recent loss of her husband. Her health was waning, her legs were causing her problems and limiting her ability to move about and care for herself. She was understandably very lonely and also worried about her neglected garden. Considerable concern was expressed about her poor diet. The ward Relief Society president explained that compassionate service assignments had been made to the visiting teachers and to other sisters in the ward to help her plan and prepare three balanced meals each day and to organize and do such needed housework as the sister would permit. The home teachers agreed to ask her if she would like them to give her a special blessing. They also said they would keep up her garden and look for other ways to be helpful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/a-call-to-action.p10\" class=\"\">After several weeks, as a result of the blessing and the loving help, she gained courage and a desire to be self-sustaining.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/a-call-to-action.p11\" class=\"\">This story illustrates how the ward welfare services committee can work together to meet the needs of ward members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/a-call-to-action.p12\" class=\"\">Stake and district Relief Society presidencies everywhere should plan what to teach so that ward and branch presidencies will more fully understand and carry out their welfare duties efficiently and effectively.
