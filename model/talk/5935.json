As I met with them, I knew they were truly converted to the gospel. I felt they would be the foundation of the Church in Czechoslovakia. They learned the truth of the gospel and felt the strength of testimony\u2014all from Olga. When I complimented Olga and thanked her for having a testimony she is willing to share, she said, \u201cOh, Brother Monson, I have 14 others with whom I am working!\u201d Later I learned that almost all of those 14 became members of the Church.

It is the account of a first-year Beehive in Young Women. I share it with you, using her own words:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/pioneers-all.p64\" class=\"\">\u201cOne day, a few months before my 12th birthday, I noticed a note card on the dresser of the room I shared with my older sister. It read, \u2018I\u2019m happy to be your teacher and hope that we have a great year in Mutual.\u2019 It was signed \u2018Baur Dee.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/pioneers-all.p65\" class=\"\">\u201cI soon learned that all of the girls loved Baur Dee. They visited her at home, wanted to sit with her in church, and stayed after Mutual each Wednesday to talk with her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/pioneers-all.p66\" class=\"\">\u201cLooking back so many years, I am amazed that I still have such a vivid memory of my earliest real meeting with Baur Dee. That first night, as I walked in the front door of our ward building to attend Mutual, she stood waiting to greet me. I noticed for the first time the smile which always transformed her appearance from average to beautiful. \u2018Welcome,\u2019 she said to me. \u2018I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re in my class. We\u2019re going to have a great time!\u2019 There was no adjustment period for me from Primary to Mutual. I felt right at home from that moment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/pioneers-all.p67\" class=\"\">\u201cOver the next few weeks, I joined the other girls as one of Baur Dee\u2019s fans. At the time, I didn\u2019t try to figure out her popularity. So many years later, though, I believe I understand. She really, truly cared about each one of us, and we knew it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/pioneers-all.p68\" class=\"\">\u201cBaur Dee suffered from a disease called nephritis\u2014a disease which not too many years later would be treated with dialysis and often cured with a kidney transplant. But for Baur Dee there was no cure, no miracle. She passed away peacefully. She was 27 years old.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/pioneers-all.p69\" class=\"\">\u201cAfter the funeral services, as we girls stood somberly around the open grave at the cemetery, we made a vow that we would visit Baur Dee\u2019s final resting place together every Memorial Day throughout our lives and that we would never, ever allow her memory to die.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/pioneers-all.p70\" class=\"\">Forty years have gone by since Baur Dee, this teacher of girls, passed away\u2014yet the pledge lives on. One of her girls has said: \u201cWherever I go, whatever I do, something of Baur Dee goes with me and with each of her \u2018girls.\u2019 She lives on in us and in those with whom we have shared her lessons.\u201d As Henry Brooks Adams observed, \u201cA teacher affects eternity; [she] can never tell where [her] influence stops.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote13-97905_000_042\">13<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">The Education of Henry Brooks Adams: An Autobiography<\/span> (1942), 280.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/pioneers-all.p71\" class=\"\">Tonight, may all who hear my voice know that this work is of our Heavenly Father.
