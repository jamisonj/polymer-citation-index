I was all alone. I had come there with the hope of recapturing\nsome of the surrounding influence that gave background to one of the significant discussions\nof all time. I refer to that occasion when the Savior had asked his disciples: \"Whom do men\nsay that I the Son of man am?\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Great Testimony<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or\none of the prophets.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen Christ became more direct, \". . . But whom say ye that I am?\n<\/p><p>\n\"And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35469\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35469)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35469)\">Matt. 16:13-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs never before, the strength, the power, the conviction of that testimony declared so many\ncenturies before had become mine to cherish and harbor as an integral part of my own\npersonal testimony.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Reawakened at Caesarea<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat happened to me that beautiful morning in the coasts of Caesarea Philippi was not\nunique nor was it physical in any way. As Christ explained to Peter: \". . . flesh and blood\nhath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35477\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35477)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35477)\">Matt. 16:17<\/a><\/span>). Peter was the\nrecipient of personal revelation! And in like manner this same sweet confirmation of\ntestimony can permeate the hearts of all truth-seeking, conscientious Latter-day Saints the\nworld over. This great gift of personal revelation is unmistakable; it is direct. It is a more sure\ncommunication than the audible spoken word, for that which we hear through mortal ears is\nsometimes distorted, so often misunderstood. This precious gift of spirit speaking to spirit is\ninfallible and direct and, in the case just cited, came from a loving Heavenly Father to his\nfaithful disciple Peter.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring this same conversation, Peter's revelation was referred to as a rock&mdash;a rock firm and\nimmovable. \". . . and upon this rock,\" the Savior declared, \"I will build my church\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35481\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35481)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35481)\">Matt. 16:18<\/a><\/span>).\nHe selected rock as the perfect symbol of uncompromised truth, the only possible\nfoundation upon which to build his true Church&mdash;the rock of revelation.\n<\/p><p>\nThis same rock of revelation is broad enough for all mankind to build upon. It beckons to all\nindividuals who are willing to put on his yoke, for it is easy and the burden is light\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35454\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35454)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35454)\">Matt. 11:30<\/a><\/span>). The\nauthor of all truth has declared it so.\n<\/p><p>\nAs a child of God man is never forsaken by him. War and contention among men whether it\nbe an international conflict or a form of family disunity is not God's will. Man's unhappiness\nis of his own making&mdash;a direct result of nonconformity to the plan of life as contained in\nHeavenly Father's blueprint for happiness. Men never fail because of God's revealed word,\nbut rather, in spite of it.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>We Can Know as Peter Knew<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSo how can we know as Peter knew? How can a person achieve this reassuring, motivating\ncertainty that God lives? Surely, if there were no doubts our course would be undeviating.\nCan it be that only a few are chosen to receive this most precious gift of personal assurance?\n<\/p><p>\nThe purpose of all creation is, hopefully, that all men may qualify to return to His presence.\nNow, there are those who spend most of a lifetime debating with themselves. They ask: Is it\nworth it? or, How can I truly know that this or that is God's will?\n<\/p><p>\nAs the Savior taught in the temple on one occasion, the Jews marveled at his wisdom and\nknowledge. \"How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?\" they asked.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.\n<\/p><p>\n\"If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether It be of God, or whether\nI speak of myself\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28179\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28179)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28179)\">John 7:14-17<\/a><\/span>).\nThe key phrase, of course, is, \"If any man will do his\nwill.\" The doing is of prime importance.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Meekness Brings It<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe are always touched when we hear a chorus of Primary children sing, \"I Am a Child of\nGod.\" The last two lines of that inspired song read: \"Teach me all that I must know, To live\nwith Him some day.\" I understand that future printings will follow a wise suggestion made by\nBrother Kimball, that the word \"know\" be changed to \"do.\" \"Teach me all that I must <i>do<\/i>, To\nlive with Him some day.\" Only in the doing can we be assured of a confirmation by the\nspirit&mdash;yes, by good works we do become eligible for personal revelation.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we now turn to another important key to this vital and sought-after knowledge of Deity.\nTwo thousand years ago the great high priest Alma was travelling from city to city. He knew\nsomething about personal revelation and seemed most anxious to share it with those he\nattempted to teach as he declared: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that these things whereof I have spoken are true.\nAnd how do ye suppose that I know of their surety?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God. Behold, I\nhave fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself. And now I do\nknow of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his\nHoly Spirit, and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9049\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9049)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9049)\">Alma 5:45-46<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Fasting and Prayer<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow, Alma points out here that he did something more than just carry on the work. He\nhastened his process of sure knowledge through fasting and prayer. \"I have fasted and prayed\nmany days that I might know these things of myself.\" These same principles will work for\neach of us today. Fasting has been practiced by men seeking spiritual strength from the very\nbeginning of time. David the Psalmist tells how he humbled his soul with fasting\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5002\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5002)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5002)\">2 Sam. 12:16-23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now speaking of prayer, if prayer were important for Alma, it is important for us, too. It\nis folly to think in terms of having this highly spiritual information made known to us by the\nHoly Spirit, without first parting the veil through prayer. It was this important step that led to\nthis greatest of all dispensations, the Dispensation of the Fullness of Times. The young lad\nJoseph was touched by that invitation of Holy Writ, the promise given for all men alike: \"If\nany of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth\nnot; and it shall be given him\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26181\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26181)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26181)\">James 1:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>To Gain Wisdom<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we want bus travel information, we go to the bus terminal; when we want financial\nassistance, we seek out a banker; so why not go directly to God for a confirming testimony of\nhim and his work?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto\nyou: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it\nshall be opened.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?\n<\/p><p>\n\"If ye then . . . know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your\nFather which is in heaven give good things to them that ask (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35441\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35441)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35441)\">Matt. 7:7-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is no sweeter work than his work. There is no joy to compare with the blessed\nassurance of obedience to his laws and ordinances. But we only do his work and obey his law\nwhen we are convinced that it is most important. This is why we must remove with all haste\nthose barriers that would prevent such assurance from a loving Heavenly Father who is so\nanxious that we receive. May we guard against the condition that Laman and Lemuel found\nthemselves in. They refused to cooperate in God's work even after receiving unmistakable\ndirection from an angel and the still small voice. Nephi records that they were \"past feeling,\"\nthat they \"could not feel his words\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1609\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1609)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1609)\">1 Ne. 17:45<\/a><\/span>).\nIt is interesting to note that it was they,\nnot God, who broke the bond. This seems to be the pattern, and our day is no exception.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Testimony \"Last of All\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI feel sorry for the man or woman who has become so negative that he is \"past feeling\" so far\nas the things of God are concerned. But we all rejoice as we see those who stand out in the\ncrowd as a beacon on a hill, declaring with Alma that \". . . the knowledge which I have is of\nGod\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9051\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9051)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9051)\">Alma 36:26<\/a><\/span>);\nthose who reconfirm the testimony of Job, \"For I know that my redeemer\nliveth . . .\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26715\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26715)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26715)\">Job 19:25<\/a><\/span>);\nthose who stand firm with Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon in their\nfamous declaration, \"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this\nis the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: <i>that he lives!<\/i>\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14615\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14615)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14615)\">D&amp;C 76:22<\/a><\/span>, italics added)\nand then those who can feel with Peter, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35474\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35474)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35474)\">Matt. 16:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe world needs assurance. The world needs some solid rock to replace shifting sand. The\nworld needs men with conviction about things most important. The world needs the added\nstrength of several thousand more clarion voices that teach only truth because they live by the\ntruth.\n<\/p><p>\nTo my mind the main strength of the world we live in is the strength of his true Church. And\nwhere is the main strength of his true Church? Not in the buildings on this block, nor is it\nfound in any group of men who might be designated as leaders for a short season. In my\nopinion, the Church has its foundation in the heart, in the home, and in the testimony of every\nworthy member. The widow cannot pay her mite, nor is it possible for an unselfish\nscoutmaster or quorum leader or dedicated bishop to take time to help a boy except the\nkingdom of God on earth is strengthened and the world is made a little more secure on its\nfoundations\n<\/p><p>\nIndeed, the Savior of the world has declared if a foundation is built on the solid rock of\nrevelation, be it an individual, a group, a nation, or the world, that \". . . the gates of hell shall\nnot prevail against it\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35482\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35482)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35482)\">Matt. 16:18<\/a><\/span>).\nPeter heard it on the shores of Caesarea two thousand\nyears ago. I found it still there undiminished twenty years ago, and you can find it in your\nquiet place today, tomorrow, and forever. May we ever be available for that most precious\ngift of the spirit&mdash;personal revelation&mdash;is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
