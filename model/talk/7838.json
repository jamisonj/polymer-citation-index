It is either the word of God as professed, or it is a total fraud. This book does not merely claim to be a moral treatise or theological commentary or collection of insightful writings. It claims to be the word of God\u2014every sentence, every verse, every page. Joseph Smith declared that an angel of God directed him to gold plates, which contained the writings of prophets in ancient America, and that he translated those plates by divine powers. If that story is true, then the Book of Mormon is holy scripture, just as it professes to be; if not, it is a sophisticated but, nonetheless, diabolical hoax.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god.p7\" class=\"\">C.\u00a0S.

A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. \u2026 You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. \u2026 But let us not come with any patronising nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-09611_000_030\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[C.\u00a0S.

If so, he would be divided against himself and thus be destroying his own kingdom, the very condition the Savior said could not exist. An honest, unbiased reading of the Book of Mormon will bring someone to the same conclusion as my great-great-grandfather, namely: \u201cThe devil could not have written it\u2014it must be from God.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god.p14\" class=\"\">But why is the Book of Mormon so essential if we already have the Bible to teach us about Jesus Christ? Have you ever wondered why there are so many Christian churches in the world today when they obtain their doctrines from essentially the same Bible? It is because they interpret the Bible differently. If they interpreted it the same, they would be the same church. This is not a condition the Lord desires, for the Apostle Paul declared that there is \u201cone Lord, one faith, one baptism\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122597\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122597)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122597)\">Ephesians 4:5<\/a><\/span>).

Why is this second witness so crucial? The following illustration may help: How many straight lines can you draw through a single point on a piece of paper? The answer is infinite. For a moment, suppose that single point represents the Bible and that hundreds of those straight lines drawn through that point represent different interpretations of the Bible and that each of those interpretations represents a different church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god.p16\" class=\"\">What happens, however, if on that piece of paper there is a second point representing the Book of Mormon? How many straight lines could you draw between these two reference points: the Bible and the Book of Mormon? Only one. Only one interpretation of Christ\u2019s doctrines survives the testimony of these two witnesses.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god.p17\" class=\"\">Again and again the Book of Mormon acts as a confirming, clarifying, unifying witness of the doctrines taught in the Bible so that there is only \u201cone Lord, one faith, one baptism.\u201d For example, some people are confused as to whether baptism is essential for salvation even though the Savior declared to Nicodemus, \u201cExcept a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122599\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122599)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122599)\">John 3:5<\/a><\/span>).

Could He have come up out of the water unless He first went down into the water?
