His concern and fears that there is\na growing laxity in the minds of young people with respect to the importance and sacredness\nof the marriage covenant suggest the topic \"Marriage and Divorce\" to which I now invite your\nattention.\n<\/p><p>\nAdjustments to be made by newly married couples when young husbands now in the armed\nforces return to civilian life suggest another condition that makes such a consideration not\nwholly untimely.\n<\/p><p>\nIn all the problems and perplexities of human existence, Jesus Christ is the one safe guide to\nwhom we can go for guidance and comfort. Mark's account of Jesus' answer to the Pharisees\non divorce sets forth the Savior's attitude toward this vital question.\n<\/p><p>\nA careful study of this text, and other references that he made to marriage and divorce, leave\nlittle doubt that Jesus set forth the lofty ideal that marriage is of divine origin and that the\nmarriage bond should be held sacred.\n<\/p><p>\nThis lofty ideal of marriage is confirmed by modern revelation, and is recorded in the D&amp;C\nas follows:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again, verily I say unto you, that whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God, for\nmarriage is ordained of God unto man.\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, it is lawful that he should have one wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and\nall this that the earth might answer the end of its creation:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the\nworld was made (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12112\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12112)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12112)\">D&amp;C 49:15-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Pharisees, seeking to justify the granting of divorce, cited the fact that \"Moses\nsuffered to write a bill of divorcement and to put a wife away\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32982\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32982)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32982)\">Mark 10:4<\/a><\/span>) on the ground of \"some\nuncleanness\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21202\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21202)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21202)\">Deut. 24:1<\/a><\/span>), Jesus answered:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. But from the beginning of the\ncreation God made them male and female. For this cause shall a man leave his father and\nmother, and cleave to his wife; And they twain shall be one flesh; so then they are no more\ntwain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32983\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32983)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32983)\">Mark 10:5-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the light of scripture, ancient and modern, we are justified in concluding that Christ's ideal\npertaining to marriage is the unbroken home, and conditions that cause divorce are violations\nof his divine teachings. Some of these are:\n<\/p><p>\nUnfaithfulness on the part of either or both, habitual drunkenness, physical violence, long\nimprisonment that disgraces the wife and family, the union of an innocent girl to a\nreprobate&mdash;in these and perhaps other cases there may be circumstances which make the\ncontinuance of the marriage state a greater evil than divorce. But these are extreme\ncases&mdash;they are the mistakes, the calamities in the realm of marriage.\n<\/p><p>\nOn the other hand, to look upon marriage as a mere contract that may be entered into at\npleasure in response to a romantic whim, or for selfish purposes, and severed at the first\ndifficulty or misunderstanding that may arise, is an evil meriting severe condemnation,\nespecially in cases wherein children are made to suffer because of such separation.\n<\/p><p>\nDANGERS THREATENING THE MARRIAGE RELATION\n<\/p><p>\nMarriage is a sacred relationship entered into for purposes that are well recognized&mdash;primarily\nfor the rearing of a family. It is claimed by some careful observers that our present modern\nlife tends to frustrate these purposes. Writes one:\n<\/p><p>\nModern living conditions contribute to these frustrations. Formerly a married woman had a\nhome to care for, often several children. Today, in many parts of our country, a married\nwoman continues either to follow her vocation or to spend her time seeking new\nstimulations&mdash;no children to care for&mdash;no house to clean&mdash;no meals to cook. Under such a\ncondition her leisure time activities become her all-absorbing interests&mdash;interests which often\nlead her away from her husband rather than to him.\n<\/p><p>\nTwenty-four years ago when the steamship <i>Marama<\/i> dropped anchor outside the coral reef that\nsurrounds the island Rarotonga, a passenger desiring to go ashore asked the captain why he\ndid not sail nearer to the wharf. In answer the experienced seaman mentioned treacherous\nwaters and pointed to an engine of one ship, the <i>Maitai<\/i>, and to the bow of another, still\nprotruding out of the water&mdash;both carrying mute evidence of the danger of anchoring too close\nto the shore of this coral-bound island. \"We anchor here,\" said the captain, \"because it is safer\nto avoid being dashed to pieces, as those two vessels, on those dangerous reefs.\"\n<\/p><p>\nA flippant attitude toward marriage, the ill-advised suggestion of \"companionate marriage,\"\nthe base, diabolical theory of \"free sex experiment,\" and the ready-made divorce courts are\ndangerous reefs upon which many a family bark is wrecked.\n<\/p><p>\nAn ever-decreasing birth rate and an increasing divorce rate are ominous signs threatening the\nstability of the American home, and the perpetuity of our present form of constitutional\ngovernment. An editorial in a weekly magazine, published in the capital of\nthe nation, says:\n<\/p><p>\nSince 1890 the United States of America's national birth rate has dropped from 32.9 per\n1,000 population to 17.4 per 1,000 population.\n<\/p><p>\nIn those same years, the national average for divorces jumped from 5.7 per 100 marriages to\n19.3 per 100 marriages.\n<\/p><p>\nA falling birth rate plus a rising divorce rate speak ill for individual faith in the future. Hence\nit speaks ill for the nation's future.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat, in the long run, is the point of vast new public programs if the individual, continually\nfearful of tomorrow, flutters from mate to mate and deliberately robs the nation of his, or her,\nown good qualities in the next generation? A nation's permanency is entirely dependent on\nthe permanency of its individual homes, the family pride of its citizens and the reproduction\nof those families, generation by generation.\n<\/p><p>\nEx-president Taft on one occasion said:\n<\/p><p>\nOur state rests upon our homes. And if we cannot keep our homes from this constant\ndemoralizing breaking up, we had better go out of the business of government entirely.\n<\/p><p>\nIn some states of the union, it is almost as easy to get a divorce as it is to get married. As a\nresult of this laxity, one out of every five marriages ends either in divorce or annulment.\n<\/p><p>\nDIVORCE INCREASING IN CIVIL AND CHURCH MARRIAGES\n<\/p><p>\nThough statistics indicate that there is a much lower divorce rate in the Church than in the\nnation, yet there is cause for concern over the number of marriages annulled annually in the\ndivorce courts.\n<\/p><p>\nWith the assistance of the Presiding Bishop's office and Professor Roy A. West, I have before\nme a comparison of marriages and divorces in the Church from 1920 to 1944. It sets forth the\nfact that though there are fewer divorces among couples married in the temples and by stake\nand ward authorities than by civil officers and other churches, yet divorces are increasing\neven in the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nFor example, during the period 1920-1922 there was one divorce for every 38.24 marriages\namong couples married in the temples and by stake and ward authorities, but there was,\nduring those same years, one divorce for every 13.20 marriages among couples married by\ncivil officers. Comparatively, that ratio continues throughout the twenty years, as you will\nnote by the following taken at random: (The first figure will be the Church marriage; the\nsecond, the civil marriage.)\n<\/p><p>\n1923 to 1925&mdash;one divorce to every 33 marriages; one divorce to every 15 marriages.\n<\/p><p>\n1935 to 1937&mdash;one divorce to every 28 marriages; one divorce to every 12.52 marriages.\n<\/p><p>\n1938 to 1940&mdash;one divorce to every 26.61 marriages; one divorce to every 10.13 marriages.\n<\/p><p>\nLast year there was one divorce for every seventeen marriages among couples married in\ntemples and by stake and ward authorities, and one divorce for every 6.9 (we will say seven)\nmarriages among couples married by civil officers. There is cause for concern over the\nincrease of divorces in this country and even in our Church.\n<\/p><p>\nDIVORCE RATE IN THE CHURCH AND IN THE UNITED STATES\n<\/p><p>\nThe ratio of divorce to marriage in the United States is three times higher than in the Church.\nIn 1920 there were 7.5 marriages to every divorce in the United States; while in the Church\nthere were 24.8 marriages to every divorce. In 1935, the United States had a ratio of 6.1\nmarriages to every divorce; during the same year the Church had a ratio of 17.9 marriages to\neach divorce.\n<\/p><p>\nThe real source of security of our nation rests in the well ordered, properly conducted homes.\nThe character of a child is formed largely during the first twelve years of his life. It is\nestimated that in that period the child spends approximately 3,240 hours in school; 416 hours\nin Sunday School and church, but 52,560 hours in the home, not counting twelve hours a day\nfor sleep. In other words, he spends sixteen times as many waking hours in the home as in\nschool, and one hundred twenty-six times as many hours in the home as in the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the homes of America are born the children of America, and from them go out into\nAmerican life American men and women. They go out with the stamp of these homes upon\nthem, and only as these homes are what they should be, will children be what they should be.\n<\/p><p>\nLuther Burbank, the great plant wizard, most impressively emphasizes the need for constant\nattention in the training of a child. He says:\n<\/p><p>\nTeach the child self-respect. Train it in self-respect just as you train a plant in better ways. No\nself-respecting man was ever a grafter. Above all, bear in mind repetition&mdash;the use of an\ninfluence over and over again, keeping everlastingly at it. This is what fixes traits in plants,\nthe constant repetition of an influence until at last it is irrevocably fixed and will not change.\nYou cannot afford to get discouraged. You are dealing with something far more precious than\nany plant&mdash;the precious soul of a child!\n<\/p><p>\nThere are three fundamental things to which every child is entitled: (1) a respected name, (2)\na sense of security, (3) opportunities for development.\n<\/p><p>\nThe family gives to the child his name and standing in the community. A child wants his\nfamily to be as good as those of his friends. He wants to be able to point with pride to his\nfather, and to feel an inspiration always as he thinks of his mother. It is a mother's duty so to\nlive that her children will associate with her everything that is beautiful, sweet, and pure. And\nthe father should so live that the child, emulating his example, will be a good citizen, and, in\nthe Church, a true Latter-day Saint.\n<\/p><p>\nSECURITY\n<\/p><p>\nA child has the right to feel that in his home he has a place of refuge, a place of protection\nfrom the dangers and evils of the outside world. Family unity and integrity are necessary to\nsupply this need.\n<\/p><p>\nHe needs parents who are happy in their adjustment to each other, who are working hopefully\ntoward the fulfilment of an ideal of living, who love their children with a sincere and\nunselfish love; in short, who are well-balanced individuals, gifted with a certain amount of\ninsight, who are able to provide the child with a wholesome emotional background which will\ncontribute more to his development than material advantages.\n<\/p><p>\nDivorce almost invariably deprives children of these advantages.\n<\/p><p>\nHOW TO LESSEN THE BREAKING UP OF HOMES\n<\/p><p>\n1. Substitute the present tendency toward a low view of marriage by the lofty view which\nJesus the Christ gives it. Let us look upon marriage as a sacred obligation and a covenant that\nis eternal, or that may be made eternal.\n<\/p><p>\n2. Teach the young of both sexes in the responsibilities and ideals of marriage so that they\nmay realize that marriage involves obligation, and is not an arrangement to be terminated at\npleasure. Teach them that pure love between the sexes is one of the noblest things on earth,\nand the bearing and rearing of children the highest of all human duties. In this regard it is the\nduty of parents to set an example in the home that children may see and absorb, as it were,\nthe sacredness of family life and the responsibility associated therewith.\n<\/p><p>\n3. The number of broken marriages can be reduced if couples realize even before they\napproach the altar that marriage is a state of mutual service, a state of giving as well as of\nreceiving, and that each must give of himself or herself to the utmost. Harriet Beecher Stowe\nwisely writes:\n<\/p><p>\nNo man or woman can create a true home who is not willing in the outset to embrace life\nheroically, to encounter labor and sacrifice. Only to such can this divinest power be given to\ncreate on earth that which is the nearest image of heaven.\n<\/p><p>\n4. Another condition that contributes to the permanence of the marriage covenant is marriage\nin the temple. Before such a marriage is consummated, it is necessary for the young man and\nyoung woman first to obtain a recommend from the bishop. They should go to him in person,\nand the bishop who does his duty will instruct the couple regarding the sacredness of the\nobligation that they are as young people going to assume, emphasizing all the safeguards that\nhave been named before. There in the presence of the priesthood the young people receive,\nbefore they take upon themselves the obligation, instruction upon the sacredness of the duty\nwhich is before them; and furthermore, whether or not they are prepared to go in holiness and\npurity to the altar of God and there seal their vows and love.\n<\/p><p>\n5. Finally, there is one principle which seems to me to strike right at the base of the happiness\nof the marriage relation, and that is the standard of purity taught and practiced among the\nLatter-day Saints. It is a common saying throughout the world that young men may sow their\nwild oats, but that young women should be chaperoned and guarded. In the Church of Christ\nthere is but one standard of morality. No young man has any more right to sow his wild oats\nthan has a young girl. She is taught that second only to the crime of taking human life is that\nof losing her virtue. And that is the ideal among young men. That young man who comes to\nthe bishop and asks for a recommend to take a pure girl to the altar is expected to give just\nthe same purity that he expects to receive.\n<\/p><p>\nCONCLUSION\n<\/p><p>\nFor the proper solution of this great problem we may turn with safety to Jesus as our guide.\nHe declared that the marriage relation is of divine origin, that \"marriage is ordained of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12111\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12111)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12111)\">D&amp;C 49:15<\/a><\/span>),\nthat only under the most exceptional conditions should it be set aside. In the teaching of the\nChurch of Christ, the family assumes supreme importance in the development of the\nindividual and of society. \"Happy and thrice happy are they who enjoy an uninterrupted\nunion, and whose love, unbroken by any complaint, shall not dissolve until the last day.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe marriage ceremony when sealed by the authority of the Holy Priesthood endures, as do\nfamily relationships, throughout time and all eternity.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33996\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33996)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33996)\">Matt. 19:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless these young couples who must make new adjustments, some under trying\ncircumstances, when the boys and husbands come home from war, and God bless us all to\nlook more earnestly and prayerfully and sincerely upon the sacredness of home and the\nmarriage covenant. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
