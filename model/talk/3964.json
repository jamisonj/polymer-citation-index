In every instance, those who are successful love what they are doing.

Larsen beautifully summarized this idea in these words: \u201cWhen we understand what is right and what is wrong, we are in a position to exercise our freedom in making choices. In so doing, we must stand accountable for our decisions, and we cannot escape the inevitable consequences of these choices. Such freedom to exercise moral agency is essential in an environment where people have the highest prospects for progress and development.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign, <\/span>May 1980, p. 76.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p11\" class=\"\">Jesus concerned himself primarily with the teaching of fundamental principles, and these principles had to do with the spiritual and mental condition of the individual. For the Savior knew that if one\u2019s mental state is right, most everything else would be right. But if the mental state is wrong, little can be accomplished in a person\u2019s life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p12\" class=\"\">It is no wonder, then, that Nephi admonished his people to \u201cfeast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4115\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4115)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4115)\">2 Ne. 32:3<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p13\" class=\"\">Jesus said, \u201cNot every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36997\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36997)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36997)\">Matt. 7:21<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cEnter ye in at the strait gate.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36994\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36994)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36994)\">Matt. 7:13<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p15\" class=\"\">President Marion G.

A sports editor wrote that for such a small country, East Germany, or as the world knows it, the German Democratic Republic, was doing exceedingly well. He said that they were not that much better trained than their competitors, but just a lot better prepared mentally, spending many hours in the preparation of the mind and the will. \u201cJust good old-fashioned positive mental attitude\u201d is all that is favoring the athletes from that country.

Often their problems include lack of knowledge and testimony of the gospel, hurt feelings that result in attitudes of unworthiness and guilt, and sometimes fear of participation in Church assignments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">4.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Youth who are caught up by the philosophies or behavior of the world and stray from their Church commitments. Some of these youth are persuaded by worldly attitudes of instant pleasure. Some are influenced by peer groups that take nothing seriously until the realities of life force them to.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p22\" class=\"\">This work of reclaiming the lost sheep, as Jesus so vividly expressed it, must receive top priority by every stake, ward, branch, and quorum leader. All inactive members should be considered candidates for activation regardless of their response to any previous approach. We must use kindness, patience, long-suffering, love, faith, and diligence. They must feel our genuine concern and untiring love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p23\" class=\"\">For individuals to become fully active in the Church, they generally must experience a spiritual conversion and a social integration. We should strive to teach them the gospel and to extend warmth and genuine friendship and fellowship to them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p24\" class=\"\">Recently, I attended a stake conference and heard a story of member activation that moved me deeply. The bishop of one of the wards in the stake took a keen interest in arousing inactive brethren to Church activity. He knew that the first step was one of communication, that he must have a meaningful visit with each inactive brother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p25\" class=\"\">So he began by telephoning one of them. The wife answered the phone and said, \u201cBishop, I surely appreciate your call. My husband is outside, but I will have him come to the phone.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p26\" class=\"\">When the husband heard that it was the bishop that wished to speak to him, his reaction was as expected. He attempted to sidestep this phone call and responded, \u201cTell the bishop that I\u2019m out sawing logs,\u201d and with a humorous touch, \u201cTell him I\u2019m dead.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p27\" class=\"\">The brother spoke the truth more literally than he realized. It was true. He was sawing logs, and tragically, he was dead to the spiritual things of his life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p28\" class=\"\">A good wife, however, is a mighty force in any man\u2019s life, and, in a kindly manner, she persuaded her husband to come to the phone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p29\" class=\"\">Then the bishop, using the power of suggestion and in a friendly voice, said, \u201cI should very much appreciate having a visit with you for a few moments this evening in my office.\u201d The brother couldn\u2019t refuse so warmhearted an invitation, and a meeting took place.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p30\" class=\"\">The testimony of the bishop and his deep concern kindled a fire in the heart of the inactive brother, and he agreed to join the temple preparation class that was about to begin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p31\" class=\"\">Each session, taught by a tactful teacher with a great knowledge of the truth and an inspiring testimony, motivated the inactive brother. He resolved to strengthen his family and bind them together eternally through the blessings of the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p32\" class=\"\">This good brother may still be sawing logs, but there is now much more. He has added for himself an indescribable dimension of happiness, as well as joy to the lives of each and every family member.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p33\" class=\"\">In another ward, the bishop assigned his two best home teachers to work with one specially selected inactive family. The husband and father had been inactive for many years, even though he held the office of elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood. The couple was approached and asked if the special teachers could come and teach them the gospel in weekly visits to their home. The family agreed, and the teachers proceeded to bring gospel lessons tailored to the needs and desires of the family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p34\" class=\"\">The bishop also helped by interviewing the couple every few weeks. The husband usually went golfing on Sundays and had no desire to change his life-style at first. During one interview, the bishop said to the husband, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get going on spiritual matters so that you won\u2019t lose your fine family.\u201d This caused the inactive brother to think deeply about important issues, and within a couple of weeks he asked for another interview with the bishop and said that he had started paying tithing and that he and his wife wanted to set a goal of being sealed in the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p35\" class=\"\">As this family became active, their whole attitude changed, and they seemed to be very happy to embrace the gospel principles and make the necessary change in life-style.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p36\" class=\"\">In the case of yet another inactive family, the specially assigned teachers lived in the same neighborhood. The teachers first showed genuine friendship and neighborly concern until they felt they could talk with the inactive family in a serious manner. They sat down with the family one day and asked if they could begin teaching them the gospel in weekly sessions in their home. The teachers assured the family that they would not pressure them in any way and that their visits would be designed to teach the doctrines of the Savior and answer questions the family might have. Within a few weeks, the home teachers took the family to church, and soon the family began to attend on their own. The bishop interviewed the couple and helped them to set goals for the husband to be ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood and for them to be sealed in the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p37\" class=\"\">The bishop reports that it was touching to see this family with their five children sealed for time and eternity. The sealing room in the temple was filled with friends and members of the ward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p38\" class=\"\">The family now bears strong testimony to the truth of the gospel, and many in the ward say they have never seen people change so much. The husband now serves in the presidency of the elders quorum.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p39\" class=\"\">The president of an elders quorum in one of our outstanding stakes in Brazil\u2014I love that great people, our members in Brazil\u2014reported phenomenal success in reactivating fifteen elders in his quorum last year. I asked the question, \u201cHow did you accomplish this?\u201d He said, \u201cWe and the home teachers visited them often.
