Each evening the father, a farm laborer, spent his entire day\u2019s wages on groceries for dinner. Departing from their humble home, the senior companion thought to himself, \u201cThe law of tithing will surely be a stumbling block to this family. Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t bring it up for a while.\u201d A few moments later, the junior companion, who had grown up in similar circumstances in his own country, voiced his own thoughts aloud: \u201cI know the principle of tithing isn\u2019t taught for four more discussions, but can we please teach it the next time we visit? They need to know about tithing now because they need the help and the blessing of the Lord so much.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/tithing-a-test-of-faith-with-eternal-blessings.p36\" class=\"\">This missionary understood that \u201cthere is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated\u2014And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote19-22911_000_011\">19<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11443\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11443)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11443)\">D&amp;C 130:20\u201321<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> The Lord wants to bless this family and anxiously awaits their obedience so He can.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/tithing-a-test-of-faith-with-eternal-blessings.p37\" class=\"\">My beloved brothers and sisters, the eternal blessings of tithing are real.
