It\u2019s wonderful to see you here, wonderful that you\u2019ve met your appointment with the Lord in this important priesthood meeting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p4\" class=\"\">Where would we be without the faith of youth? I\u2019m thinking of a boy named David in the Old Testament. I\u2019m thinking of a young lad named Nephi in Book of Mormon history. I\u2019m thinking of a young, fifteen-year-old named Joseph Smith, who had faith and who became the head of this dispensation. I\u2019m so grateful for the zeal of youth and the faith and the discernment of youth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p5\" class=\"\">One short story: a preacher finally came to the point where he felt that he had enough faith to walk on water. And so he sent the word out to all the land, and people came from far and near. There were thousands there. But right in the front row was a deacon from the LDS church. He had great interest in this kind of faith. He\u2019d heard about it in Sunday School and in family home evening, and he was on the front row, not fifteen feet away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p6\" class=\"\">As the preacher walked up to the water, he paused momentarily and as he bent down to roll up his trousers the boy said, \u201cMister, you\u2019ll never make it.\u201d And he didn\u2019t.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p7\" class=\"\">Recently I was impressed by a group of teenage Aaronic Priesthood holders who were assembled together with their bishops and advisers for an informal gospel discussion. It was a small, relaxed gathering, just to talk things over, to reason together. By the initial comments and greetings, it became obvious that each young man respected his bishop and had appreciation for the quorum advisers. It was also clear from their comments that they loved the Lord. But with all of this, there were still some who were struggling and wondering about a few things. Three main concerns came out of the discussion that morning. First, the question: \u201cWhy does life have to be so hard?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p8\" class=\"\">A little later, a boy about fifteen years of age, obviously worried about some mounting peer pressure at school, commented, \u201cI am not so sure it\u2019s worth it all.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p9\" class=\"\">And finally this\u2014they all wanted to know, \u201cHow can I be certain that the Church is true?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p10\" class=\"\">These questions are not new. They are as old as man. Nor are they reserved for just a few. I doubt that there is even one in this vast congregation that has not been faced with these same recurring questions through the years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p11\" class=\"\">Let\u2019s start with the first question about life being hard. I like what one of the seminary students said. He commented, \u201cLife here in mortality is no different from the explanation we received in the premortal existence.\u201d He went on, \u201cAccording to our Sunday School teacher, we shouted for joy and not only agreed to come to earth but literally clamored for the opportunity.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p12\" class=\"\">One of the advisers turned to a scripture to show how the Lord is always there to help us over the rough spots if we do our part.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p13\" class=\"\">He read: \u201cBehold, I stand at the door, and knock,\u201d said the Savior. \u201cIf any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42554\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42554)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42554)\">Rev. 3:20<\/a><\/span>). Did you catch the point, young men, that it is up to us to open the door? I think the Savior gives us another vital key as He declares, \u201cFor without me ye can do nothing\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29335\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29335)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29335)\">John 15:5<\/a><\/span>). That\u2019s powerful!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p14\" class=\"\">Remember the next comment? \u201cI am not sure if it is worth it all.\u201d One of the bishops was quick to ask this question: \u201cDo you think it would be worth it to some day become eligible to receive all that the Father has?\u201d He went on to remind us that to receive all that the Father has is the very essence of the oath and covenant of the priesthood. Let\u2019s reread together those words given us in the eighty-fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants with regard to that sacred obligation, an obligation that we all share alike. Please listen carefully. I\u2019m going to start with the thirty-third verse:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cFor whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified. \u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p16\" class=\"\">And then skipping down to the thirty-eighth verse:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father\u2019s kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18647\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18647)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18647)\">D&amp;C 84:33, 38\u201339<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p19\" class=\"\">My young friends, please realize that these conditions that we just read are set. They have all been affirmed. We have already had priesthood authority conferred upon us. The Lord has promised a guaranteed destiny for all who magnify that priesthood; and that destiny is eternal life, which, according to scripture, is the greatest of all the gifts (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18556\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18556)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18556)\">D&amp;C 14:7<\/a><\/span>). Because we have been ordained, we are on our way. Not only are we on our way, but it looks like we have reached the point of no return, for the Savior assures us that this is an oath and covenant of the Father \u201cwhich he cannot break, neither can it be moved\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18649\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18649)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18649)\">D&amp;C 84:40<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p20\" class=\"\">Let me interject an interesting little sidelight. As we read that last scripture concerning the oath and covenant that cannot be broken and neither can it be moved, one of the lads said, \u201cHey, where is my free agency in all of this?\u201d A boy who had just been ordained a priest then spoke up: \u201cWe exercised our free agency in the premortal existence; people agree to baptism before they are baptized; we choose to renew the baptismal covenant each week during the sacrament service; we agreed to the conditions of the priesthood during the bishop\u2019s interview. No,\u201d he concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t think our free agency has been violated.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p21\" class=\"\">He was right. There has not been a violation of our free agency.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p22\" class=\"\">I would hope that no one who has taken upon himself the sacred covenant of the priesthood would ever throw his hands up, walk away, and say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just too difficult.\u201d Nephi had problems galore: Laman, Lemuel, Laban, and so on down the list. But he realized in his hour of need that all the forces of heaven were available to him. Remember when he declared, \u201cI will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1879\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1879)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1879)\">1 Ne. 3:7<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p23\" class=\"\">At this point, one of the young deacons quipped, \u201cYeah, but Nephi didn\u2019t have to go to my school.\u201d He was telling us that his problem was just about as big as Nephi\u2019s but in a little different way. And he may be right, but the point is this: the Lord didn\u2019t forsake Nephi. He didn\u2019t forsake the Prophet Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail. And he won\u2019t forsake a boy with peer pressure at school or with any other problem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p24\" class=\"\">All of us who are to stand prepared for the great blessings associated with this priesthood authority that is ours must be sanctified from time to time by whatever process the Lord has in mind. Just as surely as we are assembled here, whether a General Authority, a bishop, an elder, a deacon, the process is exactly the same. We must try to understand that when adversity comes, it is likely a means of preparing us for something ahead. Yes, it\u2019s worth it. Believe me, young men, it\u2019s worth it all.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p25\" class=\"\">Now the third great question: \u201cHow can we be certain that the Church is true?\u201d Can anyone gain a so-called perfect testimony here in mortality? I think all of us here are still in the never-ending process of a developing testimony. Youth of Zion, forget about receiving a miracle, or the so-called sure sign from heaven. There are no shortcuts to eternity. Thus, extreme patience becomes another key factor as we develop our testimony over a lifetime. It is simply \u201cline upon line, precept upon precept; here a little, and there a little,\u201d just as the scriptures say (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18706\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18706)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18706)\">D&amp;C 128:21<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p26\" class=\"\">There are basic principles that never change in the development of a testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p27\" class=\"\">Let\u2019s use the Book of Mormon as an example. The great promise found in Moroni 10:4, [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38534\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38534)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38534)\">Moro. 10:4<\/a><\/span>] with which we are all familiar, states that we must read the book\u2014then ask Heavenly Father about it with a sincere heart, with faith in Christ.

First we must understand it through the scriptures and then we live it to the best of our ability; then we ask Heavenly Father with a sincere heart, with faith in Christ; then the truth of that principle will be manifest to us by the power of the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p29\" class=\"\">If you want to know the truth, you become informed, you be willing, and you be available.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p30\" class=\"\">Be informed about truth by reading the scriptures and by listening to inspired leaders.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p31\" class=\"\">Be willing to live that truth to the best of your ability.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p32\" class=\"\">And then be available to the gifts of the Spirit through your personal worthiness that you may be directed and that you may recognize the answer when it comes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/no-shortcuts.p33\" class=\"\">O youth of the noble birthright, you young men of a royal priesthood, become a modern-day Nephi in your faith.

And never forget this: anyone who has been foreordained as you have been, anyone who has been given the gift of the Holy Ghost as you have, and anyone who has had priesthood authority conferred upon him as you have, will surely find within his grasp the ability to acquire a strong testimony\u2014a testimony that should never stop growing.
