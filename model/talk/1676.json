Brown, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1969, pp. 33-36<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nA letter came to my desk yesterday addressed to me from some wonderful teenagers. I would\nlike to read just one line from that letter: \"We wish you the best of luck with your talk in\nconference, and hope that you will relate your address to us as young people in some way.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that my message may be related to the young people as well as the older people.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Widow's tithing<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe other day I received a telephone call from one of our bishops. He said his clerk had\nopened a donation envelope containing a cheek of many hundreds of dollars. It was from a\nyoung mother who had recently been widowed through an automobile accident. This was the\nsecond time she had been widowed, even though she was still a young woman. She had been\ninjured in the accident that took her husband's life, and had not yet completely recovered her\nhealth. She had a family of young children. The check represented a tithe on the insurance\nsettlement she had received from her husband's death. The clerk questioned the bishop,\nsuggesting she needed the money more than the Church, and asked if it would be proper to\nreturn the check to permit her to use the money for her own needs.\n<\/p><p>\nPerhaps many would ask the same question. May I suggest an answer by asking another\nquestion: What did this young mother need more than money? She needed a blessing, the\nkind money cannot buy, a blessing of peace and comfort, of assurance, of faith, of security.\nShe obviously was acquainted with this scripture: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove\nme now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and\npour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32809\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32809)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32809)\">Mal. 3:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYes, she was more than acquainted with this promise. She was converted. She accepted the\nLord at his word. Another scripture, I believe, had great meaning to her: \n<\/p><p>\n\"There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon\nwhich all blessings are predicated&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\n\"And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is\npredicated\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15455\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15455)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15455)\">D&amp;C 130:20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Principle of tithing<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTithing is not a new principle. We are told that tithing was practiced as early as Abraham's\ntime. The prophet Alma, in his discourses to his people, told them: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes; yea, even our father\nAbraham paid tithes of one-tenth part of all he possessed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9105\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9105)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9105)\">Alma 13:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe read in another sacred scripture what the Lord said to a modern-day prophet: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Verily, thus saith the Lord, I require all their surplus property to be put into the hands of the\nbishop of my church in Zion,\n<\/p><p>\n\"For the building of mine house, and for the laying of the foundation of Zion and for the\npriesthood, and for the debts of the Presidency of my Church.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And this shall be the beginning of the tithing of my people\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15444\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15444)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15444)\">D&amp;C 119:1-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis, then, was the beginning of tithing in our day. It is not expected that we now give all of\nour surplus. The Lord goes on to tell us what is expected of us now: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And after that, those who have thus been tithed shall pay one-tenth of all their interest\nannually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever, for my holy priesthood, saith the\nLord\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15445\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15445)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15445)\">D&amp;C 119:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>President Joseph F. Smith's explanation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMany ask what is one tenth of all our interest. Perhaps President Joseph F. Smith can help us\nunderstand. He said, among other things, as he delivered his concluding address in the closing\nsession of general conference April 9, 1899, in speaking of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice\nhis son Isaac on the altar: \n<\/p><p>\n\"He [meaning the Lord] wanted to put His servant to the test; to know whether he was willing\nto sacrifice himself or not in obedience to the requirements of heaven. That is what God\nwants in relation to this principle of tithing. He wants to know whether we will do our duty\nor not, and whether we will be honest or dishonest with Him. Every man is left to be his own\njudge as to what he calls his tithing, and there is a great variety of opinion as to what a\ntithing is.  A man who works for wages and devotes his whole time to the service of his\nemployer; and receives $1,000 or $2,000 a year for his salary, it is an easy matter for him to\ntell how much he owes for tithing. If I earned $2,000 a year, I should know that my tithing\nwas just one-tenth of that. And I would not take out what it had cost me to feed and clothe\nmyself and to pay all the expenses necessary to the maintenance of my family before I\nreckoned with the Lord as to what belonged to Him. Two hundred dollars would be my\nhonest tithing, would it not? That is the way I look at it.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe then goes on to discuss how a farmer might compute his tithing and how some people\nsubtract their living expenses, tithing only their net income. Then, continuing in the words of\nPresident Smith: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Now, you are at liberty to do as you please in regard to this matter. You can choose\nwhichever course you wish. But let me say to you that as we measure out, so will it be\nmeasured back unto us again (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35908\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35908)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35908)\">Matt. 7:2<\/a><\/span>).\nWhen we go to dickering with the Lord, probably He will\ndicker with us, and if He undertakes to do so, we shall get the worst of it\"\n(<i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1899, pp. 68-69).\n<\/p><p>\nAs President Smith tells us, the burden of responsibility as to whether or not we are full,\nhonest tithepayers rests squarely on our shoulders.  If it were not so, how could the Lord\nreally know of our true character and love for him?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Testimonies on tithepaying<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSometime ago a stake president bore his testimony to me regarding tithing. He said that\nduring World War II he had been a prisoner of war in China. He held the Aaronic Priesthood\nat that time. He promised the Lord he would pay his obligations to him for the rest of his life\nif only his life were spared. Upon release from the prison camp, he collected his accumulated\nmilitary pay, reported to his bishop, and paid tithing on all prior earnings. He then said, \"I\nhave paid ten percent on everything I have earned since, and I pay ten percent of that for fear\nI might have missed something.\"\n<\/p><p>\nA few years ago I was a counselor in a stake presidency. The stake president, in reviewing\nthe tithing record of ward and branch officers, noticed what appeared to be an excessively\nhigh tithe paid by a man of very humble circumstances. He was a wonderful\nSpanish-American brother who had a large family.  He was sustaining a son on a mission. His\nonly source of income was a small ditch-digging business.  Thinking that he might not\nunderstand the principle of tithing, we called him in to explain. At the conclusion of our\ndiscussion, he said: \"Yes, brethren, I understand; but, you see, the Lord has been so good to\nme and my family that I pay ten percent of the income of my business, not the money I take\nfrom it. You wouldn't deny me the blessing of trying to repay the Lord, would you?\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Lesson on tithing<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nPresident George Albert Smith teaches a very interesting and basic lesson on tithing in the\nstory of a generous man.  He tells us that a boyhood friend whom he had not seen for some\ntime accompanied him to a stake conference. Over the years his friend had achieved success\nin the financial world. As they were driving home, he turned to President Smith and said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"'You know, I have heard many things in this conference, but there is only one thing that I do\nnot understand the way you do.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"I said: 'What is it?'\n<\/p><p>\n\"'Well,' he said, 'it is about paying tithing.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"He thought I would ask him how he paid his tithing, but I did not. I thought if he wanted to\ntell me, he would. He said: 'Would you like me to tell you how I pay my tithing?'\n<\/p><p>\n\"I said, 'If you want to, you may.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"'Well,' he said, 'if I make ten thousand dollars in a year, I put a thousand dollars in the bank\nfor tithing. I know why it's there. Then when the bishop comes and wants me to make a\ncontribution for the chapel or give him a check for a missionary who is going away, if I think\nhe needs the money, I give him a check. If a family in the ward is in distress and needs coal\nor food or clothing or anything else, I write out a check. If I find a boy or a girl who is\nhaving difficulty getting through school in the East, I send a check. Little by little I exhaust\nthe thousand dollars, and every dollar of it has gone where I know it has done some good.\nNow, what do you think of that?'\n<\/p><p>\n\"'Well,' I said, 'do you want me to tell you what I think of it?'\n<\/p><p>\n\"He said, 'Yes.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"I said: 'I think you are a very generous man with someone else's property.' And he nearly\ntipped the car over.\n<\/p><p>\n\"He said, 'What do you mean?'\n<\/p><p>\n\"I said, 'You have an idea that you have paid your tithing?'\n<\/p><p>\n\"'Yes,' he said.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I said, 'You have not paid any tithing. You have told me what you have done with the\nLord's money, but you have not told me that you have given anyone a penny of your own.\nHe is the best partner you have in the world. He gives you everything you have, even the air\nyou breathe. He has said you should take one-tenth of what comes to you and give it to the\nChurch as directed by the Lord. You haven't done that; you have taken your best partner's\nmoney, and given it away.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well, I will tell you there was quiet in the car for some time. We rode on to Salt Lake City\nand talked about other things.\n<\/p><p>\n\"About a month after that I met him on the street. He came up, put his arm in mine, and said:\n'Brother Smith, I am paying my tithing the same way you do.' I was very happy to hear that.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Not long before he died, he came into my office to tell me what he was doing with his own\nmoney\" (George Albert Smith, <i>Sharing the Gospel with Others<\/i>, pp. 44-47).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The earth is the Lord's<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe psalmist has said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41897\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41897)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41897)\">Ps. 24:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAll he asks is that we return to him ten percent of that which is already his, adding that he\nwill open the windows of heaven and pour out blessings, that we shall not have room enough\nto receive them (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32810\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32810)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32810)\">Mal. 3:10<\/a><\/span>).\nIt is my witness, brethren and sisters, that this is a divine law and that many\nblessings from on high come through obedience to it, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
