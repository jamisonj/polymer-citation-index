We constantly hear the statements, \u201cIt\u2019s too hard,\u201d \u201cGive me something easier,\u201d \u201cI want it now,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t wait that long\u201d coming from our young people.

Points, rebounds, assists, tackles, goals, and home runs are all the result of long hours of painstaking practice and hard work. The bulk of that practice will always be on your own, away from the coach. Victory is brought to pass by one\u2019s personal diligence and commitment to hard work. The view of a champion, and the glory that surrounds him, must never be overshadowed by the long process of becoming one. There is a time of preparation and a time of victory.

Sitting in a home one night with two of our missionaries, the challenge was issued to a young investigator to begin reading the Book of Mormon. His answer overwhelmed us as he sat in his recliner sipping from a twelve-ounce container from the corner convenience store.

President Ezra Taft Benson gave us a powerful key in one of his addresses on missionary work: \u201cOne of the greatest secrets of missionary work is work! If a missionary works, he will get the Spirit; if he gets the Spirit, he will teach by the Spirit; and if he teaches by the Spirit, he will touch the hearts of the people and he will be happy.

Jack Demaree of the Montgomery Alabama Stake and many like him drove over two thousand miles round trip, using their vacation time to assist the hurricane victims. He brought back an article from a Florida newspaper: \u201cIn hot, humid conditions Saturday, about 12,000 volunteers\u2014including 9,000 Mormon church members from six states who brought chain saws, plywood and tar paper\u2014swarmed into South Florida. \u2026 So many people [were] at work that only two hundred showed up Saturday morning for an outdoor prayer service \u2026 despite the \u2026 prediction that more than 5,000 would attend.\u201d (Ocala, Florida, Sunday newspaper, 6 Sept. 1992.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-principle-of-work.p19\" class=\"\">In my conversation with Brother Demaree about his experience, he said, \u201cAll I did was cut up trees that were blown down by the hurricane.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-principle-of-work.p20\" class=\"\">Brethren, using that as an analogy, cutting trees is more important than thinking about cutting trees or planning to cut trees.
