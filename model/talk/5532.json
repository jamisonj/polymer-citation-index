I was born and reared in Missouri, where much of the early history of this church took place. But I had never heard anything about the Mormon church. I was looking for the truth, and although I had read the Bible and believed that Jesus Christ had lived on the earth and had been resurrected, yet I had so many unanswered questions\u2014questions such as: Why doesn\u2019t God speak to man today as he did anciently when the Bible was being written? How can Jesus be his own father and the Holy Ghost too? Why did Jesus have to be baptized when he had no sin? Where was I before I was born, and where do I go when I die? How can just believing in Christ save me when I haven\u2019t kept God\u2019s Ten Commandments?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/endure-to-the-end-in-charity.p8\" class=\"\">I knew there must be answers that I had not heard. The answers came when Elders Ted Raban and Ronald Flygare knocked on my door in San Diego, California, in July 1951. My wife, Connie, let them in and accepted a copy of the Book of Mormon from them. I was in Hawaii at the time, attending a fourteen-week training course preparatory to deployment to Korea.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/endure-to-the-end-in-charity.p9\" class=\"\">When I returned home, Connie gave me a copy of the Book of Mormon, and I began to read. I knew the book was true before I had finished 2 Nephi\u2014Nephi had converted one more\u2014and began to attend church in the old Valencia Park Ward in San Diego. Because of my preparation for deployment, I was not able to study and attend church as I wanted to and longed for the time when I could. The time came aboard the aircraft carrier <span class=\"emphasis\">Philippine Seas,<\/span> where I read fourteen of the best books that have ever been written. They included the standard works of the Church, plus the writings of each of the Presidents of the Church from Joseph Smith, Jr., to David O. McKay, plus Parley P. and Orson Pratt and a few others. I was like a starving man who had found food and drink for the first time. I loved it. When we arrived in Japan, the LDS group aboard ship decided I should be baptized. So we traveled to the Tokyo mission home, where I requested baptism. I was informed that I had not been an investigator for the required one-year time period; therefore, I could not be baptized. However, I persisted. I asked to be interviewed. The interview took an hour and a half, but in the end I received a recommend for baptism and confirmation. McDonald B. Johnson, the LDS group leader on the <span class=\"emphasis\">Philippine Seas,<\/span> baptized me, and Fred Gaylord Peterson confirmed me, and I became a member of the Church on 26 February 1952. I was ordained a deacon that day and subsequently to another office in the priesthood each time the ship returned to Japan, until, on 26 July 1952, I was ordained an elder and returned to San Diego in August, where my wife had been baptized on March 1 of that same year. We were a united family in the gospel of Jesus Christ and were looking forward with much anticipation to being sealed together with our three children in the Mesa Arizona temple, which happened in May 1953.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/endure-to-the-end-in-charity.p10\" class=\"\">Sixteen years after baptism, I was called by President David O. McKay to be a member of the First Council of the Seventy. That was in April of 1968. I was the first convert to be called as a General Authority since John Morgan, a period of eighty-six years. I have served in this capacity for twenty-six years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/endure-to-the-end-in-charity.p11\" class=\"\">I have found the gospel to be very simple but also very profound. Once we have sufficient faith in the Lord Jesus Christ that we believe he has paid for our sins, then we will repent. And no one truly repents until they believe in Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/endure-to-the-end-in-charity.p12\" class=\"\">You see, there is a difference between stopping sinning and repentance. In the first instance we are still guilty; in the second we are free of the sin and guilt. People stop sinning all the time because they are afraid they will get AIDS or die of lung cancer or some other reason, but they do not get rid of their sins. That can happen only when a nonmember follows Jesus Christ down into the waters of baptism, then comes forth and receives the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands by priesthood authority. That\u2019s how we get clean before the Lord (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20130\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20130)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20130)\">D&amp;C 84:74<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/endure-to-the-end-in-charity.p13\" class=\"\">Again, in the first instance, we are still <span class=\"emphasis\">in<\/span> our sins, but in the second instance, we are free <span class=\"emphasis\">from<\/span> our sins. The word of the Father to Nephi was \u201cRepent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son.\u201d Then Nephi reports he heard a voice from the Father saying, \u201cYea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4579\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4579)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4579)\">2 Ne. 31:11, 15<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/endure-to-the-end-in-charity.p14\" class=\"\">Then after baptism by the water and the Spirit, it appears that all the Father requires of us is that we endure to the end. What does that mean? I believe it means basically three things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/endure-to-the-end-in-charity.p15\" class=\"\">One: We must continue to repent for the rest of our lives because we will still make mistakes, and we must go home clean or we can\u2019t dwell with the Father and the Son (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20131\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20131)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20131)\">D&amp;C 84:74<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/endure-to-the-end-in-charity.p16\" class=\"\">Two: We must continue to forgive others. If we do not forgive others, we cannot obtain forgiveness ourselves (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20102\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20102)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20102)\">D&amp;C 64:9\u201310<\/a><\/span>). And three: Yes, we must be nice. If we\u2019re not nice, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to make it. In other words, we must have charity, which is really love plus sacrifice. We must serve our fellowmen, women, and children, and if we do all else but we do not serve the poor, the needy, the downtrodden, the oppressed, the sick and afflicted, both temporally and spiritually, according to their wants, we cannot retain a remission of our sins from day to day. Without serving others, we cannot \u201cwalk guiltless before God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40909\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40909)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40909)\">Mosiah 4:26<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/endure-to-the-end-in-charity.p17\" class=\"\">It is a fact that God is no respecter of persons. He loves all of his children, and I believe he loves them equally. Of course, he cannot bless his children if they do not keep his commandments, for he has said: \u201cThere is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> blessings are predicated\u2014<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/endure-to-the-end-in-charity.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when we obtain <span class=\"emphasis\">any<\/span> blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20216\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20216)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20216)\">D&amp;C 130:20\u201321<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/endure-to-the-end-in-charity.p19\" class=\"\">God tells us he cannot deny his words. Quite obviously, he is much more pleased with us when we keep his commandments, and he delights to bless us when we do. But if we do not keep his commandments, he will chasten us. It does not mean that he doesn\u2019t love us, any more than when parents discipline children. In fact, it is because he <span class=\"emphasis\">does<\/span> love us that he chastens us that we might learn obedience (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24592\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24592)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24592)\">Heb. 12:6<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20152\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20152)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20152)\">D&amp;C 95:1<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/endure-to-the-end-in-charity.p20\" class=\"\">Then to walk guiltless before God, we must love and serve others.
