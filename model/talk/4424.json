Who will love them enough to teach them faith and moral values? They must learn so much more than survival and self-gratification. There is such a great need for the teaching of the heart and not enough of the civilizing part of education. Where will children learn virtue? Who will care for them enough to mold their moral character? How can they become humane, kind, and happy and make life richer for themselves and others?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/will-i-be-happy.p7\" class=\"\">This teaching of the next generation is not easy in a society where many fundamental beliefs are disappearing. Deadly mass marketing challenges almost every cherished human value. Excessive permissiveness under the banner of individual freedom is one driving force behind this. Reaching a public consensus on what values should be taught to the next generation is almost impossible. People strongly disagree about almost everything. Social restraints are weakened.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/will-i-be-happy.p8\" class=\"\">This means we will have to teach our children a life-style of our own and provide moral anchors in the sea of self-indulgence, self-interest, and self-service in which they float.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/will-i-be-happy.p9\" class=\"\">How can this tide of wrong values be reversed?

The deadly scourges that are epidemic all over the world have flourished in the context of this popular notion. But this is simply not true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/will-i-be-happy.p12\" class=\"\">All immoral behavior directly impacts society. Even innocent people are affected. Drug and alcohol abuse have public consequences, as do illegitimacy, pornography, and obscenity. The public cost in human life and tax dollars for these so-called private choices is enormous: poverty, crime, a less-educated work force, and mounting demands for government spending to fix problems that cannot be fixed by money. It simply is not true that our private conduct is our own business. Our society is the sum total of what millions of individuals do in their private lives. That sum total of private behavior has worldwide public consequences of enormous magnitude. There are no completely private choices.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/will-i-be-happy.p13\" class=\"\">Second, adults and children need to know that public and private morality is not outmoded. We need to love our children enough to teach them that laws, policies, and public programs with a moral and ethical basis are necessary for the preservation of a peaceful, productive, compassionate, and happy society. Without the qualities and characteristics of integrity, honesty, commitment, loyalty, respect for others, fidelity, and virtue, a free and open society cannot endure.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/will-i-be-happy.p14\" class=\"\">Elder Dallin H. Oaks recently responded to those who say, \u201cDon\u2019t legislate morality.\u201d Said Elder Oaks: \u201cI suppose persons who mouth that familiar slogan think they are saying something profound. In fact, if that is an argument at all, it is so superficial that an educated person should be ashamed to use it. As should be evident to every thinking person, a high proportion of all legislation has a moral base. That is true of the criminal law, most of the laws regulating family relations, businesses, and commercial transactions, many of the laws governing property, and a host of others\u201d (\u201cGambling\u2014Morally Wrong and Politically Unwise,\u201d transcript of an address given at Ricks College, 6 Jan. 1987, p. 20).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/will-i-be-happy.p15\" class=\"\">Until recently, ethics and moral philosophy were the foundation of higher education. They were a legacy passed from generation to generation. Those values are as relevant today as when they were taught by Aristotle. Said he, \u201cMan perfected by society is the best of all animals; he is the most terrible of all when he lives without law, and without justice\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Politics,<\/span> 1.1253a, 31\u201334). Therefore, public and private morality need much greater emphasis everywhere.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/will-i-be-happy.p16\" class=\"\">The third, and most important, way to prepare our children for some lasting happiness is to fortify the family. For centuries the family was the bedrock of this and many other nations. It was the glue that held society together. Now many families are in trouble, and the glue is coming unstuck. As a result, many children are bewildered: they are growing physically but lack the support system, the disciplined moral framework, and the love and understanding that a strong family can provide.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/will-i-be-happy.p17\" class=\"\">It is in a home and with a family that values are usually acquired, traditions are fostered, and commitments to others are established. There are really no adequate substitutes. Church, school, and government programs can only reinforce and supplement that which is acquired at home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/will-i-be-happy.p18\" class=\"\">To strengthen the family, the morals of human sexuality need to be restored. Bryce Christensen recently wrote, \u201cChildren who have watched parents treat one another with affection and courtesy already understand more about the relationship between the sexes than they will ever learn from any class in reproductive physiology\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Family in America,<\/span> Mar. 1987, 1:3).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/will-i-be-happy.p19\" class=\"\">By the word of the Lord, all men and women are to practice chastity before marriage and fidelity after marriage. \u201cThou shalt not commit adultery,\u201d said the Lord (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22962\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22962)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22962)\">Ex. 20:14<\/a><\/span>), \u201cnor do anything like unto it\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18617\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18617)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18617)\">D&amp;C 59:6<\/a><\/span>).

That fabric, of course, is the family. These so-called alternative life-styles cannot be accepted as right because they frustrate God\u2019s commandment for a life-giving union of male and female within a legal marriage (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"23998\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23998)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23998)\">Gen. 1:28<\/a><\/span>).

At home, in the warm security of discipline and love, we learn the values that never change.

An awakening of faith and belief in religious values is essential. Family teachings are encouraged by the Church, and the Church, in turn, through its covenants and ordinances, unifies the eternal family. Our temples are testaments of our faith in the everlasting family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/will-i-be-happy.p24\" class=\"\">Some say families can\u2019t do the job because so many people just do not have families. It is true that a great many do not have a functioning family. Or it is said that too many families fail. Unfortunately, that is also true. However, with all its shortcomings, the family is far and away the greatest social unit, the best answer to human problems, in the history of mankind. Rather than further weaken family ties, they need to be strengthened. To aid parents, the Church has available a thoughtful booklet, <span class=\"emphasis\">A Parent\u2019s Guide<\/span> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1985). I would urge overburdened parents to accept every help.

It is a fabric of helping hands and good neighbors; bedtime stories and shared prayers; loving-packed lunchboxes and household budget balancing; tears wiped away and a precious heritage passed along; it is hard work and a little put away for the future. In a healthy society, heroes are the men, women, children who hold the world together one home at a time; the parents and grandparents who forgo pleasures, delay purchases, foreclose options, and commit most of their lives to the noblest undertaking of citizenship; raising children who, resting on the shoulders of the previous generation, will see farther than we and reach higher\u201d (pp. 8\u20139).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/will-i-be-happy.p30\" class=\"\">Troubled as many homes may be in our society, we cannot abandon the home as the primary teacher of moral values.
