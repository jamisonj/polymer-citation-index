By this same pattern, our moral discipline is rooted in loyalty and devotion to the Father and the Son. It is the gospel of Jesus Christ that provides the moral certainty upon which moral discipline rests.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/moral-discipline.p14\" class=\"\">The societies in which many of us live have for more than a generation failed to foster moral discipline. They have taught that truth is relative and that everyone decides for himself or herself what is right.

My mother discovered me with the chocolate evidence smeared on my face and escorted me back to the grocery store. As we crossed the street, I was sure I was facing life imprisonment.

Faust cautioned: \u201cThere is a great risk in justifying what we do individually and professionally on the basis of what is \u2018legal\u2019 rather than what is \u2018right.\u2019 In so doing, we put our very souls at risk. The philosophy that what is legal is also right will rob us of what is highest and best in our nature. What conduct is actually legal is, in many instances, way below the standards of a civilized society and light years below the teachings of the Christ. If you accept what is legal as your standard of personal or professional conduct, you will deny yourself of that which is truly noble in your personal dignity and worth\u201d (\u201cBe Healers,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Clark Memorandum,<\/span> spring 2003, 3).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-04211_000_036\"><a name=\"-04211_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-04211_000_036\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cBishop Fulton John Sheen Makes a Wartime Plea,\u201d in William Safire, sel., <span class=\"emphasis\">Lend Me Your Ears: Great Speeches in History,<\/span> rev. ed.
