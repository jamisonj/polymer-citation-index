There is one passage of Scripture I would like very much to take as a text, if I knew where to find it. It is somewhere in the book of Jeremiah or Ezekiel. I have not time now to look it up, and perhaps it would be better to take some other text having a bearing on the same subject. The text to which I would like to direct the attention of the people has reference to the colonization of this country by one of the descendants of Zedekiah, king of Judah. It reads something like this: &#x201C;Thus saith the Lord God; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"178b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD15\/JoD15_0178.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;178b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/5733\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> mountain and eminent: In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"60754\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 60754)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(60754)\">Ezek. 17:22-23<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v15n645\"> We read of the fulfillment of this prophecy in the Book of Mormon; but because I cannot direct your attention to the passage, I will read another text, which will be found in the 11th verse of the 85th Psalm: &#x201C;Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"56967\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 56967)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(56967)\">Ps. 85:11<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v15n646\"> Forty-five years ago this morning this prophecy, so far as it relates to &#x201C;truth springing out of the earth,&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"56968\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 56968)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(56968)\">Ps. 85:11<\/a><\/span> was fulfilled.

He was almost too young to be a brazen-faced impostor, was he not? Cast your eyes around on this congregation for the youth of fifteen, and see if you think it would be possible for one of that early age to become one of the most barefaced impostors that the world ever heard of,  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"181a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD15\/JoD15_0181.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;181a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/5730\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>for Joseph Smith was thus regarded by the world at large with few exceptions; and he must have been so, at a very early age, if this work be not true, for he could not be deceived, himself, in relation to it. There was no possible chance for any deception, so far as he himself was concerned. Why? Because the circumstances were of such a nature that he could not be deceived. God revealed to him that there were certain plates deposited about three miles from his father's house. He saw, in vision, the place of their deposit.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"93848\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 93848)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(93848)\">JS&mdash;H 1:42<\/a><\/span> He heard the holy angel declare to him in relation to these records.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"93824\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 93824)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(93824)\">JS&mdash;H 1:34-35<\/a><\/span> But first, about four years prior to this, the first vision that he had was in answer to prayer. Being but a youth, and anxious for the salvation of his soul, he secretly prayed, in the wilderness, that the Lord would show unto him what he should do, what church he should join. The Lord heard and answered this prayer. Do not be astonished, good Christians, because the Lord hears prayer in the 19th century. I know it is very popular to pray to the Lord in Christendom; but, when you talk about the Lord answering prayers, by giving revelations, visions, or sending angels, it is very unpopular. But unpopular as it was, this youth ventured to go and ask the Lord for wisdom, having, in the first place, read a passage in the New Testament, which says, &#x201C;If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given unto him.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"77423\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 77423)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(77423)\">James 1:5<\/a><\/span> Joseph Smith was not so full of tradition that he could not lay hold of this promise.

When he brings forth the record of the tribe of Joseph&#x2014;his sacred writing and puts it with the record of the Jews&#x2014;the Bible then and not till then may we look for the restitution of the house of Israel; and not even then, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v15n698\"> Now let me say a few words about the times of the Gentiles.

I answer, by sending forth to them the stick of Joseph, written upon for Joseph, in connection with the Bible, by his servants who go forth to the nations of the earth. They will proclaim to all people, nations and tongues, to the Gentiles first, the fullness of the Gospel of the Son of God, contained in these two records.
