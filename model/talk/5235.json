Ann and her children took up their load and struggled on with the company, while Robert retraced the miles of \u2026 trail, calling, and searching and praying for his helpless little son.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p12\" class=\"\">One suspects that he did not just casually look behind a few trees or leisurely walk along the trail, but that he vigorously investigated every thicket, every clump of trees and gully or wash.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cAt last he reached a \u2026 trading station where he learned that his child had been found and cared for by a woodsman and his wife.

A casual, infrequent exposure to the scriptures will generally not open the door to the whisperings of the Spirit or provide insights into the Savior\u2019s life and character. We need to search the scriptures with the same vigor that Robert hunted for his son and with the consistency of the mother searching the horizon if we expect to hear his voice and know his words. President Howard W.

The prophet Lehi and his family had traveled from Jerusalem to the borders of the Red Sea and then a further three days\u2019 journey into the wilderness when the Lord reminded Lehi that he was spiritually unarmed. The family, in their haste to leave Jerusalem, had not taken the scriptures with them.

After considerable difficulty and time, the sons returned to the father\u2019s tent with the plates. After giving thanks to the Lord for the safe return of the sons, the Book of Mormon states that they \u201csearched [the plates] and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2016\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2016)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2016)\">1 Ne. 5:21<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p19\" class=\"\">The plates of brass coupled with their own records allowed the family to pass the words of the Lord from one generation to the next.

As a person studies the words of the Lord and obeys them, he or she draws closer to the Savior and obtains a greater desire to live a righteous life.

He saw mists of darkness on the path, which caused some to lose their way and wander off. Others reached the tree by holding to the rod, but then became ashamed, let go of the rod of iron, and fell away. According to the vision, the only way to reach the tree and become a permanent partaker of the fruit was to \u201ccontinually [hold] fast\u201d to the iron rod.

Alma, however, changes the imagery in an interesting way. He likens the word of God to a seed which is planted in the heart and then nourished. He states that if people will no more than desire to believe in Christ, the seed will sprout and grow, and they will feel a swelling inside as the seed enlarges the soul. The desire to believe, coupled with obedience, eventually turns to faith in Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p25\" class=\"\">Alma states that continued nourishment will cause the seed to grow into the tree of life with fruit that is exceedingly white, sweet, and pure\u2014\u201ca tree springing up unto everlasting life.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9937\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9937)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9937)\">Alma 32:26\u201342<\/a><\/span>.)
