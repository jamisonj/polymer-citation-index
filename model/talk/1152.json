Wirthlin, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1961, pp. 14-16<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nPresident McKay, my beloved brethren and sisters, I am more than grateful for the privilege\nof expressing to you my heartfelt appreciation. As I meet the members of the Church in the\nvarious stakes, I am meeting with my brethren and sisters, for we are brethren and sisters. I\nthink of our Older Brother Jesus Christ the Son of God. It is a wonderful thing to know that\nwe are all brethren and sisters and, above all, that we are the sons and daughters of our\nHeavenly Father, and also that Jesus Christ is our Older Brother.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to bear testimony to you that I know that Joseph Smith was a Prophet. There is no\nquestion about that in my mind. I am so grateful that in my own soul I can bear that\ntestimony without any hesitation whatsoever. It was necessary for the world to have a prophet\nthat the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ in its fulness might be available to the sons and\ndaughters of our Heavenly Father. Joseph Smith was a Prophet, and those who have followed\nhim are also prophets, every one of them. President McKay is a prophet, a seer, and a\nrevelator, brethren and sisters. That is my testimony to you this morning.\n<\/p><p>\nI think of the marvelous revelation given by the Lord to the Prophet Joseph in the\neighty-eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14019\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14019)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14019)\">D&amp;C 88:1-141<\/a><\/span>). I suggest that you read it in your homes\nwith your sons and daughters. It is called the Olive Leaf, and it states that the light of truth is\nthe light of Christ (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14020\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14020)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14020)\">D&amp;C 88:6-7<\/a><\/span>).\nIf the whole world could accept Jesus Christ as the Son of God, there is\nno question but that many of the problems which now exist could be solved, and out of it we\nwould have peace and good will. In the final analysis, the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints has the responsibility of teaching to the world that Jesus Christ is the Son of\nGod.\n<\/p><p>\nAt some future time, the missionaries and representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ are\ngoing to have the opportunity to preach the gospel to the Russian people. Just how it shall\nhappen or what will bring it about, I cannot tell you. But in the main, the Russian people are\na good people. When the Lord makes it possible for missionaries to go into that area and\npreach the gospel, literally millions of them will accept it, and that same feeling of the light\nof truth, the light of Christ, will come to them.\n<\/p><p>\nIt does not only mean to the people in Russia, but it also means to the people in China where\nthere are literally millions and millions of the Lord's sons and daughters who do not know\nthat Jesus Christ existed. But in the way of the Lord, the missionaries somehow are going to\npreach the gospel to the people in China.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat I say about China is equally true with reference to India. I recall an experience which I\nhad this past summer with an individual from India who had spent some time at Brigham\nYoung University. He came to our offices, and I had the privilege of meeting him. He\nindicated to me that he had read the Book of Mormon. I asked him the question, \"Do you\nbelieve the Book of Mormon is true, that it is the real history of America?\" He said, \"Yes, I\naccept it.\" I said, \"Then, if you accept the Book of Mormon, you, no doubt, have given some\nconsideration to Christ and Joseph Smith.\" He said, \"I have done that. Joseph Smith is a\nprophet.\" I made clear to him that we had another prophet with the same authority, with the\nsame rights to divine guidance as existed in the days of Joseph Smith, namely, President\nMcKay. He said, \"I hope the time will come when you will send your missionaries into India.\nI am satisfied that our people are now waiting for something different, something else,\nsomething they do not have.\" President McKay, I am sure that some day the missionaries will\ngo into India and preach the gospel to the millions and millions of individuals who do not\nknow very much about Christ and never will know until we have the opportunity to teach\nthem the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord said in the eighty-eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants to search for the\ntruth through study and prayer (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14023\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14023)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14023)\">D&amp;C 88:118<\/a><\/span>).\nI am sure that every convert of the Church accepts the gospel\nof the Lord Jesus Christ through study and prayer. Prayer is most important to converts.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord said to us: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep\nlonger than is needful, retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your\nbodies and your minds may be invigorated.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And above all things, clothe yourselves with the bond of charity, as with a mantle, which is\nthe bond of perfectness and peace\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14026\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14026)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14026)\">D&amp;C 88:124-125<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI have thought of this wonderful statement many times in that marvelous revelation: \"Cease to\nbe idle.\" The membership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, brethren and\nsisters, do not have time to be idle. It is wonderful that in this great organization every man\nand every woman and every child, regardless of age, has something to do. That is the great\nfundamental difference between the Church of Jesus Christ and the churches of the world.\n\"Cease to be idle.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe must set the proper example to the people of America. We cannot afford to have idle\npeople. Every American ought to have something to do. This will protect him against the\npower of the evil one, Satan.\n<\/p><p>\nI think of certain organizations which give individuals the right to work only for a short time.\nSome of them advocate only four or five days a week. That is contrary to the mind and will\nof our Heavenly Father. The Lord set us a proper example when he said, \"Six days shalt thou\nlabour, and do all thy work\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22688\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22688)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22688)\">Ex. 20:9<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd what is the seventh day to be? The seventh\nday is the day when we worship the Lord, when we meet our assignments in connection with\nthe Church and, above all, have the opportunity of attending Sacrament meeting, the most\nimportant meeting of the whole week. It is my prayer that the attendance at\nour Sacrament meeting will be one hundred percent. I hope that in America we will not have\nthe experience that I had in Germany in 1914 while preaching the gospel to the German\npeople. I passed a great cathedral each weekend. One morning I went inside. It was beautiful,\nand I also noticed that there were four people in the attitude of prayer. The next week\nsomething happened to Germany. What was it? Germany was at war with France, England,\nand Russia. Again I went back and found the cathedral was filled to capacity with as many\npeople outside as there were inside. They had all gone there for one purpose only: to pray to\nthe Lord that their husbands and their sons and those who were on the front fighting for\nGermany might be protected.\n<\/p><p>\nI hope that in America we are not going to be forced to pray because of difficulties and\npossibilities of war, but we are going to be a prayerful people and recognize that God lives\nand that Jesus Christ is his Son.\n<\/p><p>\nIn this marvelous revelation I have just read to you\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14025\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14025)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14025)\">D&amp;C 88:124<\/a><\/span>), the Lord not only said, \"Cease to be\nidle,\" but he also said, \"cease to be unclean.\" I hope and pray with all my heart that\nAmerica will be a clean nation.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord also said, \". . . cease to find fault one with another.\" In every Latter-day Saint\nhome care should be taken when a father criticizes a son or a son is critical of a father or\nwhen a mother is critical of her daughter or a daughter is critical of her mother; it brings into\nthe home the power of the evil one, and the Spirit of the Lord will not dwell there.\nFaultfinding should be eliminated in the family relationship.\n<\/p><p>\nAgain it states, \". . . cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may\nnot be weary.\" Much could be said about this. Youth must have its recreation, we will all\nadmit, but the right kind of recreation is going to be that which is under the direction of the\npriesthood. We have these wonderful buildings, these recreation halls, where the right kind of\nrecreation is available, and where these events will start at such a time that youth may return\nhome by at least twelve o'clock. After twelve o'clock is when the power of the evil one\novertakes youth and others. We should see to it that they retire to their beds early that when\nthey get up in the morning they are not weary. That means much to youth, particularly those\nwho are attending school, for out of the strength they have mentally and physically, they are\nable to meet the assignments that may be given to them by their instructors. The promise is\ngiven, \". . . arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.\"\n<\/p><p>\nPrayer is also mentioned when the head of the family, who does or does not hold the\nMelchizedek Priesthood, can call his wife, his sons and his daughters in the morning hours to\nask the Lord for divine guidance in whatever their assignments might be. Then as the night\nhours come on, they can talk to that same Lord and extend gratitude and thanks for the many\nblessings they enjoy. \"Pray always, that ye might not faint, until I come. Behold, and lo, I\nwill come quickly, and receive you unto myself. Amen\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14027\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14027)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14027)\">D&amp;C 88:126<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLet us read the eighty-eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants. It is a marvelous\nrevelation. We need it brethren and sisters. We have problems, and we will continue to have\nthem, and the Lord has always given us information and divine guidance to solve them\nthrough these instructions.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray the Lord to bless you all in your endeavors to guide and direct you that we may enjoy\nthe divine guidance of our Heavenly Father, which I pray will be the blessing of each and\nevery one of us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
