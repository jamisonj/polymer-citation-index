We have been well taught. I commend the presidency on their excellent remarks. You may know that they have worried and prayed and pleaded with the Lord to help them in their preparation and in their presentation. We are all indebted to you, Sister Smoot, Sister Jensen, Sister Dew. You\u2019ve done a great work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p6\" class=\"\">I count it a precious opportunity to speak to you. There is no other congregation like this congregation. We speak from the Tabernacle on Temple Square in Salt Lake City. But you hear from almost everywhere. You are gathered across the United States and Canada, across the nations of Europe, and Mexico, Central America, and South America. You are as one in this great gathering even though you are in Asia, the South Pacific, and in other distant lands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p7\" class=\"\">Your hearts are all of one kind. You are gathered together because you love the Lord. You have a testimony and conviction concerning His living reality. You pray unto the Father in Jesus\u2019 name. You understand the efficacy of prayer. You are wives and mothers. You are widows and single mothers carrying very heavy burdens. You are newly married women, and you are women who have not married. You are a vast concourse of women of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You belong to this great organization, more than four million of you. No one can calculate the tremendous force for good that you can become. You are the keepers of the hearth. You are the managers of the home. Along with Sister Dew, I charge you to stand tall and be strong in defense of those great virtues which have been the backbone of our social progress. When you are united, your power is limitless. You can accomplish anything you wish to accomplish. And oh, how very, very great is the need for you in a world of crumbling values where the adversary seems so very much to be in control.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p8\" class=\"\">I have great respect and admiration for you young women who have come into the Society rather recently. You have largely weathered the storm that beat about you in your youth. You have kept yourself unsullied from the world. You have kept yourself free from the taints and stains of unrighteousness. You are the very flower of the good, maturing youth of the Church. You have made it thus far, clean and beautiful and virtuous. I compliment you most warmly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p9\" class=\"\">I commend you women who are single. You have known much of loneliness. You have known anxiety and fear and desperate longing. But you have not let this overcome you. You have gone forward with your lives, making significant and wonderful contributions along the way. God bless you, my dear sisters and friends.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p10\" class=\"\">Tonight I cannot talk directly to all of you. I have singled out one segment of this vast congregation, and that is you who are mothers. I might include those who will become mothers. What a wonderful thing you have done as mothers. You have given birth and nurtured children. You have entered into a partnership with our Father in Heaven to give mortal experience to His sons and daughters. They are His children and they are your children, flesh of your flesh, for whom He will hold you responsible. You have rejoiced over them, and in many cases you have sorrowed. They have brought you happiness as no one else could. They have brought you pain as none other could.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p11\" class=\"\">By and large, you have done a remarkable job in rearing them. I have said many times that I believe we have the finest generation of young people that this Church has ever known. They are better educated; they are better motivated; they know the scriptures; they live the Word of Wisdom; they pay their tithing; they pray. They try to do the right thing. They are bright and able, clean and fresh, attractive and smart. These are very substantial in number. More of them go on missions than ever before. More of them marry in the temple. They know what the gospel is about, and they are trying to live it, looking to the Lord for His guidance and help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p12\" class=\"\">But I regret to say that so many of our young people fall between the cracks. They try one foolish thing after another, never evidently satisfied, until they are pulled down into a pit from which they cannot extricate themselves. Some of our own are among these, and it is you mothers who bear the burden of sorrow that flows therefrom. They are your sons and daughters. And so tonight with the hope that I may be helpful, I plead with you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p13\" class=\"\">In some cases it may be too late, but in most cases you still have the opportunity to guide and persuade, to teach with love, to lead in paths that are fruitful and productive and away from those dead-end situations which bring no good.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p14\" class=\"\">You have nothing in this world more precious than your children. When you grow old, when your hair turns white and your body grows weary, when you are prone to sit in a rocker and meditate on the things of your life, nothing will be so important as the question of how your children have turned out. It will not be the money you have made. It will not be the cars you have owned. It will not be the large house in which you live. The searing question that will cross your mind again and again will be, <span class=\"emphasis\">How well have my children done?<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p15\" class=\"\">If the answer is that they have done very well, then your happiness will be complete. If they have done less than well, then no other satisfaction can compensate for your loss.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p16\" class=\"\">And so I plead with you tonight, my dear sisters. Sit down and quietly count the debits and the credits in your role as a mother. It is not too late. When all else fails, there is prayer and the promised help of the Lord to assist you in your trials. But do not delay. Start now, whether your child be six or 16.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p17\" class=\"\">I am told that there was recently held in this area a great gathering which attracted 10,000 young people. I am satisfied that some of those young people were our own.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p18\" class=\"\">It is reported that the acts of that evening\u2019s entertainment were lewd and evil. They were loathsome and downgrading. They were representative of the foulest aspects of life. There was no beauty in them. There was only ugliness and depravity. It was sleaze in its worst form.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p19\" class=\"\">These young people paid from $35 to $50 admission. In many cases that money came from their parents. Similar things are going on across the world. Some of your sons and daughters make it possible for the promoters of such filth to prosper in their evil undertakings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p20\" class=\"\">Last Sunday the <span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News<\/span> carried a detailed feature story on underground drug parties that go by the name of Rave. They run from 3:00 until 7:30 of a Sunday morning. Here young men and women, in their late teens to early 20s, dance to the metallic beat of so-called music pouring forth from stacks of amplifiers. \u201cSome are wearing brightly colored beads; others are waving glow sticks. Some have pacifiers in their mouths, while others are wearing painter\u2019s masks\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News,<\/span> 17 Sept. 2000, B1).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p21\" class=\"\">Drugs go back and forth from sellers to users at $20 to $25 a pill.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p22\" class=\"\">I know of no better answer to these foul practices that confront our young people than the teachings of a mother, given in love with an unmistakable warning. There will be failures, yes. There will be heartbreaking disappointments. There will be tragedies, bleak and hopeless. But in very many cases, if the process begins early and continues there will be success and happiness and love and much of gratitude. Opening your purse and handing a son or daughter money before you rush off to work will not do. It may only lead to more evil practice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p23\" class=\"\">The proverb spoken of old said, \u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41357\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41357)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41357)\">Prov. 22:6<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p24\" class=\"\">Another wise saying reads, \u201cAs the twig is bent, so the tree\u2019s inclined\u201d (Alexander Pope, <span class=\"emphasis\">Moral Essays,<\/span> vol. 2 of <span class=\"emphasis\">The Works of Alexander Pope, Esq.,<\/span> \u201cEpistle I: To Sir Richard Temple, Lord Cobham\u201d [1776], 119; line 150).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/your-greatest-challenge-mother.p25\" class=\"\">Teach your children when they are very young and small, and never quit.

He spoke of an Indian boy who climbed a high mountain. It was cold up there. At his feet was a snake, a rattlesnake.
