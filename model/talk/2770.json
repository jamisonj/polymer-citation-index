It is the precious privilege of Latter-day Saints to live, meet, and worship in the name of the Savior of mankind, and to enjoy his sustaining and regenerating spirit in every facet and dimension of their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p4\" class=\"\">Since last October, Sister Wirthlin and I have traveled many thousands of miles over central Europe, Scandinavia, and Finland, working with the eleven mission presidents and the eight stake presidents who preside in those areas. Here we have learned to know over 1,500 missionaries who radiate and communicate the reality of the truth that Jesus is in their midst. They have asked me to express their great love and appreciation for you at home. If you could hear them bear their testimonies, you would literally tingle with enthusiasm and love for the gospel truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p5\" class=\"\">Neither must we neglect to mention our servicemen in Europe. To most of them the gospel of Jesus Christ means everything. They have caught the spirit that is present where and when \u201ctwo or three are gathered together\u201d in the name of the Master. What the gospel does for them is tremendously and unbelievably wonderful! These young men and their families are a tribute to the Church\u2014an inspirational force. They are among the most devoted of all our members. They have donated thousands of dollars and incalculable time and effort toward the building of chapels in Europe\u2014chapels that most of them may never see, since they most likely will be gone home or elsewhere before the chapels are built and dedicated. The crowning glory of the work of the kingdom in Europe, however, is the thousands of faithful members who work tirelessly and joyfully both to live the gospel and to share it with others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p6\" class=\"\">The charge and the responsibility these unselfishly committed saints have taken upon themselves have evolved as portrayed in a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith to James Covill, who had been a Baptist minister for forty years. The first step in the process of becoming a Latter-day Saint, Brother Covill was told, as recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants, is truly to accept the gospel, of which the Lord says, \u201cAnd this is my gospel\u2014repentance and baptism by water, and then cometh the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which showeth all things, and teacheth the peaceable things of the kingdom.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16648\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16648)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16648)\">D&amp;C 39:6<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p7\" class=\"\">Following his acceptance of the gospel, Brother Covill was charged to do what is the uncompromising obligation of all of us today. For the Lord says, \u201cAnd if thou do this, I have prepared thee for a greater work. Thou shalt preach the fulness of my gospel, which I have sent forth in these last days, the covenant which I have sent forth to recover my people, which are of the house of Israel.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16650\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16650)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16650)\">D&amp;C 39:11<\/a><\/span>.)

What is said here to James Covill in this dispensation, when the Church was only nine months old, applies with equal force to us now\u2014and is a remarkable and powerful reiteration of the promise made by the Savior during his earthly ministry. His pledge that he will be in our midst when two or three are gathered together in his name is a wonderful declaration of his unbounded love for each of us and assures us of his presence in our church services, in our individual lives, and in the intimate circles of our families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p8\" class=\"\">What I mean when I say Jesus meant his presence to be felt in the intimate circle of each of our families may be depicted in the lives of two sisters, friends of ours, who live in two widely separated stakes. One sister married out of the Church. She had hoped to convert her husband and then be married and sealed in the temple. She had developed one of the most lovely and spiritual personalities. Her husband, however, has never caught the spirit nor acknowledged the truth of the gospel and has been a passive influence in the religious life of his family. Nevertheless, this sister set a beautiful example for her family and drew the children to accompany her in the performance of their church duties and responsibilities. She and the children, despite what could have been a ready excuse for neglect and indifference, exemplified the admonition of Jesus when he said, \u201cLet your light so shine before men, that [others] may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36429\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36429)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36429)\">Matt. 5:16<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p9\" class=\"\">The second sister married a fine man who was a faithful Latter-day Saint. As the years sped by, they carelessly omitted what they had at first intended conscientiously to do\u2014worship together in the name of Jesus that he might be in the midst of their family activities. Although always admiring the Church and its principles, they had forgotten that they were now in fact the salt of the earth that had \u201clost its savor.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36427\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36427)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36427)\">Matt. 5:13<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p10\" class=\"\">In a conversation about their children, the second sister said to the first, \u201cWhy have your children turned out so well and why are they so active in the Church despite the fact that you married out of the Church?\u201d The first sister replied, \u201cI took my children with me to Sunday School and sacrament meeting.\u201d Surprised, the second sister said, \u201cI <span class=\"emphasis\">sent<\/span> mine.\u201d And the first sister answered with greater emphasis, \u201cBut I <span class=\"emphasis\">took<\/span> mine!\u201d Hers was a case, as Jesus said, of \u201cwhere two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them,\u201d and this can be true for all of us wherever we may be, at home or elsewhere.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p11\" class=\"\">On another occasion Jesus said, \u201cI stand at the door, and knock.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42489\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42489)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42489)\">Rev. 3:20<\/a><\/span>.) Unless we open the door and permit him to come into our lives, he can\u2019t enter into our midst. Mere knowledge in itself may be, but it is not necessarily, power. Knowledge is not motivation. Neither is logic. That the springs of human action are inherently in the feelings, not the intellect, and that conduct generates feeling are set forth in the Doctrine and Covenants in these words: \u201cAnd whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16731\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16731)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16731)\">D&amp;C 84:88<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p12\" class=\"\">Only in accepting our Savior and doing his will do we acquire the \u201cfeeling to do right.\u201d If we break the commandments, we get a \u201cfeeling\u201d for that too. This explains why parents\u2019 hearts may be broken and bowed in shame because of the sins and waywardness of their sons and daughters. They are puzzled and perplexed. They say, \u201cWe brought them up to be righteous boys and girls, and our family has always been a good family. We didn\u2019t teach them to behave like this!\u201d The children learned all the precepts, but precepts do not necessarily furnish the will and desire to do right. Indeed, ignorance is not the only cause of sin and deplorable conduct. Fundamental to most wrongdoing is lack of desire, the absence of a strong motive or the right influence, and a deficiency in living the precepts. Individuals who do right and \u201chunger and thirst after righteousness\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36424\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36424)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36424)\">Matt. 5:6<\/a><\/span>) get and keep alive through their actions the feeling to do right. Inherent in the first principles of the gospel is the \u201cdesire principle\u201d\u2014the desire to love God and fellowmen \u201cwith all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36473\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36473)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36473)\">Matt. 22:37<\/a><\/span>.)

What I am trying to say about the Savior\u2019s being in our midst, whether we be two or three or many, is clearly portrayed in Paul\u2019s eloquent description of the process of attaining spiritual perfection. He said: \u201cFor our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost: so that ye were ensamples.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2754\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2754)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2754)\">1 Thes. 1:5\u20136<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p15\" class=\"\">May I restate for the sake of emphasis what these inspired writings contain for each of us. Paul rejoiced in the fact that what he had told the Thessalonians was not meaningless words to them, for they had listened with great interest, and what was taught them produced a powerful desire for righteousness in their lives. He was explicit in stressing that the Holy Spirit also gave them full assurance that what was taught was true. He did not hesitate to say that his life, as well, was further proof to them of the truthfulness of the message. Paul was pleased that the gospel message had been received with such joy and happiness, despite many hardships. Finally, he noted what must have been their crowning achievement\u2014that they were inspiring examples to all their neighbors and that from them the word of the Lord had extended to others everywhere, far beyond their boundaries. Paul paid tribute to them when he told them that wherever he traveled, he found people telling him about their remarkable good works and faith in God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p16\" class=\"\">In this bicentennial year, it is well for us to be reminded again and again that knowing and keeping the divine laws and commandments have always generated faith, righteous living, and inspiration in our people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p17\" class=\"\">I recall that when the Saints settled in a new area, they were troubled about how permanently they were to build their houses.
