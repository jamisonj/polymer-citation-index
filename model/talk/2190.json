I became well-acquainted with him, and we conversed freely and frankly. A great scholar, with perhaps a dozen languages at his tongue\u2019s end, he seemed to know all about theology, law, literature, science and philosophy. One day he said to me: \u2018You Mormons are all ignoramuses. You don\u2019t even know the strength of your own position. It is so strong that there is only one other tenable in the whole Christian world, and that is the position of the Catholic Church. The issue is between Catholicism and Mormonism. If we are right, you are wrong; if you are right, we are wrong; and that\u2019s all there is to it. The Protestants haven\u2019t a leg to stand on. For, if we are wrong, they are wrong with us, since they were a part of us and went out from us; while if we are right, they are apostates whom we cut off long ago. If we have the apostolic succession from St. Peter, as we claim, there is no need of Joseph Smith and Mormonism; but if we have not that succession, then such a man as Joseph Smith was necessary, and Mormonism\u2019s attitude is the only consistent one.

We have a testimony to bear to all of the world to this event.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-true-church.p52\" class=\"\">I think of the words of the apostle Paul when he said that he determined to know nothing but Jesus and him crucified. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"539\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 539)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(539)\">1 Cor. 2:2<\/a><\/span>.) That doesn\u2019t mean that he didn\u2019t know the old prophets or appreciate them, but a new day had come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-true-church.p53\" class=\"\">The Son of God had come, of whom the prophets had spoken, and then he said: \u201c\u2026 for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"543\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 543)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(543)\">1 Cor. 9:16<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-true-church.p54\" class=\"\">In that same sense, we know nothing but the restoration of the gospel, that it was brought by the Son of Man himself, so that there is no separation from the prophets of this dispensation, and woe be unto us if we share not these marvelous truths with the world!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-true-church.p55\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, I know that this is the work of God the Eternal Father. It is the greatest movement in all the world today. There isn\u2019t an honest man or an honest woman in this world, who really loves the Lord, who wouldn\u2019t join this church if they would take time to find out what it is and would ask God the Eternal Father, who will not mislead them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-true-church.p56\" class=\"\">That is my witness and testimony to you, and I leave it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
