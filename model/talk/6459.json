Happily, we need not all be the same kind of instrument. Just as the instruments in an orchestra differ in size, shape, and sound, we too are different from one another. We have different talents and inclinations, but just as the French horn cannot duplicate the sound of the piccolo, neither is it necessary for us to all serve the Lord in the same way. Sister Eliza R.

The Prophet Joseph, who organized the Relief Society in 1842, made it clear that the purpose of this divinely inspired organization was to not only \u201crelieve the poor, but to save souls\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 5:25). Since its earliest days Relief Society has done incalculable good. The Relief Society provided the first carload of flour that reached survivors of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and later provided wheat to the United States government during World Wars I and II. Last year our sisters donated more than 140,000 quilts to help those in distress. We have championed motherhood and the family, waged war against illiteracy, and rendered untold hours of service throughout the world. But my declaration to you tonight is that our most crucial work lies ahead as we join with our priesthood leaders to help move the kingdom of God forward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p13\" class=\"\">Sisters, we are needed here\u2014by the Lord, by our priesthood leaders, by our families, and by each other. The Lord needs us to embrace our eternal callings and fill the measure of our creation. He needs us to come home to Relief Society and look for ways to serve others in the name of His organization for women and to work together as sisters in helping the gospel kingdom move forward. Truly, Relief Society will help each of us serve our families and each other in ways that no other club or organization can.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p14\" class=\"\">President Spencer W.

The most important conversion for any of us is our own. If we are to bring the light of the gospel into others\u2019 lives, it must shine brightly in our own. Once converted, the sons of Mosiah labored without ceasing to share the gospel with others, \u201cfor they could not bear that any human soul should perish\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40057\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40057)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40057)\">Mosiah 28:3<\/a><\/span>). Only when <span class=\"emphasis\">we<\/span> are converted to the Lord Jesus Christ are we in a position to strengthen others. And only then do we begin to understand that our lives truly do have meaning, purpose, and direction, and that as sisters united in our devotion to Jesus Christ our calling is to be a light to the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p17\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Number 2.<\/span> Like the sons of Mosiah, we must wax \u201cstrong in the knowledge of the truth\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8507\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8507)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8507)\">Alma 17:2<\/a><\/span>). These brothers continually studied the gospel. Through fasting and prayer and immersing themselves in the scriptures, they came to know that Jesus is the Christ, and they learned to hear His voice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p18\" class=\"\">Likewise, as sisters of the Relief Society we should strive to increase our testimonies of Jesus Christ through prayer and scripture study and to seek spiritual strength by following the promptings of the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p19\" class=\"\">It is almost impossible to be an effective instrument within our own families, with our neighbors, or even from the pulpit unless we can discern the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. Ammon was able to perceive the thoughts of the Lamanite king because he was living close to the Lord (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"8512\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8512)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8512)\">Alma 18:16<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p20\" class=\"\">Our ability to hear the voice of the Spirit is dependent upon our willingness to keep the commandments, for \u201cwhen we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11020\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11020)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11020)\">D&amp;C 130:21<\/a><\/span>).

Imagine what goodness will fill the earth when, under the direction of the priesthood, this circle of righteous women unite to bring to pass righteous purposes! When we unitedly serve each other and all of our Father\u2019s children, we can be instruments in the hands of God, not only to relieve physical suffering but, more importantly, to succor those who are in need spiritually.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p23\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Number 3.<\/span> Service is a key to being an effective instrument. The sons of Mosiah chose to serve the Lamanites rather than assume leadership of their father\u2019s kingdom. And in many instances, their service softened the hearts of the Lamanites and made them receptive to the gospel. When Lamoni\u2019s servants were busy recounting Ammon\u2019s exploits in fending off marauders, Ammon himself was in the stable feeding the horses and serving the king (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"8511\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8511)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8511)\">Alma 18:9\u201310<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p24\" class=\"\">We, too, delight in service and good works. Service softens and opens hearts, for it is truly the gospel in action. I know of a ward in Arizona where three families are currently investigating the Church, all as a direct result of compassionate service rendered by the Relief Society.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p25\" class=\"\">Relief Society affords us countless opportunities to develop and exercise the pure love of Christ in all aspects of our lives. For example, home, family, and personal enrichment meeting provides an ideal setting to learn and serve together. Service <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> the gospel of Jesus Christ in action, for service blesses both the giver and the receiver. Will you look for ways to channel your service through the organization of the Relief Society, realizing that service is one of the most effective ways we can bless others temporally and spiritually?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p26\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Number 4.<\/span> Love must undergird everything we do. As sisters of the Relief Society, we love the Lord, we love our families, we love life and learning, and we love one another. Lamoni\u2019s father, who was king of the Lamanites, softened his heart when he saw how sincerely Ammon loved his son. Eventually Ammon\u2019s love led to the conversion of Lamoni\u2019s family (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"8517\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8517)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8517)\">Alma 20:26\u201327<\/a><\/span>). Our greatest and first concern with regard to conversion, retention, and activation must be to our own family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p27\" class=\"\">Once again, Relief Society can help. Sister Elsa Bluhm, who is 102, knew the gospel was true. She loved the Lord. She met a good man and married him. He was from Germany, and he was not a member of the Church. Her husband had never been taught to pray. When Elsa knelt beside the bed each night, she would take his hand in hers and pray. After many years he joined the Church, and they were sealed in the temple. Before his passing, Brother Bluhm became an instrument in the hands of God by researching his German ancestors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p28\" class=\"\">This happy ending began with one woman\u2019s insistent, loving, righteous example. Elsa invited the Spirit into their home and marriage by loving her husband and loving the Lord. She was both faithful and filled with faith, even when at times she felt alone. She was an instrument in the hands of God in her own home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p29\" class=\"\">For each of us, our righteous examples may seem small, but by influence they are great.

Let others feel the peace and joy that gospel living brings you. Invite your friends not of our faith or less-active members over for family home evening.
