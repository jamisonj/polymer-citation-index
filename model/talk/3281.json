Our local Church members, working in harmony with our full-time missionaries, are resulting in a rapid expansion of this Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/joseph-smith-the-prophet.p4\" class=\"\">Three weeks ago it was my privilege to be assigned to create new stakes in Lima, Peru. We met in a coliseum with over 7,000 Saints and investigators. After this moving spiritual experience, we were confronted by three newspaper reporters in the parking lot. They asked: \u201cWhy are you in Lima?\u201d \u201cHow many members does your church have in Peru?\u201d \u201cWhy is your church growing so rapidly?\u201d \u201cWhat are your church\u2019s future plans?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/joseph-smith-the-prophet.p5\" class=\"\">And then a young woman reporter asked, \u201cWhat is the difference between your church and other churches?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/joseph-smith-the-prophet.p6\" class=\"\">The crowd was large and pressing toward us, the traffic rather noisy. We were on a close time schedule. It was not an ideal setting, not one I would have chosen to explain the difference between the Lord\u2019s church and others. However, taking advantage of this opportunity, we explained briefly the Apostasy and the Restoration: that there is vast evidence and history of an apostasy from the doctrine taught by Jesus and his Apostles, that the organization of the original Church became corrupted, and sacred ordinances were changed to suit the convenience of men, and that today good people all over the world are confused with contending religions with differing doctrine and methods of worship.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/joseph-smith-the-prophet.p7\" class=\"\">The reporters listened intently. We explained to them that after a long period of darkness there was a heavenly directed restoration of the true gospel of the Savior, that a young man named Joseph Smith was chosen and schooled to be the instrument to perform the foundation labor for the marvelous work which God has established as his church in these last days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/joseph-smith-the-prophet.p8\" class=\"\">As we briefly told of the Restoration and of Joseph Smith, his profile focused in my mind in a most interesting way. It was an unusual experience. As the Prophet\u2019s facial profile remained in my mind I thought: \u201cIf these reporters and the world could only understand the entire story and the significance of the Restoration\u2014of the eternal blessings God has made available to all. If they could only feel as I feel. If they could know, as I know, if they could only realize the calling and the role of the Prophet.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/joseph-smith-the-prophet.p9\" class=\"\">I added my witness that Joseph Smith was divinely commissioned as the restorer of the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness, that he was and is a prophet of God, that he sought God in prayer and God spoke to him. He did the work Jesus, the Son of God, commanded him to do, and this Church, which the Prophet assisted in organizing, is possessor of the divine keys and authority of the holy priesthood, and is charged with the responsibility to carry God\u2019s plan of salvation to all his earthly children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/joseph-smith-the-prophet.p10\" class=\"\">Man was wondering then as now: \u201cIs there a God?

The grove became exceedingly light, brighter than he had ever known. Before him stood two glorious personages\u2014defying all description. One pointed to the other and said, <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cThis is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\u201d<\/span> The Son spoke to the kneeling boy. Joseph was told that all the churches were wrong\u2014they had corrupted the doctrine, had changed the ordinances, and had lost the authority of the priesthood\u2014and that he, unlearned but humble, was to be the instrument through whom the Almighty would reestablish his work.

His Church was organized as anciently. Apostles now held the necessary keys of the priesthood. Joseph\u2019s work was done.

It is not necessary for a man to be a president of a stake, or a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, in order to attain a high place in the celestial kingdom. The humblest member of the Church, if he keeps the commandments of God, will obtain an exaltation just as much as any other man in the celestial kingdom.
