Shortly after reading this account, I called a family friend who lived in St. Catharines. She explained that the workers had been painting the Garden City Skyway bridge for about a year and were two weeks short of completing the project when the accident happened. After the accident, officials were asked why these men did not have any safety equipment. The answer was simple: they had the equipment; they just chose not to wear it. After the scaffolding gave way, the survivors held on to a one-inch (2.5-cm) lip of steel girder and stood on an eight-inch (20-cm) ledge of steel for over an hour until rescue teams could reach them. One survivor related that as he clung to the bridge, he thought a lot about his family. He said, \u201cI just thank the Lord for me being here today. \u2026 It was pretty scary, I tell you\u201d (in Rick Bogacz, \u201cSkyway Horror,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Standard,<\/span> June 9, 1993).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/hold-on.p7\" class=\"\">There are many lessons to be learned and comparisons to be made from this incident.

Our mortal probation is not easy, and it is not brief. We are blessed to come to this earth and gain a mortal body. This life is our opportunity to prove ourselves and exercise our agency (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"119639\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 119639)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(119639)\">Abraham 3:25<\/a><\/span>).

We must deal with challenges. We may experience loneliness, strained relationships, betrayal of trust, temptations, addictions, limitations of our physical body, or the loss of much-needed employment. We may be challenged with feelings of disappointment because our righteous hopes and dreams have not been met in our personal timetable. We may question our abilities and fear the possibility of failure, even in our Church and family callings. The challenges and the dangers we live with today, including society\u2019s tolerance of sin, have been prophesied by ancient and living prophets. These are just as precarious and real as the threat of falling 125 feet (38 m) to certain death from a high bridge.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/hold-on.p10\" class=\"\">My life is not perfect. I deal with many of the same challenges. We all do. I know that the temptations of the adversary and the difficulties of mortality are ever present and beset each of us.

We learn and grow by overcoming challenges with faith, persistence, and personal righteousness. I\u2019ve been strengthened by President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson\u2019s endless confidence in our Heavenly Father and in us. He has said: \u201cRemember that you are entitled to our [Heavenly] Father\u2019s blessings in this work. He did not call you to your privileged post to walk alone, without guidance, trusting to luck. On the contrary, He knows your skill, He realizes your devotion, and He will convert your supposed inadequacies to recognized strengths. He has promised: \u2018I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up\u2019\u201d (\u201cSugar Beets and the Worth of a Soul,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> July 2009, 3\u20134; <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> July 2009, 5\u20136).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/hold-on.p12\" class=\"\">Heavenly Father has not left us alone during our mortal probation. He has already given us all the \u201csafety equipment\u201d we will need to successfully return to Him. He has given us personal prayer, the scriptures, living prophets, and the Holy Ghost to guide us. At times, using this equipment may seem cumbersome, awkward, and horribly unfashionable. Its proper use requires our diligence, obedience, and persistence. But I, for one, choose to use it. We must all choose to use it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/hold-on.p13\" class=\"\">In the scriptures we learn about another key piece of safety equipment\u2014a \u201crod of iron.\u201d Disciples of our Savior, Jesus Christ, are invited to hold on to this rod in order to safely find their way to eternal life.

Nephi promises that those who hold fast to the iron rod \u201cwould never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"119332\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 119332)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(119332)\">1\u00a0Nephi 15:24<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/hold-on.p16\" class=\"\">I invite you to read again the full accounts of this inspired vision.

We may let go because of peer pressure or pride, thinking we can find our own way back\u2014later. When we do so, we are leaving our safety equipment behind. In Lehi\u2019s vision he saw many who let go of the iron rod.

In difficult times in our own lives, we may find we are also \u201cwandering in strange roads.\u201d Let me reassure you that it is always possible for us to find our way back. Through repentance, made possible by the atoning sacrifice of our Savior, Jesus Christ, we can regain and recommit to a strong grip on the iron rod and feel the loving guidance of our Heavenly Father once again.
