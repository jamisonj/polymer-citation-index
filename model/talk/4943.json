There are twelve items, followed by a conclusion. I shall treat briefly each standard.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>1. Dating<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p18\" class=\"\">Begin to prepare for a temple marriage. Proper dating is a part of that preparation. In cultures where dating is appropriate, do not date until you are sixteen years old. Not all teenagers need to date or even want to. When you begin dating, go in groups or on double dates. Make sure your parents meet and become acquainted with those you date. Because dating is a preparation for marriage, date only those who have high standards.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p19\" class=\"\">Be careful to go to places where there is a good environment, where you won\u2019t be faced with temptation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p20\" class=\"\">A wise father said to his son, \u201cIf you ever find yourself in a place where you shouldn\u2019t ought to be, get out!\u201d Good advice for all of us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>2. Dress and Appearance<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p22\" class=\"\">Servants of the Lord have always counseled us to dress modestly to show respect for our Heavenly Father and for ourselves. The way you dress sends messages about yourself to others and often influences the way you and others act. Dress in such a way as to bring out the best in yourself and those around you. Avoid extremes in clothing and appearance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>3. Friendshipping<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p24\" class=\"\">Everyone needs good friends. Your circle of friends will greatly influence your thinking and behavior, just as you will theirs. When you share common values with your friends, you can strengthen and encourage each other. Treat everyone with kindness and dignity. Many nonmembers have come into the Church through friends who have involved them in Church activities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>4. Honesty<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p26\" class=\"\">The oft-repeated adage is ever true: \u201cHonesty is the best policy.\u201d (Miguel de Cervantes, <span class=\"emphasis\">Familiar Quotations,<\/span> John Bartlett, comp., Emily Morrison Beck, ed., Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1968, p. 197.) A Latter-day Saint young man lives as he teaches and as he believes. He is honest with others. He is honest with himself. He is honest with God. He is honest by habit and as a matter of course. When a difficult decision must be made, he never asks himself, \u201cWhat will others think?\u201d but rather, \u201cWhat will I think of myself?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p27\" class=\"\">For some, there will come the temptation to dishonor a personal standard of honesty. In a business law class at the university I attended, I remember that one particular classmate never prepared for the class discussions. I thought to myself, \u201cHow is he going to pass the final examination?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p28\" class=\"\">I discovered the answer when he came to the classroom for the final examination, on a winter\u2019s day, wearing on his bare feet only a pair of sandals. I was surprised and watched him as the class began. All of his books had been placed upon the floor. He slipped the sandals from his feet; and then, with toes that he had trained and had prepared with glycerine, he skillfully turned the pages of one of the books which he had placed on the floor, thereby viewing the answers to the examination questions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p29\" class=\"\">He received one of the highest grades in that course on business law. But the day of reckoning came. Later, as he prepared to take his comprehensive examination, for the first time the dean of his particular discipline said, \u201cThis year I shall depart from tradition and shall conduct an oral, rather than a written, test.\u201d Our favorite, trained-toe expert found that he had his foot in his mouth on that occasion and failed the examination.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>5. Language<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p31\" class=\"\">How you speak and the words you use tell much about the image you choose to portray. Use language to build and uplift those around you. Profane, vulgar, or crude language and inappropriate or off-color jokes are offensive to the Lord. Never misuse the name of God or Jesus Christ. The Lord said, \u201cThou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22981\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22981)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22981)\">Ex. 20:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>6.

Music and Dancing<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p44\" class=\"\">Music can help you draw closer to your Heavenly Father. It can be used to educate, edify, inspire, and unite. However, music can, by its tempo, beat, intensity, and lyrics, dull your spiritual sensitivity. You cannot afford to fill your minds with unworthy music. Dancing can be enjoyable and provide an opportunity to meet new people and strengthen friendships. Plan and attend dances where dress, grooming, lighting, dancing styles, lyrics, and music contribute to an atmosphere in which the Spirit of the Lord may be present.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>9. Sexual Purity<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p46\" class=\"\">Because sexual intimacy is so sacred, the Lord requires self-control and purity before marriage, as well as full fidelity after marriage. In dating, treat your date with respect, and expect your date to show that same respect for you. Tears inevitably follow transgression. Men, take care not to make women weep, for God counts their tears.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p47\" class=\"\">President David O.

I recall saying to him, \u201cDo you send a letter home to your parents every week?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p66\" class=\"\">He replied, \u201cYes, Brother Monson.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p67\" class=\"\">Then I asked, \u201cDo you enjoy receiving letters from home?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p68\" class=\"\">He didn\u2019t answer. At length, I inquired, \u201cWhen was the last time you had a letter from home?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p69\" class=\"\">With a quavering voice, he responded, \u201cI\u2019ve never had a letter from home. Father\u2019s just a deacon, and Mother\u2019s not a member of the Church. They pleaded with me not to come. They said that if I left on a mission they would not be writing to me. What shall I do?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p70\" class=\"\">I offered a silent prayer to my Heavenly Father: \u201cWhat shall I tell this young servant of Thine, who has sacrificed everything to serve Thee?\u201d And the inspiration came. I said, \u201cElder, you send a letter home to your mother and father every week of your mission. Tell them what you are doing. Tell them how much you love them, and then bear your testimony to them.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p71\" class=\"\">He asked, \u201cWill they then write to me?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p72\" class=\"\">I responded, \u201cThen they will write to you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p73\" class=\"\">We parted, and I went on my way. Months later I was attending a stake conference in Southern California when a young man came up to me and said, \u201cBrother Monson, do you remember me? I\u2019m the young missionary who had not received a letter from my mother or my father during my first nine months in the mission field. I\u2019m the one to whom you said, \u2018Send a letter home every week, Elder, and your parents will write to you.\u2019\u201d Then he asked, \u201cDo you remember that promise, Elder Monson?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p74\" class=\"\">I remembered. I inquired, \u201cHave you heard from your parents?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p75\" class=\"\">He reached into his pocket and took out a sheaf of letters with an elastic band around them, took a letter from the top of the stack and said, \u201cHave I heard from my parents! Listen to this letter from my mother: \u2018Son, we so much enjoy your letters. We\u2019re proud of you, our missionary. Guess what? Dad has been ordained a priest. He\u2019s preparing to baptize me. I\u2019m meeting with the missionaries; and one year from now we want to come to California as you complete your mission, for we, with you, would like to become a <span class=\"emphasis\">forever family<\/span> by entering the temple of the Lord.\u2019\u201d Then the young man put his hand in mine and asked, \u201cBrother Monson, does Heavenly Father always answer prayers and fulfill Apostles\u2019 promises?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p76\" class=\"\">I replied, \u201cWhen one has faith as you have demonstrated, our Heavenly Father hears such prayers and answers in His own way.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p77\" class=\"\">Clean hands, a pure heart, and a willing mind had touched heaven. A blessing, heaven-sent, had answered the fervent prayer of a missionary\u2019s humble heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/that-we-may-touch-heaven.p78\" class=\"\">Brethren, it is my prayer that we may so live that we, too, may touch heaven and be similarly blessed.
