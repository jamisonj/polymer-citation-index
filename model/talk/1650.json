I think there is no sound quite like the Saints singing at\nconference.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is a year of conventions and conferences. Many of them are held throughout the world.\nThey are of many kinds: governmental, political, business, educational, religious, but of them\nall this one is unique. Nowhere in the world is there, or could there be, an assembly such as\nthis.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Purposes of general conference<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nPresident David O. McKay lists the purposes for holding general conferences as follows: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . Reference to the Doctrine and Covenants will disclose the fact that there are four\nprincipal purposes for holding conferences of the Church: \n<\/p><p>\n\"First, to transact current Church business.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Second, to hear reports and general Church statistics.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Third, to 'approve of those names which I (the Lord) have appointed, or to disapprove of\nthem' (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15264\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15264)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15264)\">D&amp;C 124:144<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Fourth, to worship the Lord in sincerity and reverence, and to give and to receive\nencouragement, exhortation, and instruction.\" (<i>Conference Report<\/i>,\nOctober 1938, pp. 130-31.)\n<\/p><p>\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Early conferences<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe first conference was held on June 9, 1830. I read from the minutes: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Our numbers were about thirty, besides whom many assembled with us, who were either\nbelievers or anxious to learn. Having opened by singing and prayer, we partook together of\nthe emblems of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. We then proceeded to confirm\nseveral who had lately been baptized, after which we called out and ordained several to the\nvarious offices of the Priesthood. Much exhortation and instruction was given, and the Holy\nGhost was poured out upon us in a miraculous manner&mdash;many of our number prophesied,\nwhilst others had the heavens opened to their view.\" (<i>Documentary History of the Church<\/i>,\nVol. 1, pp. 84-85.)\n<\/p><p>\nThis was the first conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nSeventeen years later there was held an even more humble conference than the first. It is\ndescribed by Elder John Young.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I reached the valley during the sitting of Conference, and some of the brethren said, 'The\nConference is sitting; won't you go?' So I walked down to where they were holding\nConference, and I found them by the side of a haystack. There was Father John Smith and a\nlittle handful of men that might have been covered with a small tent, and they were holding\nthe Semi-Annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\"\n(<i>Journal of Discourses<\/i>, Vol. 6, p. 232.)\n<\/p><p>\nThose men who met that October morning by that haystack, which no doubt stood somewhere\nnear this building, had vision enough to know that someday their message would be carried\nacross the world. From that small group of pioneers the influence of these great conferences\nhas grown, and now the message is heard beyond the seas and across the world. There is a\ngreat spirit in our conferences.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Established by God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Heber J. Grant declared that \"God established these conferences. Nothing but the\nspirit of the living God could bring together such a congregation . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"The General Conferences of the Latter-day Saints are one of the great outstanding\ntestimonies . . . of the divinity of the work in which we are engaged.\" (<i>Conference Report<\/i>,\nOctober 1933, p. 118.)\n<\/p><p>\nWhat of those who attend conference? Perhaps we could introduce just one of them.\nSometime ago there came to a conference the religious editor of a large newspaper. He came\nacross the country to get the \"feel\" of the conference.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Interview by editor<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nBefore the opening of a session, we came down the aisle of this building. It was filled to\ncapacity. He noticed a middle-aged man, dressed unpretentiously, sitting next to the aisle, and\nasked to be introduced. We found him to be from the West Coast, a convert to the Church.\nAs I recall, he had once been a member of the same church to which the editor belonged. He\nwas a counselor in a bishopric. The interview proceeded something like this: \n<\/p><p>\n\"How long have you been a member of the Church?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"About eight years.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Did you join the first time the missionaries contacted you?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Oh, no. It took me several weeks before I joined the Church.\" Then he added with a smile,\n\"I don't like to rush into things.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"They tell me,\" the reporter inquired, \"that the President of your Church is a prophet. Is that\ntrue?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Oh yes! I know him to be a prophet of God, just as much a prophet as any of the biblical\nprophets.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Are you paid for your service in the Church?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Oh yes!\" he said. \"Generously paid&mdash;in blessings, not money. It seems that the principle of\ntithing requires that we pay for the privilege.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe editor, satisfied with the interview, turned to leave. Then, as an afterthought, he turned\nagain with another question and said, \"Tell me, why&mdash;why do you pay tithing?\"\n<\/p><p>\nI noticed that the good brother's countenance became very serious, and there was a brimming\nbit of emotion in his eyes as he softly answered in a single word: \"Obedience.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Participants in conference<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThese, then, are those who come to conference. From the pulpit here I can see the lumberman\nfrom Oregon, the electrician from Maine, the policeman from Tonga, the nurseryman from\nAuckland, the civil servant from Holland.\n<\/p><p>\nI can see those who saved and skimped to come. I can see others who regard it merely as an\nincidental expense.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now of the men who speak here&mdash;the First Presidency, the twelve apostles, and the\nother General Authorities. They too come from varied occupations. One was a newspaper\neditor, another a building contractor, another an engineer. Several are attorneys. One was a\nbank president, another an air line executive, and two or three are insurance men. Several are\nteachers. Four of them hold doctorates. A number have held public office&mdash;two of them as\ncabinet members. Several have served in the military. They are all married men with families.\nThough most of them have known success in their chosen profession, almost to a man they\ncome from humble beginnings.\n<\/p><p>\nAs it was when he was here, they have been welded together in the ministry of the gospel of\nJesus Christ. So it should be, for was not Peter a fisherman, and Andrew and James and John;\nand was not Matthew a publican?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Subjects discussed<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat do General Authorities talk about in conference? Some people say that they are out of\ntheir province when they speak up on temporal or political issues. President John Taylor said\nof these conferences: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . as we possess bodies as well as spirits, and have to live by eating, drinking, and\nwearing, it becomes necessary that temporal matters should be considered and discussed in\nour Conferences, and that we should deliberate upon all things that are calculated to benefit,\nbless, and exalt the Saints of God, whether they refer to our spiritual affairs or to our\navocations and duties in life as husbands and wives, as parents and children . . . whether they\nrefer to the policy we should pursue in our commercial relations . . . or to any other matter\naffecting us as human beings composing part of the body politic of this nation or as citizens\nof the world.\" (<i>JD<\/i>, Vol. 11, pp. 353-54.)\n<\/p><p>\nOthers complain that the brethren are blind to social developments and urge them to be\nobedient to the \"revelation of social progress.\"\n<\/p><p>\nCome the Sabbath day you will find these men scattered across the world holding\nconferences, bearing witness, and preaching the gospel. One will be in Hong Kong, another\nperhaps visiting the servicemen in Vietnam, another effecting a new organization in Australia\nor New Zealand. Others will be in South Africa, England, Germany, Canada, Brazil, or\nGuatemala.\n<\/p><p>\nYet, when the council meetings come in the middle of the week, we find the brethren here\nagain. They sit in council to prayerfully deliberate over the affairs of the Church and kingdom\nof God here upon the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nTraveling as they do across the earth (literally, the full extent of it), it is hardly conceivable\nthat they could miss or would ignore any significant development&mdash;social, political, religious,\nnational, or racial&mdash;anywhere on the earth. Also, they have lifelong training and achievement\nin fields of activity so important to mankind.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Speakers called of God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHowever, it is not because of travel nor professional success that we ought to pay heed to\nthem. Nor is it because they are nimble of mind or wise in years. These things are incidental\nonly.\n<\/p><p>\nWe listen to them because they have been \"called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on\nof hands, by those who are in authority to preach the gospel and administer in the ordinances\nthereof\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6854\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6854)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6854)\">A of F 1:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThey are given divine authority. Not one of them aspired to the office he holds, nor did he\ncall himself, for \"in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, one takes the place to\nwhich one is duly called,\" said President Clark, \"which place one neither seeks or declines.\"\n(<i>The Improvement Era<\/i>, June 1951, p. 412.)\n<\/p><p>\n\"Ye have not chosen me,\" said the Lord, \"but I have chosen you, and ordained you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28465\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28465)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28465)\">John 15:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Lesson from scripture<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe don't have to listen to them or pay heed to them&mdash;we have our agency. But there is a\nlesson in scripture to consider.\n<\/p><p>\nThe children of Israel entered the land of Edom. It was infested with serpents and snakes, the\nbite of which was so painful and so dangerous that they called them fiery, flying serpents.\nThey cried for deliverance.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . And Moses prayed for the people.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall\ncome to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a\nserpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41114\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41114)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41114)\">Num. 21:7-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"How silly,\" some must have said. \"How can such a thing cure me? I'll not show my\nstupidity by paying any attention,\" and some would not look.\n<\/p><p>\nIn First Nephi we read that \"after they were bitten he prepared a way that they might be\nhealed; and the labor which they had to perform was to look; and because of the simpleness\nof the way, or the easiness of it, there were many who perished\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1648\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1648)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1648)\">1 Ne. 17:41<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe lesson is enlarged in the Gospel of John.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted\nup: \n<\/p><p>\n\"That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in\nhim should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28404\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28404)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28404)\">John 3:14-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Great witness from conferences<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnd today many say, \"How silly! How could accepting Christ save me?\" They will not turn\ntheir heads to look nor incline their ears to hear. They ignore the great witness that comes\nfrom these conferences. We ought to, indeed we must, heed the counsel of these men, for the\nLord said, \"What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though\nthe heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled,\nwhether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, and the record is true, and\nthe truth abideth forever and ever. Amen\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15089\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15089)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15089)\">D&amp;C 1:38-39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThough it is my privilege to serve among them, I have not forgotten for one moment that\nthese men, the brethren, are the servants of the Lord. And individually, independent of their\nknowing it, I know and testify that David O. McKay is a prophet of God, that Jesus is the\nChrist, and that this conference is his voice speaking to his children. In the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
