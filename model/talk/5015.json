To speak in priesthood meeting of general conference is for me literally a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because I have never before had this privilege in the fifteen years that I have belonged to the Quorum of the Seventy, and it is not likely that I will have another chance to do so. I therefore consider it a personal blessing to address such a vast audience of worthy men holding the priesthood of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p4\" class=\"\">A great number of you are still single, and many of you are married. To those who are married, I would like to testify, based on my personal experience, that a loving, supportive wife at home is a great source of strength. You probably have heard the saying, \u201cBehind every great man stands a great woman.\u201d In the Church we have changed that adage somewhat by saying, \u201cBehind every great man in the Church stands a surprised mother-in-law.\u201d Because she may say, \u201cIs this the boy who married my daughter? Is he a bishop now? I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Yes, Mother, that boy has matured, has gained experience by taking upon himself greater responsibilities and has learned to serve the Lord while serving others. In short, he has <span class=\"emphasis\">changed!<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p5\" class=\"\">I would like to talk tonight about <span class=\"emphasis\">change<\/span> because everything around us seems to be changing at an accelerated pace. In the last two years we have observed tremendous changes in Eastern Europe. Also the recent events in the Persian Gulf region have, understandably so, changed the lives of many people in a dramatic way. It was inevitable that our personal lives as well were influenced by the events around us, and maybe we experienced the discomforting feeling that these changes in the world are beyond our control.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p6\" class=\"\">Yet there are important changes everyone should be able to make through proper preparation, changes over which we do have control. Brethren, as priesthood holders we should ask ourselves these questions: \u201cAm I giving enough attention and time to personal change, which will make me a better person in the eyes of the Lord?\u201d And \u201cAm I, as a father and spiritual leader in my own home, giving enough attention and time to my basic duties and responsibilities?\u201d These are:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p7\" class=\"\">Number 1. To lead and direct my family in regular family prayer and study of the scriptures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p8\" class=\"\">Number 2. To prepare my sons to receive the priesthood, and the other members in my family to honor the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p9\" class=\"\">Number 3. To encourage my family to be worthy to receive the temple ordinances and be faithful to the covenants made.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p10\" class=\"\">Number 4. To assist my family members to develop their personal talents and divine gifts to strengthen and serve others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p11\" class=\"\">Number 5. To inspire my family members to keep the commandments of God and endure in faith till the end.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p12\" class=\"\">When we really understand, accept, and commit ourselves to these priesthood duties, we prepare ourselves for a miraculous change with eternal consequences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p13\" class=\"\">Have we not been promised that we \u201cmight be partakers of the divine nature\u201d?

This means that through personal change we develop a desire to live in harmony with the divine teachings of the Lord and to free our minds from all ill feelings toward other people. To do so will make us more worthy, even more perfect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p14\" class=\"\">The old saying \u201cChange is progress\u201d then takes on a special meaning for all of us\u2014because repentance is change, conversion is change, perfecting is change.

Maxwell has made the following statement about the manner in which we should read the Book of Mormon: \u201cFor some Church members the Book of Mormon remains unread. Others use it occasionally as if it were merely a handy book of quotations. Still others accept and read it but do not really explore and ponder it. The book is to be feasted upon, not nibbled.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">But for a Small Moment,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1986, p. 28.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p17\" class=\"\">Let us, therefore, today feast upon the words of Amulek, the missionary companion of Alma the Younger, as recorded in chapter 34 of Alma, starting with verse 30:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now, my brethren, I would that, <span class=\"emphasis\">after ye have received so many witnesses,<\/span> seeing that the holy scriptures testify of these things, ye come forth and bring fruit unto repentance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cYea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cFor behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now, as I said unto you before, <span class=\"emphasis\">as ye have had so many witnesses,<\/span> therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cYe cannot say, when you are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God.

The dramatic changes we have experienced in recent years are the beginning of a new era. In the regional representatives\u2019 seminar of April 1987, the following vision was shared by Elder Maxwell:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cAll things must be done in wisdom and order. The Mormon pioneers were praised for the irrigation of the Utah desert. We are now preparing for the ultimate Mormon irrigation which will come when the Church has grown in numbers and spirituality to such an extent that the gospel truth and righteousness shall sweep the earth as with a flood. We are now in a brief interlude in Church history that precedes a special era, soon to be upon us, when this gospel will be taken to our brothers and sisters in the Third World. Their response may overwhelm us and we must make sure we are firmly established and ready for these brothers and sisters, for they are ready for us. They are now in preparation to hear the word. May God bless us in our preparation to take the word to them.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p27\" class=\"\">Brethren, I bear solemn witness that the lines and precepts that I have shared with you tonight are true, that the Book of Mormon is indeed the word of God and the most correct book on earth pertaining to the salvation and exaltation of man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/change.p28\" class=\"\">I know that God lives and that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer.
