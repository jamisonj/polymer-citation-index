And to the Seventy and the Twelve and the First Presidency who have been so supportive and encouraging, I express my love and continued support for them. I also would like to acknowledge those wonderful brothers and sisters who work behind the scenes here at headquarters and throughout the world to provide so many services and resources to help move the work along.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p5\" class=\"\">It\u2019s marvelous to be in the service of the Lord and now to be called as a witness for our Lord and Savior and to return to a land that I love more than I can express.

So I pray that I might be able to fulfill the expectations of that wonderful call.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p6\" class=\"\">In the Pearl of Great Price we read that the Lord delivered Abraham from idolatrous sacrifice.

The covenant children of Abraham were to be distinguished by their sacred obligation to declare to the world the true and living God.

We have become the covenant children of Abraham, a new generation of witnesses to bear testimony that God lives and Jesus is the Christ.

I was employed by a major corporation for almost twenty-five years. During those years I developed a personal friendship with a fine business associate from Texas. Our careers paralleled each other very closely. A few years ago, he presented me with a most unusual gift, which I shall always cherish. It was a large, molded bronze, personalized coat of arms. He said, \u201cI have been observing you for many years and have created an original coat of arms using symbols which I believe represent the four most important values to which you have committed your life, namely, your church, your family, your profession, and your quest for personal development.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p12\" class=\"\">Naturally, I was surprised, deeply impressed, and flattered. As the significance of this gift settled upon my mind, the thought of someone quietly taking mental notes of my actions, attitudes, and values fired my imagination. I realized the weighty responsibility each of us has to demonstrate accurately the principles and priorities to which we are committed. It was like a mini-foretaste of Judgment Day!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p13\" class=\"\">I thought of the scripture in Revelation in which John saw the books opened, \u201cand the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42550\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42550)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42550)\">Rev. 20:12<\/a><\/span>.) It was a most sobering experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p14\" class=\"\">All of us give our lives daily for what we believe is important. Those with whom we associate are silently assessing us, our values and character traits. Is there anything about our daily conduct we would change if we knew someone was doing a written appraisal for publication?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p15\" class=\"\">Suppose you received, as the head of a family, a telephone call from your stake president, who said, \u201cThe local newspaper is doing a series of articles on the Church. They have asked permission for a reporter to move into one of our homes for a week to observe firsthand what a Mormon family is really like. We have selected you to represent the Church in our stake.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p16\" class=\"\">You say, \u201cYes, President, we will be happy to do it.\u201d You have seven children ranging from age two months to a nineteen-year-old son awaiting his mission call.

How proud I was of this fine family as I read the reporter\u2019s account. What a positive impression was made upon him.

These individuals inevitably are judged \u201cguilty by association.\u201d To be judged fairly, we must avoid the very appearance of evil. We would do well to remember the words quoted by President McKay: \u201cWhate\u2019er thou art, act well thy part.\u201d (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Cherished Experiences,<\/span> comp. Claire Middlemiss, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1955, pp. 174\u201375.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p25\" class=\"\">Character is revealed under pressure. Let me illustrate. A few years ago, Elder Gordon B. Hinckley related this inspiring story:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cI talked with a young man recently returned from the war. He too had walked the jungle patrols, his heart pounding with fear. But reluctantly he admitted that the greatest fear he had was the fear of ridicule.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cThe men of his company laughed at him, taunted him, plastered him with a nickname that troubled him. They told him the things they reveled in. Then on one occasion when the going was rough, he faced them and quietly said, \u2018Look, I know you think I\u2019m a square. I don\u2019t consider myself any better than any of the rest of you. \u2026 But I grew up in a different way. I grew up in a religious home and a religious town. I went to church on Sundays. We prayed together as a family. I was taught to stay away from these things. It\u2019s just that I believe differently. With me it\u2019s a matter of religion, and it\u2019s kind of a way of respecting my mother and my dad. All of you together might force me toward a compromising situation, but that wouldn\u2019t change me, and you wouldn\u2019t feel right after you\u2019d done it.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cOne by one they turned silently away. But during the next few days each came to ask his pardon, and from his example others gained the strength and the will to change their own lives. He taught the gospel to two of them and brought them into the church.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Church News,<\/span> 29 Apr. 1972, p. 14.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p29\" class=\"\">As Church members, we all benefit when one of us is honorable and righteous. Some years ago I made a speech at a business convention. When I concluded, a distinguished gentleman came up to me and asked, \u201cAre you a Mormon?\u201d I responded, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201cI am associated with John Russon, a member of your church. He is the finest practicing Christian I have had the pleasure to know.\u201d To him, and I\u2019m sure to countless others, Brother Russon, now the president of the St. George Temple, is a reliable witness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p30\" class=\"\">One of our greatest needs is for true witnesses among our youth. Young people need models from their own generation. Thankfully we have a tremendous army of latter-day sons and daughters of Helaman, stripling \u201cSaturday\u2019s warriors,\u201d who are not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Rather, they have turned this commitment to the Lord into an advantage. Let me tell you of one.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p31\" class=\"\">Steve Hawes is the student body president at New Canaan High School in Connecticut. Of its twenty-three hundred students, only twenty-four are Latter-day Saints. Steve ran unopposed in a landslide election. This is impressive. But even more impressive is Steve\u2019s moral courage\u2014his commitment to living the principles of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p32\" class=\"\">The Hawes family lived for a time in Tampa, Florida. Steve played junior high football and basketball. When his family was preparing to move to Connecticut, the coach told Steve\u2019s father how much he appreciated and admired Steve, not just because he is a fine athlete, but because of his deep religious convictions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p33\" class=\"\">\u201cHe doesn\u2019t preach sermons; he just quietly lives his religion each day. I remember,\u201d said the coach, \u201ca group of us were in the squad room, and one of the boys pulled out a copy of <span class=\"emphasis\">Playboy<\/span> magazine. They opened to the centerfold and began to make some vulgar comments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/hold-up-your-light.p34\" class=\"\">\u201cI noticed Steve walk away, so I followed him and asked if anything was wrong.
