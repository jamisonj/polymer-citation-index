Each one of us developed physically within our mother\u2019s womb while relying for many months on her body to sustain ours. Eventually, however, the process of birth\u2014dramatic for both mother and child\u2014separated us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/discovering-the-divinity-within.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">As a baby emerges into this world, the change of temperature and light and the sudden release of pressure on the chest induce the baby to take its first gasping breath. Those little lungs suddenly fill with air for the first time, the organs spring into action, and the baby begins to breathe. As the umbilical cord is clamped, that lifeline between mother and baby is forever severed, and the baby\u2019s life on earth begins.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/discovering-the-divinity-within.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">Job said, \u201cThe Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-12461_000_005\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130965\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130965)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130965)\">Job 33:4<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-womens-session\/discovering-the-divinity-within.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">We come into this world \u201ctrailing clouds of glory.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-12461_000_005\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cOde: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">The Complete Poetical Works of William Wordsworth<\/span> (1924), 359.]<\/span><\/sup> \u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\u201d teaches that each one of us \u201cis a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents\u201d and \u201ceach has a divine nature and destiny.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-12461_000_005\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> or <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Nov. 2010, 129.]<\/span><\/sup> Heavenly Father generously shares a portion of His divinity within us.
