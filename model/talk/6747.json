I never get over the tremendous responsibility of speaking to the Latter-day Saints. I am grateful for your kindness and for your forbearance. I constantly pray that I may be worthy of the confidence of the people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith.p5\" class=\"\">I have recently come from a very long journey. It has been wearisome, but it has been wonderful to be out among the Saints. If it were possible I would turn all of the day-to-day administrative matters of the Church over to others, and then I would spend my time out among our people, visiting those in small branches as well as those in large stakes. I would wish to gather with the Saints wherever they may be. I feel that every member of this Church is deserving of a visit. I regret that because of physical limitations I can no longer shake hands with everybody. But I can look them in the eye with gladness in my heart and express my love and leave a blessing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith.p6\" class=\"\">The occasion for this most recent journey was the rededication of the Freiberg Germany Temple and the dedication of The Hague Netherlands Temple. It was my opportunity to dedicate the Freiberg temple 17 years ago. It was a rather modest building constructed in what was then the German Democratic Republic, the east zone of a divided Germany. Its construction was literally a miracle. President Monson, Hans Ringger, and others had won the goodwill of East German government officials who consented to it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith.p7\" class=\"\">It has served marvelously well through these years. Now the infamous wall is gone. It is easier for our people to travel to Freiberg. The building was worn after these years and had become inadequate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith.p8\" class=\"\">The temple has been enlarged and made much more beautiful and serviceable. We held just one session of dedication. Saints gathered from a vast area. In the large room where we sat, we could look into the faces of many of those rugged and solid and wonderful Latter-day Saints who through all of these years, in sunshine and in shadow, under government-imposed restraint and now in perfect freedom, have kept the faith, served the Lord, and stood like giants. I am so sorry that I could not throw my arms around these heroic brethren and sisters and tell them how much I love them. If they are now hearing me, I hope that they will know of that love and will pardon my hurried departure from their midst.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith.p9\" class=\"\">From there we flew to France to take care of Church business. We then flew to Rotterdam and drove to The Hague. Work in three nations in one day is a rather heavy schedule for an old man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith.p10\" class=\"\">The following day we dedicated The Hague Netherlands Temple. Four sessions were held. What a touching and wonderful experience that was.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith.p11\" class=\"\">The temple is a beautiful structure in a good area. I am so grateful for the house of the Lord which will accommodate the Saints of the Netherlands, Belgium, and parts of France. Missionaries were first sent to that part of Europe way back in 1861. Thousands have joined the Church. Most of them emigrated to the States. But we have there now a wonderful body of precious and faithful Latter-day Saints who are deserving of a house of the Lord in their midst.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith.p12\" class=\"\">I determined that while in that part of the world we would go to other areas. We accordingly flew to Kiev in Ukraine. I was there 21 years ago. There is a new sense of freedom in the air. What an inspiration to meet with more than 3,000 Ukrainian Saints. The people gathered from far and near, enduring great discomfort and expense to get there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith.p13\" class=\"\">One family could not afford to bring all of its members.

I was there 21 years ago also, and there is a change. It is like electricity. You cannot see it. But you can feel it. Here again we had a wonderful meeting, with opportunity to converse with important government officials as we had done in Ukraine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith.p15\" class=\"\">What a priceless and precious privilege to meet with these wonderful Saints who have been gathered \u201cone of a city, and two of a family\u201d into the fold of Zion in fulfillment of the prophecy of Jeremiah (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"26439\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26439)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26439)\">Jer. 3:14<\/a><\/span>). Life is not easy for them. Their burdens are heavy. But their faith is secure, and their testimonies are vibrant.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith.p16\" class=\"\">In these faraway places, strange to most of the Church, the gospel flame burns brightly and lights the way for thousands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith.p17\" class=\"\">We then flew to Iceland. It is a beautiful place with beautiful people. Here we had a long interview with the president of the nation, a very distinguished and able man who has been to Utah and speaks very generously of our people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith.p18\" class=\"\">Again we met with the Saints.
