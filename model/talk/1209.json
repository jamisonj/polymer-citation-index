May the Holy\nSpirit dictate what is said, and then it will be the truth, and may that same Spirit, which is the\nSpirit of truth, accompany the spoken word to our edification and blessing.\n<\/p><p>\nA brief explanation of our interpretation and acceptance of the most fundamental of all\nChristian doctrines may assist both friends and members to answer the recurring question: Are\nthe Latter-day Saints, or Mormons, Christians?\n<\/p><p>\nWe might with profit, and we hope with some interest, consider the question: What does it\nmean to be a Christian? The dictionary defines a Christian as one who follows the precepts\nand example of Jesus Christ, or one whose life is conformed to the doctrines of Jesus of\nNazareth.\n<\/p><p>\nNow we cannot, of course this morning discuss, nor could we hardly enumerate the various\nsaving principles of the gospel of Christ, but there is one doctrinal event which foreshadows\nand overshadows all other Christian doctrine. I refer to the atonement of Christ, and it would\nseem that this would be appropriate, as we approach the Easter time. \"We believe that through\nthe Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances\nof the Gospel\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6766\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6766)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6766)\">A of F 1:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFaith in this one transcendent event, the most important in all history, is the enduring\nfoundation upon which the true Christian gospel is built. Upon it, the\nsalvation of the whole human family depends. He who understands and accepts the full\nsignificance of the vicarious sacrifice of Jesus Christ and conforms to the principles and\nordinances which that acceptance enjoins may be properly classified as a Christian. But there\nmust be more than mere lip service; faith alone is not sufficient.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus said: \"Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he\nthat doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35170\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35170)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35170)\">Matt. 7:20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhat must one do to become a Christian or to be saved is an ancient and oft-repeated\nquestion which was answered by Peter, the apostle, on the day of Pentecost, when through his\npowerful sermon the people were convinced and pricked in their hearts and cried out: \"Men\nand brethren, what shall we do?\" and the apostle said, \". . . Repent, and be baptized every one\nof you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of\nthe Holy Ghost\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7890\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7890)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7890)\">Acts 2:38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nForgiveness on terms of repentance is a basic Christian principle. But is one saved by merely\nmeeting these preliminary requirements? The Apostle Paul, in one of his dynamic letters, said,\nspeaking of these principles: \". . . let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the\nfoundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24297\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24297)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24297)\">Heb. 6:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he adds that the work of perfecting the Saints (the people of the Church in former days\nwere known as Saints) must continue \"Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the\nknowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the\nfulness of Christ\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21740\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21740)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21740)\">Eph. 4:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSalvation is a continuing, on-going process. It is eternally improving, achieving,\nbecoming&mdash;yes, and overcoming. In some ways it may be analogous to education, which is a continuous\nprocess of overcoming ignorance. When is a man educated? When is a man saved? We\nbelieve a man is saved no faster than he gains knowledge for \"the glory of God is\nintelligence (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"14196\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14196)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14196)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIs a man educated when he enrolls in college, or when he gets his bachelor's, his master's or\ndoctorate? Yes, relatively, he is an educated man, but he still has a lifetime&mdash;an eternity, in\nfact, in which to pursue knowledge and truth. The highest reaches of life are but embryonic in\nthe light of eternity, and man has every reason to hope that a future life will afford him full\nscope for larger and fuller achievement.\n<\/p><p>\nThis Church, which bears Christ's name, has from the beginning uniformly taught that faith in\nthe Lord Jesus Christ is the first saving principle of the gospel, but as the poet tells us,\n\"Heaven is not gained by a single bound, but we build the ladders by which we rise, from the\nlowly earth to the vaulted skies, and mount to its summit round by round.\"\n<\/p><p>\nFaith must be confirmed and demonstrated by active acceptance of all the other principles and\nordinances taught by him whose name is incorporated in the word Christian.\n<\/p><p>\nWe do not claim to understand fully the atonement in all of its limitless scope and infinite\nblessing; but God has revealed enough detail concerning the need, purpose, and universal\napplication of the atonement of Christ to justify the doctrine that the resurrection from the\ndead is assured to all men.\n<\/p><p>\nJohn said: \"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were\nopened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged\nout of those things which were written in the books, according to their works\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42326\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42326)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42326)\">Rev. 20:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nEternal life and exaltation, however, made possible by the vicarious sacrifice of Christ may be\nprogressively attained by man's voluntary co-operation with divine will and purpose. When\nwe think of any reconciliation or appeasement or settlement, we consider it in connection with\nsome previous act or event of which it is a sequel. For instance, a treaty of peace is a sequel\nof war. A settlement of a claim or an obligation implies there has been an account with a\ndebit balance. When we speak of the atonement wrought by Jesus Christ, we\nenvision an unpaid debt, and antecedent transgression; something to atone for.\n<\/p><p>\nAll students of the Bible who accept the New Testament see in his atonement a sequel to the\ntransgression of Adam, generally known as the Fall of Adam. Through the Fall, Adam and\nEve and all their posterity became subject to bodily disintegration and death and also to\nbanishment from the presence of God, which is in the nature of spiritual death, and this\ndespite the fact that the cause was individual transgression. By the individual atonement of\nChrist, free redemption from the transgression of Adam is assured to all. Paul assures us that:\n\". . . since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"356\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 356)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(356)\">1 Cor. 15:21-22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe transgression of Adam, together with all of its consequences, was foreseen and the\nexpiation provided for before the foundations of the world were laid. In that primeval council,\nof which the scriptures speak, when \"all the sons of God shouted for joy\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26704\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26704)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26704)\">Job 38:7<\/a><\/span>),\nChrist offered himself as a ransom. He was not coerced or required to make this sacrifice. His\nfree agency was in no way infringed or trammeled. It was a freewill, love-inspired offer,\nwhich could have been withdrawn at any time. It was optional until the very time of his\ncrucifixion. He gently rebuked Peter, you remember, who would have defended him with a\nsword at the time of the betrayal, and Jesus said: \"Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my\nFather, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35205\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35205)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35205)\">Matt. 26:53<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe question is sometimes asked: Why was such a sacrifice of God's beloved Son permitted\nor accepted? Why not let someone else pay that debt? Why not Adam?\n<\/p><p>\nThe answer is found in the fact that of all the sons of God, only Christ could qualify, because\nhe was the only sinless man who ever walked the earth. Furthermore, he was the First\nBegotten, the eldest of the sons of God in the spirit, and the Only Begotten in the flesh, and\ntherefore the only one who possessed the full powers of Godhood and manhood. Hear him\nrefer to that premortal existence in the most beautiful prayer on record, found in the 17th\nchapter of John, he prayed: \"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the\nglory which I had with thee before the world was\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28036\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28036)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28036)\">John 17:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nChrist was the only one wholly free from the dominion of Satan, the only one possessed of\npower to hold death in abeyance and to die only as he willed so to do, the only one who\ncould conquer death. He said: \"For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the\nSon to have life in himself\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28009\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28009)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28009)\">John 5:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again: \"Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take\nit again.\n<\/p><p>\n\"No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I\nhave power to take it again\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28022\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28022)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28022)\">John 10:17-18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnother question is sometimes heard: Why should Christ have volunteered to make this\nsacrifice? What was the motive that inspired and sustained him from the time of that council\nin heaven until the moment of his agonized cry, \"It is finished\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28037\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28037)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28037)\">John 19:30<\/a><\/span>)?\n<\/p><p>\nThe answer to this question is twofold: first, his undeviating devotion to his Father's will. He\nsaid: \". . . My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28006\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28006)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28006)\">John 4:34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSecond was his supernal and all-embracing love for mankind, who, without his mediation,\nwould have remained in the total gloom of desiring without hope throughout eternity.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the late President Taylor very beautifully and very truthfully said, speaking of the\natonement: \"Is justice dishonored? No; it is satisfied, the debt is paid. Is righteousness\ndeparted from? No; this is a righteous act. All requirements are met. Is judgment violated?\nNo, its demands are fulfilled. Is mercy triumphant? No; she simply claims her own. Justice,\njudgment, mercy and truth all harmonize as the attributes of Deity. 'Justice and truth have met\ntogether, righteousness and peace have kissed each other.' Justice and\njudgment triumph as well as mercy and peace\" (<i>The Mediation and Atonement<\/i>, 1950 edition,\np. 167).\n<\/p><p>\nWhat was the alternative to the atonement? What if there had been no atonement? If there had\nbeen no atonement, all men would have been doomed to eternal death, for unless Christ had\nbroken its bonds, death would have been victorious. All who died before the Meridian of\nTime were still in their graves when Christ came forth triumphantly from the tomb and broke\nthe bonds that held them captive.\n<\/p><p>\nMatthew records that: \". . . the graves were opened; and many bodies of the Saints which\nslept arose,\n<\/p><p>\n\"And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared\nunto many\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35206\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35206)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35206)\">Matt. 27:52-53<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThus he became the first fruits of them that slept\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"355\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 355)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(355)\">1 Cor. 15:20<\/a><\/span>). When the Apostle Paul comprehended the\nfull meaning of this unprecedented event, he joyfully exclaimed: \"O death, where is thy sting?\nO grave, where is thy victory?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"359\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 359)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(359)\">1 Cor. 15:55<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Jesus comforted and reassured all the grieving Marthas of the world with these immortal\nwords: \". . . I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead,\nyet shall he live: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28024\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28024)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28024)\">John 11:25-26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBut the victory over death is not the only benefit arising from the atonement of the Messiah;\nhis atonement not only liberated all men from eternal death but, through the atonement,\nforgiveness of our individual sins may be obtained. He made it possible for us, through faith,\nrepentance, and continued righteousness, to obtain absolution from the effects of personal sins.\nOne does not get the full benefit of the atonement simply by acknowledging it.\n<\/p><p>\nMen cannot be saved in their sins because, by divine decree, no unclean thing can enter the\nkingdom of heaven\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50003\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50003)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50003)\">Alma 11:37<\/a><\/span>); however, through repentance, baptism, and the power of the Holy Ghost,\nmen may be saved from their sins (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50004\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50004)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50004)\">3 Ne. 27:19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNo man can by one single act, however great or sincere, free himself from the necessity for\nthat \"patient continuance in well doing\" of which Paul speaks\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42754\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42754)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42754)\">Rom. 2:7<\/a><\/span>).\nHe must still follow the Master\nand endure to the end. Jesus plainly and impressively taught this truth to the young man who\ncame to him saying: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?\n<\/p><p>\n\"And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God:\nbut if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.\n<\/p><p>\n\"He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit\nadultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness\n<\/p><p>\n\"Honor thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I\nyet?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor,\nand thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35190\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35190)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35190)\">Matt. 19:16-21<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nIt is not enough therefore merely to keep the commandments or obey the law nor even to sell\nall and give to the poor. The final requirement is to follow the Master. The poet has us sing: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Jesus, I my cross have taken, all to leave and follow thee<br \/>\n\"Naked, poor, despised, forsaken, thou from hence my all shall be.<br \/>\n\"Perish every fond ambition, all I've thought, or hoped, or known; <br \/>\n\"Yet how rich is my condition, God and Heaven are still my own!\"\n<\/p><p>\nThat all men are sinners in varying degrees is repeatedly affirmed in the New Testament. Paul\nwrote to the Romans: \"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42755\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42755)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42755)\">Rom. 3:23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd John adds: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in\nus\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1062\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1062)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1062)\">1 Jn. 1:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPeter, said: \"And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue\nknowledge;<br \/>\n\"And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;<br \/>\n\"And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.<br \/>\n\"For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor\nunfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4868\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4868)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4868)\">2 Pet. 1:5-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat the blessings of the atonement are to be made available not only to all who lived before\nthe time of Christ but also to all who die without an opportunity to hear the gospel is\nevidenced by Peter's declaration: \"For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them\nthat are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to\nGod in the spirit\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2289\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2289)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2289)\">1 Pet. 4:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior himself confirms this as follows: \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is\ncoming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear\nshall live\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28007\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28007)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28007)\">John 5:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn answer to the question then, what does it mean to be a Christian and are we Christians, we\nreply that the doctrines we teach are Christian by every test of the scripture and of revelation.\nIn practice we confess we often fall short. However, we are earnestly trying to bring our lives\ninto complete harmony with his laws and thus become entitled to the full blessings of the\natonement and become progressively better Christians.\n<\/p><p>\nNo one of us is justified in praying as did the Pharisee of old, \"God, I thank thee, that I am\nnot as other men\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31569\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31569)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31569)\">Luke 18:11<\/a><\/span>).\nThere is no room in the true Christian life for an attitude\nof \"holier than thou.\" Each one who claims to be a Christian could with better grace pray as\ndid the publican, \"God be merciful to me, a sinner\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31570\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31570)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31570)\">Luke 18:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHumbly we bear witness that God is a reality; he is personal and is our Father; that Jesus of\nNazareth is the Redeemer and Savior of the world; that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been\nrestored to the earth, and we wish all men could hear and accept that message.\n<\/p><p>\nAs Peter said in answer to the Savior's question, \"Whom say ye that I am?\" we say with him\n\"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35182\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35182)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35182)\">Matt. 16:15-16<\/a><\/span>).
