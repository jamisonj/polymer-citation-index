During these six sessions the\nGeneral Authorities of the Church have set forth impressively and dearly the paramount need\nthat the Gospel of Jesus Christ permeate the hearts of men, and that the Spirit thereof direct\nthe nations of the world. The standards and ideals of the Church have been set forth most\nsincerely and impressively. Earnest appeals have been made to all members, and particularly\nto the young men and women, that they subscribe their lives in conformity with the standards\nand ideals of righteousness. Impressively the Authorities have urged you men to be real\nguides, leaders and exemplars to the membership of the Church and to all men.\n<\/p><p>\nNow in conclusion, brethren, I repeat the words of the Lord to the Priesthood of His Church:\n\"Wherefore now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is\nappointed in all diligence. He that is slothful and will not learn his duty shall not be worthy to\nstand, and he that shows himself not approved, shall not be counted worthy to stand\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50083\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50083)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50083)\">D&amp;C 107:99-100<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBLESSINGS INVOKED\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you, brethren. God bless the membership of the Church throughout the world. May\nHis peace be with our brethren and sisters over in the war-torn countries; be with them in the\nislands of the sea, and our brethren who are there presiding, that the Spirit of the Almighty\nmight be with them under all conditions to comfort them and guide them.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless our boys who are at the front, fighting for freedom, offering their lives that this\nworld may again have peace. May the Lord's comforting influence be with the parents whose\nboys have already made the supreme sacrifice. May these parents and loved ones know that\nno bomb can end the life of one who thus offers himself; it may silence his heart beats, but\nhe lives because man is immortal. May our soldier boys so live that no matter what comes to\nthem, they may have in their hearts the eternal truth that \"he that liveth and believeth in\nChrist shall never die\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50084\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50084)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50084)\">John 11:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSYLVESTER Q. CANNON ABSENT BECAUSE OF ILLNESS\n<\/p><p>\nYou have noticed that one of the Twelve has been absent from this Conference. Elder\nSylvester Q. Cannon has, on account of illness, been unable to meet with us. We pray that the\ncomforting influence of the Holy Spirit will be with him, with Sister Cannon, and with other\nloved ones who are now administering to Elder Cannon's needs.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us all so to live that we may be truly worthy of the trust that God has placed in us,\nI pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
