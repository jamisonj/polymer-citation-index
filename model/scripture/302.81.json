[{"Verse":"0","Text":"<i>Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, March 1832. HC 1:257\u2013258. Frederick G. Williams is called to be a high priest and a counselor in the Presidency of the High Priesthood. The historical records show that when this revelation was received in March 1832, it called Jesse Gause to the office of counselor to Joseph Smith in the Presidency. However, when he failed to continue in a manner consistent with this appointment, the call was subsequently transferred to Frederick G. Williams. The revelation (dated March 1832) should be regarded as a step toward the formal organization of the First Presidency, specifically calling for the office of counselor in that body and explaining the dignity of the appointment. Brother Gause served for a time, but was excommunicated from the Church in December 1832. Brother Williams was ordained to the specified office on March 18, 1833.<\/i>"},{"Verse":"1","Text":"Verily, verily, I say unto you my servant Frederick G.
