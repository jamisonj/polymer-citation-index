Ai was a smaller city than Jericho, with fewer defenders, and Joshua thought to conquer it with only 3,000 soldiers. But the men of Ai smote the force of Israel and put them to flight. Joshua prostrated himself before the Lord and queried the reason for their defeat. Then came the answer, and a lesson.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/made-like-unto-the-son-of-god.p5\" class=\"\">When Jericho was destroyed, the Lord forbade them from taking any of the precious possessions to be found therein. But one man, Achan, seized and attempted to hide some of the spoils. \u201cWhen I saw [them],\u201d he said, \u201cI coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30151\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30151)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30151)\">Josh. 7:21<\/a><\/span>).

Elder James E. Talmage observed, \u201cA law of righteousness had been violated, and things that were accursed had been introduced into the camp of the covenant people; this transgression interposed resistance to the current of divine help, and until the people had sanctified themselves the power was not renewed unto them\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Articles of Faith,<\/span> 12th ed.

It is power to convey the mind and will of God in Church government, in obtaining His word through revelation, in preaching the gospel, and in administering the ordinances of exaltation for both the living and the dead.

This requires each one of us to serve with diligence, to teach with faith and testimony, to lift and strengthen those whose lives we touch. This means that we cannot live only unto ourselves, but we are also responsible for the growth, development, and welfare of others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/made-like-unto-the-son-of-god.p12\" class=\"\">There should be nothing automatic about ordination to any office of the priesthood because of age or circumstances. Blessed be the priesthood leader who conscientiously interviews each candidate for priesthood office and receives from that candidate a report of prior honorable service, an affirmation of personal purity and worthiness, and a confirmation of magnified effort and future intent to willingly bear and fulfill the great responsibility of priesthood office.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/made-like-unto-the-son-of-god.p13\" class=\"\">There should be nothing casual, nonchalant, or indifferent about holding priesthood.

Jesus Christ is the great high priest of God. He is the source of all priesthood authority and power on this earth.
