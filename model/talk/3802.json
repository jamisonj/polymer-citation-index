I have so many happy memories of my boyhood. During those delightful summer and winter evenings we created most of our own activities and amusement. They were wonderful days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/the-sacrament.p4\" class=\"\">The most important building in our town in addition to the schoolhouse was our ward meetinghouse. The chapel had an imposing, two-tiered, elevated stand. The stand was quite large, and the first raised portion had a table for the ward clerk at one end and a piano at the other end, and right in the center of this elevated area was the sacrament table. On the highest level of the stand was the pulpit with its red plush cover and beautifully carved chairs with red plush seats for the bishopric or visiting authorities. On the rear wall of the chapel were two impressive oil paintings, one of the Kirtland Temple and the other of the Salt Lake Temple. Everyone in attendance had a clear view of the stately pulpit and, of course, the sacrament table.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/the-sacrament.p5\" class=\"\">Sacrament meetings were very special occasions. The Lord instructed that \u201cit is expedient that the church meet together often to partake of bread and wine in the remembrance of the Lord Jesus.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17952\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17952)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17952)\">D&amp;C 20:75<\/a><\/span>.) We of the Aaronic Priesthood knew it was special. We were well trained. We knew exactly what we should do. We had been taught at home and in our quorum meetings of the high honor placed on us as holders of God\u2019s holy priesthood, which authorized us to perform sacred ordinances of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/the-sacrament.p6\" class=\"\">As a deacon, I vividly recall how we admired the two priests seated up on the first level of the raised platform who would administer the blessing on the sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper. Everyone in the meetinghouse could see them. I\u2019m sure they felt the importance of the occasion. They were neatly dressed in their best clothes and well prepared.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/the-sacrament.p7\" class=\"\">The bishopric, seated in their special chairs, were on the stand above the priests. Everyone could see them. The priests acted and looked as dignified as the bishopric.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/the-sacrament.p8\" class=\"\">As deacons and teachers we sat on the first row, prepared to pass the sacrament. I recall how shiny the bread trays appeared, and the individual glass cups for the water sparkled. Everything about the sacrament table, including the linen, was immaculate and ready on time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/the-sacrament.p9\" class=\"\">Everyone was expected to sing the special sacrament hymn. Everyone did sing. Children were trained not only to be reverent but to know some of the words to the most familiar sacrament songs. I can still see Sister Ella Jack, who led the music, standing in full view between the sacrament table and piano, as she would pause and look over the congregation to be sure everyone had a songbook and was ready to sing. She gave special attention to see that the Aaronic Priesthood boys had songbooks. We would all sing. We were learning in our youth that to feel of the Spirit we must experience a change in our hearts, and to be in harmony on this sacred occasion required our singing the sacrament hymns. As we personally sang the words, our souls were better prepared to understand this sacred ordinance. At the Last Supper the early Apostles joined with the Savior in singing. Matthew records, \u201cAnd when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36961\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36961)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36961)\">Matt. 26:30<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/the-sacrament.p10\" class=\"\">And as we would sing in that sacrament meeting \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">In humility, our Savior,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Grant thy Spirit here, we pray;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">As we bless the bread and water<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">In thy name, this holy day.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Let me not forget, O Savior,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Thou didst bleed and die for me<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">When thy heart was stilled and broken<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">On the cross at Calvary.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Fill our hearts with sweet forgiving;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Teach us tolerance and love;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Let our prayers find access to thee<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">In thy holy courts above.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Then, when we have proven worthy<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Of thy sacrifice divine,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Lord, let us regain thy presence;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Let thy glory round us shine.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/the-sacrament.p27\" class=\"\">(<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 49.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/the-sacrament.p28\" class=\"\">These words would be impressed upon our hearts because we had actually sung them.

We didn\u2019t have printed cards, but the twentieth section of the Doctrine and Covenants was open if needed. There were no microphones or speakers. The priests were taught to read slowly and distinctly and to enunciate clearly that everyone might hear and understand the words of this sacred prayer, every word of which was given to us by the Savior Himself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/the-sacrament.p30\" class=\"\">Our quorum advisers schooled us in our priesthood meeting on the sacredness of the ordinance of the sacrament\u2014how our thoughts should be about the Savior, of His sacrifice for us\u2014the importance of our dress and appearance, and of this quiet opportunity to resolve in our own minds to do better in keeping all of the commandments. We carefully watched our own priests officiate in a sacred procedure somewhat similar to the very first such occasion and heard them recite a divinely directed blessing upon the bread and water in remembrance of the flesh and blood of our Savior. As the priest publicly addresses our Eternal Father in Heaven, he might, if spiritually in tune, visualize in his mind a loving Heavenly Father listening to his humble plea,<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/the-sacrament.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cO God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it, that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17953\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17953)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17953)\">D&amp;C 20:77<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/the-sacrament.p32\" class=\"\">I wish the Aaronic Priesthood boys throughout the Church could have the same opportunity of hearing Elder Howard W.

He was the spokesman for all of the Apostles in addressing our Heavenly Father. Every word in the sacrament ordinance is vital.
