The Savior has commanded that we should \u201ctrifle not with sacred things\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11062\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11062)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11062)\">D&amp;C 6:12<\/a><\/span>). The temple and the holy ordinances are indeed sacred, and we should be spiritually sensitive to them. It is a sacred blessing to attend the temple to worship the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/enhancing-our-temple-experience.p6\" class=\"\">There is a difference in just attending the temple and having a rich spiritual experience. The real blessings of the temple come as we enhance our temple experience.

Reverence is an expression of deep respect, honor, and adoration for the Lord. It is having reverence for His name, for His words, for His ordinances and covenants, for His servants, for His chapels, and for His temples.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/enhancing-our-temple-experience.p9\" class=\"\">It is an outward indication of an inner feeling that we have for Him. We should always remember that it is by His invitation that we come to His holy house, the temple of the Lord. We should respond to His invitation by being worthy, by being prepared, and by having the temple as a priority in our lives. While in the temple we should act as if we are in His holy presence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/enhancing-our-temple-experience.p10\" class=\"\">To be reverent is not just to be quiet. It involves an awareness of what is taking place. It involves a divine desire to learn and to be receptive to the promptings of the Spirit. It involves a striving to seek added light and knowledge. Irreverence is not only an act of disrespect for Deity, but it makes it impossible for the Spirit to teach us the things that we need to know.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/enhancing-our-temple-experience.p11\" class=\"\">It is in the temple that we must speak in reverent tones.
