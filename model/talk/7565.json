I looked forward to being able to fulfill my priesthood assignments. As a young Primary boy, I watched the deacons in my ward very closely in anticipation of the day I would be 12 years old, receive the priesthood, and be able to pass the sacrament. That day finally arrived, and soon after being ordained by my father, who was the bishop of the ward, I felt ready, but nervous, to begin my duties as a new deacon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/do-you-know-who-you-are.p6\" class=\"\">I now belonged to a quorum of the Aaronic Priesthood. The members of my quorum became very best friends. That friendship and quorum brotherhood continued to grow through my youth as we learned and served together in our priesthood duties. We were all good friends and experienced a fun and enjoyable time being together in our quorum activities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/do-you-know-who-you-are.p7\" class=\"\">One Sunday following one of those warm and long sacrament meetings, the first counselor in our bishopric called me aside to talk to me. This unscheduled priesthood interview became a blessing in my life as I have pondered the question he asked during our brief but significant visit. Brother Bateman looked me in the eye and asked, \u201cDean, do you know who you are?\u201d There was complete silence, and then he gave me a quick and powerful reminder, \u201cYou are the son of Reid Burgess.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/do-you-know-who-you-are.p8\" class=\"\">The meaning and significance of that question has burned in my heart for a long time, and I often reflected on it throughout my teenage years. This good brother\u2019s question\u2014\u201cDo you know who you are?\u201d\u2014has given me inspired direction throughout my life and a commitment to bring respect and honor to my family and to the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/do-you-know-who-you-are.p9\" class=\"\">Tonight I would ask each one of you young men of the Aaronic Priesthood the very same question that I was asked as a young man, \u201cDo you know who you are?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/do-you-know-who-you-are.p10\" class=\"\">Knowing who you are makes you spiritually strong, sound, and steadfast in your priesthood duties.

He miraculously preserved King Lamoni\u2019s flocks and did all he could to serve the king. When hearing of Ammon\u2019s powerful acts, Lamoni questioned who Ammon really was.
