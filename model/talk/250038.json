Last evening I made quite a lengthy address in this hall; but we had very good order. There was no whispering, no talking, nor disturbance of any kind. It requires, in a large congregation like this, quite an exertion to speak so as to make the people hear. I am told that the people could not hear half of what was said by several of the brethren yesterday. It is wrong for us to have disorder in the house of God, a place where we meet for instruction. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n995\"> Last evening I talked of some matters of considerable importance to the Priesthood, of which there was an immense number present; they nearly filled this hall.

We will stand by the principles of eternal truth; living we will proclaim them, and dying we will be true to them, and after death will live again in their enjoyment in the eternal worlds. That is my feeling; so I don't feel very trembly in the knees, and I do not think you do, generally. I see sometimes a disposition to try to ignore some of the laws which God has introduced, and this is one of them. People want to slip round a corner, or creep out in some way. There is something very creepy about it. There was a man in former times we are told, came to Jesus by night. His name was Nicodemus.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"68687\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 68687)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(68687)\">John 3:1-2<\/a><\/span> He was one of those persons who did not like the daylight.

Nicodemus was a prominent man among the Jews, and he thought it might injure his reputation if he was seen visiting that Nazarene, to get instruction from Him, so he crawled in at night.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"68688\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 68688)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(68688)\">John 3:1-2<\/a><\/span> Jesus talked quite plainly to him, as you can read for yourselves;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"68760\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 68760)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(68760)\">John 3:3-21<\/a><\/span> but we find some folks of a similar kind now creeping around.

Congress made a law which would affect both; and cohabitation with more than one woman was  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"311a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0311.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;311a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8833\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>made a crime whether in polygamy or out of polygamy. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1028\"> 2nd. The Governor turned legislator, added to this law, and inserted in a test oath to officials, the following words regarding cohabitation, &#x201C;in the marriage relation;&#x201D; thus plainly and definitely sanctioning prostitution, without any law of the United States, or any authority. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1029\"> 3rd. The United States Commissioners, also, without legislation, adopted the action of the Governor, and still insisted on this interpolation, in the test oath in election matters, and placed all polygamists under this unconstitutional oath, and released prostitutes and their paramours from the obligations placed upon others. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1030\"> 4th. The Prosecuting Attorney has sanctioned these things, and pursued a similar course; and while he has asked all the &#x201C;Mormon&#x201D; jurors certain questions pertaining to their religious faith in the doctrines of the &#x201C;Mormon&#x201D; Church, and challenged them if they answered affirmatively as to their belief in polygamy, he has declined to ask other jurors whether they believed in prostitution, or whether they believed in cohabiting with more than one woman or not. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1031\"> 5th. Chief Justice Zane when appealed to on this question refused to interfere, or give any other ruling, and thus aided in packing the jury. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1032\"> Thus a law was first passed by Congress, which has been perverted by the administration, by all its officers who have officiated in this Territory, and made to subserve the interests of a party who have placed in their political platform an Anti-Mormon plank; and have clearly proven that there is a combination in all the officers of State, <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"311b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0311.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;311b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8833\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> officiating in this Territory, to back up this political intrigue in the interest of party, and at the sacrifice of law, equity, jurisprudence and all the safeguards that are provided by the Constitution for the protection of human rights. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1033\"> These (continued President Taylor) are some points that are of considerable importance. Similar things have been exhibited in former times&#x2014;an animus, a united operation against justice, equity and law, and, in our case, against the Constitution of the United States, and the rights and privileges and immunities of the Latter-day Saints. A law was framed professedly in the interest of purity and virtue. When it got here it was perverted and made to subserve the interest of prostitution and prostitutes; and the lowest class of men, who violate their marital relations, and trample under foot all principles of virtue and integrity, can go on our juries, can vote at the polls, through the intrigues of corrupt men; and they thus try to shackle a free people, bring them into bondage, and make slaves of them, unless they will bow to their infernal behests, and in the name of Israel's God we will not do it. [The congregation responded with a loud &#x201C;Amen.&#x201D;] We are not going to elevate prostitutes and men who violate their marital relations above men and women who are virtuous, honorable and upright. These are my feelings, and I am not afraid to proclaim them to the world. So much for these things. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1034\"> Do we want a class of men along with us that will submit to these kind of things, and are we to share in this hypocrisy, this infamy and degradation?

They are to cater to the virtuous (?) feelings of these honorable, high-minded, pure reformers that have come among us&#x2014;(Laughter)&#x2014;or what are they for? They are sanctioned, I am ashamed to say by the officers of government, and protected in their libidinous and degrading pursuits. How was it some time ago when the Edmunds law was first introduced? A son of Mayor Little was one of the election registrars. His father some years ago had had two wives&#x2014;I am sorry to say he has not got them now, they are dead&#x2014;and because some years before any law of this kind was in operation in the United States he had practiced plural marriage, his son was obliged to tell his father that he could not register. Shortly afterwards a notorious courtesan known as Kate Flint, with some of the inmates of her bagnio, drove up and requested to be registered. &#x201C;Why, of course.&#x201D; And this same gentleman that could not register his honorable father, who had never violated any law of the United States, had to endure the mortification of taking the names of these others and placing them on the list as respectable voters in our midst! About this time another non-Mormon came along to one of the other registration officers, and on partly reading the oath&#x2014;this test oath that had been prescribed&#x2014;said, &#x201C;I am afraid I can't take that!&#x201D; &#x201C;Why can't you take it?&#x201D; Well, he was an honest man among the Gentiles; he did not like to foreswear himself; so he said, &#x201C;I have a wife, and then I keep a mistress.&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh, well,&#x201D; says the man, &#x201C;read on a little further.&#x201D; He read on until he came to the words, &#x201C;<span class=\"italic\">in the marriage relation<\/span>.&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh, well, yes, I can take that,&#x201D; he said, and registered.

Now, do we want affiliation or association with such practices and principles as these? God forbid. And we want no falterers in our ranks. What shall we do? Live our religion, be true to our covenants, and keep the commandments of God. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1037\"> What shall the Presidents of Stakes do? Look after our Stakes, and if you find adulterers or adulteresses among you, don't permit them to go into the temples of God; for we won't have such people; they cannot be sanctioned by us, nor have our fellowship. We will not have them; the world may take the strumpets; they may wallow in their filth, but we will not have our holy places polluted by people calling themselves Latter-day Saints, who indulge in these abominable practices; we will not have them; and anybody who permits them to go into these holy places will have to be responsible for it. Many Bishops do it, they will be held responsible. Therefore, be careful, you Presidents of Stakes and you Bishops, how you act, and look well after your people, for be it understood that before our Lord Jesus Christ shall come, &#x201C;Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.&#x201D; (Psalms lxxxv, 13.)<span class=\"citation\" id=\"56994\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 56994)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(56994)\">Ps. 85:13<\/a><\/span> We are preparing ourselves to build up a Zion of God, and these people, whoremasters and whores, liars and hypocrites, will never get into the city of the living God, they will be found outside the gates.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"80874\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 80874)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(80874)\">Rev. 22:14-15<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1038\"> Now, have I any ill feelings towards these people that persecute and proscribe us?

I speak of these things therefore in our defense, and were we not accused by men void of honor and principle, I never would broach such a subject; for, I do not delight to dwell on the infamies, the corruptions and abominations of the world. I would rather speak of their good qualities and honorable principles, and I am thankful to say that there are thousands and tens of thousands and millions in these United States and in other nations who look with contempt upon all the chicanery, deception and fraud, whether of a moral, social, political, legislative, or judicial character; thousands and millions of men; I see many of them, very many of them, who <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"313b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0313.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;313b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8831\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> pass through here, men of note, of position in society from the United States, and from the different nations who call upon me from time to time, and express their sentiments pertaining to these matters. In order to sustain what I say, I will have Brother Cannon read over some statistics in regard to crime. We are, as I have said, represented as a very bad people, and I want to show a comparison between us and our reformers, or those that profess to be our reformers in relation to these matters. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1041\"> President Cannon then read the following, being the criminal statistics for the year 1883. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1042\"> &#x201C;The population of Utah may be estimated at 160,000 in 1883. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1043\"> &#x201C;Of these say 130,000 were Mormons, and 30,000 Gentiles, a very liberal estimate of the latter. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1044\"> &#x201C;In this year there were 46 persons sent to the Penitentiary convicted of crime. Of these 33 were non-Mormons, and 13 reputed Mormons. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1045\"> &#x201C;At the above estimate of population the ratio or percentage would be one prisoner to every 10,000 Mormons, or one hundredth of one per cent, and of the Gentiles one convict in every 909, or about one ninth of one percent. So that the actual proportion of criminals is more than ten times greater among the Gentiles of Utah, with the above very liberal estimate, than among the Mormons. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1046\"> &#x201C;It is urged that these non-Mormon prisoners are not a fair representation of the average of crime throughout the country, but are the result of the flow of the desperate classes westward to the borders of civilization; with greater truth we reply that the Mormon prisoners are not representatives of Mormonism, nor the results of Mormonism, but of the consequences of a departure  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"314a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0314.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;314a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8830\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>from Mormon principles; and of the 13 prisoners classed as &#x201C;Mormons,&#x201D; the greater portion were only so by family connection or association: <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1048\"> Arrests in Salt Lake City, 1883: Mormons, 150 Non-Mormons, 1,559 or more than ten times the number of Mormon arrests. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1049\"> &#x201C;Again, it is estimated that there are 6,000 non-Mormons, and 19,000 Mormons in Salt Lake City, which shows of Mormons one arrest in 126 2\/3. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1050\"> &#x201C;Non-Mormons one arrest in a fraction less than every four, or rather more than twenty-five percent.&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1051\"> As I have said before (continued President Taylor), if we were not on the defensive in this case, I would say nothing about these things; but it ill becomes men who have got ten criminals to our one to come here as our reformers, and try to disfranchise men who are ten times as good as they are. These are facts that are not of my getting up. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1052\"> They come from the public records and can be verified by the prison and other statistics. And the question is, how much of that rule do we want here? <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1053\"> The questionable honor is reserved to these advocates of &#x201C;advanced high moral ideas&#x201D; to trample upon all judicial precedents. It was not enough that an insignificant minority should have more than an equal showing with the majority, being equal in numbers in the drawing to make up a venire. It was not enough that every Mormon was questioned as to his religious faith, and that no Gentile was. It was not enough that all &#x201C;Mormons&#x201D; were excluded from this so-called &#x201C;<span class=\"italic\">impartial grand jury<\/span>,&#x201D; and that their avowed enemies were to be their judges.

We cannot respect and esteem such operations, and while we are desirous to place ourselves in conformity with all law, all order and all correct principle, yet we despise in our hearts this chicanery, hypocrisy, fraud and deception. But do we expect to see such things? Yes. Are we surprised at it? No. Why? Because we have been told over and over again, and the Elders have preached over and over again, and the Prophets have prophesied of it over and over again, that the world will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"76210\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 76210)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(76210)\">2 Tim. 3:13<\/a><\/span> Who is it that embarks in these things?

And there are many in this city who despise these things as they do the gates of hell, who are not associated with us in a religious capacity, many honorable men who have feelings of this kind, and then there are tens of thousands in the United States who possess the same feelings and the same abhorrence of this corruption, degradation and infamy that is sought to be palmed upon us. But while we can estimate these things at their worth, we can also estimate the actions of honorable men who are not of us at their true worth. Because a man is not a believer in our doctrines, that is no reason why he should not be an honorable man, for there are thousands and millions of them: it would be a pity if they were in the same condition as the others. But we as a people have to defend ourselves against the aggressions of an unscrupulous enemy who is instigated by the power of the adversary to overturn and destroy the truth today as he has done in other ages, in other nations and among other peoples. Therefore it becomes us to look well after our affairs, and protect ourselves as best we may from the calumnies, the reproach, and the infamies that are sought to be foisted upon us by an ungodly, hypocritical and corrupt people. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1056\"> Now, having got through with this, I want to refer to something else. It has been stated that the reason why we have so many of these criminals is because that the scum of society from the eastern States floats out here, and that therefore a rough, uncouth, lawless class finds its way into this community. Now, I want something read to you about some of these so called virtuous people in the east. <\/div> <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"315b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0315.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;315b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8829\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1057\"> President Cannon again read as follows: <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1058\"> Dr. Nathan Allen, of Lowell, has declared in a paper read before a late meeting of the American Social Science Association, that &#x201C;nowhere in the history of the world was the practice of abortion so common as in this country; and he gave expression to the opinion that, in New England alone, many thousands of abortions are procured annually.&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1059\"> Dr. Reamy, of the Ohio State Medical Society, says: &#x201C;From a very large verbal and written correspondence in this and other States, together with personal investigation and facts accumulated * * that we have become a <span class=\"italic\">nation of murderers<\/span>.&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1060\"> The Rev. Dr. Eddy writes to the <span class=\"italic\">Christian Advocate<\/span> regarding one little village of 1,000 inhabitants: &#x201C;Yet here, and elsewhere, 15 per cent of wives have the criminal hardihood to practice this black art, there is a still large and additional percent who endorse and defend it. * * Among married persons, so extensive has this practice become, that people of high repute not only commit this crime, but do not shun to speak boastingly among their intimates of the deed and the means of accomplishing it.&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1061\"> Dr. Allen further states: &#x201C;Examining the number of deaths, we find that there are absolutely more deaths than births among the strictly American children, so that aside from immigration and births of children of foreign parentage, the population of Massachusetts is rapidly decreasing. * * The birth rate in the State of New York, shows the same fact, that American families do not increase at all, and inspection of the registration in other States shows the same remark applies to all.&#x201D; <\/div> <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"316a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0316.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;316a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8828\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1063\"> Bishop Coxe, of the Protestant Episcopal Church of New York, in a pastoral letter to his people, writes: &#x201C;I have heretofore warned my flock against the blood guiltiness of antenatal infanticide. If any doubts existed heretofore as to the propriety of my warnings on this subject, they must now disappear before the fact that the world itself is beginning to be horrified by the practical results of the sacrifices to Moloch which defile our land. Again I warn you that they who do such things cannot inherit eternal life. If there be a special damnation for those who shed innocent blood, what must be the portion of those who have no mercy upon their own flesh.&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1064\"> Dr. Cowan, M.D., writing on what he styles &#x201C;the Murder of the Unborn,&#x201D; says: &#x201C;That this crime is not only widespread on this great continent, but is rapidly on the increase, we have the testimony of physicians, whose investigations have been thorough, and whose social standing and sincerity cannot be questioned.&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1065\"> President Taylor continuing said: These are the people that are coming here to reform us, and are so disgusted with our corruptions. Yet I am pleased to find that there are, once in a while, men who have the courage to speak against these damning evils. Bishop Coxe, of the Episcopal Church, is one of these men, and I honor such men whenever I hear of them, and should be glad at all times to extend to them all courtesies possible. Dr. Allen and Dr. Reamy are inspired, it seems, by the same detestation of these hellish, these fiendish, these outrageous acts. Yet from these people come our reformers, who are so horrified at the evils they see in Utah.

I am sorry to know that these things are as they are; but these are facts, and we do not feel very much honored with the association of such people. We do feel honored always to associate with honorable men and women; but with the seducer, with harlots, with thieves, with murderers of the innocents, no! never! no never! We want no association with them. As it is stated here by one of these reverend gentlemen in the East, speaking of these things, no murderer hath eternal life in him, nor no murderesses have eternal life in them.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"78720\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 78720)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(78720)\">1 Jn. 3:15<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n1067\"> I have had these things read to you for two reasons: First, to show the corruption that exists among these so-called virtuous people, honorable people, pure people, who are so shocked at the atrocities that take place in Utah. Another reason is that I want to warn our brethren and sisters against these infamies, and against permitting these filthy wretches to come into their houses. They are too low, too debased, too corrupt; and I speak of it because I know what I am talking about; there are some of these people crawling around us like so many vipers, and insinuating their hellish, murderous practices into the families of some who call themselves Latter-day Saints. Woe! to such Saints. You cannot have a place among us. No woman murderer, no man murderer can have a place among the Latter-day Saints, and I speak of it that the Presidents of Stakes and the Bishops may be apprised of these  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"317a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0317.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;317a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8827\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>things.

Watch well and know well what you are doing, when you sign recommends for doubtful characters to go into these holy places. We do not want them there. It is not their place, and you will have to account for your acts if you permit these things knowingly. It is necessary that you should be particular about these matters, for you will have to answer for your doings as I have for mine.

I call upon you if you know of adulterers or adulteresses, or people that practice these unnatural infamies, to sever them from the Church; they shall not have a place in the Church and Kingdom of God. Mr. Murray here, and others, may make laws and test oaths, with provisions in them to screen the adulterer, the whoremonger, and the seducer; but we will tear that away from our people, and all such shall have no place with Israel, and all who are in favor of it, signify it by saying, &#x201C;Aye.&#x201D; [The congregation responded with a loud &#x201C;Aye.&#x201D;] These are our feelings, and it is some of these things which has led me to talk as plainly as I have done in regard to some of these other matters.
