As you may know, it is not a short ride, so I engaged in a rather lengthy conversation with the driver.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p4\" class=\"\">I learned an unforgettable lesson from this black man. He was a big fellow. He weighed at least 250 pounds. He said he was the father of three sons, that his oldest was fourteen. The father was a regular employee of the U.S. Postal Service, and to augment his income, he drove a taxi in the afternoon when he finished his postal shift. \u201cBut,\u201d said he, \u201cI\u2019m always home every evening for dinner.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p5\" class=\"\">I said, \u201cYour wife must be an excellent cook.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cShe is,\u201d he said. But that wasn\u2019t the main reason he came home at that hour. He could have eaten later. \u201cThe reason I come home early is to be with my boys,\u201d he said. \u201cMy fourteen-year-old is almost as tall as I am. In a few years I\u2019ll no longer be able to handle him physically. When that time comes, I know he will only be obedient if he knows of my love and respect for him and also feels love and respect for me. So every evening we play ball or do homework together, or I just listen to him tell of his day. There are times,\u201d said he, \u201cwhen time with a boy is more important than money, or the things money can buy.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p7\" class=\"\">Recently, I\u2019ve been thinking how the example we set will be reflected in the conduct and lives of our children\u2014for good or ill. For instance, I\u2019ve been concerned about what goes through a boy\u2019s mind when he hears his dad quarrel with or speak unkindly to his mother, or abuse her in any way. I\u2019ve wondered where he puts his values when dad goes hunting on Sunday, or works in the yard, or goes shopping on the Sabbath. Is there a lasting impression in a boy\u2019s heart when he hears dad criticize the bishop, the home teacher, or the Sunday School teacher\u2014or maybe even the prophet? Though it may be ever so slight, does it have an effect?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p8\" class=\"\">I\u2019ve been thinking: what respect will a fourteen-year-old Aaronic Priesthood holder develop for the law when his dad drives forty-five miles an hour in a twenty-five-mile zone, or seventy when it should be fifty-five? Are there acts of dishonesty that are so small they can escape the gaze of a boy? Is it possible that if a boy hears his father swear or curse he will grow up to think that that is the mark of true manhood, or of a Melchizedek Priesthood holder?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p9\" class=\"\">I believe that through all these acts of inconsistency in living priesthood standards, generally speaking, a son will still love his dad and think he is the greatest; and because of these feelings, he may well want to be just like him. With those thoughts, I\u2019ve then wondered: what respect will the boy have for the priesthood, and for authority, and for obedience? What are his chances to develop faith, and testimony, and devotion, and an unwavering belief in his priesthood leaders and what they represent, if his father sends up the wrong kind of signals?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p10\" class=\"\">There is a time in almost every boy\u2019s life when dad can do no wrong, when he wants to be just like him. Therein lies the tragedy. Even when dad does set a poor example, even when he is wrong\u2014to a son he is still great, \u201cbecause he\u2019s dad.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p11\" class=\"\">Would it surprise you to know that in most cases faithful sons come from faithful fathers, and wavering and faithless sons come from wavering and faithless fathers? We are grateful that from among the army of faithful converts there are exceptions to the general rule, but the odds are overwhelmingly in favor of the son following his father\u2019s example.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p12\" class=\"\">Recognizing that it is sometimes hard to imagine that the six-year-old who dumped your favorite aftershave in his dog\u2019s bath water; or the twelve-year-old who used your three new ties as a rope to practice tying his Boy Scout knots; or the sixteen-year-old who came home from his first date with a newly dented fender and said simply, \u201cDad, I just don\u2019t know what happened\u201d\u2014recognizing that it is sometimes hard to believe that sons really are blessings from heaven\u2014I shall attempt to help you understand that they truly are blessings and that you do have a divine responsibility for them. I hope I can give some suggestions to help you handle it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p13\" class=\"\">Because faith and testimony and obedience are as important as the prophets say they are, maybe we ought to rethink the pattern we\u2019re following as we help our sons come to this conviction we so earnestly desire for them. In that regard, it would be well for us to be reminded that because free agency is so basic a gospel principle, we need to understand that we cannot force the heart of another to believe. We cannot force faith and testimony and obedience. We can <span class=\"emphasis\">lead<\/span> another to believe, but we cannot <span class=\"emphasis\">push<\/span> another to believe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p14\" class=\"\">One of my heroes, and a great Book of Mormon missionary, understood and practiced this eternal principle. Ammon was tremendously successful. Among many others, the two thousand sons of Helaman were products of his efforts. He taught that before conversion comes\u2014before one will believe words of truth\u2014his heart must be prepared to receive the message. Thus, to encourage the conversion process of a son, there are many things a father can do. Attitudes are changed and father-son barriers are removed by dads who will keep in mind and practice some important principles of conduct. Let\u2019s consider some ways that we, as fathers, might prepare the hearts of our children to believe in our words.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p15\" class=\"\">First, remember the impact of your example, brethren. As we think of those who are watching us, let us remember that power in the priesthood, the power to bless and guide and teach, the power to forgive and forget, the power to give positive direction to a family\u2014to a son\u2014comes through righteousness. The laying on of hands we all received is not enough. Priesthood power comes to those prepared to receive it as a result of the righteous pattern of their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p16\" class=\"\">Let\u2019s begin tonight to weed out the little inconsistencies that we all have in the way we live. Let\u2019s renew the purification process\u2014whatever that may mean\u2014in each of our lives. If our words are not consistent with our actions, they will never be heard above the thunder of our deeds.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p17\" class=\"\">Secondly, a boy\u2019s heart is better prepared to believe if he has a listening father. If I were a boy, what would I want my dad to be like? I would probably wish he didn\u2019t preach to me so much, but rather, would listen to me more. Many dads spend too much time preaching and not enough time teaching. Sometimes great things happen inside a boy when he\u2019s listened to by his dad. He begins to think he is special\u2014that he is not just another twelve-year-old or sixteen-year-old. His self-image improves. One of our crying needs is to have young men who have a worthy self-image. These are the effective builders of the kingdom. In a father-son visit, who talks most? One successful father said, \u201cDads need to give more ear and less lip to their sons.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p18\" class=\"\">Next, a boy\u2019s heart is prepared to hear when a father gives his son time alone. I\u2019ve already told you about the Washington, D.C., cab driver. Elder Richard L. Evans had a meaningful thought. Said he:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cIn all things there is a priority of importance. \u2026 And one of our urgent opportunities is to respond to a child when he earnestly asks\u2014remembering that they don\u2019t <span class=\"emphasis\">always<\/span> ask, that they aren\u2019t <span class=\"emphasis\">always<\/span> teachable, that they won\u2019t <span class=\"emphasis\">always<\/span> listen. And often we have to take them on <span class=\"emphasis\">their<\/span> terms, at <span class=\"emphasis\">their<\/span> times, and not always on <span class=\"emphasis\">our<\/span> terms, and at <span class=\"emphasis\">our<\/span> times. But if we respond to them with sincere attention and sincere concern, they will likely continue to come to us and ask. And if they find they can trust us with their trivial questions, they may later trust us with the more weighty ones.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Thoughts for One Hundred Days,<\/span> 5 vols., Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1972, 5:114\u201315.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p20\" class=\"\">Another way to prepare the heart of a boy: let him find in his father one who does not criticize\u2014whether it be the boy himself, or Church leaders, or teachers, or neighbors, or even his own wife. Yes, especially the boy\u2019s mother. There are few things a father can give his son that are worth quite as much as knowing he is in love with his mother. It doesn\u2019t take much of a man to criticize another. Faultfinding is easy. It takes a true disciple of the Master to look beyond the weaknesses we all have and find the threads of gold that are always there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p21\" class=\"\">A boy needs a patient father\u2014one who is slow to anger; one who is quick to forgive; one who can remember that he, too, was once a boy and does not expect his son to behave like a small-sized adult.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p22\" class=\"\">Recently, on a Saturday evening, a young family of four were eating at a restaurant. There were a father, mother, and two boys, ages about six and ten. The six-year-old made a mistake; the father was harsh with him and jerked him about as he reprimanded him. For the rest of the meal, though there was a holiday atmosphere at most of the tables, there was little conversation at theirs. As the young boy would take each bite, he glanced at his father to see if he had displeased him. On the boy\u2019s face there was a look of worry and fear, and a soberness unnatural to a child.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p23\" class=\"\">A boy needs a father who will correct him when necessary, but beyond that, one who will love him, and like him, and accept him regardless of his performance: a father who may treat a teenager like an adult, but not expect him to act like one. It takes quite a dad to look beyond the actions of boyhood and see the potential of manhood\u2014and even more important, for him to get a glimpse of eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p24\" class=\"\">From <span class=\"emphasis\">Elbert Hubbard\u2019s Scrapbook<\/span> we have a classic:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cThe place to take the true measure of a man is not in the darkest place or in the amen corner, nor the cornfield, but by his own fireside. There he lays aside his mask and you may learn whether he is an imp or an angel, cur or king, hero or humbug. I care not what the world says of him: whether it crowns him boss or pelts him with bad eggs. I care not a copper what his reputation or religion may be: if his babies dread his homecoming and his better half swallows her heart every time she has to ask him for a five-dollar bill, he is a fraud of the first water, even though he prays night and morning until he is black in the face. \u2026 But if his children rush to the front door to meet him and love\u2019s sunshine illuminates the face of his wife every time she hears his footfall, you can take it for granted that he is pure, for his home is a heaven. \u2026 I can forgive much in that fellow mortal who would rather make men swear than women weep; who would rather have the hate of the whole world than the contempt of his wife; who would rather call anger to the eyes of a king than fear to the face of a child.\u201d (W. C. Brann, \u201cA Man\u2019s Real Measure, in <span class=\"emphasis\">Elbert Hubbard\u2019s Scrapbook,<\/span> N.Y.: Wm. H.
