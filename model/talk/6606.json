Whether one does or does not accept these truths does not alter their reality. They are the fundamental building blocks of a living testimony. A strong testimony is the unshakable foundation of a secure, meaningful life where peace, confidence, happiness, and love can flourish. It is anchored in a conviction that an all-knowing God is in command of His work. He will not fail. He will keep His promises.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-power-of-a-strong-testimony.p5\" class=\"\">A strong testimony is the sustaining power of a successful life. It is centered in an understanding of the divine attributes of God our Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. It is secured by a willing reliance upon Them. A powerful testimony is grounded in the personal assurance that the Holy Ghost can guide and inspire our daily acts for good.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-power-of-a-strong-testimony.p6\" class=\"\">A testimony is fortified by spiritual impressions that confirm the validity of a teaching, of a righteous act, or of a warning of pending danger. Often such guidance is accompanied by powerful emotions that make it difficult to speak and bring tears to the eyes. But a testimony is not emotion. It is the very essence of character woven from threads born of countless correct decisions. These choices are made with trusting faith in things that are believed and, at least initially, are not seen.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-21911_000_035\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"22123\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22123)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22123)\">Ether 12:6<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24183\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24183)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24183)\">Heb. 11:1<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> A strong testimony gives peace, comfort, and assurance. It generates the conviction that as the teachings of the Savior are consistently obeyed, life will be beautiful, the future secure, and there will be capacity to overcome the challenges that cross our path. A testimony grows from understanding truth, distilled from prayer and the pondering of scriptural doctrine. It is nurtured by living those truths in faith and the secure confidence that the promised results will be obtained.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-power-of-a-strong-testimony.p7\" class=\"\">A strong testimony has sustained prophets throughout the ages and fortified them to act with courage and determination in times of difficulty. A powerful testimony can do the same for you. As you fortify your own personal testimony, you will have power to make correct choices so that you can stand unwaveringly against the pressures of an increasingly vicious world. Your personal security and happiness depend upon the strength of your testimony, for it will guide your actions in times of trial or uncertainty.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-power-of-a-strong-testimony.p8\" class=\"\">Honestly evaluate your personal life. How strong is your own testimony? Is it truly a sustaining power in your life, or is it more a hope that what you have learned is true? Is it more than a vague belief that worthwhile concepts and patterns of life seem to be reasonable and logical? Such mental assent will not help when you face the serious challenges that will inevitably come to you. Does your testimony guide you to correct decisions? To do so, fundamental truths must become part of the very fiber of your character. They must be an essential part of your being, more treasured than life itself. If an honest assessment of your own testimony confirms that it is not as strong as it should be, how can it be strengthened?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-power-of-a-strong-testimony.p9\" class=\"\">Your testimony will be fortified as you exercise faith in Jesus Christ, in His teachings, and in His limitless power to accomplish what He has promised.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-21911_000_035\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"8630\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8630)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8630)\">Alma 26:22<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"11058\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11058)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11058)\">D&amp;C 3:1\u201310<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"11152\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11152)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11152)\">D&amp;C 82:10<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> The key words are \u201cexercise faith.\u201d True faith has enormous power, but there are principles that must be followed to unleash that power.
