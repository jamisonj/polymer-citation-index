We have not considered the Book of\nMormon and the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price as thoroughly as we\nshould have done, and that is also true of the Bible.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord in his mercy and kindness sent angels from his presence to reveal gospel and to\nmake known the record of the ancient inhabitants of this continent, the Jaredites and the\nNephites and Lamanites. Likewise by the inspiration and guidance of his Spirit, he revealed to\nthe Prophet Joseph Smith many of the precious things that were taken out of the writings of\nthe prophets, and we have them restored again. But are we reading them? Are we making\nourselves acquainted with these commandments, these precious truths which have been made\nknown for our salvation? Have we ever stopped to think of the great advantage that we have\nover the rest of the Christian world in this fact, that they maintain that the Bible contains the\nfull word of God, that revelation from him ceased nearly two thousand years ago? Men are\nleft now to depend upon that written word. But the Lord has revealed to us the history of\nthese other ancient peoples. He has given unto us the commandments and the revelations that\nwere given to them, and so earnestly did he feel the responsibility of giving to us additional\ninformation that he sent angel from his presence to reveal it.\n<\/p><p>\nAre we, who profess to believe in the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, to testify that\nangels came to him, and through them that the gospel was restored, the priesthood again\nrevealed and given to men? Do we feel that we are under any responsibilities to search these\nscriptures and make ourselves familiar with them? I wonder. It is my understanding, I hope I\nam wrong, that a great multitude of members of this Church have never read the Book of\nMormon, are not acquainted with the Doctrine and Covenants, who have not taken the time to\nconsider the commandments that have been revealed for our eternal good, and that to our\ndetriment.\n<\/p><p>\nNow we know that there are many spirits abroad in the land\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12981\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12981)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12981)\">D&amp;C 50:1-3<\/a><\/span>), and as the Lord says, some of\ntheir doctrines are doctrines of devils; some are the commandments of men. Are we prepared\nby our knowledge and understanding to segregate these doctrines which are of men and which\nare of devils, from the truth? Are we living near enough unto the Lord to have that spirit of\ndiscernment, that we are entitled, as we would be through our humility and faith, to know the\ntruth that would make us free (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27515\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27515)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27515)\">John 8:32<\/a><\/span>)?\n<\/p><p>\nIn an earlier revelation, the Lord said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And whoso having faith you shall confirm in my church, by the laying on of the hands, and\nI will bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost upon them\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12975\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12975)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12975)\">D&amp;C 33:15<\/a><\/span>). We have the right to the\nguidance of the Holy Ghost, but we can't have that guidance if we wilfully refuse to consider\nthe revelations that have been given to help us to understand and to guide us in the light and\ntruth of the everlasting gospel. We can't hope to have that guidance when we refuse to\nconsider these great revelations which mean so much to us both temporally and spiritually.\nNow if we find ourselves in this condition of unbelief or unwillingness to seek for the light\nand the knowledge which the Lord has placed within our reach, then we are liable or in\ndanger of being deceived by evil spirits, the doctrines of devils, and the teachings of men.\nAnd when these false influences are presented before us, we will not have the distinguishing\nunderstanding by which we can segregate them and know that they are not\nof the Lord. And so we may become prey unto the ungodly, to the vicious, to the cunning, to\nthe craftiness of men.\n<\/p><p>\nWe all have a right to know the truth. It is a requirement the Lord makes of every member of\nthe Church that he know for himself and have a testimony of the truth in his own heart and\nnot be under the necessity of depending upon anyone else to know that Jesus Christ is the Son\nof God or that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God. If there is any person in the sound of my\nvoice, a member of this Church, who does not know in his heart that the Father and the Son\nappeared to Joseph Smith, revealed themselves, and made known again the true doctrine\nconcerning God, then that person has not lived up to his or her requirements, the\ncommandments the Lord has placed upon us, for we should know that fact. We should know\nthat John the Baptist came and restored the Aaronic Priesthood. We ought not to have to\ndepend upon any other source, only the light of truth which is planted in our hearts by the\nHoly Spirit through our faithfulness. We should know that Peter, James, and John came and\nrestored the Melchizedek Priesthood with all its powers, so that the gospel again could be\npreached, the knowledge of God declared, and righteousness again be found in the earth, for\nthe salvation of all those who would repent of their sins and turn unto God.\n<\/p><p>\nI have in my pocket here an invitation sent to me personally; it may be many of you have\nreceived one that was sent to you personally, inviting me to attend one of the churches to\nmake myself familiar with the doctrines. Now the man who sent this had a perfect right to\nsend it. He has a right to send this to you and to give you that invitation, but do you have\nfaith enough, knowledge enough of the gospel of Jesus Christ that you would not be deceived\nif you should accept the invitation, and go and listen to the doctrines of the church to which\nthis man belongs? Do you know the truth?\n<\/p><p>\nI have a testimony, definitely, positively, that our Father in heaven restored the gospel of\nJesus Christ, that Joseph Smith told the truth. I know that the Father and the Son appeared to\nhim, just as well as I know I am here. I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the\nRedeemer of the world, the Savior of men who will repent and receive his gospel. Are we all\nprepared so that we will not be subject to the cunning craftiness of men\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21657\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21657)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21657)\">Eph. 4:14<\/a><\/span>), to the false doctrines\nthat are in the world, the teachings that are contrary to the plan of eternal salvation? If we are\nnot then we need to repent.\n<\/p><p>\nI am going to read to you a statement that I made some time ago which I think is true, and\nwhich is a guide to me and I hope may be to you.\n<\/p><p>\nSo far as the philosophy and wisdom of the world are concerned, they mean nothing unless\nthey conform to the revealed word of God. Any doctrine, whether it comes in the name of\nreligion, science, philosophy, or whatever it may be, if it is in conflict with the revealed word\nof the Lord, will fail. It may appear plausible. It may be put before you in language that\nappeals and which you may not be able to answer. It may appear to be established by\nevidence that you cannot controvert but all you need to do is to abide your time. Time will\nlevel all things. You will find that every doctrine, every principle, no matter how universally\nbelieved, if it is not in accord with the divine word of the Lord to his servants, will perish.\nNor is it necessary for us to try to stretch the word of the Lord in a vain attempt to make it\nconform to these theories and teachings. The word of the Lord shall not pass away unfulfilled\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34523\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34523)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34523)\">Matt. 24:35<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12961\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12961)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12961)\">D&amp;C 1:38<\/a><\/span>),\nbut these false doctrines and theories will all fail.
