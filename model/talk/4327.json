In the constructive spirit of that directive, I desire to bear my testimony this morning about the vital effect in our lives and the lives of others of the day-by-day decisions all of us are making\u2014and where we can find help in making them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/i-will-look-unto-the-lord.p4\" class=\"\">A teacher once wrote of the unanticipated consequences of some of our decisions. We didn\u2019t really ever intend those consequences, but we followed the paths that led to them. \u201cHe who chooses the beginning of a road chooses the place it leads to,\u201d he said. \u201cHe who picks up one end of a stick, picks up the other.\u201d And it is not only our own course we are affecting when we choose the beginning of a road; we inevitably travel with others, and sometimes we bring anguish and distress to those we love and to other innocent persons.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/i-will-look-unto-the-lord.p5\" class=\"\">Over this pulpit President David O.

Some of us have perhaps experienced a measure of the deep disappointment he felt because of Israel\u2019s rebelliousness when he declared that \u201cthe good man is perished out of the earth\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37911\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37911)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37911)\">Micah 7:2<\/a><\/span>).

Other prophets have similarly spoken.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/i-will-look-unto-the-lord.p13\" class=\"\">Does this mean that we may never have confidence in the integrity of others? Must we never trust parents or friends or caring counselors or humble servants of God? This is obviously not the meaning of the scriptures, which themselves are the record of revelation and inspired instruction; what they are emphasizing is the <span class=\"emphasis\">care<\/span> we must exercise in <span class=\"emphasis\">choosing<\/span> counsel or example.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/i-will-look-unto-the-lord.p14\" class=\"\">There is accessible, for those who will accommodate it, much that is <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> uplifting or wholesome, which sometimes seems so perverse in its portrayal of marriage, and of the family, and of personal integrity that the undiscerning might be led to believe that this is the normal way for people or families or neighborhoods to behave.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/i-will-look-unto-the-lord.p15\" class=\"\">Only last week a comment was made by an Assistant United States Attorney General after she had witnessed a popular play in which drug use was made to appear acceptable and even desirable: \u201c\u2018We perpetuate the falsehood that drugs make you cute, bold, insightful, philosophical or chic,\u2019\u201d she said (Lois Haight Herrington, as quoted by Godfrey Sperling, Jr., \u201cTolerance for Drugs Is Undermining U.S. \u2018War\u2019 Commitment,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News,<\/span> 24 Sept. 1986, sec. A, p. 9). And a columnist, in quoting her, added an interesting line: \u201cOur society still sanctions the use of alcohol. There is really no more dangerous drug\u2014and certainly none that has done more damage or wrecked more lives over the years\u2014than alcohol\u201d (Sperling, <span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News, <\/span>24 Sept. 1986, p.

There is great power in trust and love, and, of course, we must learn to trust because our confidence in the integrity of man supports our confidence in God. Yet, in matters of lasting importance, one must not rely only on \u201cthe arm of flesh\u201d at the expense of looking to the Lord in scripture and in prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/i-will-look-unto-the-lord.p17\" class=\"\">In World War II, I had an experience aboard a United States naval vessel in the South Pacific that was a powerful example of the virtue of wise choices and the peril of making decisions that are immature or impetuous, or are made in the heat of emotion, or that go thoughtlessly along with the crowd.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/i-will-look-unto-the-lord.p18\" class=\"\">The young man aboard my ship was obviously special.

These associates had life-styles and a view of values that were far removed from those to which this choice lad was accustomed. Gradually, the circumstances and the daily pressures began to take their toll on a not yet fully stable young man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/i-will-look-unto-the-lord.p20\" class=\"\">One day in a far-off port, I observed him almost furtively preparing to go ashore in the company of some of those experienced individuals who were taking him into town for one of their \u201cgood times,\u201d as they supposed.

His furtiveness turned to defiance, and he plainly told me that he was a big boy now, able to make up his own mind, and that he would do as he chose.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/i-will-look-unto-the-lord.p22\" class=\"\">The consequences of the decisions he made that day\u2014and those that were made for him when, through their iniquitous \u201chelp,\u201d he had lost the power to think for himself or govern his own behavior\u2014were different than he ever intended or could imagine. In his immaturity, he rebelliously chose the beginning of a road without thinking where that road would lead him. The place at which he arrived in the next few hours was one which he would never in his right mind have chosen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/i-will-look-unto-the-lord.p23\" class=\"\">When he returned to the ship, overleave overseas in wartime, out of control, and in custody of the shore patrol, he became subject to severe discipline. I cannot forget his tearful anguish as he awaited his ordeal. He could not even remember anything of the most serious of the tragedies that had occurred to him. All he could recall was lifting a glass they pressed on him, not knowing that they had drugged the drink, and then all was blank. They had proceeded to take him on their rounds with them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/i-will-look-unto-the-lord.p24\" class=\"\">The charges against him, indelibly imprinted on his previously perfect service record, were heartbreaking.
