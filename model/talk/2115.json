And then, with a voice ringing with a conviction that I shall never forget, he quoted those great words of Nephi: \u201cI will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1667\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1667)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1667)\">1 Ne. 3:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/if-ye-be-willing-and-obedient.p9\" class=\"\">There came into my young heart on that occasion a resolution to try to do what the Lord has commanded.

Some years ago he received a missionary call to the Western States Mission with headquarters in Denver. He had been to Denver a number of times as a member of the university debate team. It was only over the mountain. He and his parents had dreamed of a more exotic field, of one of those \u201cfaraway places with the strange-sounding names.\u201d His friends smiled. Some dear to him doubted the wisdom, the inspiration of his call. Why should so choice a young man be called on a mission from Salt Lake City to Denver? But he went. He became a powerful missionary. There are those today who thank the Lord for his coming. He was named counselor to his mission president and experienced marvelous opportunities for training in leadership. He met there a beautiful girl whom he later married. Out of the remarkable and peculiar opportunities of that mission, there emerged within him qualities that have made him preeminent in his chosen vocation.

I had been called to labor in the European Mission office in London under President Joseph F. Merrill of the Council of the Twelve, then president of the European Mission. One day three or four of the London papers carried reviews of a reprint of an old book, snide and ugly in tone, indicating that the book was a history of the Mormons. President Merrill said to me, \u201cI want you to go down to the publisher and protest this.\u201d I looked at him and was about to say, \u201cSurely not me.\u201d But I meekly said, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/if-ye-be-willing-and-obedient.p32\" class=\"\">I do not hesitate to say that I was frightened. I went to my room and felt something as I think Moses must have felt when the Lord asked him to go and see Pharaoh. I offered a prayer. My stomach was churning as I walked over to the Goodge Street station to get the underground train to Fleet Street. I found the office of the president and presented my card to the receptionist. She took it and went into the inner office and soon returned to say that Mr. Skeffington was too busy to see me. I replied that I had come five thousand miles and that I would wait. During the next hour she made two or three trips to his office, then finally invited me in. I shall never forget the picture when I entered. He was smoking a long cigar with a look that seemed to say, \u201cDon\u2019t bother me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/if-ye-be-willing-and-obedient.p33\" class=\"\">I held in my hand the reviews. I do not know what I said after that. Another power seemed to be speaking through me. At first he was defensive and even belligerent. Then he began to soften. He concluded by promising to do something. Within an hour word went out to every book dealer in England to return the books to the publisher. At great expense he printed and tipped in the front of each volume a statement to the effect that the book was not to be considered as history, but only as fiction, and that no offense was intended against the respected Mormon people. Years later he granted another favor of substantial worth to the Church, and each year until the time of his death I received a Christmas card from him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/if-ye-be-willing-and-obedient.p34\" class=\"\">I came to know that when we try in faith to walk in obedience to the requests of the priesthood, the Lord opens the way, even when there appears to be no way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/if-ye-be-willing-and-obedient.p35\" class=\"\">Ten years ago last Friday I was sustained in this great Tabernacle as a member of the Council of the Twelve.
