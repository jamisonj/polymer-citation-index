It was my eldest grandson. He had recently received the Aaronic Priesthood and been ordained a deacon. I took the opportunity on that occasion to address my remarks to him on the importance of receiving the Aaronic Priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p6\" class=\"\">I said to my grandson:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cI am not overly pleased with worldly conditions that you and other young men are inheriting as you assume your role in moving toward manhood. While those of us who are older have been of an age and position to influence the world, I believe we\u2019ve greatly failed you in what we have allowed the conditions in the world to become. This places you in a position where many of those with whom you must associate have not been reared with an understanding of or respect for traditional values. Thus, peer pressure becomes much more difficult and extreme.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cWe have brought into our homes radios, record players, and television sets. While each has the potential of providing wholesome entertainment, so much of what has been produced for our listening and watching pleasure is not of the caliber to inspire and encourage young men. In fact, most of what is produced is degrading. The flip of a switch right in your own home has the potential of destroying within you a sense of what is right and what is wrong\u201d (\u201cI Confer the Priesthood of Aaron,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1985, 46).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p9\" class=\"\">The more things change, the more they stay the same\u2014except for technology. I\u2019m tempted to ask the young men of the Aaronic Priesthood if they even know what a record player is. For those who don\u2019t, it\u2019s something we used to go to the family room and play so we could listen to music. Imagine that\u2014we had to go to it instead of carrying it around with us everywhere.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p10\" class=\"\">I also taught my grandson Terry four lessons based on the story of Daniel in the Old Testament. I told him to (1) keep his body healthy and clean, (2) develop his mind and become wise, (3) be strong and resist temptation in a world filled with it, and (4) trust in the Lord, especially when you need His protection.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p11\" class=\"\">I closed my counsel to Terry with these words: \u201cThese stories in the scriptures will never grow old. They will be just as exciting for you when you are reading them as a deacon, a teacher, a priest, a missionary, a home teacher, an elders quorum president, or whatever the Lord calls on you to do. They will teach you to have faith, courage, love for your fellowmen, confidence, and trust in the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1985, 48).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p12\" class=\"\">I am happy to report that Terry has been faithful to the charge I gave him 25 years ago. He later received the Melchizedek Priesthood, served a faithful mission, currently serves as an elders quorum president, and of course is a father of a beautiful daughter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p13\" class=\"\">A lot has changed in the last quarter of a century. Another thing that has happened is many of my grandchildren have grown up and had their own children. This summer I had the opportunity of standing in a circle of priesthood holders and laying my hands on the head of my eldest great-grandson as his father conferred on him the Aaronic Priesthood. Even though my great-grandson is not present to stand by my side today, I would like to address my remarks to him and all you wonderful young men who hold the Aaronic Priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p14\" class=\"\">It is a very special blessing to receive the Aaronic Priesthood. History records the glorious day when the priesthood was restored to the earth, giving men the right to again act as God\u2019s agents as they performed the sacred priesthood ordinances. It was on April 5, 1829, that Oliver Cowdery arrived at the home of Joseph Smith in Harmony, Pennsylvania. Oliver inquired of the Prophet about his work translating an ancient record, the Book of Mormon. Convinced of the divine nature of the work, Oliver agreed to act as scribe in completing the translation. The work of translation progressed rapidly once Oliver committed to act as scribe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p15\" class=\"\">By May 15, 1829, Joseph and Oliver had already reached 3\u00a0Nephi. The history of the resurrected Savior visiting the Western Hemisphere and His teachings about baptism thrilled them. As they read in 3\u00a0Nephi, their minds started to wonder about baptism. What manner of baptism was correct, and who had authority to perform this sacred, saving ordinance? They sought an answer to these fundamental doctrinal questions. They resolved to seek an answer by prayer, and they went to a nearby place on the banks of the Susquehanna River. They poured out their hearts, and the heavens were opened to them. An angel appeared, introducing himself as John the Baptist, and he told Joseph and Oliver he was acting under the direction of Peter, James, and John, who held the higher priesthood (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120951\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120951)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120951)\">Joseph Smith\u2014History 1:72<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p16\" class=\"\">Placing his hands on their heads, he said: \u201cUpon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120952\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120952)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120952)\">D&amp;C 13:1<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p17\" class=\"\">Later, Oliver recounted the event in these words: \u201cBut \u2026 think, further think for a moment, what joy filled our hearts, and with what surprise we must have bowed \u2026 when we received under his hand the Holy Priesthood\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120953\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120953)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120953)\">Joseph Smith\u2014History 1:71<\/a><\/span>, footnote).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p18\" class=\"\">After mankind had been waiting for centuries for God\u2019s authority to be restored, the power and glory of the holy Aaronic Priesthood returned to the earth. In section 107 of the Doctrine and Covenants, we learn why the lesser priesthood is called the Aaronic Priesthood:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cThe second priesthood is called the Priesthood of Aaron, because it was conferred upon Aaron and his seed, throughout all their generations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cWhy it is called the lesser priesthood is because it is an appendage to the greater, or the Melchizedek Priesthood, and has power in administering outward ordinances.\u00a0\u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cThe power and authority of the lesser, or Aaronic Priesthood, is to hold the keys of the ministering of angels, and to administer in outward ordinances, the letter of the gospel, the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, agreeable to the covenants and commandments\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120954\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120954)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120954)\">D&amp;C 107:13\u201314, 20<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p22\" class=\"\">Not only do young men of the Aaronic Priesthood receive the power and authority to be agents of the Lord in carrying out their priesthood responsibilities, but they also receive the keys of the ministering of angels.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p23\" class=\"\">Young men of the Aaronic Priesthood, I testify to you that the Lord is bound by solemn covenant to bless your lives according to your faithfulness. If you will heed the voice of warning of the Holy Ghost and will follow His direction, you will be blessed with the ministering of angels. This blessing will add wisdom, knowledge, power, and glory to your life. This is a sure blessing promised to you by the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p24\" class=\"\">A few months ago I had the opportunity of attending a ward fast and testimony meeting. One who stood to bear his testimony was an Aaronic Priesthood adviser. His testimony provided me with a new appreciation of what it means for an Aaronic Priesthood bearer to hold the keys of the ministering of angels.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p25\" class=\"\">This adviser described some of his experiences with the ward Aaronic Priesthood that morning. As he was walking to church he noticed two young deacons with fast-offering envelopes going to the homes of the members. He was impressed with the way they were dressed in their Sunday best and how they approached their assignment with quiet dignity. He then accompanied two priests to administer the sacrament in a residential home for physically and mentally disabled men. This was the first opportunity for these two young men to visit this home, and their adviser noted the respectful and caring way in which they approached their priesthood assignment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p26\" class=\"\">Then the adviser shared a brief experience that deeply touched his heart, because one of the priests reminded him of what it really means to be a true minister of Jesus Christ\u2014literally, a ministering angel. The young priest who was passing the water to the congregation came to a man who appeared to have Down syndrome. The man\u2019s condition prevented him from taking the cup from the tray to drink from it. This young priest immediately assessed the situation. He placed his left hand behind the man\u2019s head so he would be in a position to drink, and with the right hand he took a cup from the tray and gently and slowly lifted it to the man\u2019s lips. An expression of appreciation came to the man\u2019s face\u2014the expression of someone to whom someone else has ministered. This wonderful young priest then continued his assignment to pass the blessed water to the other members of the congregation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p27\" class=\"\">The adviser expressed in his testimony the feelings he had at that tender moment. He said he wept silently with joy, and he knew the Church was in good hands with these young, caring, obedient bearers of the Aaronic Priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-priesthood-of-aaron.p28\" class=\"\">President Ezra Taft Benson once said: \u201cGive me a young man who has kept himself morally clean and has faithfully attended his Church meetings. Give me a young man who has magnified his priesthood and has earned the Duty to God Award and is an Eagle Scout.

Prepare yourselves for the great blessing of receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood, which you will need to be worthy to receive before you serve as a full-time missionary. The Lord needs you to prepare yourselves for His service, especially the great responsibility you will have of declaring His gospel to the world. I promise you if you will prepare to receive His holy priesthood, He will literally pour out blessings upon your heads.
