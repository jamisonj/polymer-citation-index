I have met the\nsons and daughters of many of you, and I bring you, from them, a good word. I want to tell\nyou that they are interested in their work, they are devoted to it, and they are\nstriving to the best of their ability and their utmost power to teach and preach the gospel of\nJesus Christ. I pray that you will have faith in them, that you will have no misgivings as to\ntheir future, for they are in the hands of God and are striving to do his work. It was\ninteresting to study with them their problems, and to strive to help them in the solution of\nthese problems. One of the questions that they confront most often, is the statement of many\npeople, \"We could accept your teachings and the principles which you advocate, if it were not\nfor the supernatural conditions that you allege surrounded the birth of your organization.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWORLD'S RELUCTANCE TO ACCEPT MODERN REVELATION\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Kimball has told us in the address which he has just finished, of the mission of Jesus\nChrist, of his appearance to the Prophet Joseph Smith. That seems the hardest thing for\nChristian people to accept when they think of us, for we allege in that statement that Christ is\nactually the Son of God, that God is a separate and distinct personage from Christ, and that\nman is made in their image. That statement topples the Christian idea which prevailed at the\ntime of the Prophet Joseph Smith; it had prevailed for ages before him, and it still prevails. It\nis the most difficult thing for them to accept. It is miraculous that God and Christ should\nappear to a human being. At the same time, they will tell you that they accept without\nreservation the statements of the Bible, and some of them will go so far as to tell you they\nbelieve every word that is in it. When we read it, we find that one great prophet of God,\nJacob, wrestled during the night with an angel from heaven\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23519\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23519)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23519)\">Gen. 32:24-30<\/a><\/span>). That doesn't seem difficult to\nthem. We come down through history, and we find the Israelites in bondage in Egypt, their\nliberation necessary. We find that God, through the faith of those people, turned back the\nwaters of the Red Sea, so that they walked through on dry ground\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22563\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22563)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22563)\">Ex. 14:21-31<\/a><\/span>), and the hosts of Egypt\nwhich followed were overcome by the returning waves, and the people were thus liberated.\nThey accept that; it doesn't seem beyond their powers of belief. Those people wander on into\nthe desert, and they find themselves thirsty. They want water, and Moses strikes a stone with\nhis rod, the water gushing forth to quench the thirst of that unhappy people\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41091\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41091)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41091)\">Num. 20:11<\/a><\/span>). They accept that.\nThen they find themselves hungry, and God causes them to be fed from heaven with divine\nfood (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22564\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22564)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22564)\">Ex. 16:15<\/a><\/span>);\nand they accept that. Again we find a prophet who is able to call down from heaven fire\nto consume those who are obstructing the work of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1189\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1189)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1189)\">1 Kgs. 18:38<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3172\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3172)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3172)\">2 Kgs. 1:10<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd thus it goes. We find the Savior\nhimself, praying to his Heavenly Father in Gethsemane. These are all miraculous things, and\npeople accept them more or less as in the ordinary events of the work of God, but they say,\n\"Now why should there be a miracle in our day?\" I can't bring myself to believe that those\npeople were in any greater need of divine help than are people in our day. I can't bring\nmyself to believe, either, that they were any more dear to God their\nHeavenly Father, as his children, than we and our fathers and grandfathers. And I can't bring\nmyself to believe that we are any more unworthy of the aid of God than they were. So to me,\nit seems a more or less proper thing and a natural thing, that God should so manifest himself.\n<\/p><p>\nPERSONALITY OF DEITY AGAIN REVEALED\n<\/p><p>\nTo me that is the great and underlying reason for the restoration of the gospel in the latter\ndays&mdash;the fact that people had come to misunderstand the personality of God; they had come\nto question his power of intervention in the affairs of men, and it was necessary that they\nshould be taught again the things which they were taught in the testimony that was given at\nthe baptism of Christ, and in the testimony that was given in the appearance of Christ to the\nNephites. They were again to be taught that Christ is the Son of God. It is one of the most\ndifficult things for sectarian peoples to accept because of the indoctrination that they have\nreceived over these many generations. That is one of the problems that your boys and your\ngirls, young and old, have to present to the people in the mission fields.\n<\/p><p>\nMany of them have gone out, not knowing too well these things, sometimes because we at\nhome have failed to do our full duty in explaining these truths to them. Some of us perchance\ndepend upon our Sunday Schools, our Mutuals, and our priesthood quorums entirely for such\ninstruction. But I feel that it is the duty of every father and every mother in Israel to see that\ntheir son and their daughter know these things, and to qualify them to testify to the world that\nit is true, that God came back and visited the Prophet Joseph Smith, and spoke to him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30243\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30243)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30243)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>) thus\nbringing back to the world the testimony as to the true personality of God. I believe that they\nshould further teach them the various and sundry teachings of the Church, regarding these\nthings; baptism, repentance, faith in God, charity in their lives, chastity, and all the virtues\nthat go to make fine men and women, so that those who may be called for missionary service\nshall go into the world fully convinced in their hearts that God lives; that he is the Father of\ntheir spirits; that he is the guardian of them all; that he actually has personal interest in our\nwelfare; and that he can be sought in prayer for aid and assistance. If they go into the world\nunderstanding these things, they will be effective and efficient missionaries for the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nSPECIAL CALLING OF THE SEVENTIES\n<\/p><p>\nI represent the great body of the priesthood, whose purpose by ordination is to disseminate\nthese truths. Many of those men have family obligations which prevent them from actually\ngoing into the world themselves to do this preaching, but they frequently have sons and\ndaughters who can represent them, and I feel it is their duty, after preparing\nthose boys and girls, young men and young women for that work, to present them, even at a\nsacrifice, if you want to call it such, to the Church for the short period of time that is required\nin the mission field. That is the work of the seventy, to testify to the restoration of the gospel;\nand if they can't do it personally, why can they not do it through their sons and their\ndaughters?\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a pleasing thing to me that there is an increasing percentage of men in the missions of\nthe world. It has been our experience in the stake missions, that as the percentage of men\ndecreased, the hours required for baptism increased. It seems that there is a power in the\npriesthood of God that is necessary to the ultimate conversion of men. And I would like to\nsee this percentage increase beyond its present status, both in the foreign missions and in the\nstake missions. When our stake missions began, we had a percentage of sixty from the\nseventies quorum, whose special duty it is to teach, and today that percentage is as low as\nthirty-five. I personally would like to see that restored to its original percentage, or better, so\nthat the seventies of the Church will actually be doing the work for which they are set aside\nby ordination.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, that is our duty; it is the duty of the Church to break down the unfounded traditions of\nthe past and to teach the restoration of the gospel. Every man who is warned should warn his\nneighbor (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12281\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12281)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12281)\">D&amp;C 88:81<\/a><\/span>).\nWe are doing a valiant work, but we are likely not doing all we could and all we\nought to do in this capacity.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that God may give us a proper appreciation of our obligations to each other and to the\nworld, that he may give us a proper understanding of the principles of the gospel, that may\nenable us to teach our young men and young women, our boys and our girls, our sons and\ndaughters, the doctrines upon which they should rest their faith, in such a way as to build up\nin their hearts an undying faith regarding this great work in which we are engaged; so that at\nsuch time, when the Presidency of the Church sees fit to ask them for a service, they may be\nready for it. May he bless us all, that we may live more near to him, that we ourselves may\nunderstand better our obligations to each other, that we may be able to purify our thoughts\nand our emotions and our actions so as to be worthy recipients of the Spirit of God, I pray in\nJesus' name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
