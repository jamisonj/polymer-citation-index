He is the First Begotten Son of the Father in the premortal existence and the Only Begotten Son of the Father on earth. God the Eternal Father is the literal parent of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and of His other spirit children (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"2097\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2097)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2097)\">1 Ne. 11:18, 21<\/a><\/span>; James E. Talmage, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Articles of Faith,<\/span> 12th ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1924, p. 466).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/our-message-to-the-world.p6\" class=\"\">When we refer to the divine Sonship of Jesus Christ, we are also referring to His role as a God in the premortal sphere. This Firstborn Son of Elohim the Father was chosen and ordained in the primeval councils in heaven to be the Savior of the yet-to-be-born race of mortals (see James E. Talmage, <span class=\"emphasis\">Jesus the Christ,<\/span> 3rd ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1916, p. 4). Jesus was also chosen and sent by the Father to organize and create this earth, our solar system, our galaxy, even worlds without number.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/our-message-to-the-world.p7\" class=\"\">Jesus Christ was and is Jehovah of the Old Testament, the God of Adam and of Noah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Jehovah appeared to and talked to the ancient prophets. When He spoke He did so on behalf of the Father, and He said what His Father would have said. Jehovah of the Old Testament became Jesus Christ of the New Testament when He was born into mortality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/our-message-to-the-world.p8\" class=\"\">The \u201cdivine Sonship\u201d also refers to the designation \u201cOnly Begotten Son in the flesh.\u201d Ancient and modern scriptures use the title \u201cOnly Begotten Son\u201d to emphasize the divine nature of Jesus Christ. This title signifies that Jesus\u2019 physical body was the offspring of a mortal mother and of an immortal Eternal Father, which verity is crucial to the Atonement, a supreme act that could not have been accomplished by an ordinary man. Christ had power to lay down His life and power to take it again because He had inherited immortality from His Heavenly Father. From Mary, His mother, Christ inherited mortality, or the power to die.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/our-message-to-the-world.p9\" class=\"\">This infinite atonement of Christ and Christ\u2019s divine Sonship go together hand in hand to form the single most important doctrine of all Christianity. Elder Bruce R. McConkie said, \u201cWe view the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ as the center and core and heart of revealed religion\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">A New Witness for the Articles of Faith,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1985, p. 81).

In that pillar stood two personages\u2014God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ\u2014whose brightness and glory defied all description. The Father spoke, saying, Joseph, \u201cThis is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30748\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30748)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30748)\">JS\u2014H 1:17<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/our-message-to-the-world.p13\" class=\"\">One of the hallmarks of the calling of the Prophet Joseph Smith was his divine education in the writings and prophecies of the ancient apostles and prophets. The writings and teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith \u201cread like a seamless gospel fabric, woven from the sacred truths of ancient and modern scripture\u201d (Richard C. Galbraith, introduction to <span class=\"emphasis\">Scriptural Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1993, p. 5).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/our-message-to-the-world.p14\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith was much more than an uneducated plowboy of the American frontier. Rather, he received the greatest heavenly tutorials ever given to man in the process of his divine education. He received direct answer to prayer from God, not from books. After the First Vision he received other visions and numerous visits from angelic ministers, and \u201che was taught for years by \u2026 holy angels sent from God out of heaven to teach and instruct him and prepare him to lay the foundation of this Church\u201d (Wilford Woodruff, in <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 16:265). The inspiration of the Holy Ghost was likewise fundamental in Joseph\u2019s expounding of biblical scripture. He received revelations from Jesus Christ, and the Urim and Thummim provided another means by which Joseph Smith received scriptural instructions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/our-message-to-the-world.p15\" class=\"\">The eternal truths he taught answered a brood of questions that had been in the minds of philosophers for centuries. When one studies the doctrinal teachings revealed to Joseph Smith, that person, if he or she is sincere in the search for truth, will be led to Jesus Christ and His role as our Savior, Redeemer, and Advocate with the Father. In studying these teachings of Joseph about the Savior, uncertainty and doubt flee, and hearts are changed. The honest person finds greater meaning in life by the Prophet\u2019s answers to the philosophical questions, Where did we come from? Why are we here? Where are we going? Because of revelations given to Joseph, the memory veil between this life and our premortal existence becomes almost transparent at times. And the veil between this life and the spirit world becomes thinner, causing family ties to become stronger, sweeter, and more meaningful as the hearts of the children turn to their fathers and the hearts of the fathers turn to their children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/our-message-to-the-world.p16\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph taught that the same sociality that we enjoy in this life will continue into the next, giving great comfort to those seeing friends and loved ones depart from this earth (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20429\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20429)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20429)\">D&amp;C 130:2<\/a><\/span>). The doctrines of salvation taught by this prophet distill upon our souls as the very dews from heaven (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20418\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20418)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20418)\">D&amp;C 121:45<\/a><\/span>).

It is a collection of writings by prophets who lived in the Western Hemisphere, who believed in Christ, and who prophesied of Christ, some of whom associated with Christ during the brief time He visited the Americas after His resurrection. Those ancient American prophets wrote the Book of Mormon for our day. It has withstood every conceivable test by both skeptical and sincere minds. It is not on trial. We are the ones on trial, being tested by our acceptance or rejection of its truths, teachings, commandments, and declarations (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"4628\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4628)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4628)\">2 Ne. 33:11\u201314<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/our-message-to-the-world.p18\" class=\"\">President Ezra Taft Benson reminded us forcefully that if we forget to teach and preach the Book of Mormon, and if we forget to study and meditate on the contents of this book of Holy Writ, we will be under condemnation. We have a mission and a commandment to declare its contents to the world and to bear testimony of it (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20362\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20362)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20362)\">D&amp;C 84:54\u201358<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>The Divine Nature of the Church<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/our-message-to-the-world.p20\" class=\"\">Our third declaration is the divine nature of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to prepare the way for the Second Coming of Christ.
