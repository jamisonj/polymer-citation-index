The First Vision is the very foundation of this Church, and it is my conviction that each member of this Church performs his duty in direct ratio to his personal testimony and faith in the First Vision. How well do you believe this story? No man having heard the Joseph Smith testimony can, in good conscience, remain on neutral ground.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/our-fundamental-obligation-the-priesthood.p15\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith was an ordinary boy with a rather ordinary name, but he was now to become an extraordinary prophet. For nine long years following the First Vision Joseph prepared for the privilege of the priesthood. As you remember, it was John the Baptist who appeared on the banks of the Susquehanna in answer to a fervent prayer offered by Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. How simple the words for such a historic occasion:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/our-fundamental-obligation-the-priesthood.p16\" class=\"\">\u201c<span class=\"emphasis\">Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/our-fundamental-obligation-the-priesthood.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cHe said this Aaronic Priesthood had not the power of laying on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that this should be conferred on us hereafter; and he commanded us to go and be baptized, and gave us directions that I should baptize Oliver Cowdery, and that afterwards he should baptize me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/our-fundamental-obligation-the-priesthood.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAccordingly,\u201d continues the Prophet, \u201cwe went and were baptized. I baptized him first, and afterwards he baptized me\u2014after which I laid my hands upon his head and ordained him to the Aaronic Priesthood, and afterwards he laid his hands on me and ordained me to the same Priesthood\u2014for so we were commanded.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30572\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30572)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30572)\">JS\u2014H 1:69\u201371<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/our-fundamental-obligation-the-priesthood.p19\" class=\"\">It was just a few weeks later that Peter, James, and John appeared to confer the Melchizedek Priesthood and the apostleship upon these same two men. That priesthood authority remains today in an unbroken chain. How reassuring to know that God\u2019s house is a house of order and that the same great leaders of 2,000 years ago were privileged to reestablish true priesthood authority on the earth.
