Most of us tried to get to the middle so we wouldn\u2019t be thrown off by the centrifugal force as the saucer picked up speed. Sometimes those on the edge would grab a friend who was closer to the middle, but that would pull them both completely off the saucer. I soon recognized that the centrifugal force was far less powerful in the middle. I was quite safe in the center even though the saucer was still spinning. But it was risky when someone on the fringe latched on to me. I learned that safety comes from staying close to the center.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>8.

I believe your spirits may have been reserved for these latter days; that you, like Esther, have come to earth \u201cfor such a time as this.\u201d It may be that your most significant, everlasting achievements will be your righteous influence on others, that your divine feminine inner beauty and intuition will find expression in your quiet strength, gentleness, dignity, charm, graciousness, creativity, sensitivity, radiance, and spirituality. Enhance these sublime feminine gifts. They will make you appealing and even irresistible as you serve others as the handmaidens of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/the-virtues-of-righteous-daughters-of-god.p47\" class=\"\">I testify that if you practice these virtues, you will be able to \u201cpress forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote18-23905_000_040\">18<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3440\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3440)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3440)\">2 Ne. 31:20<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-23905_000_040\"><a name=\"-23905_000_040\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-23905_000_040\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"3439\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3439)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3439)\">2 Ne. 31:20<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-23905_000_040\"><a name=\"-23905_000_040\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-23905_000_040\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Lectures on Faith<\/span> (1985), 1.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-23905_000_040\"><a name=\"-23905_000_040\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-23905_000_040\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Private letter written by Michele Lewis, 12 Aug. 1996.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-23905_000_040\"><a name=\"-23905_000_040\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-23905_000_040\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1995, 102;
