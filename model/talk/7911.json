Three years isn\u2019t long to call an entire Quorum of Twelve Apostles from a handful of new converts, purge from them the error of old ways, teach them the wonders of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and then leave them to carry on the work until they too were killed.

Their Lord and Master, their Counselor and King, was crucified. His mortal ministry was over, and the struggling little Church He had established seemed doomed to scorn and destined for extinction. His Apostles did witness Him in His resurrected state, but that only added to their bewilderment. As they surely must have wondered, \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d they turned for an answer to Peter, the senior Apostle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/the-first-great-commandment.p11\" class=\"\">Here I ask your indulgence as I take some nonscriptural liberty in my portrayal of this exchange.

None of us could have imagined such a few short months ago the miracles we have seen and the divinity we have enjoyed. We have talked with, prayed with, and labored with the very Son of God Himself. We have walked with Him and wept with Him, and on the night of that horrible ending, no one wept more bitterly than I. But that is over. He has finished His work, and He has risen from the tomb. He has worked out His salvation and ours. So you ask, \u2018What do we do now?\u2019 I don\u2019t know more to tell you than to return to your former life, rejoicing. I intend to \u2018go a fishing.\u2019\u201d And at least six of the ten other remaining Apostles said in agreement, \u201cWe also go with thee.\u201d John, who was one of them, writes, \u201cThey went forth, and entered into a ship immediately.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-10411_000_032\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"123549\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123549)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123549)\">John 21:3<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/the-first-great-commandment.p12\" class=\"\">But, alas, the fishing wasn\u2019t very good.

Or perhaps he was searching his heart, seeking honest confirmation of the answer he had given so readily, almost automatically.

What I need, Peter, are disciples\u2014and I need them forever. I need someone to feed my sheep and save my lambs. I need someone to preach my gospel and defend my faith. I need someone who loves me, truly, truly loves me, and loves what our Father in Heaven has commissioned me to do. Ours is not a feeble message. It is not a fleeting task. It is not hapless; it is not hopeless; it is not to be consigned to the ash heap of history. It is the work of Almighty God, and it is to change the world.
