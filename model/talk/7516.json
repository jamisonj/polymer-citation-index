I am a single woman and do not have any children of my own. I think Sister Beck thought that I was qualified to talk about families because I have never made a mistake with any of my own children. Many women can\u2019t claim that.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/i-will-strengthen-thee-i-will-help-thee.p6\" class=\"\">I am a social worker by profession and have worked with many families over the years\u2014mostly with families who are experiencing troubles or great challenges. I have seen some heartbreaking situations where children have been badly hurt\u2014both physically and emotionally. I have seen children who have been abandoned and forgotten due to the substance abuse or addictions of their parents. I have seen 18-year-olds who have been in foster care and are now out on their own without any support and backing of a loving family to help them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/i-will-strengthen-thee-i-will-help-thee.p7\" class=\"\">Thankfully, most of us don\u2019t have abuse or neglect in our families, but every family will experience some type of challenge\u2014illness, death, disobedience, financial problems, and so forth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/i-will-strengthen-thee-i-will-help-thee.p8\" class=\"\">These problems raise some serious questions.

He tells us that marriage is not important, that children do not need a father and a mother, and that strong families are not important. He tells us that moral values are old-fashioned and silly. When challenges come, Satan tells us to abandon our beliefs and go with the ways of the world. He entices us with fame and fortune and tells us where to find the easy life. He attacks our faith in God and tries to discourage even the strongest and most loving families. Satan is delighted when we give in\u2014even just a little.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>What Is the Difference between a Stable Family and One That Is Dysfunctional?<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/i-will-strengthen-thee-i-will-help-thee.p13\" class=\"\">The members of a stable family know who they are, where they are going, and what they want to achieve. The members of a dysfunctional family do not know who they are; they have no plan, no anchor, and no core set of values or standards to set their course.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/i-will-strengthen-thee-i-will-help-thee.p14\" class=\"\">Some of the parents of dysfunctional families were taught good values but have gotten on the wrong path due to alcohol, drugs, or other addictions that have taken away their good judgment and their ability to make correct decisions. In a stable family, loving parents teach by example and don\u2019t just tell their children to do something. They do it with them and show them how things are done.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>What Are Some Simple Things That Will Help Families?<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/i-will-strengthen-thee-i-will-help-thee.p16\" class=\"\">Remember, children are precious.

Tell them you love them. Put your arms around them. Appropriate physical affection will accomplish miracles. Express kind words. Show them by example how to work. Teach them to pray. President James E. Faust said, \u201cPraying together as a family is a bonding experience. Younger children can learn how to pray as they hear the prayers of their parents and older siblings. \u2026 Individual prayer and family prayer are indispensable to personal and family happiness.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-00611_000_043\">1<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cChallenges Facing the Family,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,<\/span> Jan. 10, 2004, 2.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/i-will-strengthen-thee-i-will-help-thee.p18\" class=\"\">Read to your children.

As precious as they are, children can be exasperating, frustrating, and sometimes even naughty. It takes a tremendous amount of patience and restraint in order to avoid doing or saying things we will later regret.

It is also a big responsibility for parents.\u201d I thought for a moment that it really didn\u2019t pertain too much to me since I wasn\u2019t married and didn\u2019t have any children.
