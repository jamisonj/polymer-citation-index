Two of President Heber C. Kimball\u2019s sons were called into military service for a three-month expedition against the Indians. Before they left he gave them a priesthood blessing. Apparently concerned that his sons might shed the blood of their Lamanite brothers, he first counseled them about the great promises God has made to this branch of the house of Israel [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24006\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24006)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24006)\">Gen. 49:1\u201328<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"4216\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4216)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4216)\">2 Ne. 4:3\u201312<\/a><\/span>].

Persons who need extra spiritual power to overcome a personal challenge can receive a blessing. Expectant mothers can be blessed before they give birth.

Elder Nelson has described how that blessing was fulfilled by significant reductions in the risk of certain heart operations and in the time required for postoperative care. Eight years later, the man who had blessed him became his patient. Elder Spencer W. Kimball was scheduled for a complex heart operation. Presidents Harold B. Lee and N. Eldon Tanner blessed Dr. Nelson \u201cthat the operation would be performed without error, that all would go well, and that [he] need not fear for [his] own inadequacies, for [he] had been raised up by the Lord to perform this operation\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign, <\/span>May 1984, p. 88).

Think of a young man preparing to leave home to seek his fortune in the world. If his father gave him a compass, he might use this worldly tool to help him find his way. If his father gave him money, he could use this to give him power over worldly things. A priesthood blessing is a conferral of power over spiritual things. Though it cannot be touched or weighed, it is of great significance in helping us overcome obstacles on the path to eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/priesthood-blessings.p18\" class=\"\">Remember how the Savior intervened to assure that the little children could come unto him.

In the spring of 1844, some men were plotting against the Prophet Joseph Smith. One of the leaders, William Law, held a secret meeting at his home in Nauvoo. Among those invited were nineteen-year-old Dennison Lott Harris and his friend, Robert Scott. Dennison\u2019s father, Emer Harris, who is my second great-grandfather, was also invited. He sought counsel from the Prophet Joseph Smith, who told him not to attend the meeting but to have the young men attend. The Prophet instructed them to pay close attention and report what was said.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/priesthood-blessings.p31\" class=\"\">The spokesmen at this first meeting denounced Joseph Smith as a fallen prophet and stated their determination to destroy him.

Again the Prophet asked them to attend, but he told them this would be their last meeting. \u201cBe careful to remain silent and not to make any covenants or promises with them,\u201d he counseled. He also cautioned them on the great danger of their mission. Although he thought it unlikely, it was possible they would be killed.

Then, when each person was required to take an oath to join the plot and keep it secret, they bravely refused. After everyone else had sworn secrecy, the whole group turned on Dennison and Robert, threatening to kill them unless they took the oath also. Because any refusal threatened the secrecy of their plans, about half of the plotters proposed to kill these two immediately. Knives were drawn, and angry men began to force them down into a basement to kill them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/priesthood-blessings.p34\" class=\"\">Other plotters shouted to wait. Parents probably knew where they were. If they didn\u2019t return, an alarm would be sounded and a search could reveal the boys\u2019 deaths and the secret plans. During a long argument, two lives hung in the balance. Finally, the group decided to threaten to kill the young men if they ever revealed anything that had occurred and then to release them. This was done. Despite this threat, and because they had followed the Prophet\u2019s counsel not to make any promises to the conspirators, Dennison and Robert promptly reported everything to the Prophet Joseph Smith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/priesthood-blessings.p35\" class=\"\">For their own protection, the Prophet had these courageous young men promise him that they would never reveal this experience, not even to their fathers, for at least twenty years.

I rejoice as I recall inspired promises and the strengthened faith that came when they were fulfilled. I feel pride in the faith of a new generation when I think of a son, apprehensive about a professional examination and unable to reach his faraway father, seeking a priesthood blessing from the most accessible priesthood holder in his family, the husband of his sister. I remember a confused young convert to the Church seeking a blessing to help him change the self-destructive pattern of his life. He received a blessing so unusual I was astonished when I heard the words I spoke.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/priesthood-blessings.p38\" class=\"\">Brethren, young and old, do not be hesitant to ask for a priesthood blessing when you are in need of spiritual power. Fathers and other elders, cherish and magnify the privilege of blessing your children and the other children of our Heavenly Father. Be prepared to give priesthood blessings under the influence of the Holy Ghost whenever you are requested in sincerity and faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/priesthood-blessings.p39\" class=\"\">This is the true church of our Savior. I testify of the saving mission of Jesus Christ. We are bearers of his priesthood. God bless us to exercise that priesthood under his direction, for the blessing of his children. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
