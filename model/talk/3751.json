The Savior said, \u201cA certain man had two sons.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32116\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32116)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32116)\">Luke 15:11<\/a><\/span>.) The younger of the two sons seemed always to be in the shadow of his older, more mature brother. Compliments would come freely to the older brother. His age and size were in his favor; he could work harder. The younger son, always compared to his older brother, never quite measured up. He tired more quickly, did not get all the work done, and probably had a fairly poor self-image. He may, have determined that the \u201csystem\u201d was against him. He was not being judged on his own merits. He decided to leave home and start in a new environment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p4\" class=\"\">The parable continues: \u201cAnd the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32118\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32118)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32118)\">Luke 15:12<\/a><\/span>.) Apparently the father had previously discussed with his sons that one day each would receive an inheritance. The inheritance would be a free-will gift from the father. It is doubtful that either son actually earned much more than his room and board. Nevertheless, the father \u201cdivided unto him his living.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32119\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32119)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32119)\">Luke 15:12<\/a><\/span>.) This, in essence, was approval for the younger man to strike out on his own with his inheritance. The father loved him. He may have had an idea what the younger son would do with his share. The younger brother \u201cgathered all together, and took his journey into a far country.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32120\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32120)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32120)\">Luke 15:13<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p5\" class=\"\">He may have intended to do something honorable. However, he found, after arriving in the distant city in a far country, people did not just automatically gather round and make him welcome. He was in a predicament, no influence and no friends. True friends must be earned, others can be bought. The younger son found that flies are attracted by honey. He began to flash his inheritance around. The flies came. Not only did he not invest or use his money wisely, he wasted it on riotous living. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32121\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32121)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32121)\">Luke 15:13<\/a><\/span>.)

Conditions were bad, for not only had he used up all his inheritance, but even the average citizen waxed sore. He had been taught to work at home and apparently attempted to find work. He may have gone to many who had been his friends when he was \u201cflush.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p7\" class=\"\">The prodigal began to be in want and \u201cwent and joined himself to a [certain] citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32123\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32123)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32123)\">Luke 15:15<\/a><\/span>.) Now he was not only destitute, but also forced to take the most humble kind of work. In such great poverty was he that \u201che would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32124\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32124)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32124)\">Luke 15:16<\/a><\/span>.) The Savior is undoubtedly showing us the contrast and the depths of poverty and need to which he had sunk. He had indulged with all who came when he had money. Now not even one of his supposed friends so much as gave him a husk of corn so that he might feed at least as well as the swine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p8\" class=\"\">There is a great purging and humbling that comes from the wells of despair.

The father had been faithful and had worked hard all his life, a frugal man with character and integrity. Would he turn his son away? The younger son arose and came unto his father\u2014undoubtedly a long journey.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p14\" class=\"\">Now, the older son may have noticed that since the younger brother\u2019s leaving, the father seemed always preoccupied. His father had little interest in the work. He would work a bit, then leave the field to look down the road, each time returning with a faraway look in his eyes. Not only did the older brother have to do his own work and make up for the younger brother\u2019s absence, but he also had an additional work load which was previously done by the father. It also seemed that his father paid him little attention. Before the younger brother\u2019s leaving, there was always a word of praise for the way the older son worked. Now, there was little or no fun, no singing, no dancing, and precious little talk. Both the mother and father would sit at night and stare into the open fire. Days, weeks, even months passed thus.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p15\" class=\"\">The Master states: \u201cBut when [the younger son] was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cBut the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32127\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32127)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32127)\">Luke 15:20\u201322<\/a><\/span>.) The long journey probably had been made with little or no footwear, so the robe and shoes were necessities. But the father also had a ring brought for his son\u2019s hand. This was an unexpected gift, an expression of the gratitude of the father for the son\u2019s return.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cFor this my son was dead, and is alive again \u2026 was lost, and is found.

Perhaps he thought he should have taken his inheritance also. He would not have wasted it, but increased it. In spite of these thoughts, he had stayed at home and been a dutiful son. There was no music, no dancing for his righteous life; and yet when his younger brother returned, all of these things celebrated his coming.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p25\" class=\"\">Word came to the father that his son was outside and would not come in,\u201d therefore came his father out, and intreated him.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32129\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32129)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32129)\">Luke 15:28<\/a><\/span>.) The father must have realized the oversight; he may even have apologized. The great concern for his younger son was off his mind. He remembered he had not been as complimentary to the older son as usual. He recalled the older son\u2019s more intense work to compensate\u2014no dancing, no music, no sumptuous feasts.
