It is a sacred time for you to be alive.

I thought these were all good qualities. But when my oldest daughter, Becky, was 16, she came to me and asked, \u201cWhat is the most important quality to look for in a husband?\u201d By then I had been married for many years. I knew the answer to that question. I believe the most important quality we can possess is integrity. How I love the value of integrity!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p7\" class=\"\">What is this most important principle? Integrity means to <span class=\"emphasis\">do<\/span> what you say you will do; you keep promises to yourself. The Young Women program defines integrity as: \u201cI will have the moral courage to make my actions consistent with my knowledge of right and wrong.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cWe can easily spot \u2026 someone with integrity. They\u2019re honest. They do the right thing when nobody is watching. They keep their word and they keep our confidences. They repay their debts, and they clean up their own messes. They accept responsibility for their actions\u201d (\u201cThe Wholeness of Integrity,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Church News,<\/span> 26 June 1999, 16).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p9\" class=\"\">Everyone comes into this world with different levels of integrity. Have you ever wondered what qualified Jesus to be given the role as Savior of the world? He was the Firstborn of the Father, chosen from the beginning. But what really made Him perfect? It was His total dedication and desire to please our Father in Heaven. The Savior was capable of sinning, but His desire for \u201chonesty [was] an armor against temptation\u201d (James E. Talmage, <span class=\"emphasis\">Jesus the Christ,<\/span> 3rd ed. [1916], 134). The Savior said, \u201cI do always those things that please [the Father]\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124732\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124732)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124732)\">John 8:29<\/a><\/span>). We know that throughout His life, He consistently made right choices. He had the moral courage to make His actions consistent with His knowledge of right and wrong.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p10\" class=\"\">President Hinckley has said: \u201cIn all this world there is no substitute for personal integrity. It includes honor. It includes performance. It includes keeping one\u2019s word. It includes doing what is right regardless of the circumstances\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley<\/span> [1997], 270).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p11\" class=\"\">Let\u2019s look at a few examples of young women who are learning to love integrity. They have chosen to do what is right regardless of the circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p12\" class=\"\">A young woman named Brooke writes: \u201cThis past summer I had the opportunity of attending a leadership conference. It only took a couple of hours to find out that the LDS kids were in the minority there. I ended up [rooming] with two girls who were very nice but definitely didn\u2019t have the same standards. At night when I read my scriptures they stared at me like I was some kind of weirdo. While they were talking about their drinking parties, I was talking about [parties] with punch and cookies. They laughed but were always curious.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cAlthough I was scared sometimes, I never failed to stand up for what I believe in. At the end of the conference, one of my roommates [said], \u2018I guess Mormons can be cool,\u2019 and that she would think about our religion and maybe even learn about it. I [learned] that I could make a difference by simply standing up for what I believe.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p14\" class=\"\">Cari shares this experience:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cI have always known what was right, but I thought I could choose my own path. After being on that path, I started to feel lost and confused. Finally I prayed with a humble heart and asked Heavenly Father what I should do. The first step was to change friends. That wasn\u2019t easy, being in the \u201cpopular\u201d group. But I took the challenge and did just that.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cWe liked to hang out on the weekend and watch R-rated movies. I had made up my mind never to watch R movies again. It was the beginning of a new school year, and a guy asked me to watch a movie. I told him that I didn\u2019t watch rated R movies. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s cool, we can watch a different one.\u201d This has happened more than once. I have left parties, sat home on weekends, and turned down [dates] because I don\u2019t watch R-rated movies. This has been the greatest blessing in my life. Now it\u2019s easier for me to stand up for what I believe in many other ways.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p17\" class=\"\">Kristen, a Laurel, writes:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cI try to stand as a witness of God every day. It\u2019s the little things\u2014being nice to everyone I talk with, not laughing at a crude joke, not gossiping about someone, being patient. Sometimes it\u2019s these small things that are the hardest to do, \u2026 but I constantly strive to do better. Scripture study and prayer have given me power\u2014the courage to stand and share with the Savior my testimony of Him. The scriptures give me the power to change for the better.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p19\" class=\"\">Now listen to Salina\u2019s letter:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cLast year in seminary we were taught about Joseph Smith. Towards the end of the year, we had a spiritual lesson that has impacted the rest of my life. Through all of his experiences, he never once failed to stand as a witness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cAs I sat listening, I asked myself over and over if I could be that strong. My testimony was strengthened that day as the Spirit manifested to me that the Church was true and Joseph Smith was a true prophet. If I was faced with trials as he was, with the Lord\u2019s help I could be just as strong. So I made a commitment that day that I would always stand as a witness. If Joseph Smith could do it, so can I!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p22\" class=\"\">These young women are learning the value of integrity. There is a common thread which runs through all of these stories. Do you recognize it? You\u2019ve heard it a thousand times before. Reading your scriptures and saying your prayers invites the Spirit to be with you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p23\" class=\"\">When President Spencer W. Kimball was 15 years old, he attended stake conference and heard a speaker ask everyone who had read the entire Bible to raise their hands. I heard President Kimball say, \u201cI cared not what others were thinking. I knew that I had not read it and I was filled with shame.\u201d After the meeting was over, he ran home as fast as he could, grabbed the Bible off the shelf, and climbed the stairs to the attic. His brothers teased him, saying, \u201cWhy try? You\u2019ll never finish it.\u201d But he did. Almost a year later he finished reading the Bible. The integrity he had as a 15-year-old boy was one of the things that made him a great prophet of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p24\" class=\"\">Dear young women, you too can develop a love for integrity as you discipline yourselves through daily prayer and scripture study. The Holy Ghost can inspire you with a greater desire for honesty and integrity. Make a decision tonight that you will read your scriptures and say your prayers every day for the rest of your life. You see, scriptures and prayer go together like peanut butter and jelly. They will help you stay close to the Church and close to the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/integrity.p25\" class=\"\">And remember this: as you develop your integrity you can be more beautiful.
