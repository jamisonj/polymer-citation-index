When, in disgust or discouragement, we allow ourselves to reach depressive levels of despair because of our demeaning self-appraisal, it is a sad day for us and a sad day in the eyes of God. For us to conclude that we have no gifts when we judge ourselves by stature, intelligence, grade-point average, wealth, power, position, or external appearance is not only unfair but unreasonable.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/there-are-many-gifts.p4\" class=\"\">From <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18610\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18610)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18610)\">D&amp;C 46:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>, we have this truth: \u201cFor all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/there-are-many-gifts.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cTo some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/there-are-many-gifts.p6\" class=\"\">God has given each of us one or more special talents.

How could those in charge decide?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/there-are-many-gifts.p55\" class=\"\">The tall, handsome young man mentioned many names of past Scout leaders and then said, \u201cNo, it is none of these, though they have all been great Scouters. Our ward \u2018Best Scouter Ever\u2019 award goes to someone who has worked in the Primary and as a Scout leader teaching boys for forty years. This individual has received the Silver Beaver Award, one of the highest awards given in Scouting, and the Silver Beehive Award, the highest award given by the Church in Scouting.\u201d Then with a voice that trembled slightly, he said, \u201cOur \u2018Best Scouter Ever\u2019 recognition goes to Sister Jennie Verl Keefer.\u201d There came a hush over the audience, then knowing voices of approval, then a burst of applause that seemed to go on forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/there-are-many-gifts.p56\" class=\"\">Sister Keefer was called up to the front. All present intently watched her quietly make her way. From the back of the room, this gray-haired bundle of energy hesitatingly came forward, her five-foot frame barely taller than those who were seated. Once at the microphone, the surprised recipient expressed a quiet and emotional, yet firm, thanks. She said between tears of gratitude it wasn\u2019t quite forty years she had served. It was only thirty-seven years. And then Sister Keefer proudly added that during all her time of service, she had never had a bad boy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/there-are-many-gifts.p57\" class=\"\">Then the presenter asked all those whom Sister Keefer had ever taught and cared for to come to the stage. Here was the amazing thing. Men and boys started from the audience and filled the space behind this tiny woman. Big men, men in suits, doctors, bishops, presidents of companies, husbands, fathers holding babies, returned missionaries, contractors, computer workers, dentists, carpenters, and more. All these Scouts had been boys touched by the service and caring of this one noble and great woman\u2014the best Scouter ever in the ward\u2019s entire history. She had the gift of caring, and here were some of the fruits of her labors. Generations yet to come will bless her name for what she has done. What a great gift have those who know how to care!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/there-are-many-gifts.p58\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd to every man is given a gift\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18609\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18609)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18609)\">D&amp;C 46:11<\/a><\/span>). This is true. God help us to recognize, develop, and share our gifts that all may profit thereby is my earnest hope and plea.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/there-are-many-gifts.p59\" class=\"\">God does live. He does bless us with gifts. As we develop and share our God-given gifts and benefit from the gifts of those around us, the world can be a better place and God\u2019s work will move forward at a more rapid pace. To these truths I bear my testimony and leave my personal witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
