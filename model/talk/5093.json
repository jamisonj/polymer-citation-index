They are young, pliable, eager, and filled with unlimited energy. Sometimes they make mistakes. I remember a meeting where we of the First Presidency and the Twelve were reviewing a youthful mistake made by a missionary. The tone was serious and rather critical, when Elder LeGrand Richards said, \u201cNow, brethren, if the good Lord wanted to put a forty-year-old head on a nineteen-year-old body, He would have done so. But He didn\u2019t. He placed a nineteen-year-old head on a nineteen-year-old body, and we should be a bit more understanding.\u201d The mood of the group changed, the problem was solved, and we moved on with the meeting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p20\" class=\"\">The years in the Aaronic Priesthood are growing years. They are years of maturing, learning, developing.

Be examples worthy of emulation. Youth need fewer critics and more models to follow. \u201cTeach ye diligently,\u201d said the Lord, \u201cand my grace shall attend you.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19490\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19490)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19490)\">D&amp;C 88:78<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p22\" class=\"\">These young men of the Aaronic Priesthood, many of whom are assembled here tonight, have a vital interest in athletics. The Church recognizes this fact and provides through its activities and athletic programs an opportunity for participation and growth. The enormous financial investment in physical facilities made by the Church, with the anticipation that all may benefit, can provide fellowship and brotherhood, as well as the development of athletic skills. These goals, however, are defeated if winning the game overshadows participation in the game. Young men come to play\u2014not to sit on the bench. Ours is the privilege to provide this opportunity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p23\" class=\"\">I remember in my youth a basketball team from the Twenty-fifth Ward of the Pioneer Stake that had ten young men participating. A wise leader decided not to play just the five best, with the other five substituting here and there. Rather, he formed two teams with balanced ability and age. One team of five played the first and third periods, while the remaining team of five played the second and fourth periods. It was not a contest between bench warmers and active players, but a situation where morale was high, playing time was equal, and games were played and won in the right spirit. No participant in Church-sponsored athletic contests should warm the bench for the entire game.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p24\" class=\"\">Scouting is another area of vital interest to young men. Much has been said in the media of late regarding Scouting. Let me affirm that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has not diminished in any way its support of the Scouting movement. President Spencer W. Kimball declared that the Church endorses Scouting \u201cand will seek to provide leadership which will help boys keep close to their families and close to the Church as they develop the qualities of citizenship and character and fitness which Scouting represents. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ve remained strong and firm in our support of this great movement for boys and the Oath and the Law which are at its center.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1977, p. 36.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p26\" class=\"\">President Ezra Taft Benson described Scouting as \u201ca noble program,\u201d saying, \u201cIt is a builder of character, not only in the boys, but also in the men who provide the leadership.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">\u2026 So Shall Ye Reap,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1960, p. 138.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p27\" class=\"\">Brethren, if ever there were a time when the principles of Scouting were vitally needed\u2014that time is now. If ever there were a generation who would benefit by keeping physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight\u2014that generation is the present generation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p28\" class=\"\">A few years ago a Scouting skill saved a life\u2014in my own family. My nephew\u2019s son, eleven-year-old Craig Dearden, successfully completed his requirements for Scouting\u2019s swimming award. His father beamed his approval, while mother tenderly placed an affectionate kiss. Little did those attending the court of honor realize the life-or-death impact of that award. Later that very afternoon, it was Craig who spotted a dark object at the deep end of the swimming pool. It was Craig who, without fear, plunged into the pool to investigate and brought to the surface his own little brother. Tiny Scott was so still, so blue, so lifeless. Recalling the life-saving procedures he had learned and practiced, Craig and others responded in the true tradition of Scouting. Suddenly there was a cry, breathing, movement, life. Is Scouting relevant? Ask a mother, a father, a family who know a Scouting skill saved a son and brother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p29\" class=\"\">Many of you are serving as members of bishoprics, of high councils, and as officers in priesthood quorums.

Other brethren have the ability to work with youth, to win their respect, prompt their determination to overcome temptation, and lead with love these choice young spirits as they travel along that pathway which, when followed, provides eternal life.

Such was my thought one day as I drove down the street where Ben and Emily lived. They were older\u2014even in the twilight period of life. Aches and pains of advancing years caused them to withdraw from activity to the shelter of their home\u2014isolated, detached, shut out from the mainstream of daily life and association.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p37\" class=\"\">That day I felt the unmistakable prompting to park my car and visit Ben and Emily, even though I was on my way to a meeting. It was a sunny weekday afternoon. I approached the door to their home and knocked. Emily answered. When she recognized me, her bishop, she exclaimed, \u201cAll day long I have waited for my phone to ring. It has been silent. I hoped that the postman would deliver a letter. He brought only bills. Bishop, how did you know today is my birthday?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p38\" class=\"\">I answered, \u201cGod knows, Emily, for He loves you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p39\" class=\"\">In the quiet of their living room, I said to Ben and Emily, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I was directed here today, but our Heavenly Father knows. Let\u2019s kneel in prayer and ask Him why.\u201d This we did, and the answer came. Emily, who had a beautiful voice, was asked to sing in the choir\u2014even to provide a solo for the forthcoming ward conference. Ben was asked to speak to the Aaronic Priesthood young men and recount a special experience in his life when his safety was assured by responding to the promptings of the Spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p40\" class=\"\">She sang. He spoke. Hearts were gladdened by the return to activity of Ben and Emily. They rarely missed a sacrament meeting from that day to the time each was called home.

The visits to the homes of quorum members, blessing the sick, helping a member with a project, or comforting grieving hearts when a loved one passes on are all sacred privileges of priesthood service. True, they may not be recorded on a written report; but more important, they find lodgment in the soul and bring joy to the heart. They are also known of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p42\" class=\"\">Should our load seem heavy or the results of our efforts discouraging, we may well recall the words of President Kimball to some who noted his undeviating devotion to his calling even in his advancing years: \u201cMy life is like my shoes\u2014to be worn out in service.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Dec. 1985, p. 41.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p43\" class=\"\">I trust that all young men here tonight are preparing now to serve a full-time mission in the service of the Lord.

You will never know the full influence of your testimony and your service, but you will return with gladness for having had the privilege of responding to a sacred call to serve the Master.

When I first visited Czechoslovakia, accompanied by Hans B. Ringger, long before the freedom bell sounded, I was met by Jiri Snederfler, our leader through this dark period, and Sister Olga Snederfler, his wife. I went to their home in Prague where the branch met. Displayed on the walls of the room in which we assembled were picture after picture of the Salt Lake Temple. I said to Sister Snederfler, \u201cYour husband must truly love the temple.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p45\" class=\"\">She responded, \u201cI, too; I, too.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p46\" class=\"\">We sat down for some soup Sister Snederfler had prepared, after which she brought out a treasure trove: an album containing individual pictures of the missionaries who were serving there in 1950 when the government edict came for the mission to be closed. As she slowly leafed through the pictures of different missionaries, she would say, \u201cWonderful boy; wonderful boy.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p47\" class=\"\">Brother Snederfler has been a courageous Church leader in Czechoslovakia and has been willing to put everything on the line for the gospel. When the opportunity came that we would seek recognition for the Church in that country, the government leaders, then Communist, said, \u201cDon\u2019t send an American. Don\u2019t send a German. Don\u2019t send a Swiss. Send a citizen of Czechoslovakia.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p48\" class=\"\">There were ominous implications in that particular statement, because to have admitted that you were a church leader during this period of the prohibition of religion was tantamount to possible imprisonment. And yet, this call came to Brother Snederfler to be the designated person to go before the government and to forthrightly state that he was the leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for all of Czechoslovakia and that he was seeking recognition for his church. He later told me that he had been somewhat frightened and had asked for the prayers of his brothers and sisters in the Prague Branch. He went to his sweet wife, Olga, and said to her, \u201cI love you. I don\u2019t know when, or if, I\u2019ll be back; but I love the gospel, and I must follow my Savior.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/called-to-serve.p49\" class=\"\">With that spirit of faith and devotion, Brother Snederfler went before the government officials and acknowledged that he was the leader of the Church and that he was there to seek a restoration of the recognition the Church had enjoyed long years before. In the meantime Elder Russell M. Nelson had been working tirelessly to bring about the desired decision. Later, Brother Snederfler heard the good news: \u201cYour church is again recognized in Czechoslovakia.\u201d How eager Brother Snederfler was to tell his dear wife and the other stalwart members of the Church the wonderful news that once again missionaries could come to Czechoslovakia and the Church could provide a haven for freedom of worship in that nation.
