They suppose that they shall have all that marriage can offer without the obligations connected with it. They are wrong!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p14\" class=\"\">However much they hope to find in a relationship of that kind, they will lose more. Living together without marriage destroys something inside all who participate. Virtue, self-esteem, and refinement of character wither away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p15\" class=\"\">Claiming that it will not happen does not prevent the loss; and these virtues, once lost, are not easily reclaimed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p16\" class=\"\">To suppose that one day they may nonchalantly change their habits and immediately claim all that might have been theirs had they not made a mockery of marriage is to suppose something that will not be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p17\" class=\"\">One day, when they come to themselves, they will reap disappointment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p18\" class=\"\">One cannot degrade marriage without tarnishing other words as well, such words as <span class=\"emphasis\">boy, girl, manhood, womanhood, husband, wife, father, mother, baby, children, family, home.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p19\" class=\"\">Such words as <span class=\"emphasis\">unselfishness<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">sacrifice<\/span> will then be tossed aside. Then self-respect will fade and love itself will not want to stay.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p20\" class=\"\">If you have been tempted to enter such a relationship or if you now live with another without marriage, leave! Withdraw from it! Run away from it! Do not continue with it! Or, if you can, make a marriage out of it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p21\" class=\"\">Even a rickety marriage will serve good purpose as long as two people struggle to keep it from falling down around them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p22\" class=\"\">And now a word of warning. One who destroys a marriage takes upon himself a very great responsibility indeed. Marriage is sacred!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p23\" class=\"\">To willfully destroy a marriage, either your own or that of another couple, is to offend our God. Such a thing will not be lightly considered in the judgments of the Almighty and in the eternal scheme of things will not easily be forgiven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p24\" class=\"\">Do not threaten nor break up a marriage. Do not translate some disenchantment with your own marriage partner or an attraction for someone else into justification for any conduct that would destroy a marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p25\" class=\"\">This monumental transgression frequently places heavy burdens upon little children. They do not understand the selfish yearnings of unhappy adults who are willing to buy their own satisfaction at the expense of the innocent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p26\" class=\"\">God Himself decreed that the physical expression of love, that union of male and female which has power to generate life, is authorized only in marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p27\" class=\"\">Marriage is the shelter where families are created. That society which puts low value on marriage sows the wind and, in time, will reap the whirlwind\u2014and thereafter, unless they repent, bring upon themselves a holocaust!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p28\" class=\"\">Some think that every marriage must expect to end in unhappiness and divorce, with the hopes and dreams predestined to end in a broken, sad wreck of things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p29\" class=\"\">Some marriages do bend, and some will break, but we must not, because of this, lose faith in marriage nor become afraid of it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p30\" class=\"\">Broken marriages are not typical.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p31\" class=\"\">Remember that trouble attracts attention! We travel the highway with thousands of cars moving in either direction without paying much attention to any of them. But should an accident occur, we notice immediately.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p32\" class=\"\">If it happens again, we get the false impression that no one can go safely down the road.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p33\" class=\"\">One accident may make the front page, while a hundred million cars that safely pass are not regarded as worth mentioning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p34\" class=\"\">Writers think that a happy, stable marriage does not have the dramatic appeal, the conflict worth featuring in a book or a play or a film. Therefore, we constantly hear about the ruined ones and we lose our perspective.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p35\" class=\"\">I believe in marriage. I believe it to be the ideal pattern for human living. I know it to be ordained of God. The restraints relating to it were designed to protect our happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p36\" class=\"\">I do not know of any better time in all of the history of the world for a young couple who are of age and prepared and who are in love to think of marriage.

Troubles like we have now are very hard on marriages.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p38\" class=\"\">Do not lose faith in marriage. Not even if you have been through the unhappiness of a divorce and are surrounded with pieces of a marriage that has fallen apart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p39\" class=\"\">If you have honored your vows and your partner did not do so, remember God is watching over us. One day, after all of the tomorrows have passed, there will be recompense. Those who have been moral and faithful to their covenants will be happy and those who have not will be otherwise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p40\" class=\"\">Some marriages have broken up in spite of all that one partner could do to hold the marriage together. While there may be faults on both sides, I do not condemn the innocent one who suffers in spite of all that was desired and done to save the marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p41\" class=\"\">And to you I say, do not lose faith in marriage itself. Do not let your disappointment leave you bitter or cynical or justify any conduct that is unworthy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p42\" class=\"\">If you have had no opportunity for marriage or if you have lost your companion in death, keep your faith in marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p43\" class=\"\">Some years ago an associate of mine lost his beloved wife. She died after a lingering illness, and he watched in helpless agony as the doctors withdrew all hope.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p44\" class=\"\">One day near the end she told him that when she was gone she wanted him to marry again and he was not to wait too long a time. He protested! The children were nearly grown and he would go the rest of the way alone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p45\" class=\"\">She turned away and wept and said, \u201cHave I been such a failure that after all our years together you would rather go unmarried?

In marriage all of the worthy yearnings of the human soul, all that is physical and emotional and spiritual, can be fulfilled.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p48\" class=\"\">Marriage is not without trials of many kinds. These tests forge virtue and strength. The tempering that comes in marriage and family life produces men and women who will someday be exalted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p49\" class=\"\">God has ordained that life should have its beginning within the protecting shelter of marriage, conceived in a consummate expression of love and nurtured and fostered with that deeper love which is accompanied always by sacrifice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p50\" class=\"\">Marriage offers fulfillment all the way through life\u2014in youth and young love, the wedding and on the honeymoon, with the coming of little children and the nurturing of them. Then come the golden years when young ones leave the nest to build one of their own. The cycle then repeats itself, as God has decreed it should.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/marriage.p51\" class=\"\">There is another dimension to marriage that we know of in the Church. It came by revelation.
