I sincerely trust that I may have an interest in your faith and prayers the few moments\nthat I stand before you this afternoon.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE UPLIFT OF WORSHIP\n<\/p><p>\nI want to express my appreciation for the privilege of being here in this great assembly. It is\ncertainly a Sabbath day feast to come and attend these three days of general conference. It\ndoes something for our souls. You know in our agricultural pursuits Brother Widtsoe will tell\nus of the need of fallowing our land, permitting it to rest, that it might be recharged and\nrevitalized. We come together for that purpose in these conference sessions, that we too might\nbe revitalized and recharged, and verily these conference sessions give us the rest and peace\nof a Sabbath day.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has told us that we should go to his holy house on his day and there worship before\nhim, offer our oblations to him that we might be built up and strengthened\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12461\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12461)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12461)\">D&amp;C 59:9-12<\/a><\/span>). It isn't that the\nLord wants us to honor him, but like all of his laws, they are for our benefit and blessing. His\ninjunctions are that we might be happy, that we might grow and become spiritually strong,\nthat we might ultimately be as he is, that we might take upon ourselves great power. We are\nhere in this life for that purpose, that we might understand life and, as the scriptures say, that\nwe might have life more abundantly (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27316\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27316)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27316)\">John 10:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAGE OF SCIENTIFIC MARVELS\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Smith referred this morning to the fact that these services were not only being\nbroadcast but also that the Saints who are assembled in the Assembly Hall are permitted to\nsee just what is being done, to see the Tabernacle Choir in its singing and to see those who\nare called to the stand to speak. It is verily a marvelous age. Reference was made by Bishop\nIsaacson to the fact that he talked to his son by long-distance telephone last night. You and I\nmay talk to our sons even in Europe. We may not only talk to them but we may also see\nthem. What a source of comfort it will be for a parent to pick up the telephone and talk to his\nson in a foreign country and at the same time see him visually, to know that he is well.\n<\/p><p>\nTwenty-five years ago, had anyone said anything about television, we would have wondered\nwhether or not he was sound in his thinking, and yet today we have these marvelous things\nright at our door.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of our brethren was down in our locality a few weeks ago to talk to one of our service\nclubs, Brother Alvin Pack, a son of Dr. Fred J. Pack who formerly was connected with the\nUniversity of Utah, and has now passed to the other side, a lovely character, a man in all of\nhis scientific work stimulating faith. We were informed of some of the present-day marvelous\nachievements. He told us that as he came around the point of the mountain in his car a little\nflash on his dashboard indicated that he was wanted on the telephone and on picking up the\nreceiver he was informed that he was wanted in New York on long distance. With only a flip\nof a button he was able, as he was traveling fifty or sixty miles an hour, to make that\nconnection and talk to New York. Certainly this is a marvelous age. It is an age for youth, an\nage of opportunity, and as I thought of these things and thought of this achievement of\ntelevision I wondered in my own heart if perhaps the time will not come when we can see our\nloved ones on the other side. That is not beyond the pale of possibility. To us now, of course,\nit seems impossible. Television was impossible for us not so long ago.\n<\/p><p>\nWE MUST WALK BY FAITH\n<\/p><p>\nIs it not within the range of possibility that we may at some future day be able not only to\ncommune with those dear to us on the other side, but to see them? What an assurance this\nwould be. God in his mercy has seen fit not to grant to us this great blessing and privilege\nnow, because he recognizes we must walk by faith. We must live by faith. Human experience\nhas taught that when we walk by pure knowledge, we forget the place of God in our lives. I\nthink it was William Dean Howells who made this observation on one occasion, that he\nwondered if one of the reasons why the other side was shut out from our view was because if\nwe positively knew, we would be less kind, we would be less sympathetic in the positive\nknowledge that would come to us, we would delay the day of making right wrongs that beset\nus; but the fact that we walk by faith, the fact that sometimes there is some uncertainty in our\nwalking leads us to be more careful. Certainly the Lord in his great wisdom has withheld\nfrom us some of the things that we would all love to know and see; and yet, as we\ncontemplate the marvelous experiences of life from day to day, we are conscious of the fact\nthat in his great providence we will eventually be able to surmount all of the physical things\nthat beset us. Then we will be ushered into the eternal things, and we will know as God\nknows. We will have power as he has power. Jesus had that power. He said in effect, \"No\nman taketh this life from me, but I have power of myself to lay this body down and by the\nsame power I shall take it up. This I have received from my Father\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27318\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27318)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27318)\">John 10:18<\/a><\/span>). Even\nso will we, his children, be given these great powers, but all of them predicated upon our\nsubscribing to is divine laws and living in accordance with his holy will.\n<\/p><p>\nPARENTAL GUIDANCE NEEDED\n<\/p><p>\nI said a minute ago this is a great day for youth. Our boys and girls are having opportunities\nthe like of which we never had in our generation. It certainly is a thrilling time to live and\nyet, my brethren and sisters, I have wondered many times if in this great field of physical\nprogress we are keeping pace spiritually. I am led to this conclusion because of some of the\nexperiences that our boys and girls are having and some of the things that are coming to light\nof their experiences. One of our boys recently came home from Japan, and when I\ninterviewed him for a mission, he said frankly, \"Brother Young, I find it much harder here to\nwithstand temptation than I found it over in Tokyo.\" In interviewing some of these boys we\nfind that they are lacking some of the parental care that they should have and doubtless did\nhave a generation ago. I am wondering whether we as parents are frank enough with our boys\nand girls, if we take them into our confidence, if we are not relying too much on this\nmechanical age, for which we are truly grateful, for their spiritual strength, for the parental\ncounsel that they need. It seems to me that this is one field of our activity that we need to\nemphasize more strongly than ever before. Our boys and girls need our help. They need our\nguidance; they need to know some of the pitfalls that may confront them in their experiences;\nand they need to be talked to very frankly about some of their sex problems, my brethren and\nsisters, the field that we seem to avoid. We need parents to sit down with their boys and girls\nand to warn them of dangers that are on every hand. There is no change, in all this progress,\nin all the present-day opportunities, in some of the fundamental concepts. It is just as wrong\ntoday to steal (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22592\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22592)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22592)\">Ex. 20:15<\/a><\/span>)\nas it was four thousand years ago when the Lord gave his great commandment.\nIt is just as wrong today to commit adultery\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22591\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22591)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22591)\">Ex. 20:14<\/a><\/span>)\nas it was then. It is just as wrong today to violate\nthe Sabbath day (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22583\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22583)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22583)\">Ex. 20:8<\/a><\/span>)\nas it was then. It is just as important today that we should honor God, honor\nhis holy name, not profane it (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22581\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22581)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22581)\">Ex. 20:7<\/a><\/span>),\nkeep his holy day as it was four thousand years ago. These\nthings never change. It is just as right and proper that we should honor virtue, that we should\nhonor womanhood as we were taught centuries ago. These things never change.\n<\/p><p>\nGLORIOUS AGE FOR YOUTH\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, I repeat, my brethren and sisters, with all of the great opportunities we have before\nus, the opportunities that our boys and girls have, it is a glorious age in which to live, one\nthat brings happiness, if we keep the commandments, one that thrills us because of the great\nopportunities, and yet, with it all we must also keep pace spiritually and not forget some of\nthese fundamental concepts that are always true and will never change. So I repeat again, we\nneed to go back to some of the old customs of fathers and mothers sitting down with their\nchildren and talking through some of the problems that confront our youth. Our boys and girls\nneed our help. I am not one that would say to a boy or a girl.\n<\/p><p>\nYou're not worthy to go to the temple,\" but I would say, \"You're not quite prepared. Let us\nsit down together and see if we cannot help you to become prepared.\" It may take six months\nor it may take a year, but the fact that our boys and girls may not be prepared does not\nrelieve us of the responsibility of doing the thing we should do of helping our youth to\nbecome prepared for the problems of life and for the great spiritual opportunities that are\ntheirs in this great Church to which we belong.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God help us that we may have wisdom in the direction of our youth, in helping them in\ntheir problems and above all of having a sympathetic understanding of them and what they\nhave to face, and may he sanctify to our spiritual growth the great opportunities with which\nwe are surrounded, these glorious physical opportunities, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
