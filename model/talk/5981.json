The Richard Headlee family, learning of the suffering and pitiful conditions in Romania, joined with others to assemble a 40-foot container filled with 40,000 pounds of needed supplies, including food, clothing, medicine, blankets, and toys. The project deadline arrived, and the container had to be shipped that day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/teach-the-children.p53\" class=\"\">No one involved with the project knew of the particular need for a child-size walker. However, at the last possible moment, a family brought forth a child\u2019s walker and placed it in the container.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/teach-the-children.p54\" class=\"\">When the anxiously awaited container arrived at the orphanage in Bucharest, Dr. Oborn was present as it was opened. Every item it contained would be put to immediate use at the orphanage. As the Headlee family introduced themselves to Dr. Oborn, he said, \u201cOh, I hope you brought me a child\u2019s walker for Raymond!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/teach-the-children.p55\" class=\"\">One of the Headlee family members responded, \u201cI can vaguely remember something like a walker, but I don\u2019t know its size.\u201d Another family member was dispatched back into the container, crawling among all the bales of clothes and boxes of food, searching for the walker. When he found it, he lifted it up and cried out, \u201cIt\u2019s a little one!\u201d Cheers erupted\u2014which quickly turned to tears, for they all knew they had been part of a modern-day miracle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/teach-the-children.p56\" class=\"\">There may be some who say, \u201cWe don\u2019t have miracles today.\u201d But the doctor whose prayers were answered would respond, \u201cOh, yes we do, and Raymond is walking!\u201d She who was inspired to give the walker was a willing vessel and surely would agree.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/teach-the-children.p57\" class=\"\">Who was the angel of mercy touched by the Lord to play a vital role in this human drama? Her name is Kristin. She is the daughter of Kurt and Melodie Bestor. Kristin was born with spina bifida, as was her younger sister, Erika. The two children have spent long days and worrisome nights in the hospital. Modern medicine, lovingly practiced, along with help from our Heavenly Father have brought a measure of mobility to each. Neither is downhearted. Both inspire others to carry on. Last month Kristin and Erika entertained guests celebrating the 75th anniversary of Primary Children\u2019s Medical Center. They sang with their father and mother, and then the girls movingly sang a duet. Each person in the audience had red-rimmed eyes; handkerchiefs were everywhere displayed. These girls, this family, had overcome sorrow and brought joy to the lives of others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/teach-the-children.p58\" class=\"\">Kristin\u2019s father said to me that evening, \u201cPresident Monson, meet Kristin. She is the one who felt impressed to send her walker to Romania, hoping that some child there would be benefited.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/teach-the-children.p59\" class=\"\">I spoke to Kristin as she sat in her wheelchair. \u201cThank you for listening to the Spirit of the Lord. You have been the instrument in the Lord\u2019s hands to answer a doctor\u2019s prayer, a child\u2019s wish.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/teach-the-children.p60\" class=\"\">Later, as I walked out of that celebration held for the benefit of children, I looked upward toward the heavens and offered my own \u201cThank you\u201d to God for children, for families, for miracles in our time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/teach-the-children.p61\" class=\"\">Let us earnestly follow His direction: \u201cSuffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote16-97911_000_009\">16<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33501\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33501)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33501)\">Mark 10:14<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/teach-the-children.p62\" class=\"\">A popular song includes the words, \u201cThere are angels among us.\u201d These angels are quite frequently the precious little ones God, our Father, has entrusted to our earthly care.
