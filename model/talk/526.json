His mortal remains lie\nhere within a stone's throw of where he was born. North West Temple extends from South\nTemple on the south to First North on the north.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom my early childhood to my early manhood I lived in that area. No better people ever\nlived than lived within those two blocks on West Temple during that period of my life. No\ngreater, no sweeter, no kinder neighbors ever lived than lived there.\n<\/p><p>\nAt the head of the street on the south was the home of this man of God. At the head of the\nstreet on the north was one of the homes of his wonderful father. Their homes were properly\nplaced on that street of good neighbors. Since the day of his birth until his passing, this man\nof God traveled a million miles or more abroad in the earth in doing good.\n<\/p><p>\nHe loved the people in the old Seventeenth Ward, but he had so much love that he could not\nspend it all in that small area, and so God called him from the Seventeenth Ward and gave\nhim to the world, and he went about the world among all nations giving his love and the love\nof God to his fellow men.\n<\/p><p>\nFRIENDS IN SOUTH PACIFIC\n<\/p><p>\nI journeyed with him to New Zealand in 1938. I know how the people of the Pacific loved\nhim, and he loved them. When the message from Tonga was read by President McKay I was\nreminded that on my first visit to Tonga about three and a half years ago, I called at the\noffice of the Prime Minister, Mr. Ata. The first thing Mr. Ata asked me was, \"How is my\ngood friend, George Albert Smith?\" He said, \"I have never met a grander man in all my life\nthan that man.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I called on the crown prince, the Honorable Tungi, he brought from the drawer of his\ndesk an Improvement Era which he had just received from President Smith.\n<\/p><p>\nIn all the islands of the sea he is loved and revered, and on his last visit to Hawaii during the\ncentennial of that mission, in his last testimony to those people, he said, \"It is an honor to\nhave my name numbered among yours upon the membership records of the Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints.\"\n<\/p><p>\nGOOD IN EVERY ONE\n<\/p><p>\nAll those million miles which he traveled during his lifetime were used in distributing love\nwherever he went. Only a few weeks ago I went to the hospital to inquire about his health.\nOn hearing that I was out in the hall he sent for me to come in, and when I went in, I walked\nup to his bedside and he reached out and took me by the hand, and gripping my hand firmly\nhe said. \"Young man, remember all the days of your life that you can find good in everyone\nif you will but look for it.\" The last message, the last instruction to me&mdash;\"Remember always\nyou can find good in everyone if you will but look for it.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe loved everyone because he could see the good within them. He did not look upon sin with\nthe least degree of allowance (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12859\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12859)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12859)\">D&amp;C 1:31<\/a><\/span>),\nbut he loved the sinner because he knew that God was love\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1032\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1032)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1032)\">1 Jn. 4:8<\/a><\/span>),\nand that it is God's love that regenerates human souls and may, by that process, transform the\nsinner into a saint.\n<\/p><p>\nMaybe there are sinners who mistook his love for respect. He didn't respect the sinner, but he\nloved him. I am sure that love found response in the hearts and in the lives of those whom he\nloved.\n<\/p><p>\nAN APPROACHABLE MAN\n<\/p><p>\nI have never met in all my life a more approachable man. I never hesitated to go to him for\nconfession and for counsel, and I always received that for which I went, whether it was\nforgiveness of shortcomings, or counsel which I would need in the work to which I have been\ncalled and to which he ordained me and set me apart.\n<\/p><p>\nTruly he forgave all men. He was aware in all of his life of the commandment of God: God\nwill forgive whom he will forgive. As for us, we must forgive all men\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12898\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12898)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12898)\">D&amp;C 64:10<\/a><\/span>). He could do that, and\nthen refer the matter to God. As he forgave I am sure he forgot. When one who forgives can\nforget, then truly that man is an unusual man, indeed a man of God!\n<\/p><p>\nWhen he moved from the Seventeenth Ward, he just left the geographical area. He never left\nhis neighbors. I read a letter from a man who was in the army of occupation in Germany\nfollowing the first war. He was a Seventeenth Warder, and he said in that letter, \"While I was\non furlough in Italy, President George Albert Smith came to Coblentz to see me.\" He always\nknew where his neighbors were, and he was always concerned with their well-being.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen he left New Zealand for Australia in 1938&mdash;he spent a month in Australia&mdash;and when\nhe came back he said, \"I saw one of our good Seventeenth Ward neighbors way over in west\nAustralia. He came down from the mining camps to see me.\" This man was a mining\nengineer.\n<\/p><p>\nI said, \"How did he know that you were there so he could come down to see you?\" And he\nsaid, \"I sent him a telegram.\" That man had not lived in the ward for many years, but his\nneighbor knew where he was, and he sent for him to come down and see him.\n<\/p><p>\nPRESIDENT SMITH'S CREED\n<\/p><p>\nPresident George Albert Smith had a creed. To those of us who knew him, it is not necessary\nto read that creed because his life was the creed. All of us who knew him could have written\nhis creed. What an achievement! What an accomplishment! To be able to write the creed of\nyour fellow man by the life which he lived.\n<\/p><p>\nIf it is possible that there is someone within the sound of my voice who didn't know this\nwonderful neighbor, who has not heard nor read his creed, I will take the time now to read it.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I would be a friend to the friendless and find joy in ministering to the needs of the poor.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I would visit the sick and the afflicted and inspire in them a desire for faith to be healed.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I would teach the truth to the understanding and blessing of all mankind.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I would seek out the erring and try to win him back to a righteous and a happy life.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I would not seek to force people to live up to my ideals but rather love them into doing the\nthing that is right. I would live with the masses and help solve their problems that their earth\nlife may be happy.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I would avoid the publicity of high positions and discourage the flattery of thoughtless\nfriends.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I would not knowingly hurt the feelings of any, not even one who may have wronged me,\nbut would seek to do him good and make him my friend.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I would overcome the tendency to selfishness and jealousy and rejoice in the success of all\nthe children of my Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I would not be an enemy to any living soul.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Knowing that the Redeemer of mankind has offered to the world the only plan that will fully\ndevelop us and make us really happy here and hereafter I feel it not only a duty but a blessed\nprivilege to disseminate this truth.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt would be easy for us to memorize this creed, my brothers and sisters and friends, because it\ncan all be briefed into one word&mdash;love. That was his creed. And with what grandeur he has\nswept the threshold of heaven as he has passed with this, his creed! How his heart and soul\nand his virtue and strength went out to the distressed, to the unfortunate, even to the criminal.\nI am reminded that someone once touched the garment of the Master, and he felt virtue or\nstrength go out from him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34437\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34437)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34437)\">Matt. 9:20-22<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31291\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31291)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31291)\">Luke 8:43-48<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nEveryone in distress, everyone beset with illness or other adversity, whoever came within the\npresence of this son of God, drew virtue and strength from him. To be in his presence was to\nbe healed, if not physically, then indeed spiritually.\n<\/p><p>\nHIS HEART WAS PURE\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the span of his life he was nigh unto death on several occasions. Many men more\nrobust in health could not have survived the illnesses which beset him periodically during his\nlife. But his strength was as the strength of ten because his heart was pure, and so he\nsurvived.\n<\/p><p>\nMen like this never die. He is an eternal being. God attracts the godly, and I am sure that the\nshortest journey this man of God ever made in all of his travels has been the journey which\nhe has just taken. God is love (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1033\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1033)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1033)\">1 Jn. 4:8<\/a><\/span>).\nGeorge Albert Smith is love. He is godly. God has taken him unto himself.\n<\/p><p>\nI have loved his family. I have grown up with them. I have been at school with them. All I\ncan say now to them and to all of us is we can't honor a life like this with words. They are\nnot adequate. There is only one way to honor his virtue, his sweetness of character, his great\nqualities of love, and that is with our deeds. Let us walk in his footsteps, we who knew him.\nWe know what he wanted of us. We must never let him down.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us all be a little more forgiving, a little more tender in our associations with each other, a\nlittle more considerate of one another, a little more generous of each other's feelings. Let us\nso honor him that when we come to die we may be saved and exalted in the celestial presence\nof God our Father, and in that presence we will find his noble and prophetic son, George\nAlbert Smith.\n<\/p><p>\nGod grant that that boon and blessing may be ours I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
