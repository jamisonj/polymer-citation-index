Among those who now listen, or who may later read what we say, are young men and women, in many lands, struggling through those wonderful, worrisome teenage years.

The fair Lady Lyonors had been stolen away by the horrible black knight, who held her in his castle. Many young knights tried to rescue her but failed. They returned defeated and broken, with tales of the awesome power of the black knight; they begged Gareth not to go.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/to-young-women-and-men.p20\" class=\"\">But Gareth went to the castle with the drawbridge, the tower, and the window where \u201cLady Lyonors wrung her hands and wept.\u201d Then, \u201chigh on a night-black horse, in night-black arms, with white breast-bone, and barren ribs of Death,\u201d a laughing skull engraved upon his helmet, \u201cin the half-light\u2014thro\u2019 the dim dawn\u2014advanced the monster,\u201d more awesome, more terrible even than Gareth had been told. (\u201cGareth and Lynette,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Idylls of the King,<\/span> in <span class=\"emphasis\">The Complete Poetical Works of Alfred Lord Tennyson,<\/span> Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1898, p. 332.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/to-young-women-and-men.p21\" class=\"\">The black knight lowered his lance and thundered forward. Gareth, who had been defeated in more than one tournament, sensed his terrible fate. Every logic and emotion shouted, \u201cFlee for your life!\u201d But he could not turn away. Not, that is, and keep his honor. Gareth lowered his lance and met the charge.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/to-young-women-and-men.p22\" class=\"\">And then, to his surprise, Gareth unseated the black knight and tore his helmet away. There in that black armor with the bones engraven on it sat a little boy who began to cry and beg for mercy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/to-young-women-and-men.p23\" class=\"\">Young women, young men, no matter how many tournaments you lose along the way, no matter how monstrous your challenges may be, if you will learn a few simple lessons, it can be with you as it was with Gareth on that bridge before the castle of the black knight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Of Royal Birth<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/to-young-women-and-men.p25\" class=\"\">Gareth was only a prince. You are more than that. You are a child of God. He is the father of your spirit. Spiritually you are of noble birth, the offspring of the King of Heaven. Fix that truth in your mind and hold to it. However many generations in your mortal ancestry, no matter what race or people you represent, the pedigree of your spirit can be written on a single line. You are a child of God!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/to-young-women-and-men.p26\" class=\"\">You are a dual being, a spirit clothed in a mortal body.

Anything that is addictive is dangerous.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/to-young-women-and-men.p27\" class=\"\">Within your body is the power to beget life, to share in creation. The only legitimate expression of that power is within the covenant of marriage. The worthy use of it is the very key to your happiness. Do not use that power prematurely, not with anyone. The misuse of it cannot be made right by making it popular.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/to-young-women-and-men.p28\" class=\"\">Your spirit operates through your mind, but cultivating your intellect is not enough.

In a moment of curiosity or reckless bravado some teenagers have been tempted to toy with Satan worship. Don\u2019t you ever do that! Don\u2019t associate with those who do! You have no idea of the danger! Leave it alone! And there are other foolish games and activities that are on that dark side. Leave them alone!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/to-young-women-and-men.p31\" class=\"\">There is a courage far greater than Gareth needed to face the black knight. It is the courage to run away from unworthy things when you will be mocked for doing so. That courage is laced with wisdom. We had to gain it from experience; you need it now.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/to-young-women-and-men.p32\" class=\"\">You have an alarm system built into both body and spirit. In your body it is pain; in your spirit it is guilt\u2014or spiritual pain. While neither pain nor guilt is pleasant, and an excess of either can be destructive, both are a protection, for they sound the alarm \u201cDon\u2019t do that again!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/to-young-women-and-men.p33\" class=\"\">Be grateful for both.
