You\nare always so kind and considerate of our every need. Yet I do not know why I should feel\ntimid as I stand here this morning to attempt to say just a few words, and especially after this\nimpressive address by President McKay. It is a challenging position,\nand I do ask for an interest in your faith and prayers.\n<\/p><p>\nI can only suggest a few things in the short time allotted. You remember in reading the eighth\nchapter of John, that Jesus went into the temple and\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and  taught them.\" Then the scribes and the\nPharisees, the doubting scribes and Pharisees, brought to him a woman taken in sin. He\nrebuked them by telling them if they were without sin they could condemn, but they had no\nright to condemn unless they were without sin (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27726\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27726)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27726)\">John 8:2-7<\/a><\/span>).\nHe was reaffirming the truth\ntaught to his disciples as he sat with them on the mount, when he said:\n<\/p><p>\nJudge not, that ye be not judged.<br \/>\nFor with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye\nmete, it shall be measured to you again\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34822\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34822)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34822)\">Matt. 7:1-2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJesus was teaching them a fundamental truth. He was not condoning sin, but he was\nemphasizing this truth to those scribes and Pharisees who would trap him, who would\nquestion whether or not he accepted the law. They were not concerned about the sin; they\nwere more concerned about making good their own argument and establishing themselves in\ntheir position with him, because they did attempt to argue, if you will read the chapter, but he\nwas equal to their seeming cleverness.\n<\/p><p>\nThen we are told he continued to teach them that he was \"the light of the world: he that\nfolloweth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27727\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27727)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27727)\">John 8:12<\/a><\/span>). Then\nmany believed and to those who believed, he said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;<br \/>\nAnd ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27729\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27729)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27729)\">John 8:31-32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMy brethren and sisters, this brings so forcibly to us the importance of the message we have\nlistened to this morning. We have heard the truth. The truth will make us free if we will just\npermit it to.\n<\/p><p>\nYou remember that when the Savior stood before Pilate, Pilate wanted to set the Savior free.\nHe had sent him to Herod, but Herod, not willing to take the responsibility other than to\nscourge him, to mock him, had sent him back to Pilate. Pilate, impressed that there was\nsomething about the Nazarene that transcended human power, his own power of\nunderstanding, would have set him free. He questioned him, and among the questions was,\n\"What is truth?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27744\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27744)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27744)\">John 18:38<\/a><\/span>).\nThere is no record of the answer. I would that we had the\ncomplete record. Without any doubt the Savior did answer him. But in this day the Savior has\nsaid:\n<\/p><p>\nThe Spirit of truth is of God. I am the Spirit of truth, and John bore record of me,\nsaying: He received a fulness of truth, yea, even of all truth;<br \/>\nAnd no man receiveth a fulness unless he keepeth his commandments.<br \/>\nHe that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified\nin truth and knoweth all things\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13574\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13574)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13574)\">D&amp;C 93:26-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe have heard the truth this morning. We hear it from this pulpit conference after conference.\nWe read about it.\n<\/p><p>\nDo we apply it in our lives? If we do, then we sense that degree of freedom to which we\napply it, and there are so many ways, my brethren, and sisters, that we can apply it.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have it exemplified in the field of science. Human suffering is being alleviated by the\nunselfish efforts of men and women who are devoting their time unselfishly, trying to\ndiscover the causes of disease and find a remedy.\n<\/p><p>\nI marvel as I travel about in meeting some of our own brethren, great men, devoting their\ntime unselfishly in the fields of science whereby they may relieve human suffering, trying to\nfind truth, that mankind may be free.\n<\/p><p>\nYou know, in this Church we have stake presidents who devote their time generously to their\nlabors in their stakes, and yet day after day work in the laboratories, seeking to find the\nsource of some of the diseases that so far have baffled the medical world. I honor them. God\nbless them for the great work they are doing.\n<\/p><p>\nIn all of these fields, \"know the truth.\" I think of our young people&mdash;President\nMcKay has touched on this so forcibly&mdash;what it would mean to our\nyoung people if they could avoid some of these pitfalls, if they could know the truth and\nwould live the truth.\n<\/p><p>\nI was reading recently a talk by the eminent English scientist and surgeon, Dr. William Osler.\nHe has gone now&mdash;but a generation ago he was known all over the world for his great work.\nEngland claims him; she knighted him. He was born in Canada. He spent a good deal of time\nin this country. Some of our own local men of a generation ago knew him well. He spent\nfifteen years at Johns Hopkins. In a talk he gave before the students of Yale University in\n1913, his thesis was to \"live today your fullest, live the truth today.\" Never mind yesterday, it\nis past. You cannot do much about it. But you can live today and that will prepare you for\ntomorrow.\n<\/p><p>\nAmong other things he cautioned the men to whom he was talking, on the excessive use of\nliquor&mdash;he might have said to avoid it entirely&mdash;and the excessive use of tobacco, and he\npointed out the evils of these things to which Brother McKay has alluded.\n<\/p><p>\n\"If you will avoid these,\" he said, \"You will have a clear mind. Your vision will be clear and\nkeen. It will add to your happiness. It will make today a better day.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI would that we could emphasize that among our own people, our young people especially, to\nhelp them to live today and to get all that they can out of life. We have the truth, and in\nliving it, we may be free.\n<\/p><p>\nNow there is one more thing&mdash;I have mentioned it here from this pulpit before, and I come in\ncontact with it so often that I am going to repeat it. I think our young people, as they start out\nin life, should exercise caution. We have been taught from this pulpit time and time again to\navoid obligations that we cannot meet, and yet many of our people find themselves in\nbondage. They have not lived the truth, hence they are not free. They are in bondage. All\nyoung boys and girls who start out in life owe it to themselves and to their children, just as\nfast as they can, to see that their homes are their own. I know it is a struggle. I know from\nmy own experience, and I know what debt means.\n<\/p><p>\nBrigham Young warned us against debt. And we heard President Grant from this pulpit say\nwhat it had done for him, the struggle he had had, but he also said this, against the counsel of\nsome of his friends: \"I never wavered in my obligations to the Lord during it all, and because\nof that I was able to pay my obligations.\" And he promised the people that if they would be\ntrue to their tithes and their offerings, not excuse themselves on the ground of debt, they\nwould be able to be free. I accept that as a truth, and I can bear testimony to it, my brethren\nand sisters.\n<\/p><p>\nSo this \"knowing the truth\" is an everyday principle. It is a principle we can live every day in\nour lives. It has a practical application.\n<\/p><p>\nThen there is the spiritual side of it all. When Jesus was talking to his disciples, he was also\nreminding them that he and the Father were one\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27731\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27731)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27731)\">John 10:30<\/a><\/span>).\nIn this same chapter to which I referred, he\npointed out that he and the Father bore witness of this eternal truth that he was the Son of\nGod (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27728\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27728)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27728)\">John 8:18<\/a><\/span>),\nthe Redeemer of the world. They did not believe it, but it was an eternal truth just the\nsame.\n<\/p><p>\nThink what that means&mdash;to know that truth. We are nearing Easter, which will be celebrated\nwith all the pageantry and tradition typical of it. But underlying it all will be the fundamental\ntruths that Jesus was the Christ, the Redeemer of the world, the Savior; that there is a\ncontinuity of life; that life does not end with death. What blessed concepts! And they are true\nand God will bear witness to our souls these truths, if we will seek to know. He has given us\nthe way.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord help us that we may know the truth, that we may be free, I humbly pray in the\nname of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
