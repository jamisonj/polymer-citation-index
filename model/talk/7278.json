We saw two performances, because our daughter Carolyn was playing the part of one of the three witches in that play. Of course, we were delighted to see her in the play and even more delighted when, at a dramatic moment, she said those famous lines: \u201cBy the pricking of my thumbs, \/ Something wicked this way comes\u201d (act 4, scene 1, lines 40\u201341).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p5\" class=\"\">When I heard that, I thought how useful it would be to have an early-warning system which would tell us about the approach of evil and allow us to be prepared for it.

Babylon was, in the time of ancient Israel, a city which had become sensual, decadent, and corrupt. The principal building in the city was a temple to a false god, which we often refer to as Bel or Baal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p8\" class=\"\">However, that sensuality, corruption, and decadence, and the worshipping of false gods are to be seen in many cities, great and small, scattered across the globe.

What a concept to hold close to our hearts, as we see Babylon becoming more widespread. We see Babylon in our cities; we see Babylon in our communities; we see Babylon everywhere.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p12\" class=\"\">And with the encroachment of Babylon, we have to create Zion in the midst of it. We should not allow ourselves to be engulfed by the culture which surrounds us. We seldom realize the extent to which we are a product of the culture of our place and time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p13\" class=\"\">During the days of ancient Israel, the people of the Lord were an island of the one true God, surrounded by an ocean of idolatry. The waves of that ocean crashed incessantly upon the shores of Israel. Despite the commandment to make no graven image and bow down before it, Israel seemingly could not help itself, influenced by the culture of the place and time. Over and over again\u2014despite the prohibition of the Lord, despite what prophet and priest had said\u2014Israel went seeking after strange gods and bowed down before them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p14\" class=\"\">How could Israel have forgotten the Lord, who brought them out of Egypt?

It permeates our environment, and we think we are being reasonable and logical when, all too often, we have been molded by the ethos, what the Germans call the zeitgeist, or the culture of our place and time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p16\" class=\"\">Because my wife and I have had the opportunity to live in 10 different countries, we have seen the effect of the ethos on behavior. Customs which are perfectly acceptable in one culture are viewed as unacceptable in another; language which is polite in some places is viewed as abhorrent in others. People in every culture move within a cocoon of self-satisfied self-deception, fully convinced that the way they see things is the way things really are.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p17\" class=\"\">Our culture tends to determine what foods we like, how we dress, what constitutes polite behavior, what sports we should follow, what our taste in music should be, the importance of education, and our attitudes toward honesty. It also influences men as to the importance of recreation or religion, influences women about the priority of career or childbearing, and has a powerful effect on how we approach procreation and moral issues. All too often, we are like puppets on a string, as our culture determines what is \u201ccool.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p18\" class=\"\">There is, of course, a zeitgeist to which we should pay attention, and that is the ethos of the Lord, the culture of the people of God. As Peter states it, \u201cBut ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44885\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44885)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44885)\">1 Pet. 2:9<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p19\" class=\"\">It is the ethos of those who keep the Lord\u2019s commandments, walk in His ways, and \u201clive by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"45153\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45153)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45153)\">D&amp;C 84:44<\/a><\/span>).

It was wonderful to sit in the celestial room and be there in perfect silence, without a single sound to be heard coming from the busy New York streets outside. How was it possible that the temple could be so reverently silent when the hustle and bustle of the metropolis was just a few yards away?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p21\" class=\"\">The answer was in the construction of the temple. The temple was built within the walls of an existing building, and the inner walls of the temple were connected to the outer walls at only a very few junction points. That is how the temple (Zion) limited the effects of Babylon, or the world outside.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p22\" class=\"\">There may be a lesson here for us.

The king\u2019s servant instructed them that they were to eat of the king\u2019s meat and drink of the king\u2019s wine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p25\" class=\"\">Let us clearly understand the pressures that the four young men were under. They had been carried away as captives by a conquering power and were in the household of a king who held the power of life or death over them. And yet Daniel and his brothers refused to do that which they believed to be wrong, however much the Babylonian culture believed it to be right. And for that fidelity and courage, the Lord blessed them and \u201cgave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44816\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44816)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44816)\">Dan. 1:17<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p26\" class=\"\">Seduced by our culture, we often hardly recognize our idolatry, as our strings are pulled by that which is popular in the Babylonian world.

No photographer is there to record the heroism, no journalist will splash it across the newspaper\u2019s front page. Just in the quiet contemplation of our conscience, we will know that we faced the test of courage: Zion or Babylon?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p35\" class=\"\">Make no mistake about it: much of Babylon, if not most of it, is evil.
