Satan is attacking with unprecedented fury.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/protection-from-pornography-a-christ-focused-home.p7\" class=\"\">One reason we are here on earth is to learn to manage the passions and feelings of our mortal bodies. These God-given feelings help us want to marry and have children. The intimate marriage relationship between a man and a woman that brings children into mortality is also meant to be a beautiful, loving experience that binds together two devoted hearts, unites both spirit and body, and brings a fulness of joy and happiness as we learn to put each other first. President Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball taught that in marriage, \u201cthe spouse \u2026 becomes preeminent in the life of the husband or wife, and \u2026 [no] other interest [or] person [or] thing shall ever take precedence over the companion spouse. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/protection-from-pornography-a-christ-focused-home.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cMarriage presupposes total allegiance and total fidelity.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10905_000_15reeves\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer\u00a0W.

I stepped into her bedroom, where she opened up her heart and explained to me that she had been at a friend\u2019s home and had accidentally seen startling and disturbing images and actions on the television between a man and a woman without clothing. She began sobbing and expressed how horrible she felt about what she had seen and wished she could get it out of her mind. I was so grateful that she would confide in me, giving me a chance to soothe her innocent and aching heart and help her know how to get relief through our Savior\u2019s Atonement. I remember the sacred feelings I had as we knelt together, as mother and daughter, and petitioned the help of our Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/protection-from-pornography-a-christ-focused-home.p10\" class=\"\">Many children, youth, and adults are innocently exposed to pornography, but a growing number of both men and women are choosing to view it and are drawn back repeatedly until it becomes an addiction. These individuals may desire with all of their hearts to get out of this trap but often cannot overcome it on their own. How grateful we are when these loved ones choose to confide in us as parents or a Church leader. We would be wise not to react with shock, anger, or rejection, which may cause them to be silent again.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/protection-from-pornography-a-christ-focused-home.p11\" class=\"\">We as parents and leaders need to counsel with our children and youth on an ongoing basis, listening with love and understanding. They need to know the dangers of pornography and how it overtakes lives, causing loss of the Spirit, distorted feelings, deceit, damaged relationships, loss of self-control, and nearly total consumption of time, thought, and energy.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/protection-from-pornography-a-christ-focused-home.p12\" class=\"\">Pornography is more vile, evil, and graphic than ever before.

Some of you have heard me tell how overwhelmed my husband, Mel, and I felt as the parents of four young children. As we faced the challenges of parenting and keeping up with the demands of life, we were desperate for help. We prayed and pleaded to know what to do. The answer that came was clear: \u201cIt is OK if the house is a mess and the children are still in their pajamas and some responsibilities are left undone. The only things that really need to be accomplished in the home are daily scripture study and prayer and weekly family home evening.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/protection-from-pornography-a-christ-focused-home.p18\" class=\"\">We were trying to do these things, but they were not always the priority and, amidst the chaos, were sometimes neglected. We changed our focus and tried not to worry about the less-important things. Our focus became to talk, rejoice, preach, and testify of Christ by striving to daily pray and study the scriptures and have weekly family home evening.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/protection-from-pornography-a-christ-focused-home.p19\" class=\"\">A friend recently cautioned, \u201cWhen you ask the sisters to read the scriptures and pray more, it stresses them out.

These are the very practices that help take away stress, give direction to our lives, and add protection to our homes. Then, if pornography or other challenges do strike our families, we can petition the Lord for help and expect great guidance from the Spirit, knowing that we have done what our Father has asked us to do.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/protection-from-pornography-a-christ-focused-home.p21\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, if these have not been practices in our homes, we can all begin now. If our children are older and refuse to join us, we can start with ourselves.
