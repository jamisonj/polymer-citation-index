The dictionary defines light as something that makes vision possible or something that enlightens or informs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/light.p4\" class=\"\">Two types of light are physical light and spiritual light.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/light.p5\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Physical light,<\/span> especially natural light, affects the moods of people. When summer\u2019s light begins to fade, days grow shorter, and the winter season looms darkly ahead, natural light becomes a more precious commodity, especially to people who live in extreme northern climates. There, where darkness reigns for up to three months a year and then summer blooms into three months of constant daylight, moods swing with the seasons.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/light.p6\" class=\"\">Light does have a profound effect on human mood and behavior. Mounting evidence indicates that people who are feeling a little down and need a lift can get it by going outside in daylight. Walking in the light is a natural mood booster. Many who simply walk for half an hour or more during the daylight hours receive a distinct benefit. (See <span class=\"emphasis\">The Walking Magazine,<\/span> Jan.\/Feb. 1989, pp. 28\u201330.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/light.p7\" class=\"\">Scientists are not entirely certain which wavelengths cause light\u2019s mood-boosting effects. Researchers believe that these effects are traceable to light taken in <span class=\"emphasis\">through the eyes<\/span> and not through the skin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/light.p8\" class=\"\">A second medical use of light is light therapy for treating some cancers. Certain chemicals combined with light can destroy cancer cells. Research is under way to identify the best source of light and to determine how to direct it to body areas. (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Time,<\/span> Canadian ed., Nov. 1989.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/light.p9\" class=\"\">Shifting from these brief remarks about physical light, I should like to consider a kind of light that has infinitely greater power and effect. I speak of <span class=\"emphasis\">spiritual light.<\/span> It comes from God and his gospel. In the scriptures, we find reference to a relationship between the physical light of the sun and spiritual light.

The Stewart family had learned to face persecution and hardship. Their ancestors had been forced to flee from Scotland to Northern Ireland, where they had been promised protection. But instead of finding peace, they again became victims of persecution at the hands of the Irish Greens. Independence and strong conviction were part of their heritage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/light.p37\" class=\"\">The Stewart family characteristics of love and devotion and a deep religious faith made them receptive to the gospel. When the Mormon missionaries came to the Stewart house, Elizabeth, the third child, immediately felt the truthfulness of their message. She began to study and search for more assurance of the things she felt within. Her feelings and study stirred an immediate response in her old granny, who was the matriarch of the Stewart household. Elizabeth spent many hours telling her granny about the new prophet of God, Joseph Smith, who had brought back to earth the simple, direct message that Christ was alive and had appeared to man. Elizabeth felt a testimony burning within and asked permission to be baptized. Because of the unpopularity of the Mormons, her parents objected. Elizabeth\u2019s granny came to her rescue. \u201cLet the child alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI have read all her books, and I do believe the child is right.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/light.p38\" class=\"\">As Elizabeth left her home to go to her baptism, her granny was at her side. The two walked to the river, where the elders had broken a hole in the ice that wintry March day. When the elders came toward Elizabeth to baptize her, her granny stepped up and said, \u201cWatch your manners, child; never step in front of your elders.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/light.p39\" class=\"\">The elders baptized Granny in her street clothes; she even had on her little white cap. She had brought no extra clothes, so she walked home in her wet, frozen clothes. She did not take cold even though she did not change her clothes until the other family members had gone to bed. She said nothing about her baptism to the family but went about her usual tasks as if nothing had happened. After the others had gone to bed, she hung her clothing around the fireplace. In the morning when Archibald got up, he saw the clothes drying. He began to joke with the others about Granny having been dipped in the river along with Elizabeth. Granny listened to their fun and then said: \u201cArchibald, if you don\u2019t want people to hear, stop shouting so loudly.
