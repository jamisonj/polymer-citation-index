I know this because I have seen it manifested in the lives of thousands and have felt it in my own life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/what-i-want-my-son-to-know-before-he-leaves-on-his-mission.p44\" class=\"\">May the priesthood of God be prepared and worthy for any calls that may come, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-96905_000_019\"><a name=\"-96905_000_019\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-96905_000_019\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"20542\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20542)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20542)\">D&amp;C 50:26<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-96905_000_019\"><a name=\"-96905_000_019\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-96905_000_019\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"20543\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20543)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20543)\">D&amp;C 50:27\u201328<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-96905_000_019\"><a name=\"-96905_000_019\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-96905_000_019\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"20521\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20521)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20521)\">D&amp;C 35:13\u201314<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-96905_000_019\"><a name=\"-96905_000_019\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-96905_000_019\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Mission presidents\u2019 seminar, Aug. 1982; quoted in <span class=\"emphasis\">Missionary Guide<\/span> (1988), 32; emphasis added.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-96905_000_019\"><a name=\"-96905_000_019\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote5-96905_000_019\">5.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"emphasis\">Stories for Mormons,<\/span> sel.
