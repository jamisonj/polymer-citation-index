Oftentimes, heavy winds, storms, angry clouds, down drafts, etc., have caused bumpy and anxious moments, particularly when it was time to land. A seasoned pilot gave me comfort once after such an experience when he talked about a landing pattern\u2014the ordered flight path of an aircraft about to touch down. Precise instruments, experience, and trust guide the planes to safety en route and through proper landing and takeoff. \u201cWe can\u2019t control the weather or elements, but we can stay within the pattern for safety,\u201d he emphasized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/a-pattern-in-all-things.p4\" class=\"\">One day I was admiring a beautiful hand-finished quilt made by a skilled seamstress.

I have always received courage, comfort, and direction from this powerful quotation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/a-pattern-in-all-things.p7\" class=\"\">A pattern is a guide for copying, a design, a plan, a diagram or model to be followed in making things, a composite of traits or features characteristic of an individual. It is also the ordered flight path for an aircraft about to land.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/a-pattern-in-all-things.p8\" class=\"\">The gospel of Jesus Christ is God\u2019s pattern for righteous living and eternal life. It makes possible goal-setting and lofty priorities. Satan and his advocates will constantly try to deceive and entice us into following their patterns. If we are to achieve daily safety, exaltation, and eternal happiness, we need to live by the light and truth of our Savior\u2019s plan. All salvation revolves around our Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/a-pattern-in-all-things.p9\" class=\"\">In a recent conversation with a drug addict about priorities, life\u2019s patterns, hopes, goals, and purposes, I was grieved when this attractive young lady said, \u201cGod is loving. God is kind. Leave me alone, and never mind.\u201d The wayward and disobedient will never be happy while smothered with Satan\u2019s suggestion that practice makes permanence. God\u2019s gift and commitment to agency never will include a tolerance of sin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/a-pattern-in-all-things.p10\" class=\"\">God is truly loving and kind. Part of his pattern is to help us use our gift of free agency, but his pattern does not condone sin. When we abuse our agency to choose a life-style contrary to revealed patterns, we must live with the consequences. Our unwillingness to follow the true and tested patterns given for our happiness causes the individual, family, and friends heartaches and ultimate disaster. Our freedom to choose our course of conduct does not provide personal freedom from the consequences of our performances. God\u2019s love for us is constant and will not diminish, but he cannot rescue us from the painful results that are caused by wrong choices.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/a-pattern-in-all-things.p11\" class=\"\">It is no secret that Satan wages open war with the truth and all those who live righteous lives. He deceives with skill and effectiveness even his own followers. He would have us give up, quit, rebel when setbacks come. Sometimes in life when we are committed to and are following proper patterns, we experience heavy bumps and anxious hours. Many times true winners in life are those who have been hurt and disappointed but have risen above these challenges. Very often in life, God gives us difficulties to bring out the best in us. It is true, life does not determine winners. Winners determine life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/a-pattern-in-all-things.p12\" class=\"\">The great Olympic slogan says that the glory of the Olympic Games is not in the victory, but in taking part\u2014taking part like a man. Grantland Rice once wrote, \u201cWhen the One Great Scorer comes to write against your name, he marks\u2014not that you won or lost\u2014but how you played the game.\u201d (In <span class=\"emphasis\">The Home Book of Quotations,<\/span> 8th ed., sel.

Inside are immorality, self-destruction, and substandard culture temptations. His established pattern is to deceive at all costs. His call to \u201clive it up,\u201d \u201cenjoy the \u2018now,\u2019\u201d \u201cgo for it,\u201d \u201cdo your own thing,\u201d and yield to peer pressures are some of his available enticements for the susceptible in the days and hours to come. He cunningly uses damaging deceit in its most dastardly form. He would have us forget the essential thing in life is not conquering, but steadfast commitment to righteous patterns.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/a-pattern-in-all-things.p14\" class=\"\">Satan is the author of all programs that dress up evil and wrong to whet our appetites.

It will never lead to happiness. Evidence to the contrary, there are no successful sinners. All of us must one day stand before God and be judged according to our personal deeds done in the flesh. The burdens of the sinner will never be lighter than that of the saint. Be not deceived by the lures of Satan. God is at the helm and is grieved when we, his children, stray from proven paths of enduring happiness and righteousness. He would have us hold fast to the iron rod with total commitment and strength.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/a-pattern-in-all-things.p18\" class=\"\">One of Satan\u2019s most intriguing traps among many of God\u2019s children today seems to be a trend to postpone taking on mature personal responsibilities, such as avoiding marriage because of the possibility of divorce, and becoming involved in the drug culture because life is so uncertain. There are segments of our population that march, protest, and demand handouts and cures rather than follow God\u2019s given rules of prevention and self-discipline. Following revealed patterns helps us to recognize our weaknesses, deal positively with them, overcome them, and rise to Christlike heights.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/a-pattern-in-all-things.p19\" class=\"\">We must, if we will have happiness, follow the straight and prescribed paths. \u201cI will give you a pattern in all things\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19219\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19219)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19219)\">D&amp;C 52:14<\/a><\/span>] is one of the Lord\u2019s greatest gifts and promises. Today it comes from him and his prophets. Keeping one\u2019s mind occupied with constructive, useful things on a constant basis prevents Satan from having success in idle minds. Good music, art, literature, recreation, and other worthy pastimes can help establish proper patterns in one\u2019s mind and conduct. Happiness is a by-product of righteous living and sharing within the framework of lofty patterns.

He went to his coach and told him, \u201cCoach, I\u2019m through. I\u2019m going to devote all my time to studying.\u201d His coach said, \u201cRoger, I think you are the man who can break the four-minute mile.

He went home knowing not what to say or to do. But before the night was over, he had convinced himself that he would develop an iron will before he quit running. He was going to break the four-minute mile.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/a-pattern-in-all-things.p27\" class=\"\">He knew what this meant. He would have to set a pattern and live by it.

His parents and a few hundred others were present. The rest is history. Running strictly according to his charts and pattern, he ran the miracle mile in 3:59.4. He became the first man in recorded history to speed across this distance in less than four minutes. He had proven that man could run faster than was thought possible. He paid the price and reaped the rewards of following the proper pattern. Today in England he is a doctor in his own right. At the time of his victory over the one-mile barrier, he became an international hero in all the record books. The four-minute-mile barrier is broken constantly these days, but Roger Bannister set the pattern many years ago and followed it with total commitment, self-discipline, and a will of iron.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/a-pattern-in-all-things.p31\" class=\"\">Patterns are given by the Lord that we may follow, reason, and endure in righteousness.
