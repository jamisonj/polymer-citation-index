They selected as their theme that night, \u201cOpen Up Your Hearts.\u201d When it came my turn to speak, I said, \u201cI am a little sensitive on that subject,\u201d but I want President Kimball and his counselors and all my brethren to know that I have listened in this conference with an open heart. I have been sensitive to their counsel and will recommit myself to the great work ahead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p4\" class=\"\">The weather is glorious here by the Wasatch Range and throughout many parts of the world. Even the thin birds have reappeared. The fat birds are those that remained here during the cold seasons, overate, and became rotund. The thin birds flew hundreds of miles to stay warm, kept in shape, and have returned with wan looks on their feathered faces. Whether they are birds of passage or frost-bound nonachievers, they remind us of this truth spoken of by the Master: \u201cBehold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36372\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36372)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36372)\">Matt. 6:26<\/a><\/span>.)

A beardless youth became so enamored of a young miss (although she did not encourage him) that each day for 47 consecutive days he wrote her a special-delivery letter, until finally, on the 48th day, she eloped with the mailman. The lad is probably blessed, since all he had to offer the lady was a mission yet unserved, a college education one quarter complete, and no funds (he had spent all of his money on stamps).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p7\" class=\"\">Spring is a time for the rebirth of living things from their wintry cover.

Our prophet, President Kimball, has counseled you, young people, particularly young men, as to that proper sequence. Would you note the sequence of events that will bring orderliness and happiness to your life. I quote from our prophet:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cOne can have all the blessings if he is in control and takes the experiences in proper turn: first some limited social get-acquainted contacts, then his mission, then his courting, then his temple marriage and [now note] his schooling and his family, then his life\u2019s work. In any other sequence he could run into difficulty.\u201d (Spencer W. Kimball, \u201cThe Marriage Decision,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Feb. 1975, p. 4.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p12\" class=\"\">Now for a few moments, may we talk about this sequence in its \u201cproper turn\u201d?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p13\" class=\"\">For many young men, now is the time for preparation\u2014preparation for a planned mission. It\u2019s a time for you to apply yourselves in school, to concentrate on the foundation of a good education so that when you are called as an ambassador for Jesus Christ, you will represent him with the dignity befitting one who holds his priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p14\" class=\"\">It\u2019s a time when I would challenge you to read the scriptures, a time to learn to know your Heavenly Father in prayer. It\u2019s also a time to be cautious in your associations with the opposite sex; for again, as President Kimball has cautioned:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen you get in the teen-age years, your social associations should still be general acquaintance with both boys and girls. Any dating or pairing off in social contacts should be postponed until at least the age of 16 or older, and even then there should be much judgment used. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cYoung people should still limit the close contacts for several years, since the boy will be going on his mission when he is 19 years old.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Feb. 1975, p. 4.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p17\" class=\"\">To the young men of the priesthood, if you haven\u2019t served a mission, this is <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> the time for a lot of involvement in love or romance. It is a time for saving money. Do you know how much a mission costs today? It averages about $150 a month. For a two-year mission, that is $3,600.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p18\" class=\"\">One young man was startled when his father sat down with him to figure how he could earn that money. Noting that the most productive earning time would be from ages 16\u201319, they figured that he would have to save at least $1,000 each year for that three-year period. This also meant that the young man had to earn another $600 before age 16 (he was then 12) to save sufficiently for his mission. Hopefully, many start earlier than that.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p19\" class=\"\">You\u2019ve heard some of our young men say, \u201cBut I can\u2019t find a job. No one will hire me.\u201d May I suggest to you the example of one enterprising 13-year-old who has already produced some handbills that he is passing out in his neighborhood. The handbill reads: \u201cWhen you\u2019re on vacation and need someone to care for your yard, or if you want any odd jobs done, call Bill, because when you call me, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d He then signed his name and included his phone number. He already has his summer filled with work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p20\" class=\"\">Preparation for a mission, however, is not just a matter of economics. It\u2019s a time above all else to keep yourself clean in mind and clean in habits. What counsel could be more plain than of our prophet\u2019s words: \u201cThere must never be any sex of any kind prior to marriage.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Feb. 1975, p. 4.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p21\" class=\"\">For others of you, after an honorably served mission, it is a time to prepare for marriage. To those of you to whom this applies, our president has said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cNow is the time for you to plan good strong marriages and organize your programs and set your standards and solidify your determination to prepare for that married period of your lives which will be beautiful and rewarding.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Feb. 1975, p. 4.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p23\" class=\"\">This does not suggest that you rush into marriage impulsively, without proper preparation, forethought, and inspiration.

Once you can see the vision of what the Lord has in store for you, I\u2019m confident you will want to make any sacrifice necessary to achieve those blessings. To you men in your late twenties and early thirties and not yet married, read again those possibilities as he has described them to us in the Doctrine and Covenants, sections 131 and 132.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p25\" class=\"\">In proper sequence, in proper order: first, preparation for a mission; next, an honorably served mission; then a temple marriage; and next, a time to have a family, to complete one\u2019s schooling, and plan for your life\u2019s work. Some ask the question \u201cShouldn\u2019t we get our education first and then have our family?\u201d \u201cI know of no scriptures or authorities,\u201d admonishes President Kimball, \u201cwhich authorize young wives to delay their families. \u2026 Young married couples can make their way and reach their educational heights, if they are determined.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Feb. 1975, p. 4.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-for-every-purpose.p26\" class=\"\">My, what sound counsel! Any of us who have gone through the educational process can only endorse the counsel of our prophet.
