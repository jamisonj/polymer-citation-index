Before I escorted these prominent guests through the temple, I explained to them the position and basic doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I wanted them to know why the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith, so they could understand the divine purpose and the eternal significance of the temple. My message this morning is to remind Church members what we have and to invite nonmembers to understand the need for the restoration of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p4\" class=\"\">The mortal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ was comparatively brief. He lived only thirty-three years, and His ministry was only three years. But in those three years He taught the human family everything that is necessary to receive all of the blessings our Father in Heaven has in store for His children. He concluded His mortal ministry with the single most compassionate and significant service in the history of the world: the Atonement.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p5\" class=\"\">One of the most important accomplishments of the Savior was the establishment of His church upon the earth. Paul taught that Christ \u201cgave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cFor the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22050\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22050)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22050)\">Eph. 4:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p7\" class=\"\">When Jesus called His twelve Apostles, He laid His hands upon them, ordained them, and conferred upon them the authority to act in His name and govern His church. Peter is commonly understood to have become the chief Apostle, or the President of the Church, after the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. Early Christians endured the challenges of persecution and hardship. Peter and his brethren had a difficult time holding the Church together and keeping the doctrine pure. They traveled extensively and wrote to one another about the problems they were facing, but information moved so slowly and the Church and its teachings were so new that heading off false teachings before they became firmly entrenched was difficult.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p8\" class=\"\">The New Testament indicates that the early Apostles worked hard to preserve the church that Jesus Christ left to their care and keeping, but they knew their efforts would ultimately be in vain. Paul wrote to the Thessalonian Saints, who were anxiously anticipating the second coming of Christ, that \u201cthat day shall not come, except there come a falling away first\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5063\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5063)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5063)\">2 Thes. 2:3<\/a><\/span>). He also warned Timothy that \u201cthe time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; \u2026 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5288\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5288)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5288)\">2 Tim. 4:3\u20134<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p9\" class=\"\">And Peter presupposed the falling away, or the Apostasy, when he spoke of \u201cthe times of refreshing\u201d that would come before God would again send Jesus Christ, who \u201cbefore was preached unto you:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cWhom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8419\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8419)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8419)\">Acts 3:19\u201321<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p11\" class=\"\">Eventually, with the known exception of John the Beloved, Peter and his fellow Apostles were martyred. The Apostle John and members of the Church struggled for survival in the face of horrifying oppression. To their everlasting credit, Christianity did survive and was truly a prominent force by the end of the second century <span class=\"small\">A.D.<\/span> Many valiant Saints were instrumental in helping Christianity to endure.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p12\" class=\"\">Despite the significance of the ministries of these Saints, they did not hold the same apostolic authority Peter and the other Apostles had received through ordination under the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. When that authority was lost, men began looking to other sources for doctrinal understanding. As a result, many plain and precious truths were lost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p13\" class=\"\">History tells us, for example, of a great council held in <span class=\"small\">A.D.<\/span> 325 in Nicaea. By this time Christianity had emerged from the dank dungeons of Rome to become the state religion of the Roman Empire, but the church still had problems\u2014chiefly the inability of Christians to agree among themselves on basic points of doctrine. To resolve differences, Emperor Constantine called together a group of Christian bishops to establish once and for all the official doctrines of the church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p14\" class=\"\">Consensus did not come easily. Opinions on such basic subjects as the nature of God were diverse and deeply felt, and debate was spirited. Decisions were not made by inspiration or revelation, but by majority vote, and some disagreeing factions split off and formed new churches. Similar doctrinal councils were held later in <span class=\"small\">A.D.<\/span> 451, 787, and 1545, with similarly divisive results.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p15\" class=\"\">The beautiful simplicity of Christ\u2019s gospel was under attack from an enemy that was even more destructive than the scourges and the crosses of early Rome: the philosophical meanderings of uninspired men. The doctrine became based more on popular opinion than on revelation. This period of time was called the Dark Ages. They were dark largely because the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ had been lost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p16\" class=\"\">Then in 1517, the Spirit moved Martin Luther, a German priest who was disturbed at how far the church had strayed from the gospel as taught by Christ. His work led to a reformation, a movement that was taken up by such other visionaries as John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, John Wesley, and John Smith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p17\" class=\"\">I believe these reformers were inspired to create a religious climate in which God could restore lost truths and priesthood authority. Similarly, God inspired the earlier explorers and colonizers of America and the framers of the Constitution of the United States to develop a land and governing principles to which the gospel could be restored.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p18\" class=\"\">By 1820 the world was ready for the \u201crestitution of all things\u201d spoken of by Peter and \u201call [God\u2019s] holy prophets since the world began\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8420\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8420)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8420)\">Acts 3:21<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p19\" class=\"\">At this time religious excitement was sweeping across the countryside in upstate New York. Ministers from different denominations vied zealously for the loyalty of the faithful in villages and towns, including Palmyra, the home of the family of Joseph Smith, Sr., and Lucy Mack Smith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p20\" class=\"\">The Smith family followed this religious excitement, and members of the family were \u201cproselyted\u201d to various faiths.

While reading in the Bible, he came upon a simple, direct admonition in the epistle of James: \u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26395\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26395)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26395)\">James 1:5<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p24\" class=\"\">Joseph reflected: \u201cNever did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart.

He paused when he arrived at a quiet, secluded spot. He looked around to make sure he was alone. Then he knelt and began to pray. No sooner had he done so than an overwhelming feeling of darkness swept over him, as if some evil power was trying to dissuade him. Rather than surrender, Joseph intensified his pleas to God\u2014and God Himself responded.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p27\" class=\"\">Reading from Joseph\u2019s account:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cI saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/restored-truth.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air.
