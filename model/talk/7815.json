I always look forward to this annual general Relief Society meeting and the excellent messages given here. Thank you, sisters. It is a precious honor for me to be assigned by President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson to speak today and to add a few thoughts addressing the sisters of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p6\" class=\"\">A while ago I was walking through a beautiful garden with my wife and daughter. I marveled at the glory and beauty of God\u2019s creation. And then I noticed, among all the glorious blooms, the tiniest flower. I knew the name of this flower because since I was a child I have had a tender connection to it. The flower is called forget-me-not.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p7\" class=\"\">I\u2019m not exactly sure why this tiny flower has meant so much to me over the years. It does not attract immediate attention; it is easy to overlook among larger and more vibrant flowers; yet it is just as beautiful, with its rich color that mirrors that of the bluest skies\u2014perhaps this is one reason why I like it so much.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p8\" class=\"\">And there is the haunting plea of its name. There is a German legend that just as God had finished naming all the plants, one was left unnamed. A tiny voice spoke out, \u201cForget me not, O Lord!\u201d And God replied that this would be its name.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p9\" class=\"\">Tonight I would like to use this little flower as a metaphor. The five petals of the little forget-me-not flower prompt me to consider five things we would be wise never to forget.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>First, forget not to be patient with yourself.<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p11\" class=\"\">I want to tell you something that I hope you will take in the right way: God is fully aware that you and I are not perfect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p12\" class=\"\">Let me add: God is also fully aware that the people you think are perfect are not.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p13\" class=\"\">And yet we spend so much time and energy comparing ourselves to others\u2014usually comparing our weaknesses to their strengths. This drives us to create expectations for ourselves that are impossible to meet. As a result, we never celebrate our good efforts because they seem to be less than what someone else does.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p14\" class=\"\">Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p15\" class=\"\">It\u2019s wonderful that you have strengths.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p16\" class=\"\">And it is part of your mortal experience that you do have weaknesses.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p17\" class=\"\">God wants to help us to eventually turn all of our weaknesses into strengths,<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-09611_000_047\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122280\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122280)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122280)\">Ether 12:27<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> but He knows that this is a long-term goal.

Keep working on it, but stop punishing yourself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p18\" class=\"\">Dear sisters, many of you are endlessly compassionate and patient with the weaknesses of others. Please remember also to be compassionate and patient with yourself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p19\" class=\"\">In the meantime, be thankful for all the small successes in your home, your family relationships, your education and livelihood, your Church participation and personal improvement. Like the forget-me-nots, these successes may seem tiny to you and they may go unnoticed by others, but God notices them and they are not small to Him. If you consider success to be only the most perfect rose or dazzling orchid, you may miss some of life\u2019s sweetest experiences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p20\" class=\"\">For example, insisting that you have a picture-perfect family home evening each week\u2014even though doing so makes you and everyone around you miserable\u2014may not be the best choice. Instead, ask yourself, \u201cWhat could we do as a family that would be enjoyable and spiritual and bring us closer together?\u201d That family home evening\u2014though it may be modest in scope and execution\u2014may have far more positive long-term results.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p21\" class=\"\">Our journey toward perfection is long, but we can find wonder and delight in even the tiniest steps in that journey.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Second, forget not the difference between a good sacrifice and a foolish sacrifice.<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p23\" class=\"\">An acceptable sacrifice is when we give up something good for something of far greater worth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p24\" class=\"\">Giving up a little sleep to help a child who is having a nightmare is a good sacrifice. We all know this. Staying up all night, jeopardizing our own health, to make the perfect accessory for a daughter\u2019s Sunday outfit may not be such a good sacrifice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p25\" class=\"\">Dedicating some of our time to studying the scriptures or preparing to teach a lesson is a good sacrifice. Spending many hours stitching the title of the lesson into homemade pot holders for each member of your class perhaps may not be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p26\" class=\"\">Every person and situation is different, and a good sacrifice in one instance might be a foolish sacrifice in another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p27\" class=\"\">How can we tell the difference for our own situation? We can ask ourselves, \u201cAm I committing my time and energies to the things that matter most?\u201d There are so many good things to do, but we can\u2019t do all of them. Our Heavenly Father is most pleased when we sacrifice something good for something far greater with an eternal perspective. Sometimes, that may even mean nurturing small but beautiful forget-me-not flowers instead of a large garden of exotic blooms.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Third, forget not to be happy now.<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p29\" class=\"\">In the beloved children\u2019s story <span class=\"emphasis\">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,<\/span> the mysterious candy maker Willy Wonka hides a golden ticket in five of his candy bars and announces that whoever finds one of the tickets wins a tour of his factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p30\" class=\"\">Written on each golden ticket is this message: \u201cGreetings to you, the lucky finder of this Golden Ticket\u00a0\u2026\u00a0!

The food would never burn.

She even took her frustration out on the children at school. She found herself losing her temper, and she swung between fits of anger and desperate loneliness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p38\" class=\"\">The tragedy of this story is that this dear woman, in all her disappointment about her golden ticket, failed to notice the blessings she <span class=\"emphasis\">did<\/span> have. She did not have children in her home, but she was surrounded by them in her classroom. She was not blessed with a family, but the Lord had given her an opportunity few people have\u2014the chance to influence for good the lives of hundreds of children and families as a teacher.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p39\" class=\"\">The lesson here is that if we spend our days waiting for fabulous roses, we could miss the beauty and wonder of the tiny forget-me-nots that are all around us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/forget-me-not.p40\" class=\"\">This is not to say that we should abandon hope or temper our goals.
