Monson told of the great faith and trust in the Lord of Randall Ellsworth, a missionary who, in Brother Monson\u2019s words, \u201cwas crushed under that devastating earthquake in Guatemala, pinned for, I think, twelve hours. Found himself totally paralyzed from the waist down. Kidney functions, not present. No hope to ever walk again. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/trust-in-the-lord.p70\" class=\"\">\u201cHe was flown to \u2026 Maryland and \u2026 interviewed in the hospital by a television reporter. The television reporter said to him, \u2018The doctors say you will not walk again. What do you think, Elder Ellsworth?\u2019 He said, \u2018I\u2019ll not only walk again, but I have a call from a prophet to serve a mission in Guatemala, and I shall go back to Guatemala and finish that mission. \u2019 \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/trust-in-the-lord.p71\" class=\"\">\u201cHe exercised twice the [requirement] outlined by the doctors. He exerted his faith. He received a blessing from the priesthood and his recovery was miraculous. It astounded the physicians and the specialists. He began to be able to stand on his feet. Then he could walk with crutches, and then the doctors said to him, \u2018You may return to the mission field if the Church will permit you to go.\u2019 He went. We sent him to Guatemala. He returned to the land to which he had been called, to the people whom he dearly loved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/trust-in-the-lord.p72\" class=\"\">\u201cWhile there he was walking, proselyting a full schedule with a cane in each hand. [His mission president] looked at him and said, \u2018Elder Ellsworth, with the faith that you have, why don\u2019t you throw those canes away and walk?\u2019 And Elder Ellsworth said, \u2018If you have that kind of faith in me [take the canes].\u2019\u201d He put down the canes and has never used them since.

May we learn that when we\u2019re young, and practice it through our lives so that we can testify as these experiences testify, in the name of Jesus Christ.
