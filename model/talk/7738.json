We love you, we admire you, and we sustain you. Indeed, in this afternoon\u2019s session we will have a more formal opportunity to raise our hands in a sustaining vote, not only for President Monson but also for all the other general officers of the Church as well. Because my name will be included on that list, may I be so bold as to speak for all in thanking you in advance for those uplifted hands. Not one of us could serve without your prayers and without your support. Your loyalty and your love mean more to us than we can ever possibly say.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/because-of-your-faith.p6\" class=\"\">In that spirit my message today is to say that <span class=\"emphasis\">we<\/span> sustain <span class=\"emphasis\">you,<\/span> that we return to <span class=\"emphasis\">you<\/span> those same heartfelt prayers and that same expression of love. We all know there are special keys, covenants, and responsibilities given to the presiding officers of the Church, but we also know that the Church draws incomparable strength, a truly unique vitality, from the faith and devotion of <span class=\"emphasis\">every<\/span> member of this church, whoever you may be. In whatever country you live, however young or inadequate you feel, or however aged or limited you see yourself as being, I testify you are individually loved of God, you are central to the meaning of His work, and you are cherished and prayed for by the presiding officers of His Church. The personal value, the sacred splendor of every <span class=\"emphasis\">one<\/span> of you, is the very reason there is a plan for salvation and exaltation. Contrary to the parlance of the day, this <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> about <span class=\"emphasis\">you.<\/span> No, don\u2019t turn and look at your neighbor.

I am grateful for <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> the women of the Church who in my life have been as strong as Mount Sinai and as compassionate as the Mount of Beatitudes. We smile sometimes about our sisters\u2019 stories\u2014you know, green Jell-O, quilts, and funeral potatoes. But my family has been the grateful recipient of each of those items at one time or another\u2014and in one case, the quilt and the funeral potatoes on the same day. It was just a small quilt\u2014tiny, really\u2014to make my deceased baby brother\u2019s journey back to his heavenly home as warm and comfortable as our Relief Society sisters wanted him to be. The food provided for our family after the service, voluntarily given without a single word from us, was gratefully received. Smile, if you will, about our traditions, but somehow the too-often unheralded women in this church are <span class=\"emphasis\">always<\/span> there when hands hang down and knees are feeble.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-09211_000_005\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120588\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120588)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120588)\">Hebrews 12:12<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120589\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120589)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120589)\">Doctrine and Covenants 81:5<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> They seem to grasp instinctively the divinity in Christ\u2019s declaration: \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, ye have done it unto me.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-09211_000_005\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120590\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120590)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120590)\">Matthew 25:40<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/because-of-your-faith.p9\" class=\"\">And no less the brethren of the priesthood.

I am grateful for memories of my own high priests group, which a few years ago took turns for weeks sleeping on a small recliner in the bedroom of a dying quorum member so that his aged and equally fragile wife could get some sleep through those final weeks of her sweetheart\u2019s life. I am grateful for the Church\u2019s army of teachers, officers, advisers, and clerks, to say nothing of people who are forever setting up tables and taking down chairs. I am grateful for ordained patriarchs, musicians, family historians, and osteoporotic couples who trundle off to the temple at 5:00 in the morning with little suitcases now almost bigger than they are. I am grateful for selfless parents who\u2014perhaps for a lifetime\u2014care for a challenged child, sometimes with more than one challenge and sometimes with more than one child.

President James\u00a0E. Faust stood at this pulpit 13 years ago and said, \u201cAs a small boy\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, I remember my grandmother \u2026 cooking our delicious meals on a hot woodstove. When the wood box next to the stove became empty, Grandmother would silently \u2026 go out to refill it from the pile of cedar wood outside, and bring the heavily laden box back into the house. I was so insensitive \u2026 [that] I sat there and let my beloved grandmother refill [that] box.\u201d Then, his voice choking with emotion, he said, \u201cI feel ashamed of myself and have regretted my omission for all of my life.

Each had to bear the full expense of the mission to which he or she was sent. Some missions were very expensive, and as it turned out, mine was one of those.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/because-of-your-faith.p14\" class=\"\">As we encourage missionaries to do, I had saved money and sold personal belongings to pay my own way as best I could. I <span class=\"emphasis\">thought<\/span> I had enough money, but I wasn\u2019t sure how it would be in the final months of my mission. With that question on my mind, I nevertheless blissfully left my family for the greatest experience anyone could hope to have.

What would I do now? How in the world could I pay for a college education? How could I possibly pay for board and room? And how could I realize the great dream of my heart, to marry the breathtakingly perfect Patricia Terry?

Furthermore, what I did not know but then came to know was that my mother, who had never worked out of the home in her married life, took a job at a local department store so that my mission expenses could be met. And not one word of that was ever conveyed to me on my mission. Not a single word was said regarding any of it. How many fathers in this Church have done exactly what my father did?
