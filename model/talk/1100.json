I had prepared a talk, but I think I shall discuss something\nelse. Brother Dyer has been speaking of the work in Europe, and I rejoice at the marvelous\nthings that are being accomplished there. I wish to say that I feel that the same spirit, the\npower of the Lord upon the people of the earth, is being made manifest all over the world\nwhere the gospel is being taught.\n<\/p><p>\nI have recently had the experience, under the direction of the First Presidency, of going\nthrough the missions of the Orient. I cannot deny the miracles of God, and I think many of\nthe things I have seen are truly miracles.\n<\/p><p>\nNot long ago, I sat in an old high school gymnasium in the city of Seoul, Korea. Just a short\ntime earlier the blood of the young people of Korea had been running in the streets of that\nstrife-ridden city. In our meeting that evening there were over 500 young Koreans. I was told\nthat we have only two married couples who are members of the Church in all of the Seoul\nDistrict. Our members there are young, forward-looking people. Conducting that gathering\nwas a sandy-haired, Utah farm boy. He conducted with dignity and spoke with ease the\nlanguage of those people, and after the meeting, as they came up and put their arms around\nhim, and he put his arms around them, I marveled at the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ\nto change men's hearts.\n<\/p><p>\nWe then went down to the sad city of Pusan on the southern tip of Korea. We held a street\nmeeting in the park overlooking the harbor. Within a few feet of a great anti-aircraft gun\nemplacement we opened our meeting, and about\n<\/p><p>\n150 curious, intelligent-looking people gathered. A boy from Florida, a missionary of this\nChurch, began to speak. I then wandered down into the crowd with an army sergeant&mdash;one of\nour boys who was taking us around. A Korean who spoke some English said in substance to\nthe sergeant, \"How long that young man been here? Two years,\" was the reply. \"No&mdash;he here\nlonger. Americans here fifteen years and not speak our language. Americans not speak Korean\nlike that.\" I thought of the words of the Savior as recorded by Mark: \"... they shall speak with\nnew tongues\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33137\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33137)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33137)\">Mark 16:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI remember sitting in this tabernacle while I was a university student and hearing one of the\nbrethren say that peace can come to the world only through acknowledgment of the Lord\nJesus Christ. I was at a critical age, and I doubted the possibility of that ever occurring. I\nthink recently I have glimpsed the vision of how it might happen.\n<\/p><p>\nNot long ago we were in Hiroshima, Japan. We stood in the park and green grows the grass\nat the site where on the sixth of August 1945, just fifteen years ago, 80,000 lives were taken\nwith the blinding flash of the first atomic bomb. Another 80,000 have since died from the\neffects of it. It is a sobering experience to stand in that place.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a simple monument about the size of this pulpit, and it has inscribed on its face in\nJapanese characters, words which say in translation: \"Rest in peace. May this tragedy never\nagain come to the world.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThere were three of us, the mission president, a man from Hiroshima, and myself. The man\nfrom Hiroshima was a Japanese businessman, an elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints, a man who had served in the Japanese Imperial Army for nine years. I was\nan elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from the land which had dropped\nthe bomb. With emotion and sincerity he said, through an interpreter, \"Thank God for the\nmissionaries. Last night my wife and I were on our knees, as we are\neach night, to express gratitude for the coming of these two young men who have literally\nsaved our lives. We had nothing to live for, no hope here or hereafter, and we were drinking\nourselves to death. They came. They taught us. They brought purpose into our lives. The\nchange in me has been so noticeable that my partner became curious. I have been teaching\nhim the gospel, and I am now going to baptize him.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThat is the way peace will come to the world. This thing shall spread from soul to soul, and\nmen in all lands shall come to acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Son of God, the Savior of\nmankind, our Elder Brother, the Prince of Peace.\n<\/p><p>\nWe sat in a testimony meeting one day a few months ago. A boy stood up with a letter in his\nhand. He said, \"I think I am happier than I have ever been in my life. I have had many\nwonderful experiences here, and they have made me happy, but it is this letter that has really\nwarmed my heart. My father, once active, began drinking, and oh, the sorrow my mother has\nsuffered because of this. After my farewell my father said, 'My son, I am going to try to live\nworthy of you.' Now,\" the missionary said, \"I have a letter from my father, received\nyesterday, which says that last week he was ordained a high priest and set apart as counselor\nin the bishopric of our ward, and he has just made a down payment on a home for the first\ntime in his life.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThese are some of the miracles I have seen in my associations with our missionaries. I am\ngrateful, I am more grateful than I can say for this great program of the Church that I have\nbeen blessed to be associated with. I know it is one of the marks of the divinity of this work.\nNo other organization in this world has anything quite like it.\n<\/p><p>\nIt touches for good the lives of all who are affected by it.\n<\/p><p>\nThe work is going forward on the other side of the earth. I recall sitting here as a boy and\nhearing President Grant tell of his difficulties in Japan and of his praying to the Lord to give\nhim another assignment because of his discouragement. Do you know that the missionaries of\nthe Northern Far East Mission have baptized an average of about six converts per missionary\nso far this year? Many of these were not Christian people. Our missionaries in this part of the\nworld have taken to people who are of the Oriental religions the testimony of Jesus and have\nconverted them to this cause. God bless them for their devotion and their faithfulness. The\nLord bless us at home to sustain his work throughout the world by the virtues of our lives, I\npray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
