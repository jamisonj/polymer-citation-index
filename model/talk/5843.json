I asked whether their responsibilities to aged parents would preclude their service at that time. This sister was the only daughter of a wonderful mother, then about 80, whom she visited and helped each week. Though somewhat dependent physically, this mother was strong spiritually. She had served four missions and 15 years as a temple worker. Because she was in tune with the Spirit, she had a remarkable experience. Several months before this interview she told her daughter that the Spirit had whispered that her daughter\u2019s husband would be called as a mission president. So advised, the mother had prepared herself for the needed separation and assured her daughter, long in advance of my assignment for the exploratory interview, that she would \u201cnot be a hindrance\u201d to their service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/always-have-his-spirit.p25\" class=\"\">The need to keep our personal temple clean in order to have the companionship and guidance of the Holy Ghost explains the importance of the commandment to partake of the sacrament on the Sabbath.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/always-have-his-spirit.p26\" class=\"\">In partaking of the sacrament, we can renew the effects of our baptism.
