How many here know the origin of this day? Before tithing was paid, the poor were supported by donations. They came to Joseph and wanted help, in Kirtland, and he said there should be a fast day, which was decided upon. It was to be held once a month, as it is now, and all that would have been eaten that day, of flour, or meat, or fruit, or anything else, was to be carried to the fast meeting and put into the hands of a person selected for the purpose of taking care of it and distributing it among the poor. If we were to do this now faithfully, do you think the poor would lack for flour, or butter, or cheese, or meat, or sugar, or anything they needed to eat? No, there would be more than could be used by all the poor among us. It is economy in us to take this course, and do better by our poor brethren and sisters than they have hitherto been done by. Let this be published in our newspapers. Let it be sent forth to the people that on the first Thursday of each month, the fast day, all that would be eaten by husbands and wives and children and servants should be put in the hands of the Bishop for the sustenance of the poor. I am willing to do my share as well as the rest, and if there are no poor in my ward, I am willing to divide with those wards where there are poor. If the sisters will look out for rooms for those sisters who need to be taken care of, and see them provided for, you will find that we will possess more comfort and more peace in our hearts, and our spirits will be buoyant and light, full of joy and peace. The Bishops should, through their teachers, see that every family in their wards who is able, should donate what they would naturally consume on fast day to the poor.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses, <\/span>vol. 12, pp. 115\u201316.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/my-brothers-keeper.p37\" class=\"\">I encourage the bishops to hold this principle before their people today in order that we may more fully supply the essential bread and other needs of our brethren who are in unfortunate circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/my-brothers-keeper.p38\" class=\"\">Edwin Markham, you remember, said that our all-supplying Father would give us not only bread, but also beauty and brotherhood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/my-brothers-keeper.p39\" class=\"\">Has the Lord supplied mankind with beauty?

Sometimes we picked the Father\u2019s flowers and stroked their soft petals and loved their bright colors. Sometimes it was one of the Father\u2019s birds. We watched it build its nest. We saw the eggs that were laid. We wondered, elated at the care it gave its young. Often we told stories of the Father. I told them to the child, and the child told them again to me. We told them, the child and I, over and over again. Sometimes we stopped to rest, leaning against one of the Father\u2019s trees, and letting his cool air cool our brows, and never speaking.
