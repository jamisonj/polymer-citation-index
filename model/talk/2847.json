It is the first school and the first church. The best way to prepare a child for a happy and righteous adult life is to strengthen him during his child life. And happy is the family where this most important trust\u2014that of properly raising the children of that family\u2014is their greatest concern.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/parenthood.p27\" class=\"\">Equal to the responsibility we have to provide food and shelter and the necessities of life is the responsibility to set the right example for our children in all that we do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/parenthood.p28\" class=\"\">Let us remember that the parent in the home influences the behavior patterns, the habits, the opinions, and the beliefs of the children.
