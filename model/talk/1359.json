I\nhope the Spirit will bear witness that I mean it, for I know that we are all brothers and sisters.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Concept of God Taught by the Church<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nUnder the title \"The Living and True God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2737\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2737)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2737)\">1 Thes. 1:9<\/a><\/span>),\nI purpose this morning to set forth the concept of\nGod as known and taught by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The fact that\none's understanding of God is the basis of his religion tends to make the subject itself\nsomewhat controversial. This fact will, I hope, to your satisfaction account for any seeming\nintolerance in what I say. I don't want to be intolerant, and I don't think that I am. I do,\nhowever, earnestly desire to convey to you a clear explanation of the \"Living and True God.\"\nAnd, although I remember reading of the furor raised by Paul when he attempted to do this\nsame thing in Athens, and that they charged him with being \". . . a setter forth of strange\ngods\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7949\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7949)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7949)\">Acts 17:18<\/a><\/span>),\nstill I feel somewhat as did Peter and John when they were\ncommanded by the rulers of the Jews not to preach or teach any more in the\nname of Jesus (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7932\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7932)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7932)\">Acts 4:18<\/a><\/span>).\nYou will remember that they answered and said unto them \". . .

Speaking on this most important subject he once\nsaid:\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Prophet Speaks of God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . we know that there is a God in heaven, who is infinite and eternal, from everlasting to\neverlasting the same unchangeable God, the framer of heaven and earth, and all things which\nare in them;\n<\/p><p>\n\"And that he created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And gave unto them commandments that they should love and serve him, the <i>only living and true God<\/i>,\nand that he should be the only being whom they should worship\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14376\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14376)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14376)\">D&amp;C 20:17-19<\/a><\/span>, italics added).\n<\/p><p>\nThis scripture was given in 1830. It is, therefore, modern scripture. However, the teachings in\nit are not new.

I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above\nme in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the\nother&mdash;<i>This is My Beloved Son.

This was made known to him in a revelation in\nwhich the Lord said that the inhabitants of the worlds, including this earth, \". . . are begotten\nsons and daughters unto God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14418\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14418)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14418)\">D&amp;C 76:24<\/a><\/span>).\nThrough this and other modern revelation\nJoseph came to fully comprehend what Paul was talking about when he said to the Hebrews:\n\". . . we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall\nwe not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24330\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24330)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24330)\">Heb. 12:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Knowledge of God Through the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThis knowledge of God opened up to Joseph Smith, as it does to all of us, a vision with\ninfinite promise. We all know that like begets like and that for the offspring\nto grow to the stature of his parent is a process infinitely repeated in nature. We can therefore\nunderstand that for a son of God to grow to the likeness of his Father in heaven is in\nharmony with natural law. We see this law demonstrated every few years in our own\nexperience. Sons born to mortal fathers grow up to be like their fathers in the flesh. This is\nthe way it will be with spirit sons of God. They will grow up to be like their Father in\nheaven. Joseph taught this obvious truth. As a matter of fact, he taught that through this\nprocess God himself attained perfection. From President Snow's understanding of the\nteachings of the Prophet on this doctrinal point, he coined the familiar couplet: \"As man is,\nGod once was; as God is, man may become.\" This teaching is peculiar to the restored gospel\nof Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Joseph considered a knowledge of God to be of such importance that in setting\nforth the beliefs of the Church, he placed it at the head of the list&mdash;\"We believe in God, the\nEternal Father\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6797\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6797)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6797)\">A of F 1:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOne with such a knowledge is in the way of eternal life, for, according to the teachings of\nJesus, \". . . this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ,\nwhom thou hast sent\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28147\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28147)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28147)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>).\nHaving such knowledge, one is assured that God, although\ninfinite and eternal, the framer of heavens and the earth and all things that in them are\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3718\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3718)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3718)\">2 Ne. 2:14<\/a><\/span>), being\nthe possessor of all power, all wisdom, and all understanding, being more intelligent than all\nother beings, is, nevertheless, an individual&mdash;an understanding, kind, and loving parent ready\nto hear and minister to the needs of his children&mdash;that he is not merely some unthinkable,\nunknowable, indefinable, far-off, distant force. When one with such a knowledge prays, he\nknows that he is praying to some <i>one<\/i> and not just to some thing.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>For Want of Knowledge of God the World is Dying<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFor want of a knowledge of the true and living God, this world is today dying. And please do\nnot be deceived. Such a knowledge is not widespread. It is true that, in their great concern\nabout world conditions, men are almost frantically proclaiming from the pulpit, the platform,\nover the air, and through the press that a return to God is the only way out of our difficulties.\nThe tragedy is their cries, like Paul's trumpet of uncertain sound\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"392\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 392)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(392)\">1 Cor. 14:8<\/a><\/span>), are unheeded. Now the\nobvious reason is that neither the trumpeters nor the hearers know the God to whom we must\nreturn. They use the familiar term with which we are all so well acquainted. But when they\nattempt to define the God to whom they would have us return, they reveal a woeful lack of\nknowledge concerning the living and true God. Frequently they actually deny him.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>As of Old<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe present world situation is not unlike that which prevailed in Athens, as portrayed in\nPaul's great sermon preached on Mars' hill. As he stood there, his spirit stirring within him as\nhe beheld the city given wholly to idolatry, he cried:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For as I passed by, and beheld your devotion, I found an altar with this inscription, To the\nUnknown God. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7950\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7950)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7950)\">Acts 17:22-23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFollowing this poignant but deserved thrust, Paul declared that God had made the world and\nall things therein and was therefore Lord of heaven and earth, that both he (Paul) and his\nhearers were the offspring of God, in whom they lived and moved and had their being\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7951\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7951)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7951)\">Acts 17:24-31<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo us it seems almost incredible that in Paul's day men could have believed that graven\nimages of gold or silver or stone fashioned by men's device were gods. And yet, the evidence\nindicates that many today are as far afield in their concepts and belief in God as were the\nAthenian philosophers and populace in that day so long ago when Paul chided them on Mars'\nhill about worshiping a god whom they admittedly did not know; for instance (and now I cite\nthese examples not by way of contention but to illustrate how the concepts of men of the\nworld differ from the true concepts of the living and true God), in a modern\nbook an eminent scientist, whose purpose is altogether commendable, wrote the book to prove\nthat there is a God and in that book appears this statement:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Any effort to visualize God reveals a surprising childishness. We can no more conceive Him\nthan we can conceive an electron\" (Lecomte de Nouy, <i>Human Destiny<\/i>, p. 188).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then to account for the birth and development of moral man, the author says that he was\nforced, and I quote, to admit \"that the only possible logical interpretation of the facts\ncoincided with that which recognized the existence of God . . . We therefore,\" I continue to\nquote, \"used the consecrated name (God), but avoided as much as possible any\nanthropomorphic idea\" (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, pp. 201-202).\n<\/p><p>\nAnother writer says this: \"Man makes God in his own image . . . When man believes that\nGod is personal,\" he says, \"he believes rightly. [But] to say that God is 'a person' is no doubt\nan error.\" (Maude Royden, <i>The Garvin Lectures<\/i>, 1949, p. 45.)\n<\/p><p>\nThese statements indicate that their authors and those who hold their views neither know nor\nbelieve in the living and true God preached by Paul and Joseph Smith. Is it not a great\ntragedy for men today to be walking in such darkness when they might be walking in the\nlight if they would but look and see? This situation brings to mind the Savior's statement:\n\"The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14429\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14429)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14429)\">D&amp;C 88:49<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn connection with this statement the Lord adds another phrase which I love. \". . .\nnevertheless,\" he says, \"the day shall come when you shall comprehend even God, being\nquickened in him and by him\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14430\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14430)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14430)\">D&amp;C 88:49<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Transforming Power of Knowledge of God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThis world would be, comparatively, a heaven if men could be brought to understand and\nknow the living and true God. They who are able to receive and who do receive the restored\ntruth concerning God are literally transformed by their knowledge of, and faith in, him. They\nare drawn upward from the carnal state of fallen man, as it were, and brought back, to a\ndegree at least, into the presence of God. They develop unshakable faith in him. They seek\nhim with certain confidence. They put their trust in him, and he never fails them. In him are\ntheir hope and their strength. Envy, greed, hate, lust, and unrighteous ambition flee from\nthem. They grow in virtue, patience, brotherly kindness, charity, and love, and their eyes are\nsingle to the glory of God (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14361\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14361)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14361)\">D&amp;C 4:5<\/a><\/span>).\nThe principal objective in their lives becomes to keep the\ncommandments of God, thus ridding themselves of sin, for they realize that no unclean thing\ncan enter into his presence (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5678\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5678)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5678)\">3 Ne. 27:19<\/a><\/span>);\nand to return into that presence becomes the supreme faith and\nhope of their existence.\n<\/p><p>\nInto their hearts comes a great concern for the welfare of their fellow men. They set about not\nto conquer them, not to take advantage of them, not to gain temporal and worldly power at\ntheir expense, but to take to them the glorious knowledge of the living and true God which\nthey themselves possess. This they do that their fellows may experience and enjoy the\ntransformation which has come into their lives.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is nothing other than a knowledge of the living and true God which will give men\nincentives strong enough to induce them to root out of their lives the wickedness which has\nbrought us to the brink of the cataclysm on which we totter.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>God's Revelations of Himself<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nEarnest attention to God's revelations of himself is of first importance to every human being.\nTo disbelieve in him, in the light of the plain and certain knowledge he has revealed of\nhimself and which is available to us, is a great evil for which men will be held accountable.\nFull acceptance of him would work in every man the same transformation it worked in the\npeople of Enoch, in Saul of Tarsus, in Alma, in Joseph Smith and his followers&mdash;a\ntransformation which will eventually come and which will establish peace on the earth.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"I Personally Know That There is a God\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow, in conclusion, as a special witness, I want to leave my testimony with\neach of you, and I have in mind all of you who are present and you who are beyond the\nconfines of this building. I personally know \". . . that there is a God in heaven, who is infinite\nand eternal . . . that he created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own\nlikeness . . . \"; that in these latter days he has revealed himself anew; and that he is \". . . the\nonly living and true God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14377\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14377)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14377)\">D&amp;C 20:17-19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"By the Witness of the Holy Spirit\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI have obtained this knowledge and testimony through the same means that Peter, Paul,\nJoseph Smith, and tens of thousands of others have received it&mdash;by the witness of the Holy\nSpirit to my soul. I testify to each of you that you can obtain like knowledge and testimony\nfor your individual selves if you will but humble yourselves and in faith and sincere prayer\nseek it.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are all the children of our Father in heaven. It is inherent in our beings to have faith in\nhim, to believe that he is. It was this kind of faith that prompted Joseph Smith, acting upon\nthe assurance of James&mdash;\"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men\nliberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26171\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26171)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26171)\">James 1:5<\/a><\/span>). It was this that led\nthe Prophet to seek wisdom in prayer. As a result he received a revelation in which the\nliving and true God appeared to him. He received that revelation not just for himself alone\nbut for you and for me and for every living soul in this earth.\n<\/p><p>\nGod has not left us to grope in darkness. His words do not fail\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14408\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14408)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14408)\">D&amp;C 64:31<\/a><\/span>). If we will but ask him in sincerity\nand faith, he will make known to each of us the reality of himself. We can, if we will submit\nto his spirit, know for a certainty that he is the true and living God.\n<\/p><p>\nAs one of the least of his humble servants, I bear this witness to you in the\nname of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
