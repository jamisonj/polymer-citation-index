But the president of the Church is in fact a prophet raised up in these last days to give inspired guidance, not only to Latter-day Saints, but to all mankind everywhere.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p8\" class=\"\">The Almighty has said of him and the other prophets of this church:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p9\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 they shall speak as they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15908\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15908)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15908)\">D&amp;C 68:3\u20134<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p11\" class=\"\">President Smith is a prophet in the same sense as were Moses and Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Paul and Peter, and others who ministered anciently.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p12\" class=\"\">Every faithful person will agree that there were prophets in Israel during Old Testament times. Prophets also were a part of the church as established by the Savior in his day. They too were like Moses and Isaiah, but they were even more\u2014they were <span class=\"emphasis\">Christian <\/span>prophets, chosen by the Lord for the Christian ministry to properly teach the saints and to protect them from false doctrines that could lead them astray.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p13\" class=\"\">Few modern people, whether Jewish or Christian, realize that there are living prophets on earth today, men who hold the same gifts and powers that characterized the prophets of old. But they are here, alive and alert. They are modern men, well educated and fully oriented to present-day conditions. They give the word of God as it is received now, just as Moses and Isaiah, Peter and Paul ministered in their day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p14\" class=\"\">Try to realize it if you will.

He has appeared to modern mortal men who have seen his face and heard his voice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p19\" class=\"\">No more is he an absentee God. No longer is he isolated from us. In the time in which we ourselves live he has shown himself to be a divine reality, physical as well as spiritual.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p20\" class=\"\">By showing himself literally to modern men, he has removed all doubt as to his existence. He lives, as does his divine Begotten Son, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p21\" class=\"\">Both have made themselves known by a great new revelation in our day!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p22\" class=\"\">Is that hard to believe? Do you doubt it? Does it seem incredible to you that God would appear to modern men?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p23\" class=\"\">He certainly revealed himself anciently. If he is unchangeable, as the scriptures say, should he not do as much for modern people as he did for the ancients?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p24\" class=\"\">Throughout Bible times he made himself known. Especially when his people began to drift astray did he manifest himself in power to bring them back to the fold.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p25\" class=\"\">This he did through new prophets whom he raised up from time to time, and to whom he gave new revelations, which revitalized and gave added meaning to the divine word previously given.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p26\" class=\"\">After long centuries of laboring through his prophets, he then sent his own Beloved Son, not to condemn the world but to save it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p27\" class=\"\">To accomplish his purposes, the Lord founded his church and taught his gospel, and for a time many followed it. But since then mankind again has drifted from his precepts and neglected his commandments; hence the condition of the world today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p28\" class=\"\">But because he loves modern people as he did those of ancient times, the Lord is now making a final effort to save us. This he does by precisely the same means that he used anciently; that is, by giving new revelation and raising up new prophets through whom he speaks to mankind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p29\" class=\"\">You may say that you have been taught that the Almighty no longer reveals himself, that no more revelation is needed, and that the Bible is sufficient.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p30\" class=\"\">It is admitted that for centuries revelation did stop. There were no more apostles and prophets on the earth. This is only too true and is most regrettable.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p31\" class=\"\">But the flow of revelation stopped only for the same reason that it ceased occasionally in Old Testament times.

Angels also were to visit the earth once more, giving divine direction to wandering mankind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p35\" class=\"\">Is that hard to believe? Not if you accept the Bible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p36\" class=\"\">We Latter-day Saints announce that this new light has come. God has given a great new revelation. He has raised up new apostles and prophets to labor among the nations, even as did Peter and Paul. We are those apostles and prophets. We are his divinely called representatives for today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p37\" class=\"\">But many will say that this cannot be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p38\" class=\"\">It has come to pass nevertheless. It is an accomplished fact. And it is in direct fulfillment of Bible prophecy!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-people-of-sound-judgment.p39\" class=\"\">Some may say that God would never appear to a small sect hidden away in the Rocky Mountains.
