This seems to be the feeling of everyone that attempts to speak before this congregation. But what are the feelings of thousands of this people that appreciate their blessings and their enjoyments? I know for one that I have never seen a day since I entered into this Church, but what I felt thankful for the situation in which I was placed. I have been many times poor as to the things of this world, but I never saw the time but what I felt rich in regard to the principles of life and salvation, that God has revealed to us. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v2n968\"> I presume there are but few in this valley, and perhaps not one, that has seen closer times than I have, or than President Brigham Young has. I hear a great many people say, and even some of those who labor on the Public Works, that they have nothing but bread to eat and water to drink; well, I have seen the time, a great many times, that I had not bread to eat, but there was plenty of water, though not half so good as we have here in these valleys. I have thought a thousand times how it is possible that men can have nothing under the heavens to live upon but bread and water, when the valleys are full of vegetation, and at the same time they will have plenty of potatoes, beets, carrots, pumpkins, and everything of that kind, and still they say they have nothing but bread and water! That is a mystery that never has been un<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"155b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD02\/JoD02_0155.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;155b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/5979\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>folded to me. I have never seen the time in my life but what I had something to eat, if it was nothing but some horse beef, or something of that kind. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v2n969\"> Well, there are a great many who labor, and have their three dollars and three dollars and a half a day, and they say there is nothing but bread and water to live upon. Ask them how much of a family they have, and you will learn they have only one wife, and no children, and are paid from 18 to 20 dollars a week, and cannot get anything but bread and water! <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v2n970\"> I merely speak of this because I have heard it so much. Perhaps they cannot get meat, and perhaps they cannot get butter, nor sugar, nor coffee, nor tea, but they have plenty of potatoes, and they have plenty of beets, carrots, pumpkins, squashes, &amp;c., &amp;c., for there are thousands of these things in the Tithing Office. I wish the brethren would not come to President Young, nor to any other one, with that complaint any more, until the potatoes are all gone. Why not say, &#x201C;We have to live on bread, and water, and potatoes, and pumpkins, squashes, and all these good things?&#x201D; Will you not be so candid as to make that report the next time? I know perfectly well we are comfortable as a people, and you may go into the United States, and into the best cities and towns that there are in the United States, and you cannot find so large a congregation as are here together,  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"156a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD02\/JoD02_0156.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;156a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/5978\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>which is as well clad as you are today. If you could stand where I am, and look upon this congregation, you would be surprised to see the good clothing you have on; it is better than I ever saw any congregation have in any part of the United States, or in any portion of Europe that I ever was in; and we have the least cause of complaint of any people that live upon the face of the earth; this I know. And I know another thing, that a great many people are becoming so proud&#x2014;well, perhaps it is not pride, but they have got so that they cannot dress and clothe themselves with anything that is not brought here by the merchants. Many will bring in their wool, and their linsey, and their good clothing that they make here from the wool, and give it to clothe the Indians, for they are too proud to wear it themselves. But the day will come when the merchants of the earth will lift up their heads and their voices, and cry out, &#x201C;We have no place to sell our merchandise.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"94337\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 94337)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(94337)\">Rev. 18:11<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v2n972\"> Will the time ever be that we can make our clothing?

If there are any who have not got the sheep, they can buy the wool cheaper than it can be bought in the United States this day. You can buy it at from 20 to 50 cents a pound. I would like to see the people take a course to make their own clothing, make their own machinery, their own knives and their own forks, and everything else we need, for the day will come when we will be under the necessity of doing it, for trouble and perplexity, war and famine, bloodshed and fire, and thunder and lightning will roll upon the nations of the earth, insomuch that we cannot get to them, nor they to us.

Look at Nauvoo, for instance, and see how poor and penniless we were, living in old log cabins, and destitute; but we began to get rich, and many became wealthy. There is no man upon the face of the earth that will be favorable towards Zion and towards this people, but what he will prosper temporally as well as spiritually. I have never seen a place, since I was born upon the earth, in which I could make one dollar, but that I could make 50 dollars among the Saints in the same length of time. It seems to cost more to build a house here by one half than it does in the United States, still it is easier to build, and to multiply and replenish the earth,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52283\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52283)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52283)\">Gen. 1:28<\/a><\/span> and raise food, and everything else, in this place, than in any other that ever I saw. At the same time there are a great many who murmur, and say it is the hardest place they ever saw; that is a curiosity to me, when the blessings of the Almighty attend us wherever we go; for we can build up a city in a few days, or at the furthest in a few years, and it seems to be no trouble at all. Brethren and sisters, let us try to appreciate our blessings, and honor the calling we have received. At the same time there are  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"157a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD02\/JoD02_0157.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;157a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/5977\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>a great many who disregard their profession, and tantalize others who hold the Priesthood, and try to make it dishonorable; but they cannot do it. I cannot dishonor it, but I can dishonor myself. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v2n975\"> The Priesthood is a gift from the Almighty, and He has placed a portion of it upon me to honor, and if I honor that calling, that Priesthood will honor me, it will magnify me before God, and before the world. I do know that when I take a course to dishonor myself, I degrade myself in the eyes of heaven, and upon earth. When I trifle with the Priesthood I trifle with the Almighty; and when I trifle with President Young I trifle with the Priesthood, and that Priesthood will leave me, and I will fall and I will become disgraced in the eyes of heaven, and of all Saints; and I forfeit everything that I had attained while I held that Priesthood, when I forfeit it; I forfeit my salvation and every blessing I possess. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v2n976\"> Supposing we all realized this, do you not think that those who have the Priesthood, and take a course to pollute not only themselves, but their brethren, and their sisters, and degrade themselves, and steal, and lie, and take the name of God in vain, would repent speedily? How do you suppose the Lord looks upon them?

It is just as reasonable that they should. I know it is so; I do not believe it, but I actually know it; and that the God which I serve lives and dwells in the heavens; and I feel to honor Him, I feel to reverence Him, and to do a good work by His authority, that I may come into His presence, and give up my stewardship with joy, and not with grief; and dwell with Him at some future time. And when I give up my stewardship to Him, if He considers me worthy, He can restore it to me, with an hundredfold beside. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v2n978\"> We are on trial, and let us prove ourselves by paying our tithing, and fulfilling all our duties before God, and see if He will not pour us out a blessing that there will not be room to contain it.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"62442\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 62442)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(62442)\">Mal. 3:10<\/a><\/span> How in the heavens can you prove the Lord whether His word shall be verified, if you do not step forward and do as He has told you?

No, it won't affect them one hair. If you do not pay one dime of tithing it will not impoverish the Almighty, but I will tell you where the effect will be, it will affect yourselves, your own salvation. If you neglect these things, I tell you the Lord will neglect to bless you; it comes on yourselves individually, and it stands you in hand, every soul of you, men and women, to arise and prove the Lord, and see if He does not watch your faithfulness, and is not ready to pour you out a blessing that you have not room to receive.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"62443\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 62443)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(62443)\">Mal. 3:10<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v2n980\"> Since President Young and others have dwelt upon tithing it is coming in first rate, and Bishop Hunter has become frightened; &#x201C;Good heavens,&#x201D; says he, &#x201C;what shall we do with the tithing?

Let us be one in these things, and be up and doing while it is time; and it is time all the time, and it is time in eternity all the time, and always will be; and when we get into the next stage of action it will be time while we are there, and it will be eternity around us.

There are a great many men will pray when you ask them to pray, but I doubt whether they pray at any other time, but they must keep up an appearance in our midst, and at the same time carry on iniquity right here in the heart of Zion. As someone said here last Sabbath, I wish things would take a little different course, that we should have no necessity of exhorting you to faithfulness. I wish you would exhort yourselves to faithfulness, and then practice it, and then continue in it to the end. Let us go, to work and build up Zion as well as build up ourselves, for when we build up Zion we build up ourselves, when we enrich Zion we enrich ourselves. When we build up the Public Works we enrich ourselves, for the public improvements increase the value of our private improvements, and they are connected together. Let President Brigham Young and his Counselors, and the Twelve, leave this place and go to Fillmore, and property in Fillmore will rise the moment we go there and commence to build a temple. Lots, instead of selling for 25 dollars, will sell for 25 hundred. Take away the temple from here, and place it there, and see what a change it will make; for where the carcass is, there the eagles will gather together,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"65789\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 65789)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(65789)\">Matt. 24:28<\/a><\/span> and you cannot help yourselves. Do you know it? Now let us go to work and build up these Public Works, and make things look nice and comfortable. It will take us but a little while to do a thing if we have means to do it; for the more means there are, the more men can be employed; and after all true riches are in labor and muscle, the sinew and the bone, more than in gold and silver, and fine clothing. Did you ever see a piece of calico make itself? It is produced by bone and sinew. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v2n989\"> Some in the world say, &#x201C;I never can believe the earth was made with  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"161a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD02\/JoD02_0161.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;161a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/5973\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>hands, or if it was, it is certainly a curiosity for the Lord to measure the whole of it in the hollow of His hand,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"59326\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 59326)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(59326)\">Isa. 40:12<\/a><\/span> and it is said He did; He hefted it and weighed it in a balance.

We were speaking about an open vision that we saw some years ago; it was not seen in the dark, but we saw it with our natural eyes; President Young, myself, brother Phineas Young, and many others saw it.

This we saw with our natural eyes, and looked upon it for hours; it was the very night that the angel delivered the plates to Joseph Smith. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v2n993\"> This army marched to the southwest, and they marched as if there was a battle to take place; and we could hear the clashing of their swords and guns, and the measured tread of their march, just as plain as I ever heard the movements of troops on the earth. John P. Greene came to wake me up to look upon it. I am speaking of this to show you how exact in our discipline and government we must be to prepare us for a celestial being; we have got to begin to come to it, and I would like to know when you will begin to prepare yourselves. The whole world have got to see and feel the armies of heaven, and when they come they will come with order, and when they are commanded to act there will be no running away, and there will be no traitors in that army, but it will be composed of virtuous Saints, who are clothed with the power of God, and have the integrity of heavenly beings. They will not sell whiskey, and stick up grogeries, and establish distilleries, and engage in various other operations to pollute this people among whom they have enlisted, even under the banners of Christ. Among the wicked there will be disorder, but in the armies of heaven there will be order. Things in heaven are in order, there is a pure government there, and it must be observed, and strictly adhered to; this you read in your Bibles.
