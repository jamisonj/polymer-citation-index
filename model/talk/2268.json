I love them and they know it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p4\" class=\"\">The story of Joseph, the son of Jacob who was called Israel, is a vivid representation of the great truth that \u201call things work together for good to [those] who\u201d love God. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"42846\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42846)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42846)\">Rom. 8:28<\/a><\/span>.) Joseph always seemed to do the right thing; but still, more importantly, he did it for the right reason. And how very, very significant that is! Joseph was sold by his own brothers as a slave and was purchased by Potiphar, a captain of the guard of Pharaoh. But even as an indentured servant, Joseph turned every experience and all circumstances, no matter how trying, into something good.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p5\" class=\"\">This ability to turn everything into something good appears to be a godly characteristic. Our Heavenly Father always seems able to do this. Everything, no matter how dire, becomes a victory to the Lord. Joseph, although a slave and wholly undeserving of this fate, nevertheless remained faithful to the Lord and continued to live the commandments and made something very good of his degrading circumstances. People like this cannot be defeated, because they will not give up. They have the correct, positive attitude, and Dale Carnegie\u2019s expression seems to apply: If you feel you have a lemon, you can either complain about how sour it is, or you can make a lemonade. It is all up to you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cFailure ceases to exist in the face of persistence.\u201d So, the Lord prospered Joseph, and his master saw that the Lord was with him and made Joseph overseer over all his house; and all that he had, he put in Joseph\u2019s hands. So implicit was his trust in this remarkable young man that Potiphar did not bother to keep any accounting of his own possessions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p7\" class=\"\">Naturally, such a remarkable person would be enticing to the opposite sex, and so it was with Joseph. Potiphar\u2019s wife, who, to say the most for her, was of very doubtful character, attempted to seduce Joseph; but Joseph was untouchable because of his trust and reliance on the Lord. He tried to reason with her, saying:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p8\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 my master \u2026 hath committed all that he hath to my hand;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cThere is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife \u2026\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23845\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23845)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23845)\">Gen. 39:8\u20139<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p10\" class=\"\">Then, it would seem that he would have followed this declaration with a profession of loyalty to his master because of his appreciation of the trust that Potiphar had placed in him. But he did not; instead, his statement of why he could not submit to her demands revealed the real strength of this choice young man. He said: \u201c\u2026 how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23846\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23846)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23846)\">Gen. 39:9<\/a><\/span>.) With this statement Joseph showed that he was determined to do the right thing, but do it for the right reason. That reason: because he loved the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p11\" class=\"\">Oh, yes, it is good to be loyal to your employer, or your friends, or your family. Loyalty is akin to honesty; and if you are not honest, you are really not much good. You are no good to yourself because you lie to yourself. This is called rationalization, but it is really just lying. You are no good to your friends because they cannot trust you. You are no good to the Lord because he cannot use you\u2014unless, of course, it would be as a bad example. If you make a mistake, all is not lost.

It is so vitally important that, I feel, if you do anything in righteousness for any other reason than you love the Lord, you are wrong\u2014at least you are on very shaky ground. And, somewhere your reasons for acting in righteousness will not be strong enough to see you through. You will give way to expediency, or peer group pressure, or honor, or fame, or applause, or the thrill of the moment, or some other worldly reason. Unless your motives are built upon the firm foundation of love of the Lord, you will not be able to stand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p14\" class=\"\">It seems that, at this day and time, everything is in a state of change. There appears to be nothing in this life that is not subject to erosion, or decay, or just change for the sake of change\u2014like the new automobile models each year.

The scripture records that Joseph stoutly resisted the advances of Potiphar\u2019s wife, but one day as he went into the house \u201cto do his business,\u201d it so happened that \u201cthere was none of the men of the house there within.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23847\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23847)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23847)\">Gen. 39:11<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p24\" class=\"\">Now, this is always a dangerous situation and should be avoided if at all possible. Potiphar\u2019s wife became particularly insistent, even to taking hold of his coat and attempting to draw him to her. But Joseph did the very best thing he could do under the circumstances. The scripture records, \u201c\u2026 he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23848\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23848)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23848)\">Gen. 39:12<\/a><\/span>.)

In order to really be free of the commandment, it becomes necessary for me to add a commandment of my own to the navy\u2019s commandment, such as, \u201cThou shalt not fly thy airplane closer than 5,000 feet to the trees.\u201d When you do this, you make the navy\u2019s commandment of not flying in the trees easy to live, and the safety factor is tremendously increased.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p29\" class=\"\">Admittedly, the latter commandment is your own addition, and care should be exercised that you do not get it mixed up with the law and expound it <span class=\"emphasis\">as <\/span>the law.
