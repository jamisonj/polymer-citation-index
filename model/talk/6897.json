There must be a tremendous demand for these products, because one can scarcely turn on the television or radio without seeing or hearing promotions for products that promise everything from losing weight to growing a lush crop of thick hair. At times I wonder if the people who make these products know me personally.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p5\" class=\"\">Today I would like to offer my own self-improvement program. It consists of three steps that have been useful to me, and I am confident they will be helpful to you as well. What\u2019s more, this self-improvement program is free. There\u2019s no need for you to pull out your credit card. No toll-free number will flash on the screen warning that you have five minutes remaining to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime offer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p6\" class=\"\">Perhaps the best way to teach these principles is by way of parable.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p7\" class=\"\">There was once a man named John who, although still relatively young, had experienced much suffering and sorrow. Homeless and addicted to alcohol and other drugs, John was terribly sick and weary of life. The more he descended into illness and despair, the more he knew that if he didn\u2019t make changes\u2014and quickly\u2014there was a very real possibility he would die miserable, useless, and alone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p8\" class=\"\">Perhaps because he had attended Primary a few times when he was a boy, John ended up in a nearby meetinghouse where he asked to see the bishop.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cI have ruined my life,\u201d John said between tortured sobs that emerged from the depths of his harrowed soul. He spoke of the mistakes he had made and the path of self-destruction and misery he had trod.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p10\" class=\"\">As the bishop listened to John\u2019s sad story, he could tell that the man truly wanted to repent and change his life. But he could also sense that John had little confidence that he could change.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p11\" class=\"\">The bishop thought for a moment about what he could say. Finally, he looked up and said, \u201cJohn, I have made three choices in my life that have been of value to me. They may be of assistance to you as well.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cPlease, tell me,\u201d John pleaded. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything. I just want to start over. I want to go back.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p13\" class=\"\">The bishop smiled and told him, \u201cThe first thing you should understand is that you can\u2019t go back and begin where you once were. But all is not lost. You can begin where you are. Choose to begin your repentance now.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p14\" class=\"\">To some degree, we all are like John. We have made mistakes. But no matter how badly we want to go back and begin again, we can\u2019t. We can, however, repent and begin where we are today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p15\" class=\"\">In the Book of Mormon, we read of Alma the Younger. He was the son of a great prophet, but he turned against his father and sought to do evil. After a visit from an angel that left him incapacitated and unable to speak, Alma repented and worked for the rest of his life to repair the damage he had done. As a result, he blessed and enriched the lives of thousands of others. Alma did not accept that he was doomed because of past mistakes. He understood that he could not erase the past. But he also understood that he had the power to repent and begin anew from where he was.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p16\" class=\"\">How do we begin to repent?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p17\" class=\"\">By first acknowledging our errors and deciding to repent. By committing today\u2014this very day\u2014to do better, to live noble and compassionate lives, to strive each day to be more like the Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p18\" class=\"\">Our destiny and ultimate fate depend upon our daily decisions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p19\" class=\"\">The great Old Testament prophet Joshua knew this when he said, \u201cChoose you this day whom ye will serve; \u2026 but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-23911_000_026\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30021\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30021)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30021)\">Josh. 24:15<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p20\" class=\"\">Joshua understood how critical it is to choose without delay to be more righteous. We too should decide now. Will our lives be filled with regret and despair? Or will we repent and strive each day to make our days worthwhile and meaningful?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p21\" class=\"\">Tomorrow\u2019s joy or tomorrow\u2019s despair has its roots in decisions we make today. Perhaps some people think to themselves: \u201cI know I need to change some things in my life. Maybe later, but not now.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p22\" class=\"\">Those who stand at the threshold of life always waiting for the right time to change are like the man who stands at the bank of a river waiting for the water to pass so he can cross on dry land.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p23\" class=\"\">Today is the day of decision.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p24\" class=\"\">When John heard the bishop\u2019s words, he promised he would do what the bishop had said. Because of his addictions, John knew he needed to repent and improve his health. So he checked himself into a facility where he underwent the prolonged process of recovery. He began eating nutritious food. He began to walk and do other exercises.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p25\" class=\"\">Weeks passed. John was able to free himself from his addictions. He could see that his health was improving and he was getting stronger. But still he was not satisfied. There were so many things about his life that needed improvement that he felt overwhelmed and discouraged.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p26\" class=\"\">So, once again, he scheduled a meeting with his bishop.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p27\" class=\"\">That is when he learned the second choice: \u201cJohn,\u201d the bishop said to him, \u201cyou\u2019ll most likely have a rough time if you think you can make yourself perfect all at once. What you must learn is to choose your priorities. You have to put first things first.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p28\" class=\"\">In most cases, growth comes slowly\u2014one step at a time. We understand this when it comes to mastering a musical instrument, becoming an accomplished athlete, or flying a jet aircraft. Yet, we often can scarcely forgive ourselves when we don\u2019t make the progress we expect in all areas of our own lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p29\" class=\"\">Great sculptors and artists spend countless hours perfecting their talents. They don\u2019t pick up a chisel or a brush and palette, expecting immediate perfection. They understand that they will make many errors as they learn, but they start with the basics, the key fundamentals first.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p30\" class=\"\">So it is with us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p31\" class=\"\">We become masters of our lives in the same way\u2014by focusing on first things first. We all have a pretty good idea of the most important decisions we need to make\u2014decisions that will improve our lives and bring us greater happiness and peace. That is where we should start. That is where we should place our greatest effort.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p32\" class=\"\">Each night before I go to bed, I take out a small card and write a list of the things I need to do the next day in order of their priority.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p33\" class=\"\">When I arrive at the office in the morning, I check my card and put all my efforts into the first item on the list. When I accomplish that item, I move on to the second and so on. Some days, I finish every item on my list. On other days, some tasks are not completed. I don\u2019t become discouraged, however, because I\u2019m focusing my energies on the things that matter most.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p34\" class=\"\">John began to understand that he couldn\u2019t change everything that was wrong with his life in an instant, but he could choose his priorities. He could focus on the things that mattered most, and with time his life would begin to improve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p35\" class=\"\">With help from the elders quorum president, John found a modest place to live. He knew that he needed to find a way to support himself, and as his health and attitude improved, he found part-time work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p36\" class=\"\">Each night before John went to bed, he made a list of the most important things he needed to accomplish the next day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p37\" class=\"\">Eventually, John was earning a steady income. He moved into a more comfortable place and bought a car. Yet, although he was feeling much better about his life, he still felt that something was missing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p38\" class=\"\">Consequently, John returned a third time to meet with his bishop.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p39\" class=\"\">\u201cThe reason you still feel empty,\u201d the bishop said, \u201cis because you have not made the third choice.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p40\" class=\"\">John asked what it was.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p41\" class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to make choices and decisions, and to work on them each day,\u201d the bishop said. \u201cMany have spent their lives in productive labor and have accomplished much. But they still feel empty. At the end of their days they lament that their lives had little meaning.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p42\" class=\"\">That was exactly what John had been feeling.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p43\" class=\"\">The bishop continued, \u201cIt is not enough to do things.

The leather cover was scuffed and wrinkled. The gilded edges on the paper were nearly worn away. \u201cThrough the scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets,\u201d the bishop replied. \u201cThese are the \u2018right things.\u2019 Some believe that the commandments of our Heavenly Father are restrictive and hard. To the contrary, they\u2019re a handbook to happiness. Every aspect of the gospel of Jesus Christ\u2014the principles, the doctrines, and the commandments\u2014is a part of our Heavenly Father\u2019s plan to help us obtain peace and happiness.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p46\" class=\"\">The bishop turned to the Book of Mormon and read the words of King Benjamin: \u201cConsider \u2026 the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-23911_000_026\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40164\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40164)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40164)\">Mosiah 2:41<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/three-choices.p47\" class=\"\">As the bishop spoke, John thought about his own life.

This I testify in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-23911_000_026\"><a name=\"-23911_000_026\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-23911_000_026\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"30021\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30021)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30021)\">Josh. 24:15<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-23911_000_026\"><a name=\"-23911_000_026\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-23911_000_026\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"40164\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40164)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40164)\">Mosiah 2:41<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-23911_000_026\"><a name=\"-23911_000_026\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-23911_000_026\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"32959\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32959)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32959)\">Mark 8:36<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-23911_000_026\"><a name=\"-23911_000_026\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-23911_000_026\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"38200\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38200)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38200)\">Moro. 7:16<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
