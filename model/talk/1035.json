Stapley<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Delbert L. Stapley, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1959, pp. 70-73<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brothers and sisters, I am happy indeed to extend the hand of fellowship to Elder Howard\nW. Hunter, called this day as a member of the Council of the Twelve. I look forward with\njoyous anticipation to association with him in that council. I assure him of my support and my\nlove and my help.\n<\/p><p>\nToday I feel to share with you my witness and humble testimony that this Church is the true\nChurch of Christ, established upon the earth in this dispensation of God's providence for the\nlast time. It was divinely set up by our Lord, and possesses every truth, principle, and\nordinance for the salvation and exaltation of those who receive and obey its plan of life.\n<\/p><p>\nI solemnly testify that every President of this Church has been called of God, and sustained\nby him and by the faithful Church members who with uplifted hands before God, angels, and\nfellow disciples, agreed to accept and sustain their leader as prophet, seer, and revelator. We\nso sustain our beloved President David O. McKay today. According to the spirit of truth\nwithin me, I accept him in this high position of prophet, seer, and revelator with all my heart,\nand uphold him without question and without reservation. I say to you, my brothers and\nsisters, that if everyone would keep his eyes on the President of this Church and follow his\nexample, he would never go wrong. I have that faith and confidence, and so testify to you\nwith full knowledge that ultimately I must answer to God for my teachings and personal acts.\n<\/p><p>\nThe members of the Church must, by implicit obedience to gospel principles and ordinances,\nstand firm and true to the faith and not be tossed about by every wind of doctrine from\ndeceiving teachers who wrongfully and wilfully suggest that the Church in this day has gone\nastray, which claim I humbly testify to you is untrue. Dissenters from the Church in all ages\nof the world, influenced by evil design, have zealously taught deceptive and false doctrines\nand led many unsuspecting and unthinking souls into the broad way of apostasy from the\ntruth. The true servants of the Lord have consistently and humbly warned against\nself-appointed leaders, and have always admonished the Saints to be faithful and true in\nkeeping the commandments of God, and thus develop faith and strength against the powers of\nevil which are constantly leveled at them.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the early history of the Church, because the elders did not understand the manifestations of\ndifferent spirits abroad which were disturbing the members, the Lord, in answer to prayerful\ninquiry, warned: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold, verily I say unto you, that there are many spirits which are false spirits, which have\ngone forth in the earth, deceiving the world\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13738\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13738)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13738)\">D&amp;C 50:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhat was true then is true now, and ever will be until Satan and his evil hosts are forever\nbound and shorn of their power to deceive and destroy. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught,\n\"Nothing is a greater injury to the children of men than to be under the influence of a false\nspirit when they think they have the Spirit of God\" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>,\npage 205). How true this statement is, and how important to know correct Church doctrine\nand procedures to prevent stumbling along life's way. It is a great blessing and gift to be able\nto discern and choose rightly between truth and error.\n<\/p><p>\nTo protect the faith of Church members the Lord has revealed: \n<\/p><p>\n\"But ye are commanded in all things to ask of God, who giveth liberally; and that which the\nSpirit testifies unto you even so I would that ye should do in all holiness of heart, walking\nuprightly before me, considering the end of your salvation, doing all things with prayer and\nthanksgiving, that ye may not be seduced by evil spirits, or doctrines of devils, or the\ncommandments of men; for some are of men, and others of devils\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13737\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13737)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13737)\">D&amp;C 46:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn all the teachings and prophecies of the prophets concerning the establishment of God's\nkingdom in the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, there is no mention nor indication that\nthe Church, when once established, would fail or be given to another people\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10647\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10647)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10647)\">Dan. 2:44<\/a><\/span>). That was not\ntrue of the Church in the Meridian of time. The prophets before the time of Christ, and the\napostles after, warned and predicted a falling away from the truth and the true Church.\n<\/p><p>\nAs members of the Church, we must always remember that this is the Dispensation of the\nFulness of Times, or, the last of all gospel dispensations, when all things are to be gathered\ntogether in Christ before his coming to earth again. The destiny of this Church is too great\nand the time too short for so important a work to be bounced from one group of people to\nanother. The Lord would not have it so and has decreed the permanency of his latter-day\nkingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen John the Revelator, in a vision of important latter-day events, witnessed an angel flying\nin the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the\nearth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42291\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42291)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42291)\">Rev. 14:6<\/a><\/span>); he quoted the angel as\nsaying: \"Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42294\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42294)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42294)\">Rev. 14:7<\/a><\/span>).\nOur era of time is the hour of God's judgment; therefore, this prophecy could not be\nfulfilled if interruptions were to occur in the progress and work of the restored kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Daniel, interpreting King Nebuchadnezzar's dream, informed him that its\nfulfillment would be in the latter days. Then, calling attention to the kingdoms that should\nfollow that of the king until many kingdoms resulted, Daniel declared: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never\nbe destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces\nand consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.\n<\/p><p>\n\"God,\" said Daniel, concluding his interpretation of the king's dream, \"hath made known\nto the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation\nthereof sure\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10650\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10650)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10650)\">Dan. 2:44-45<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHere is prophetic evidence of the continuity of God's latter-day kingdom when established\nupon the earth. Daniel emphasized that point dramatically when he said, \"The dream is certain\nand the interpretation thereof sure.\" The kingdom, prophesied Daniel, is not to be destroyed; it\nis not to be left to other people; and it shall stand forever. How convincing and certain this\ndeclaration is!\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord, in a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith shortly after the organization of the\nChurch, made this pronouncement: \"For behold, the field is white already to harvest; and it is\nthe eleventh hour, and the last time that I shall call laborers into my vineyard\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13728\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13728)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13728)\">D&amp;C 33:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAgain, the Lord revealed to the Prophet: \"The keys of the kingdom of God are committed\nunto man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth,\nas the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth until it has filled\nthe whole earth\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13751\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13751)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13751)\">D&amp;C 65:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis latter declaration accords with and confirms Daniel's interpretation of King\nNebuchadnezzar's dream, for the Prophet Daniel spoke of the stone which was cut without\nhands which smote the image and became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith gave this wise counsel, which is a true principle in Church\ngovernment and is the order of the Holy Priesthood: \"I will inform you that it is contrary to\nthe economy of God for any member of the Church, or any one, to receive instruction for\nthose in authority, higher than themselves; therefore you will see the impropriety of giving\nheed to them\" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>, page 21).\n<\/p><p>\nAgain he taught: \"Revelations of the mind and will of God to the Church, are to come\nthrough the Presidency. This is the order of heaven, and the power and privilege of this\nPriesthood\" (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, page 111).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then a powerful declaration of an eternal principle which the Prophet Joseph Smith said\nis eternal, undeviating, and firm as the pillars of heaven: \"I will give you one of the Keys of\nthe mysteries of the Kingdom. It is an eternal principle, that has existed with God from all\neternity: That man who rises up to condemn others, finding fault with the Church, saying that\nthey are out of the way, while he himself is righteous, then know assuredly, that that man is\nin the high road to apostasy; and if he does not repent, will apostatize, as God lives\" (<i>Ibid.<\/i>,\npage 156).\n<\/p><p>\nHow clear and forthright these statements are, and so powerfully and convincingly stated that\nthere can be no doubt of their truth.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord gave this instruction and warning to the elders of his Church, and to all the\ninhabitants of Zion against those individuals making false claims and purporting to receive\nrevelations: \"And this shall be a law unto you, that ye receive not the teachings of any that\nshall come before you as revelations or commandments;<br \/>\n\"And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived, that you may know that they are not\nof me.<br \/>\n\"For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me shall come in at the gate and be\nordained as I have told you before, to teach those revelations which you have received and\nshall receive through him whom I have appointed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13734\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13734)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13734)\">D&amp;C 43:5-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBaptism at the hands of an authorized servant of God permits a person to come in at the gate;\nand the way prescribed by the Lord, as outlined in the preceding quotation, by which those\nordained can be known and accepted by the members of his Church is clearly set forth in the\nfollowing revelation: \"Again I say unto you,\" said the Lord, \"that it shall not be given to\nanyone to go forth to preach my gospel, or to build up my church, except he be ordained by\nsome one who has authority, and it is known to the church that he has authority and has been\nregularly ordained by the heads of the church\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13733\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13733)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13733)\">D&amp;C 42:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs in past ages, men will continue to arise to plague the work of God, for this\nis the intent of Satan and ever has been since the beginning of man on the\nearth.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are infallible guiding principles found in the revelations and in the historical records of\nthe Lord's dealings with his people for their guidance and protection. Here is a very important\none given in this last dispensation to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Lord gave it as a guiding\nadmonition to his people. Said he: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And all things shall be done by common consent in the church, by much prayer and faith,\nfor all things you shall receive by faith\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13724\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13724)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13724)\">D&amp;C 26:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf the members of the Church will follow this counsel and act together in prayer and true\nfaith, the Holy Ghost will not permit them to yield to the influence of error and false\nteachings of those who seek to overthrow the work of God. The great Nephite prophet,\nMosiah, warning his people against kingcraft, counseled them concerning the manner in which\njudges to govern them should be selected, and wisely advised: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which\nis right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right;\ntherefore this shall ye observe and make it your law&mdash;to do your business by the voice of the\npeople\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40289\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40289)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40289)\">Mosiah 29:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAll wavering and disaffected individuals should remember the safeguards to faith and\ntestimony given by the Lord through revelation, and, recognizing and working through\nconstituted channels of priesthood authority, submit their views or claims and be willing to\nabide by the voice of the people, who, conforming to the above-quoted revelation, are to\ndecide the matter after exercising much faith and prayer. If they would do this before\npermitting themselves to follow a deviating or contrary course, and manifest the faith to abide\nby the voice of the Saints, they would not go astray nor depart from the right way, and their\nsouls and those of their posterity would, through obedience to the commandments, be saved in\nthe kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many other scriptural references and revelations, also statements by Church leaders,\nbearing upon this subject which could be quoted, but I close with two additional quotations\nfrom the revelations of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The first concerns the keys of\npriesthood power committed to the First Presidency and the Twelve of the Church: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For unto you, the Twelve, and those, the First Presidency, who are appointed with you to be\nyour counselors and your leaders, is the power of this priesthood given, for the last days and\nfor the last time, in the which is the dispensation of the fulness of times.<br \/>\n\"For verily I say unto you, the keys of the dispensation, which ye have received, have come\ndown from the fathers, and last of all, being sent down from heaven unto you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13792\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13792)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13792)\">D&amp;C 112:30,32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now the second and concluding admonition from the Lord, which also is a perfect\nsafeguard to the membership of this Church: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Hearken, O ye elders of my church whom I have called, behold I give unto you a\ncommandment, that ye shall assemble yourselves together to agree upon my word;<br \/>\n\"And by the prayer of your faith ye shall receive my law, that ye may know how to govern\nmy church and have all things right before me.<br \/>\n\"He that receiveth my law and doeth it, the same is my disciple; and he that saith he receiveth\nit and doeth it not, the same is not my disciple, and shall be cast out from among you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13731\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13731)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13731)\">D&amp;C 41:2-3,5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, my brothers and sisters when assembled together, as today, it is to instruct and\nedify each other and thus learn how to act and how to direct the affairs of God's latter-day\nkingdom. May I encourage all of you to listen to and accept the teachings and counsel of your\nbrethren given in this general conference of the Church. How important it is for the Saints of\nthe kingdom to be guided aright, knowing that false spirits are abroad in the land to deceive,\nyes, even the very elect of God (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34979\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34979)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34979)\">Matt. 24:24<\/a><\/span>)\nif they are not careful in keeping the commandments and\nwalking in faithful obedience to God's laws.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you, my brothers and sisters, that you may walk in obedience to God's laws. This I\nhumbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
