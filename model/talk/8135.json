Monson. I want to witness to all of you of the strength and love President Monson had as he said to me, \u201cThis call comes from the Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-stand-all-amazed.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">I am overwhelmed and shaken to my very core to consider the import and significance of those words so tenderly spoken by our loving prophet. President Monson, President Eyring, President Uchtdorf, I love you and will serve the Lord and you with all of my heart, might, mind, and strength.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-stand-all-amazed.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">Oh, how I have loved President Boyd\u00a0K. Packer and Elders L.\u00a0Tom Perry and Richard\u00a0G. Scott. I dearly miss them. I am blessed to have been trained and taught at the feet of these dear Brethren. Not in the smallest part am I able to walk in their shoes, yet I am honored to stand tall on their shoulders and carry on in the Lord\u2019s ministry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-stand-all-amazed.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">When I think of those who have helped make me who I am, I think \ufb01rst of my sweet and selfless eternal companion, Melanie. Through the years, she has helped mold me like potter\u2019s clay into a more polished disciple of Jesus Christ. Her love and support, and that of our 5 children, their spouses, and our 24 grandchildren, sustain me. To my dear family, I love you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-stand-all-amazed.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">Like Nephi of old, I was born of goodly parents in the gospel and they of goodly parents back six generations. My earliest ancestors who joined the Church were from England and Denmark. These early pioneers gave their all to the gospel of Jesus Christ and leave a legacy for their posterity to follow. I am so grateful for a multigenerational Latter-day Saint family, and I know this is a worthy goal for all of us to strive for.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-stand-all-amazed.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">Many others have contributed to preparing my life for this new call. They include my childhood friends and family, early leaders, teachers, and lifelong mentors. I must include those from my early mission to the eastern states and our beloved missionaries from the New York New York North Mission. For the many who have in\ufb02uenced and shaped my life, I am most grateful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-stand-all-amazed.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">I have cherished serving with my Brethren of the Seventy. For 15 years I have been in one of the greatest quorums and loving brotherhoods of the Church. Thank you, my dear fellow servants. Now I look forward to belonging to a new quorum. President Russell\u00a0M. Nelson, my love is deep for you and each member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-stand-all-amazed.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">Sister Rasband and I have been blessed to visit members during\u00a0many assignments in congregations and missions around the world.

Jesus Christ looked past people\u2019s ethnicity, rank, and circumstances in order to teach them this profound truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-stand-all-amazed.p22\" class=\"\" id=\"p22\">I have been asked many times when I received my testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/i-stand-all-amazed.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">I can\u2019t remember not believing in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. I have loved Them since I learned of Them at the knees of my angel mother, reading scripture and gospel stories. That early belief has now grown into a knowledge and a witness of a loving Heavenly Father, who hears and answers our prayers.
