In 1947, television and computers were in their infancies. We had no satellite broadcasts or videotapes and no computer fraud.

The obscenity, nudity, and other forms of pornography that would have made us blush and turn away in shame in 1947 are now thrust at us openly in printed and audiovisual material. They are even paraded through our homes unless we are careful to keep them out. As a people, we are slipping further from our old moorings today because we are not following our prophets.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/patience-a-key-to-happiness.p14\" class=\"\">A certain amount of impatience may be useful to stimulate and motivate us to action. However, I believe that a lack of patience is a major cause of the difficulties and unhappiness in the world today. Too often, we are impatient with ourselves, with our family members and friends, and even with the Lord. We seem to demand what we want right now, regardless of whether we have earned it, whether it would be good for us, or whether it is right. Some seek immediate gratification or numbing of every impulse by turning to alcohol and drugs, while others seek instant material wealth by questionable investments or by dishonesty, with little or no regard for the consequences. Perhaps the practice of patience is more difficult, yet more necessary, now than at any previous time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>The Scriptures Teach Patience<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/patience-a-key-to-happiness.p16\" class=\"\">To the Latter-day Saints, the Lord gave patience as one of the divine attributes that qualifies a person for the ministry (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18543\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18543)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18543)\">D&amp;C 4:6<\/a><\/span>), he counseled them to be patient in their afflictions (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18579\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18579)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18579)\">D&amp;C 24:8<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18592\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18592)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18592)\">D&amp;C 31:9<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18615\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18615)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18615)\">D&amp;C 54:10<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18671\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18671)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18671)\">D&amp;C 98:23\u201324<\/a><\/span>), and he admonished them to make their decisions in patience (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18679\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18679)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18679)\">D&amp;C 107:30<\/a><\/span>).

Though absolutely unyielding in adherence to the truth, he exemplified patience repeatedly during his mortal ministry. He was patient with his disciples, including the Twelve, despite their lack of faith and their slowness to recognize and understand his divine mission. He was patient with the multitudes as they pressed about him, with the woman taken in sin, with those who sought his healing power, and with little children. Finally, he remained patient through the sufferings of his mock trials and his crucifixion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/patience-a-key-to-happiness.p19\" class=\"\">During the Apostle Paul\u2019s ministry of about thirty years, between his conversion and his martyrdom in Rome, he was flogged five times, beaten severely at least three times, imprisoned several times, shipwrecked three times, and stoned and left for dead on one occasion (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"3116\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3116)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3116)\">2 Cor. 11:23\u201327<\/a><\/span>).

Welker of the German-Austrian Mission, one of the outstanding mission presidents of the Church, needed to assign a missionary to labor in Salzburg, Austria, to solve a problem in the branch there. Eight new missionaries were soon to arrive in the mission. He prayed that one of them would have the proper visa and currency to labor in Austria. He continued to pray and waited two weeks for an answer. The night before the eight arrived, the Spirit of the Lord whispered to the president the name of the missionary who should be assigned to Salzburg. The one whose name he received was the one who had the proper credentials to go to Austria. I was that elder.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/patience-a-key-to-happiness.p25\" class=\"\">The president\u2019s patience not only helped solve a problem in the branch, but it also blessed me and our family in a way that I never could have foreseen. Shortly after I arrived in Salzburg, that part of the German-Austrian Mission was changed into the Swiss-Austrian Mission. Later, I was transferred to Zurich, Switzerland, where I met Brother Julius Billeter, a warm and friendly member who was a genealogist. He was acquainted with the genealogical records of my progenitors. He researched the names of 6,000 of my ancestors for whom temple work later was completed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Patience Today<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/patience-a-key-to-happiness.p27\" class=\"\">We should learn to be patient with ourselves. Recognizing our strengths and our weaknesses, we should strive to use good judgment in all of our choices and decisions, make good use of every opportunity, and do our best in every task we undertake. We should not be unduly discouraged nor in despair at any time when we are doing the best we can. Rather, we should be satisfied with our progress even though it may come slowly at times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/patience-a-key-to-happiness.p28\" class=\"\">We should be patient in developing and strengthening our testimonies. Rather than expecting immediate or spectacular manifestations, though they will come when needed, we should pray for a testimony, study the scriptures, follow the counsel of our prophet and other Church leaders, and live the principles of the gospel.

Don\u2019t expect perfection. Find agreeable ways to work out the differences that arise. Remember President David O. McKay\u2019s wise counsel regarding marriage: keep your eyes wide open before marriage and half closed afterward (see Conference Report, Apr. 1956, p. 9). Perhaps, on occasion, our wives could get into the car and honk the horn while we, as husbands, get the children ready.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/patience-a-key-to-happiness.p31\" class=\"\">Parents, be patient with your children. Read to your little children and help them with their schoolwork, even if you need to tell or show them the same thing many times. Elder Richard L.

Capitalize on their natural curiosity and help them develop a love for learning. Teach them the principles of the gospel in simple terms. Be patient with them if they disturb family home evening or family prayers.

If they seem to be out of touch on such vital issues as dating, clothing styles, modern music, and use of family cars, listen to them anyway. They have the experience that you lack. Very few, if any, of the challenges and temptations you face are new to them. If you think they know nothing about the vital issues I just mentioned, take a good look at their high school and college yearbooks.

Avoid rash or hurried financial decisions; such decisions require patience and study. Get-rich-quick schemes seldom work. Beware of debt.
