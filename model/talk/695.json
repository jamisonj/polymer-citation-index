Ivins, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1954, pp. 50-52<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy beloved brethren and sisters: My wife once asked Father, \"Do you ever get over being\nnervous when you speak to the conference?\" And he said, \"I haven't yet.\" And neither have I.\n<\/p><p>\nI seek an interest in your faith and prayers, that the testimony which I may endeavor to bear\nmay be directed by the Spirit of our heavenly Father.  We have listened to some wonderful\ntestimonies today.  I hope that mine may be in full harmony with what has been said.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many things for which I am truly grateful, especially the testimony that I have as to\nthe reality of the Sonship of the Christ, that he lives, that he has done a wonderful service for\nyou and me and that he has prepared the plan for us, which, if followed, will give us the joy\nfor which the Book of Mormon says that man exists\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3556\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3556)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3556)\">2 Ne. 2:25<\/a><\/span>), and will bring us back into the presence\nof God with the ultimate possibility, if we attain to perfection, of Godhood.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many things requisite to that.  President Richards referred to one of the most\nimportant of them today, and that is the family organization entered into with the approval\nand under the authority of the priesthood of God, sealed by a servant of God and under the\nholy spirit of promise.\n<\/p><p>\nIt should be our purpose, brethren and sisters, as we approach this situation, to do it in all\nseriousness, understanding its tremendous potentialities and responsibilities, with a\ndetermination in our hearts that we will do everything we possibly can to make it a success\nand to enjoy in that relationship the Spirit of God, our heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of my friends, one day, in talking to me, said, \"You know, Antoine, if I were God, I\nwould have done things differently,\" and I said, \"How?\" \"Well,\" he said, \"in the first place I\nwould have fixed it up so that whenever a man married a woman, he would have been\nhappy.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI prefer to think he was talking from observation rather than experience, but it is a fact that\nthroughout the world a tremendously large proportion&mdash;too large a proportion&mdash;of the\nmarriages that are entered into do not produce the desired happiness.  In order to guarantee it\nthere must be a proper foundation for it.  I have been trying today to think of some of the\nfoundation stones; and who should lay them, as well as when the laying of them should begin.\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems to me that the purpose of the family relationship is to furnish bodies to spirits who\nare waiting the opportunity to tabernacle in the flesh.  I have come to think that when we\nassume the obligation of offering such a tabernacle, we should be equipped, if possible, to\nproduce a perfect one, and to that end our lives must be well-nigh perfect as to chastity and\nmoral purpose.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe the foundation should be laid in the beginning by the parents who, when entering\ninto marriage, should give due consideration to their anticipated children. Those of you who\nare beginning now, and those of you who are in the process of rearing families, should bear\nthat in mind for it is incumbent upon you to lay the foundation stones for the happy marriages\nof your children, to teach them the responsibility of it, so that as they approach that age, an\nage when there are certain urges developing within the human body, that they should have a\nhigh moral and religious purpose and be able to dominate those impulses, bringing them\nunder absolute subjection, so that when the time comes, the contracting parties can enter into\nthe temple of God and make the promises that are made therein to each other, realizing that\nthey have a right to do it.  There is nothing that will tend to make a\nmarriage happier than faith in each other, and there is I think, that will produce greater faith\nthan the testimony of each to the other, of a pure previous life.\n<\/p><p>\nThe physical dangers from the nonobservance of the law of chastity can well be overcome,\nbut I have never yet found anybody who could say that the moral effects of its infringement\ncould be entirely overcome and forgotten.  It is true hat there is a law of repentance and\nforgiveness and all that, but how much better it is when we begin life in that capacity, if we\ndo not have to invoke that law for that particular offense.  I believe it is possible for fathers\nand mothers, if they set the example, and teach under the Spirit of God, to get close enough\nto their children to lay such a foundation.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter having laid the stone, then they must build upon it, and that building must be the\nreflection of a chaste, virtuous, honest, upright life on the part of the father and mother of the\nfamily. You know and I know that does not always exist, but it should always exist, when a\nfamily starts out.\n<\/p><p>\nChildren should be taught that there is a greater likelihood of success if the contracting parties\nhave community of interests.  It may not always be imperative, I presume, that they should\nbelong to the same church, but the chances are better if they do.  It may not always be\nnecessary that they have the same background, but the chances are better if they do, and the\nchances are always better if the do not rush into the union thoughtlessly, not understanding\neach other. Then they should be taught that there may be obstacles to surmount as they move\nalong together in married life; that victory over these obstacles is what develops strength and\npower and ability.  I do not know whether we would have been so much better off if He had\nmade it so there would never have been any sorrow come into a family organization because I\nthink that is one of the ways God has of testing us and mellowing us.  When we survive\nthem, when we can put our arms around each other in a mutual feeling of faith and of trust\nand reliance, then we develop from those obstacles.  That, brethren and sisters, I believe, is\nour duty to our children, to teach them so that when the enter into this relationship they will\nbe sweet and clean, with faith in God, realizing that the marriage they celebrate will not end\nwith this life, but that it is to be for all eternity, and, consequently, it should be properly done\nand done under the inspiration of the Spirit of God.  Then, I believe, it would always be safe.\n<\/p><p>\nBut after having gone that far, brethren and sisters, we are not always safe.  There are too\nmany cases where older people fail.  Many of the things which disrupt families are trivial in\nthe extreme, and many of them come about, just because people cannot bring themselves to\nacknowledge that the things they do they ought not to do and to try to make adjustments for\nthem with each other. If we could, under the inspiration of our heavenly Father, find a few of\nthe solutions as we grow older, it would be much easier for many of us.  The court records\ntell us that these things do happen.  They ought never to happen in a good Latter-day Saint\nfamily.\n<\/p><p>\nOur efforts should be to so live that we will have claim upon our heavenly Father for his\nSpirit to help us over these rough places, so that the example we set to our growing children,\nand to their children, when they come along, will be one above reproach. The family, we\nhave been told, is the foundation stone of our society.  It is not brought together just that we\nmay enjoy each other's association here.  As I have suggested, it has a higher, more spiritual\npurpose, and the relationships that are entered into in the family should always be directed by\nthe Spirit of God.  If that could be, we would always be happy in that relationship, and then\nwe would have a solidarity in our organization that would astound the world.\n<\/p><p>\nI do not want to say more today, but I plead, brethren and sisters, for an effort on our part to\nso instill in the hearts and minds of growing children, who are our responsibility, a desire to\nmake this the highest social relationship that there is, a grand, glorious religious privilege\nentered into with the approval of the priesthood of God, with a determination that nothing\nunder heaven shall ever disrupt it.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us in it, I pray, in the name of Jesus.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
