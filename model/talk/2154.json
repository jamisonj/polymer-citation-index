The obvious hazard is that when these elected leaders have been maligned and down-graded, the seeds of disrespect to authority and law and order are sown in the minds of youth, particularly, instead of respectful obedience to counsel and to the laws enacted by those whose integrity and honesty have been thus impugned.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-time-of-decision.p8\" class=\"\">The story, presumably authentic, is told that during the Civil War when the fortunes of the Union armies, under the command of General Grant, were going badly, some concerned ministers called on President Abraham Lincoln at the White House and forcefully urged the dismissal of Grant.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-time-of-decision.p9\" class=\"\">To these men he is alleged to have said: \u201cGentlemen, General Grant has under his command all that we hold dear in this nation.
