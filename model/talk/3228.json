May I say at the outset that what you will see and hear is the result of months of prayerful study and deliberation. This presentation about Church councils is <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> a new program, but it is a reemphasis of a principle based on the scriptures and on traditional Church government procedures. Some of you who live in the United States will recognize in this presentation nothing more than what is already being done at your interim meetings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p5\" class=\"\">Because this is such an important matter, I will stay with a written text, using visuals as needed. As I begin, however, I want you to know that this presentation has the wholehearted endorsement of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, the First Quorum of the Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric. We have no doubt that what we are presenting to you today will greatly facilitate communication and unity at various Church levels and help move the kingdom forward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p6\" class=\"\">Some background may be helpful so you can more completely understand the significance of these developments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p7\" class=\"\">Throughout the history of the Church, it has been a practice that essentially ecclesiastical matters be administered by the Quorum of the Twelve and that essentially temporal affairs be administered by the Presiding Bishopric. This practice continues to this day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p8\" class=\"\">You are all, of course, familiar with the traditional administrative channel of authority to the field from the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Presidency of the First Quorum of the Seventy, Area Supervisors, Regional Representatives, stake presidents, and bishops. This channel of authority remains unchanged.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p9\" class=\"\">More recently, because of the need to carefully manage temporal matters in the field, approval was given to have a Presiding Bishopric area supervisor in certain countries of the world. He has worked in close cooperation with the General Authority Area Supervisor and has reported his responsibilities on temporal matters to the Presiding Bishopric, who in turn report to the First Presidency.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p10\" class=\"\">The principle we desire to reemphasize was well expressed by President Stephen L Richards, first counselor to President David O.

In the spirit under which we labor, men can get together with seemingly divergent views and far different backgrounds, and under the operation of that spirit, by counseling together, they can arrive at an accord.\u201d (In Conference Report, Oct. 1953, p. 86.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p12\" class=\"\">The First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric have determined to organize council meetings at the general Church level, the area level, and the region level. These councils will be called the Church Coordinating Council (at the general level), area council, multiregion council (<span class=\"emphasis\">only<\/span> if needed), region council, and the presently existing stake and ward correlation councils.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p13\" class=\"\">We have felt that in order to be effective, these councils need to be <span class=\"emphasis\">comprehensive<\/span> in representing <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> Church programs so that there will be a <span class=\"emphasis\">correlating, coordinating, planning,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">resolving<\/span> body at each of these levels. These councils, properly organized and functioning, assure a unified approach to the management of ecclesiastical and temporal affairs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p14\" class=\"\">It has also been determined that the General Authority Area Supervisor\u2019s title will be changed to <span class=\"emphasis\">executive administrator,<\/span> and outside of the United States and Canada, the Presiding Bishopric area supervisor\u2019s title will be changed to <span class=\"emphasis\">director for temporal affairs.<\/span> These title changes take effect immediately. In the United States and Canada the Presiding Bishopric will appoint individuals either from Church headquarters or from the local area to represent and manage temporal activities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p15\" class=\"\">Now may I say a word to all who will participate in the administration of these councils at the area, region, and other local levels. The Twelve continue to be vitally interested in temporal matters; the Presiding Bishopric continue to be vitally concerned with ecclesiastical matters. To us it is one great program. This division of responsibility is intended for administrative convenience. All things are spiritual to the Lord (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"17169\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17169)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17169)\">D&amp;C 29:34<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p16\" class=\"\">I\u2019ll now speak briefly about each of these councils at the respective levels.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>First: The Church Coordinating Council<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p18\" class=\"\">This council is comprised of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p19\" class=\"\">The Presidents of the First Quorum of the Seventy will be invited to attend the meetings of this council and will also be invited to the General Welfare Services Committee.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p20\" class=\"\">The Church Coordinating Council will set policy, authorize exceptions to policy, authorize implementation, and resolve any difficulties which remain unresolved at the area council level.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p21\" class=\"\">Communications between the Church Coordinating Council and area administrations will proceed through the ecclesiastical and temporal lines.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p22\" class=\"\">The Church Coordinating Council will also set priorities (insofar as they desire to do so), so that area and region councils can function within guidelines. This will help us meet the urgent need to balance the distribution of available resources (both time and money) which are to be given to various Church programs and efforts. For example, suppose recommendations from the combined area councils of the Church show a need for 800 buildings during a given year, but the Church has only time and money resources for 600 buildings. The Church Coordinating Council would then determine where resources are needed most.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p23\" class=\"\">This council will also review and approve overall plans for ecclesiastical and temporal matters before policies are implemented.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Second: The Area Council<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p25\" class=\"\">The primary council in the field for correlating, coordinating, planning, and resolving problems is the <span class=\"emphasis\">area council.<\/span> This council will function under the direction of the executive administrator.

We, as priesthood holders, need to act in the manner which the Lord instructs in the revelation just quoted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/church-government-through-councils.p76\" class=\"\">Brethren and sisters, we want you to know that our whole interest has been to do what is best for the kingdom. Today we are taking a step which <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> for the good of the kingdom. May the Lord bless us in our efforts as we implement this system of priesthood councils so that we, under the operation of the Spirit, may have greater unity, accord, and effectiveness in building the Lord\u2019s kingdom, which I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
