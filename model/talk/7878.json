Those on the receiving end feel they can never please such leaders or parents and that they always fall short. Wise parents must weigh when children are ready to begin exercising their own agency in a particular area of their lives. But if parents hold on to <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> decision-making power and see it as their \u201cright,\u201d they severely limit the growth and development of their children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/only-upon-the-principles-of-righteousness.p13\" class=\"\">Our children are in our homes for a limited time. If we wait until they walk out the door to turn over to them the reins of their moral agency, we have waited too long. They will not suddenly develop the ability to make wise decisions if they have never been free to make any important decisions while in our homes. Such children often either rebel against this compulsion or are crippled by an inability to make any decisions on their own.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/only-upon-the-principles-of-righteousness.p14\" class=\"\">Wise parents prepare their children to get along without them.

Our daughter Mary was a standout soccer player growing up. One year her team made it to the championships and, wouldn\u2019t you know it, that game was to be played on a Sunday. As a young teen, Mary had had years of teaching that the Sabbath was a day of rest and spiritual regeneration, not recreation. But she still felt pressure from her coaches and teammates to play, as well as a desire not to let her team down.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/only-upon-the-principles-of-righteousness.p16\" class=\"\">She asked us what she should do. My wife and I could easily have made this decision for her. However, we decided after prayerful consideration that in this case our daughter was ready to take spiritual responsibility for her own decision. We read some scriptures with her and encouraged Mary to pray and think about it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/only-upon-the-principles-of-righteousness.p17\" class=\"\">After a few days she announced her decision. She would play the game on Sunday. Now what were we to do? After further discussion and receiving reassurance from the Spirit, we did as we had promised and permitted her to carry out her choice to play. After the game ended, Mary slowly walked over to her waiting mother. \u201cOh, Mom,\u201d she said, \u201cthat felt <span class=\"emphasis\">awful.<\/span> I never want to feel like that again. I\u2019m never playing another game on the Sabbath day.\u201d And she never did.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/only-upon-the-principles-of-righteousness.p18\" class=\"\">Mary had now internalized the principle of Sabbath keeping.
