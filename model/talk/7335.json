From my father, Joseph L. Wirthlin, I learned the values of hard work and compassion. He was bishop of our ward during the Great Depression. He possessed a genuine concern for those in distress. He reached out to those in need not because it was his duty but because it was his sincere desire.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p8\" class=\"\">He tirelessly cared for and blessed the lives of many who suffered. In my mind, he was an ideal bishop.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p9\" class=\"\">Those who knew my father knew how active he was. Someone once told me that he could do the work of three men. He rarely slowed down. In 1938 he was operating a successful business when he received a call from the President of the Church, Heber J. Grant.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p10\" class=\"\">President Grant told him they were reorganizing the Presiding Bishopric that day and wanted my father to serve as counselor to LeGrand Richards. This caught my father by surprise, and he asked if he could pray about it first.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p11\" class=\"\">President Grant said, \u201cBrother Wirthlin, there are only 30 minutes before the next session of conference, and I want to have some rest. What do you say?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p12\" class=\"\">Of course, my father said yes. He served 23 years, 9 of them as Presiding Bishop of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p13\" class=\"\">My father was 69 years old when he passed away. I happened to be with him when he suddenly collapsed. Soon after, he was gone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p14\" class=\"\">I often think about my father. I miss him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p15\" class=\"\">My mother, Madeline Bitner, was another great influence in my life. In her youth she was a fine athlete and a champion sprinter. She was always kind and loving, but her pace was exhausting. Often she would say, \u201cHurry up.\u201d And when she did, we picked up the pace. Perhaps that was one of the reasons I had quick acceleration when I played football.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p16\" class=\"\">My mother had great expectations for her children and expected the best from them. I can still remember her saying, \u201cDon\u2019t be a scrub. You must do better.\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Scrub<\/span> was her word for someone who was lazy and not living up to his potential.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p17\" class=\"\">My mother passed away when she was 87 years old, and I think about her often and miss her more than I can say.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p18\" class=\"\">My younger sister Judith was an author, composer, and educator. She loved many things, including the gospel, music, and archaeology. Judith\u2019s birthday was a few days before mine. Every year I would give her a crisp one-dollar bill as my birthday present to her. Three days later she would give me 50 cents as her birthday present to me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p19\" class=\"\">Judith passed away a few years ago. I miss her and think of her often.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p20\" class=\"\">And that brings me to my wife, Elisa. I remember the first time I met her. As a favor to a friend, I had gone to her home to pick up her sister, Frances. Elisa opened the door, and at least for me, it was love at first sight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p21\" class=\"\">I think she must have felt something too, for the first words I ever remember her saying were, \u201cI knew who you was.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p22\" class=\"\">Elisa was an English major.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p23\" class=\"\">To this day I still cherish those five words as some of the most beautiful in human language.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p24\" class=\"\">She loved to play tennis and had a lightning serve. I tried to play tennis with her, but I finally quit after coming to the realization that I couldn\u2019t hit what I couldn\u2019t see.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p25\" class=\"\">She was my strength and my joy. Because of her, I am a better man, husband, and father. We married, had eight children, and walked together through 65 years of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p26\" class=\"\">I owe more to my wife than I can possibly express. I don\u2019t know if there ever was a perfect marriage, but, from my perspective, I think ours was.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p27\" class=\"\">When President Hinckley spoke at Sister Wirthlin\u2019s funeral, he said that it is a devastating, consuming thing to lose someone you love. It gnaws at your soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p28\" class=\"\">He was right. As Elisa was my greatest joy, now her passing is my greatest sorrow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/sunday-will-come.p29\" class=\"\">In the lonely hours I have spent a great deal of time thinking about eternal things.
