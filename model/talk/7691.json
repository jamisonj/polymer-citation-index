The dying man\u2019s diseased heart was removed, and a healthy heart from a deceased donor was sewn in its place. Since then, over 75,000 heart transplants have been performed worldwide.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/preserving-the-hearts-mighty-change.p6\" class=\"\">In each heart transplant recipient, the patient\u2019s own body recognizes the new, lifesaving heart as \u201cforeign\u201d and begins to attack it. Left unchecked, the body\u2019s natural response will reject the new heart, and the recipient will die. Medicines can suppress this natural response, but the medications must be taken daily and with exactness. Furthermore, the condition of the new heart must be monitored. Occasional heart biopsies are performed wherein small pieces of heart tissue are removed and then examined under a microscope. When signs of rejection are found, medications are adjusted. If the rejection process is detected early enough, death can be averted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/preserving-the-hearts-mighty-change.p7\" class=\"\">Surprisingly, some patients become casual with their transplanted hearts. They skip their medicines here and there and obtain the needed follow-up less frequently than they should. They think that because they feel good, all is well. Too often this shortsighted attitude puts the patients at risk and shortens their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/preserving-the-hearts-mighty-change.p8\" class=\"\">A heart transplant can prolong life for years for people who would otherwise die from heart failure.

I worked every day, including Sundays. If I finished my Sunday work by 2:00 p.m., I could join my wife and daughter and drive to church for meetings that began at 2:30.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/preserving-the-hearts-mighty-change.p19\" class=\"\">One Sunday late in my first year of training, I knew that I would likely finish by 2:00. I realized, however, that if I stayed in the hospital just a little longer, my wife and daughter would depart without me. I could then walk home and take a needed nap. I regret to say that I did just that. I waited until 2:15, walked home slowly, and lay down on the couch, hoping to nap. But I could not fall asleep. I was disturbed and concerned. I had always loved going to church. I wondered why on this day the fire of testimony and the zeal that I had previously felt were missing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/preserving-the-hearts-mighty-change.p20\" class=\"\">I did not have to think long. Because of my schedule, I had become casual with my prayers and scripture study. I would get up one morning, say my prayers, and go to work. Often day blended into night and into day again before I would return home late the following evening. I would then be so tired that I would fall asleep before saying a prayer or reading the scriptures. The next morning the process began again. The problem was that I was not doing the basic things I needed to do to keep my mightily changed heart from turning to stone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/preserving-the-hearts-mighty-change.p21\" class=\"\">I got off the couch, got on my knees, and pleaded with God for forgiveness. I promised my Heavenly Father that I would change. The next day I brought a Book of Mormon to the hospital. On my to-do list that day, and every day since, were two items: praying at least morning and evening and reading in the scriptures. Sometimes midnight would come, and I would have to quickly find a private place to pray. Some days my scripture study was brief. I also promised Heavenly Father that I would always try to get to church, even if I missed part of the meeting. Over the course of a few weeks, the zeal returned and the fire of testimony burned fiercely again. I promised to never again fall into the spiritual death trap of being casual about these seemingly small actions and thereby jeopardizing things of an eternal nature, regardless of circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/preserving-the-hearts-mighty-change.p22\" class=\"\">To endure to the end, we need to be eager to please God and worship Him with fervor and passion. This means that we maintain faith in Jesus Christ by praying, studying the scriptures, partaking of the sacrament each week, and having the Holy Ghost as our constant companion. We need to actively help and serve others and share the gospel with them. We need to be perfectly upright and honest in all things, never compromising our covenants with God or our commitments to men, regardless of circumstances. In our homes we need to talk of, rejoice in, and preach of Christ so that our children\u2014and we ourselves\u2014will desire to apply the Atonement in our lives.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote10-04211_000_033\">10<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"119344\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 119344)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(119344)\">2\u00a0Nephi 25:26<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> We must identify temptations that easily beset us and put them out of reach\u2014way out of reach.
