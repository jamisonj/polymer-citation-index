I know that each of you listens with a very individual heart. Each of your needs at this particular moment are yours alone. Regardless of the formality of this setting, I have confidence that many of us will find\u2014either through music, the spoken word, or simply the comradery of friends around us\u2014answers and encouragement that will help us move forward. My only desire is to be a part of that process.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p5\" class=\"\">In this desire to somehow connect with your very individual lives, I began to think about something that every human being experiences\u2014something that we usually see as negative\u2014that we would avoid if we could. Sometimes we tell ourselves that no one else suffers from this as we do, or sometimes in an effort to control it, we tell ourselves that we simply do not experience it. That something is called <span class=\"emphasis\">fear<\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p6\" class=\"\">I have asked many young women what they are afraid of.

Even being alone with the bishop in his office can sometimes be frightening to me. I\u2019m also afraid that if anyone else knew what has happened to me, they wouldn\u2019t love me anymore.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t pass the big test that will allow me to keep going to school.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t ever get married.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m afraid that my parents won\u2019t be able to buy a uniform for me to go to school.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p16\" class=\"\">Scary stuff, isn\u2019t it?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p17\" class=\"\">As we read the scriptures, we find that fear has been a part of the history of individuals ever since the world began. I can even imagine that in the preexistent world, when the two plans were presented, some may have chosen Lucifer\u2019s plan because of fear\u2014the fear of leaving the presence of the Father with no guarantee that we would return. Lucifer perhaps played on those fears by assuring that with his plan, all would return.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p18\" class=\"\">I can imagine how frightening it must have been for Adam and Eve, who had lived with complete security\u2014friendly animals, plenty to eat, no opposition from nature\u2014to suddenly be cast into a world where survival itself must have been a constant fear.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p19\" class=\"\">Why is fear part of earth life?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p20\" class=\"\">Perhaps our Heavenly Father\u2019s greatest hope is that through our fears we may choose to turn to him. The uncertainties of earth life can help to remind each of us that we are dependent on him. But that reminder is not automatic. It involves our agency. We must <span class=\"emphasis\">choose<\/span> to take our fears to him, <span class=\"emphasis\">choose <\/span>to trust him, and <span class=\"emphasis\">choose<\/span> to allow him to direct us. We must make these choices when what we feel most inclined to do is to rely more and more on our own frantic and often distorted thinking.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p21\" class=\"\">As we try to live his commandments and pray to him, there are things he will direct us to do that will help calm our fears. These actions often require great courage and direction from the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost may help us to understand when and with whom we should share our fears. He will support us as we face our fears and try to do things that we have never done before.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p22\" class=\"\">May I offer two ideas that have been helpful to me when I have felt fearful? The first one came in the form of advice from Sister Michaelene Grassli, Primary general president. I served under her on the Primary General Board. We were on a training assignment together when a local leader began to describe in glowing details the auxiliary leaders who had come to that area the year before. As she told about the wonderful things they had done and expressed her hopes that we would do the same, a sick feeling began to settle in my stomach. That night after our hostess had left, I expressed to Sister Grassli my fears: I was afraid my performance would be far less than those who had come before, and I would certainly be a disappointment to everyone and probably an embarrassment to her and the Church. She said, \u201cI have had those same feelings, but it is comforting to me to know that I need only be concerned that what I do and say is acceptable and pleasing to the Lord.\u201d Her words brought such immediate peace to my mind that I have repeated them over and over to myself in countless situations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p23\" class=\"\">As women, we like very much to please others\u2014sometimes seeking approval so frantically that we become torn and confused by the conflicting needs of those around us. Concentrating on pleasing Heavenly Father brings peace, a respite from fear and anxiety. Think of that, young women, the next time you are asked to perform in church, or visit an inactive member of your class, or plan an activity: \u201cI only need to worry about pleasing the Lord.\u201d I think some of your fears will evaporate. The prophet David said: \u201cThe Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42050\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42050)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42050)\">Ps. 27:1<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p24\" class=\"\">The second idea that has been helpful to me was reportedly expressed by Vincent van Gogh, a famous painter. He said, \u201cI am always doing what I can\u2019t do yet in order to learn how to do it.\u201d A large part of conquering daily fear is simply doing things that we don\u2019t know how to do\u2014yet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p25\" class=\"\">Are there things you don\u2019t know how to do yet, that you are doing anyway? What about trying to make conversation with a young man at Mutual even though you feel very awkward? What about working hard in school even though it feels discouraging? I have often heard Sister Janette Hales, our Young Women general president, tell young people to work hard. She has said, \u201cWorking increases our abilities, and as you feel your abilities increase, you will feel more secure.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p26\" class=\"\">I\u2019ve just finished reading Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s biography. She was the wife of a president of the United States, but her influence went far beyond politics and position. Her life stands as a beacon to all women as someone who magnificently developed her own gifts through her service to others. This was a woman whose early life was ruled by fear and self-doubt. She described herself as an awkward adolescent, unattractively tall, with protruding teeth, dressed inappropriately, and so ill at ease with others her own age that parties and dances were dreaded occasions. How did she move from that to the kind of confidence that allowed her to contribute so widely?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p27\" class=\"\">She said, \u201cYou gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You must do the thing which you think you cannot do.\u201d (Karen McAuley, <span class=\"emphasis\">Eleanor Roosevelt,<\/span> New York: Chelsea House Publishers, 1987, p. 105.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p28\" class=\"\">As we concentrate on pleasing the Lord rather than others and continue to work hard, doing the things we don\u2019t know how to do yet, we will experience personal growth. We will increase our confidence in Heavenly Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. This faith assures us that in the end, we will not only survive but we will know great joy and happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p29\" class=\"\">After the death of Christ, Paul was converted and became a great missionary. He had a junior companion, whom he loved as a father loves his own son. When we pick up their story in 2 Timothy, they are separated in their service. Timothy is lonely and afraid\u2014being a missionary can be a fearful business. Paul is in prison in Rome. He writes Timothy a letter: \u201cTo Timothy, my dearly beloved son. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cI thank God \u2026 that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cGreatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5260\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5260)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5260)\">2 Tim. 1:2\u20134<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/fear.p32\" class=\"\">Isn\u2019t that a tender letter?
