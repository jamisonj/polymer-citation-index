This is no small blessing. It is a sacred responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>The Power of <span class=\"emphasis\">Why<\/span><\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p8\" class=\"\">Recently I have been thinking about two significant callings I received as a priesthood holder in the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p9\" class=\"\">The first of these callings came when I was a deacon. I attended with my family the branch of the Church in Frankfurt, Germany. We were blessed with many wonderful people in our little branch. One was our branch president, Brother Landschulz. I admired him a great deal, even though he always seemed to be rather serious, very official, and most of the time dressed in a dark suit. I remember as a young man joking with my friends how old-fashioned our branch president appeared.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p10\" class=\"\">It makes me laugh to think about this now because it is very possible that the youth of the Church today view me in a very similar way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p11\" class=\"\">One Sunday, President Landschulz asked if he could speak with me. My first thought was, \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d My mind raced over the many things I might have done that could have inspired this branch-president-to-deacon talk.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p12\" class=\"\">President Landschulz invited me into a small classroom\u2014our chapel did not have an office for the branch president\u2014and there he extended a call to me to serve as deacons quorum president.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cThis is an important position,\u201d he said, and then he took his time and described why. He explained what he and the Lord expected of me and how I could receive help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p14\" class=\"\">I don\u2019t remember much of what he said, but I do remember well how I felt. A sacred, divine Spirit filled my heart as he spoke. I could feel that this was the Savior\u2019s Church. And I felt that the calling he had extended was inspired by the Holy Ghost. I remember walking out of that tiny classroom feeling quite a bit taller than before.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p15\" class=\"\">It has been nearly 60 years since that day, and I still treasure these feelings of trust and love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p16\" class=\"\">As I was thinking back on this experience, I tried to remember just how many deacons there were in our branch at the time. To my best recollection, I believe there were two. However, this may be a huge exaggeration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p17\" class=\"\">But it really didn\u2019t matter whether there was one deacon or a dozen. I felt honored, and I wanted to serve to the best of my ability and not disappoint either my branch president or the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p18\" class=\"\">I realize now that the branch president could have merely gone through the motions when he called me to this position. He could have simply told me in the hallway or during our priesthood meeting that I was the new deacons quorum president.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p19\" class=\"\">Instead, he spent time with me and helped me understand not only the <span class=\"emphasis\">what<\/span> of my assignment and new responsibility but, much more important, the <span class=\"emphasis\">why.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p20\" class=\"\">That is something I will never forget.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p21\" class=\"\">The point of this story is not merely to describe how to extend callings in the Church (although this was a wonderful lesson on the proper way to do it). It is an example to me of the motivating power of priesthood leadership that awakens the spirit and inspires action.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p22\" class=\"\">We need to be constantly reminded of the eternal reasons behind the things we are commanded to do. The basic gospel principles need to be part of our life\u2019s fabric, even if it means learning them over and over again. That doesn\u2019t mean that this process should be rote or boring. Rather, when we teach the foundational principles in our homes or in church, let the flame of enthusiasm for the gospel and the fire of testimony bring light, warmth, and joy to the hearts of those we teach.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p23\" class=\"\">From the newest ordained deacon to the most senior high priest, we all have lists of <span class=\"emphasis\">what<\/span> we could and should do in our priesthood responsibilities. The <span class=\"emphasis\">what<\/span> is important in our work, and we need to attend to it. But it is in the <span class=\"emphasis\">why<\/span> of priesthood service that we discover the fire, passion, and power of the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p24\" class=\"\">The <span class=\"emphasis\">what<\/span> of priesthood service teaches us what to do.

We had moved back to Frankfurt, Germany, and I had just received a promotion at work that would require a great deal of my time and attention. During this busy season of my life, Elder Joseph\u00a0B. Wirthlin extended a call to me to serve as stake president.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p28\" class=\"\">During my interview with him, many thoughts raced through my mind, not the least of which was the unsettling worry that I might not have the time this calling would require. Although I felt humbled and honored by the call, I briefly wondered if I could accept it. But it was only a fleeting thought because I knew that Elder Wirthlin was called of God and that he was doing the Lord\u2019s work. What could I do but accept?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p29\" class=\"\">There are times when we have to step into the darkness in faith, confident that God will place solid ground beneath our feet once we do. And so I accepted gladly, knowing that God would provide.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p30\" class=\"\">In the early days of this assignment, we were privileged as a stake to receive training from some of the greatest teachers and leaders in the Church\u2014men like Elder Russell\u00a0M. Nelson and President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson came to our area. Their teaching was like the dew from heaven and an inspiration for us. I still have the notes I took during these training sessions. These Brethren gave us the <span class=\"emphasis\">vision<\/span> of what it means to establish the kingdom of God by building personal testimonies and strengthening families. They helped us see how to apply gospel truth and principles to our specific circumstances and for our specific time. To put it another way, inspired leaders helped us to see the <span class=\"emphasis\">why<\/span> of the gospel, and then we had to roll up our sleeves and go to work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p31\" class=\"\">It wasn\u2019t long before we realized that there were a lot of things a stake presidency could do\u2014so many, in fact, that if we didn\u2019t set inspired priorities, we might miss doing the important ones. Competing priorities began to arise, deflecting our focus from the vision shared by the Brethren. There were many \u201cgood\u201d things to do, but not all of them mattered most.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p32\" class=\"\">We learned an important lesson: the fact that something is good is not always reason enough to require our time and resources. Our activities, initiatives, and plans should be inspired by and grounded upon the <span class=\"emphasis\">why<\/span> of our priesthood service and not by any flashy trend or interest of the moment. Otherwise, they can distract our efforts, dilute our energy, and get us caught up in our own hobbies, spiritual or temporal, that are not at the center of discipleship.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-why-of-priesthood-service.p33\" class=\"\">Brethren, we all know that it takes self-discipline to remain focused on the matters that have the greatest power to increase our love for God and fellowman, invigorate marriages, strengthen families, and build the kingdom of God on earth.
