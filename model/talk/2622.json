It does not deny the reality of death, but it offers us an assurance that God has preserved life beyond the grave.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-message-of-easter.p6\" class=\"\">It is interesting to note, however, that the restored gospel as taught by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encompasses the belief of a literal resurrection, which is radically different from the concept taught by most Christian churches and other faiths.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-message-of-easter.p7\" class=\"\">President Grant often told how several hundred ministers were asked, \u201cDo you believe that after you die you will live again as a conscious entity, knowing and being known as you are?\u201d No doubt all of these ministers had conducted Easter services, but in answering, none actually believed in a literal resurrection as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-message-of-easter.p8\" class=\"\">It seems to be the nature of mankind not to accept things they cannot explain, and no man can explain the resurrection. But neither can man explain how life came to be; but who denies that we live? If we gave up everything we cannot explain, we would have to give up life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-message-of-easter.p9\" class=\"\">But He who has given us life has assured us of life hereafter.
