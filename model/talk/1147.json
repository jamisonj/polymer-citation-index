McKay<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">David O. McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1961, pp. 130-132<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI think it was Thomas Carlyle who said that one of the most Godlike of virtues is the\nappreciation of human worth as shown by the hearts of men. I am sure, at the conclusion of\nthis great, inspirational conference, that you would have me express your appreciation of the\nservices rendered by all who have contributed to the success and spirituality of our four days'\nconference.\n<\/p><p>\nFirst, to the General Authorities, we express deep appreciation for the inspirational messages\nyou have given to us, and in that expression we express gratitude to our Father in heaven for\nhaving inspired each one who has spoken.\n<\/p><p>\nTo the public press, you reporters and your fair and accurate reports throughout the sessions\nof the conference, your devotion and your attendance at all the services during the day or\nevening sessions.\n<\/p><p>\nWe appreciate the cooperation of the city officials and commend especially the traffic\nofficers for handling so carefully and ably the increased traffic; the fire department and the\nRed Cross, who have been on hand to render assistance and service whenever and wherever\ntheir service would be needed.\n<\/p><p>\nTo the Tabernacle ushers, who have rendered a service quietly and efficiently in seating the\ngreat audiences of these conference sessions. I noticed one in the gallery and his courtesy in\nthe way he handled one who rendered a little disturbance.\n<\/p><p>\nWe mention especially the radio and television officers and officials&mdash;twenty-seven television\nand eighteen radio stations throughout our own city and the nation have carried the sessions\nof this conference. This has been the means of permitting untold thousands to hear the\nproceedings of the 131st conference of this Church.\n<\/p><p>\nFriday we had a meeting never held before in the history of the Church. It was a meeting of\nofficers of stakes beyond the boundaries of our country. Attending this meeting were stake\npresidencies from Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, and Holland who met and received\ninstructions from members of the Council of the Twelve, officers of the Bishopric, and\nmembers of auxiliary organizations. That is an epoch-making event in our history!\n<\/p><p>\nWe appreciate those who furnished the singing throughout this entire conference. I know your\nhearts respond most heartily to expressions of gratitude for the inspiration we have received\never since the opening session when the Primary Teachers' Chorus from nineteen stakes of\nUtah County rendered such inspirational singing. They filled the seats usually occupied by the\nTabernacle Choir members, and also seats on each side of the gallery. I think you will always\nremember that solo by thirteen-year-old Ronnie Clark. There was some question about having\nhim sing, but his voice rang out in such clearness that not only those in this Tabernacle were\nthrilled, but also thousands listening on the radio.\n<\/p><p>\nTo the combined choirs of the Logan Institute of Religion and the Utah State University we\nextend our thanks for their singing on Saturday morning and afternoon. We never have a\ngroup of young people filling these choir seats without being thrilled, not only by their\nsinging, but also by their presence and their attitude towards religious matters.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Men's Chorus of the Tabernacle Choir Saturday night&mdash;what a thrill they gave us, and\nalways do, at that inspirational gathering! We were also thrilled with the tenor solo by Brother\nDennis Clancy of Dundee, Scotland, singing, \"I Know That My Redeemer Lives.\"\n<\/p><p>\nToday, I think we have never heard the \"Hallelujah Chorus\" sung as you heard the Tabernacle\nChoir render that beautiful and inspiring oratorio at the conclusion of this morning's session.\nWe thank the leaders and officers of the choir and especially you men and women who\ndevote so much of your time and give so freely of your means to inspire not only the entire\nChurch, but also now the whole world.\n<\/p><p>\nWe acknowledge the flowers&mdash;the daffodils from Puyallup Valley Daffodil Company, the\ncalla lilies from the high priests' quorum of the Oakland-Berkeley Stake, the\nten thousand sweet peas from the Mesa (Arizona) Eleventh Ward and all others who have\ncontributed in any way to the success and inspiration of a great and memorable conference.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to say just a word at the conclusion in expressing appreciation of the worth of\nman, of the service of the members of the Church in building chapels, and in other responses\nto the calls that are made of you. I marvel, and I think all members of the Church marvel, as\nwell as those outside of the Church, at what the members are doing by way of improving\nplaces of worship and of supplying the need for public worship.\n<\/p><p>\nServices will be held one day for the breaking of the ground&mdash;a simple matter&mdash;and one\nyear or eighteen months later, a building will be dedicated, fifty percent of the cost of which\nwas borne by the people themselves out of their meager earnings, and the principal part of\nthat activity and that contribution came from our sisters who labored diligently and\nunceasingly to gather the necessary means so that the ward will meet its share of the expenses\nof the erection of the house of worship. God bless our sisters, and I say that with all my\nheart.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, brethren and sisters, in summary, let me emphasize that <i>the noblest aim in life is to\nstrive to live to make other lives better and happier. The most worthy calling in life is that in\nwhich man can serve best his fellow man.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nBrowning touches that great theme in his poem, \"Paracelsus.\" You students, remember how\nParacelsus started out to gain knowledge for himself, even though it took him away from the\npeople themselves. His friend Festus warned him not to withdraw from the people, but\nParacelsus concluded that he would gain learning at the expense of anybody or anything, and\nwhen Festus cautioned him, he said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Festus, are there not two experiences in the life of a diver,<br \/>\n     One&mdash;when, a beggar, he prepares to plunge,<br \/>\n     One&mdash;when, a prince, he rises with his pearl?<br \/>\n     Festus, I plunge.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd his friend standing by said: \"We await you when you rise.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYears later, after Paracelsus had failed in his efforts to find the soul satisfaction he sought,\nFestus found him in a conjurer's house, and Browning puts into his mouth the following:\n\"There is an answer to the passionate longings of the human heart for fulness, and I knew it,\nand the answer is this: Live in all things outside yourself by love, and you will have joy. That\nis the life of God; it ought to be our life. In Him it is accomplished and perfect, but in all\ncreated things, it is a lesson learned slowly through difficulty.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSuch is the divine message given to the Prophet Joseph Smith in these words: \"Remember the\nworth of souls is great in the sight of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13961\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13961)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13961)\">D&amp;C 18:10<\/a><\/span>). Such is the philosophy expressed\nby the Redeemer in the seemingly paradoxical statement, \"Whosoever will lose his life for my\nsake shall find it\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35123\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35123)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35123)\">Matt. 16:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe meaning of this becomes clear in the light of another passage which says: \"Inasmuch as\nye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35139\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35139)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35139)\">Matt. 25:40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo no other group of men in all the world is given a better opportunity to engage in the\nnoblest calling in life than that which is afforded the elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints. To establish salvation and peace to the extent of their individual efforts,\ntheir lives are dedicated. To make the world a better or a safer or a fitter place for man, their\ntalents and means are consecrated.\n<\/p><p>\nJust to be associated with you, with men striving toward such an aim, is joy; and to assist you\nin this quest, an inspiration. Unselfishly you are trying to serve your fellow men in love. You\nare true followers of the Master for to those who have the Christian faith, the most sublime of\nits teachings, and to him who penetrates its deepest sense, the most human of all is this: To\nsave mankind, God came to dwell among us in the form of man and was\nwilling to make himself known by this simple though glorious principle, <i>Love.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nThe animal world is filled with selfishness, each thing seeking its own life, its own\nperpetuation. But Christ lived for love. \". . . love the Lord thy God with all thy might, mind,\nand strength, and thy neighbour as thyself\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33142\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33142)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33142)\">Mark 12:30-31<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless the elders and our sisters, who, if not with perfect love, at least with a desire to\nbring joy and peace to others, are engaged in the noblest calling of life. Worthy servants of\nChrist you are! Teachers, followers of the true Teacher, the great Exemplar of all, our\nRedeemer, our Lord. There is none greater than this noble work, none more righteous. Yours\nis the joy promised by the Savior, who said: \"And if it so be that you should labor all your\ndays in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great\nshall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!\n<\/p><p>\n\"And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the\nkingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13963\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13963)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13963)\">D&amp;C 18:15-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat is the word of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nGod sanctify this wonderful conference to the good of all who have listened in, and through\nyou who are present, your households and your young boys and girls who have not heard, but\nwho will feel your influence in your own homes.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the homes of the Church everywhere be better because of this conference than they have\nbeen in the past and be an example to the whole world, a great majority of whom during the\nlast forty years have had their minds poisoned by a false ideology that rejects the existence of\nGod the Father, refuses to acknowledge the divinity of his Son Jesus Christ, and would\ndestroy the home life, the very foundation of our future by taking the children and making\nthem members of the state instead of leaving them with their mothers and fathers.\n<\/p><p>\nWith all the power that we possess, we bless you, members of the Church of Jesus Christ.\nMay the power and the inspiration that have characterized this great conference, including last\nnight's great priesthood meeting, go to every corner of the earth where there is a branch or\nwhere a family lives, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
