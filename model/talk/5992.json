The biggest test for the Church will come with the advent of television and radio, which tend to keep people away from the Church.\u201d He then proceeded to relate what I\u2019ve called the \u201chot coals\u201d story. He described a warm fireplace where the pieces of wood had burned brightly, with the embers still glowing and giving off heat. He then observed that by taking in hand brass tongs, he could remove one of the hot embers. That ember would then slowly pale in light and turn black. No longer would it glow. No longer would it warm. He then pointed out that by returning the black, cold ember to the bed of living coals, the dark ember would begin to glow and brighten and warm. He concluded, \u201cPeople are somewhat like the coals of a fire. Should they absent themselves from the warmth and spirit of the active church membership, they will not contribute to the whole, but in their isolation will be changed. As with the embers removed from the heat of the fire, as they distance themselves from the intensity of the spirit generated by the active membership, they will lose that warmth and spirit.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/home-teaching-a-divine-service.p48\" class=\"\">The reverend closed his comments by observing, \u201cPeople are more important than the embers of a fire.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/home-teaching-a-divine-service.p49\" class=\"\">As years come and then go and life\u2019s challenges become more difficult, the visits of home teachers to those who have absented themselves from Church activity can be the key which will eventually open the doors to their return.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/home-teaching-a-divine-service.p50\" class=\"\">With this thought in mind, can we brethren not reach out to those for whom we are responsible and bring them to the table of the Lord to feast on His word and to enjoy the companionship of His Spirit, and be \u201cno more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God\u201d?<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-97911_000_021\">7<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22079\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22079)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22079)\">Eph. 2:19<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/home-teaching-a-divine-service.p51\" class=\"\">President Ezra Taft Benson said that home teaching is \u201cpriesthood compassionate service.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-97911_000_021\">8<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Ezra Taft Benson, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson<\/span> (1988), 225.]<\/span><\/sup> Not long ago I received a touching letter from Sister Mori Farmer.
