The lesson I learned as I watched the mile run was most impressive. I know I shall never forget it. About a dozen young men had qualified to represent their schools. The starting gun was fired, and these young men who had trained so long and so hard took off. Four fellows, closely bunched together, took the early lead. Suddenly the runner in second place spiked the first runner\u2019s foot with his shoe. As the leader was about to make the next stride forward, he found that he was without a shoe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/stalwart-and-brave-we-stand.p5\" class=\"\">As I noticed this, I wondered what the leader would do because of what his competitor had unintentionally done to him. It seemed to me he had a number of choices. He could take a few extra quick sprints and catch up to the fellow who had put him out of first position, double up his fist, and hit him to get even. He could run over to the coach and say, \u201cThis is what you get\u2014I have trained all my life for this big day, and now look what\u2019s happened!\u201d He could run off into the stands and say to his mother, father, or girlfriend, \u201cIsn\u2019t this horrible?\u201d Or he could have sat down on the track and cried. But to my pleasure, he did none of these things. He just kept running.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/stalwart-and-brave-we-stand.p6\" class=\"\">This was halfway around the first lap, and I thought to myself, \u201cGood for him; he\u2019ll finish this first lap of the four and retire gracefully.\u201d But after he had completed the first lap, he just kept running. He completed the second lap, then the third lap\u2014and every time he took a stride, cinders were coming up through his stocking, hurting his foot. They ran on cinder tracks in those days. But he didn\u2019t quit. He just kept running.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/stalwart-and-brave-we-stand.p7\" class=\"\">I thought, \u201cWhat an outstanding display of courage and self-discipline! What parents! What a coach! What leaders who have affected his life enough so that in a situation like this he would not stop running!\u201d He finished the job he had to do. He did not place first, but he was a real winner. When I walked over to him at the completion of the race and congratulated him on his courageous performance, he was composed and in complete control. He was able to carry on when it would have been much easier to quit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/stalwart-and-brave-we-stand.p8\" class=\"\">Just before our esteemed, honored Apostle and special friend of Aaronic Priesthood and their leaders worldwide, Elder Bruce R. McConkie, passed away nearly four and one-half years ago, with his sweetheart and eternal companion, Amelia, at his bedside, some very significant words were shared. As Sister McConkie held his hand during his final earthly minutes, she asked, \u201cBruce, do you have a message for me?\u201d Though weak and expiring, he responded in a firm voice his last words, \u201cCarry on.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/stalwart-and-brave-we-stand.p9\" class=\"\">Here was one of God\u2019s choicest servants, who had studied, pondered, and written as extensively on the life and mission of Jesus Christ as anyone else in his time, using these two powerful words for direction and encouragement.

As a group of Primary children stood before the congregation and sang \u201cI Am a Child of God,\u201d I noticed three young Primary members on the front row singing but saying nothing vocally. They were deaf; they sang with their hands. No one heard them audibly, but we received their message. They touched my spirit deeply, and it was my privilege to tell them in front of the members of that stake that our Heavenly Father heard them. Even though vocally they had said nothing, they transmitted a memorable message. In moving silence they taught of the spirit, they taught of the mind, and they taught of the heart. They had not given up singing just because they had no voice. They had been taught to carry on.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/stalwart-and-brave-we-stand.p13\" class=\"\">Let me now share with you the text of the song \u201cCarry On.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Firm as the mountains around us,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Stalwart and brave we stand<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">On the rock our fathers planted<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">For us in this goodly land\u2014<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">The rock of honor and virtue,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Of faith in the living God.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">They raised his banner triumphant\u2014<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Over the desert sod.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And we hear the desert singing:<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Carry on, carry on, carry on!<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Hills and vales and mountains ringing:<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Carry on, carry on, carry on!<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Holding aloft our colors,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">We march in the glorious dawn.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">O youth of the noble birthright,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Carry on, carry on, carry on!<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">We\u2019ll build on the rock they planted<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">A palace to the King.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Into its shining corridors,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Our songs of praise we\u2019ll bring,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">For the heritage they left us,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Not of gold or of worldly wealth,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">But a blessing everlasting<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Of love and joy and health.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And we hear the desert singing:<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Carry on, carry on, carry on!<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Hills and vales and mountains ringing:<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Carry on, carry on, carry on!<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Holding aloft our colors,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">We march in the glorious dawn.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">O youth of the noble birthright,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Carry on, carry on, carry on!<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/stalwart-and-brave-we-stand.p46\" class=\"\">(<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 255.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/stalwart-and-brave-we-stand.p47\" class=\"\">Fifty-nine years ago, when this beautiful number, \u201cCarry On,\u201d was first shared with the Church in general, to say that it was timely is an understatement.

I had the opportunity of meeting him in Wellington, New Zealand. Later on in the week someone said to me, \u201cWould you like to see where Peter Snell does his training and his running?\u201d I answered yes. I was shocked when I was taken down to the beach\u2014not to a track, but to the beach. I asked, \u201cWhere does he run?\u201d My friends said, \u201cHe runs out close to the water where the sand comes up over his feet. There it is difficult to pull his feet out of the sand after each stride.\u201d I had an idea why, but I said to my friends, \u201cWhy does he run there?\u201d They answered, \u201cWhen he gets on a track in competition, he feels like he\u2019s floating because he doesn\u2019t have to pull his feet up out of the wet sand.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/stalwart-and-brave-we-stand.p53\" class=\"\">In my mind I could see him running on that difficult track.

When I looked for a track again, they said, \u201cNo, he runs up the steep hills. Then, when he is on the level at track meets, it is pretty easy to run.\u201d That is why he breaks records, and that is why I remember his example.
