At the heart of the interview will be a discussion of what seems to be a lifetime of memorable experiences and key lessons that have been gained in just 18 to 24 months.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p6\" class=\"\">While many of these experiences and lessons may be common to missionary service, each mission is unique, with challenges and opportunities that stretch and test us according to our particular needs and personalities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p7\" class=\"\">Long before leaving our earthly home to serve a full-time mission, we left heavenly parents to fulfill our mortal mission. We have a Father in Heaven, who knows us\u2014our strengths and weaknesses, our abilities and potential. He knows which mission president and companions and which members and investigators we need in order to become the missionary, the husband and father, and the priesthood holder we are capable of becoming.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p8\" class=\"\">Prophets, seers, and revelators assign missionaries under the direction and influence of the Holy Ghost. Inspired mission presidents direct transfers every six weeks and quickly learn that the Lord knows exactly where He wants each missionary to serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p9\" class=\"\">A few years ago, Elder Javier Misiego, from Madrid, Spain, was serving a full-time mission in Arizona. At that time, his mission call to the United States appeared somewhat unusual, as most young men from Spain were being called to serve in their own country.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p10\" class=\"\">At the conclusion of a stake fireside, where he and his companion had been invited to participate, Elder Misiego was approached by a less-active member of the Church who had been brought by a friend. It was the first time this man had been inside a chapel in years. Elder Misiego was asked if he might know a Jos\u00e9 Misiego in Madrid. When Elder Misiego responded that his father\u2019s name was Jos\u00e9 Misiego, the man excitedly asked a few more questions to confirm that this was <span class=\"emphasis\">the<\/span> Jos\u00e9 Misiego. When it was determined that they were speaking about the same man, this less-active member began to weep. \u201cYour father was the only person I baptized during my entire mission,\u201d he explained and described how his mission had been, in his mind, a failure. He attributed his years of inactivity to some feelings of inadequacy and concern, believing that he had somehow let the Lord down.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p11\" class=\"\">Elder Misiego then described what this supposed failure of a missionary meant to his family. He told him that his father, baptized as a young single adult, had married in the temple, that Elder Misiego was the fourth of six children, that all three boys and a sister had served full-time missions, that all were active in the Church, and that all who were married had been sealed in the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p12\" class=\"\">The less-active returned missionary began to sob. Through his efforts, he now learned, scores of lives had been blessed, and the Lord had sent an elder from Madrid, Spain, all the way to a fireside in Arizona to let him know that he had not been a failure. The Lord knows where He wants each missionary to serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p13\" class=\"\">In whatever manner the Lord may choose to bless us during the course of a mission, blessings of missionary service are not designed to end when we are released by our stake president. Your mission is a training ground for life. The experiences, lessons, and testimony obtained through faithful service are meant to provide a gospel-centered foundation that will last throughout mortality and into the eternities. However, for the blessings to continue after the mission, there are conditions that must be met. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read, \u201cFor all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122498\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122498)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122498)\">D&amp;C 132:5<\/a><\/span>).

Moses and his people, according to the promise of the Lord, were protected.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p17\" class=\"\">The blood used by the Israelites, symbolic of the Savior\u2019s future Atonement, was a product of the sacrifice they had offered. Nevertheless, the sacrifice and the blood alone would not have been sufficient to obtain the promised blessing. <span class=\"emphasis\">Without the application of the blood to the door posts, the sacrifice would have been in vain.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p18\" class=\"\">President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson has taught: \u201cMissionary work is difficult. It taxes one\u2019s energies, it strains one\u2019s capacity, it demands one\u2019s best effort. \u2026 No other labor requires longer hours or greater devotion or such sacrifice and fervent prayer\u201d (\u201cThat All May Hear,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1995, 49).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p19\" class=\"\">As a result of that sacrifice, we return from our missions with our own gifts: The gift of faith. The gift of testimony. The gift of understanding the role of the Spirit. The gift of daily gospel study. The gift of having served our Savior. Gifts carefully packaged in worn scriptures, tattered copies of <span class=\"emphasis\">Preach My Gospel,<\/span> missionary journals, and grateful hearts. However, as with the children of Israel, the ongoing blessings associated with missionary service require application after the sacrifice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p20\" class=\"\">A few years ago, while Sister Waddell and I presided over the Spain Barcelona Mission, I would extend one last assignment to each missionary during their final interview. As they returned home, they were asked to immediately take time to consider the lessons and gifts provided to them by a generous Father in Heaven. They were asked to prayerfully list and consider how to best apply those lessons in post-mission life\u2014lessons that would impact every facet of their lives: education and career choice, marriage and children, future Church service, and most important, who they would continue to become and their continued development as disciples of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p21\" class=\"\">There is no returned missionary for whom it is too late to consider the lessons obtained through faithful service and to apply them more diligently. As we do so, we will feel the influence of the Spirit more fully in our lives, our families will be strengthened, and we will draw closer to our Savior and Father in Heaven. In a previous general conference, Elder L.\u00a0Tom Perry extended this invitation: \u201cI call on you returned missionaries to rededicate yourselves, to become reinfused with the desire and spirit of missionary service. I call on you to look the part, to be the part, and to act the part of a servant of our Father in Heaven. \u2026 I want to promise you there are great blessings in store for you if you continue to press forward with the zeal you once possessed as a full-time missionary\u201d (\u201cThe Returned Missionary,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Jan. 2002, 88, 89; <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 2001, 77).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p22\" class=\"\">Now, to the young men who have yet to serve a full-time mission, I share President Monson\u2019s counsel from last October: \u201cI repeat what prophets have long taught\u2014that every worthy, able young man should prepare to serve a mission. Missionary service is a priesthood duty\u2014an obligation the Lord expects of us who have been given so very much\u201d (\u201cAs We Meet Together Again,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 2010, 5\u20136).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p23\" class=\"\">Just as with missionaries past and present, the Lord knows you and has a mission experience prepared for you. He knows your mission president and his wonderful wife, who will love you as their own children and who will seek inspiration and direction on your behalf. He knows each of your companions and what you will learn from them. He knows each area in which you will labor, the members you will meet, the people you will teach, and the lives you will impact for eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-opportunity-of-a-lifetime.p24\" class=\"\">Through your devoted service and willing sacrifice, your mission will become holy ground to you.
