It features standards from the writings and teachings of Church leaders and from scripture, adherence to which will bring the blessings of our Heavenly Father and the guidance of His Son to each of us.

Listen to this letter from my mother: \u2018Son, we so much enjoy your letters. We\u2019re proud of you, our missionary. Guess what? Dad has been ordained a priest. He\u2019s preparing to baptize me. I\u2019m meeting with the missionaries; and one year from now we want to come to California as you complete your mission, for we, with you, would like to become a forever family by entering the temple of the Lord.\u2019\u201d This young missionary asked, \u201cBrother Monson, does Heavenly Father always answer prayers and fulfill Apostles\u2019 promises?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/preparation-brings-blessings.p44\" class=\"\">I replied, \u201cWhen one has faith as you have demonstrated, our Heavenly Father hears such prayers and answers in His own way.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/preparation-brings-blessings.p45\" class=\"\">Clean hands, a pure heart, and a willing mind had touched heaven.
