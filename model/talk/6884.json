His lungs were not fully developed because of his premature birth, and he desperately fought for each breath of air. He was so small but with so much will to live. As young and inexperienced parents, my courageous and ever faithful wife, Jan, and I prayed that the Lord\u2019s hand would reach out and somehow help our baby boy continue to breathe. As I put my trembling hand through the small opening into the isolette, I felt so inadequate and powerless. I took hold of the tiny but perfect hand of our newborn son, and there was a powerful spiritual connection never to be forgotten. Two fingers from each of my hands covered his tiny head as I administered to him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-lord-thy-god-will-hold-thy-hand.p12\" class=\"\">Our desire for him was pure, but we knew that his earthly experience rested in the Lord\u2019s hands and not in ours or in the medical team who cared for him. I then humbly realized that my quivering hands held power and authority well beyond my own. My fingers on his head symbolized the placing of God\u2019s hands and power upon our son. Following that blessing, in a moment of emotional peace, my eternal companion and I looked at each other across the isolette, feeling the spirit of renewed hope and comfort born of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in the personal effect of His Atonement. It was a powerful witness of His love for an infant son who had just left His presence. We were then better prepared to accept His will for our son. We truly felt we had placed our hands in the hands of the Savior. It was as if the Savior\u2019s own hands provided the critical respiratory aid, allowing our son to breathe and gain sustenance. With each breath and with each incremental bit of progress, we expressed prayerful thanks. Today, our healthy son and his indebted parents continue to be so grateful for the Savior\u2019s willing hands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-lord-thy-god-will-hold-thy-hand.p13\" class=\"\">Among the supernal promises of coming forth in the morning of the First Resurrection and inheriting \u201cthrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers\u201d are the additional promises of \u201call heights and depths\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11669\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11669)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11669)\">D&amp;C 132:19<\/a><\/span>).
