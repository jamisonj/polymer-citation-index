In those days the most electrifying thing that the world had experienced in\nyears was so close to them that they no doubt were still startled by it&mdash;the resurrection the\nactual, glorified resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord. We are going to celebrate it now, but it\nwas a new thought in that day, that it could be possible. It became a reality, and it was the\nthing that was passing from believer to believer, publicly and in private conversation. The\nresurrection of Jesus Christ verified the statement that he was and is the Son of God, and that\nmust have been the theme of every devout Christian of that day, just as it must be today. Of\ncourse, they would amplify it, after bearing testimony that Christ had risen, that he was the\nSon of God, that he was born of Mary by miraculous means, then they would pass on to his\nteachings as to how men and women should live to gain an exaltation in the kingdom of God.\nThat, it seems to me, would have been and should have been and must have been the \"word\"\nof every faithful Christian in that day. Likewise it should be your \"word\" and my \"word\"\ntoday. We, however, have something to add to that because we must tell the world not only\nthese things but also that not too far back Christ the Lord and his Father appeared to the boy\nProphet Joseph Smith and brought back to man the testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of\nGod. Then we must teach also that Peter, James, and John, John the Baptist, the Angel\nMoroni, and the men who had held the keys of the various past dispensations, came back to\nthe Prophet Joseph Smith restoring unto him the keys, all of the keys that had ever been given\nto man through the various dispensations of time. We are under that obligation, too, and we\nmust do it, not only publicly, but we must do it in our conversations. This\nshould be the theme of every religious conversation of a good member of the Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints. And it should go out as a living testimony that it is true. Of\ncourse when we bear that testimony to others who have not received it, we should do it in all\ncharity, but we should do it with spirit, fearlessly, courageously, and never doubting. If we\ncan develop the faith that will enable us to do that, a faith that God is the Father of our\nspirits, that he is the Father of Jesus Christ, that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world,\nand that if we will repent and purify our lives, he will carry the burden of the sins of the\nworld, (and it is only upon that condition, brethren and sisters, that he says he will do it), if\nwe can develop that faith in our hearts, then we should be able to carry on. We must not only\ndevelop that faith, but also the faith of a good Latter-day Saint, the faith of a good Christian\nmust be in himself, in his neighbors, and especially in his leaders, that the Church shall go\nforward vigorously, courageously to a wonderful realization of its purposes.\n<\/p><p>\nNow I say, it must be done very largely in conversation, and in that each one of us becomes a\nmissionary for the Church. He who is warned must warn his neighbor, and if we have that\ntestimony given to us by the Spirit of God, it remains for us to pass it on by word of mouth\nto those who have not received it. It does not require a call from President McKay to enable\nus to bear our testimonies to our neighbors. We have been warned. God himself has given us\nthe charge to do it. Then it is not only by word of mouth that we bear testimony, but it is also\nby purity of life. Through the power we hold in the priesthood of God, we must be able to\ndemonstrate by our lives its value. We can if we will. Our problem is to will to do it, and we\nmust do it in good spirit. I wonder if many of us are sorry that we have so many things that\nwe are told we ought not to do, whether or not they become burdensome to us. I frequently\ntell the missionaries when I talk to them that they must consider the rules that are set up in\nthe mission field for their protection, and so it is with these things which we ought not to do\nas members of the Church. They are for our protection; they are the reflection of purity of\nlife.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren and sisters, if we will be an example of the faithful believer, all these things we will\ndo, and in this time of decreasing missionary help, those of us who can should make available\nour services and go forth to bear this testimony. There is no compromise with the testimony\nthat Jesus Christ was born of Mary by miraculous means, that he is the Son of God, that he\nwas the firstfruits of the resurrection\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"237\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 237)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(237)\">1 Cor. 15:20<\/a><\/span>),\nthat through that resurrection he made possible to you\nand me a return to the presence of God our Heavenly Father, contingent only, that is, an\nexaltation in his presence is contingent only upon faithful service unto him and our fellows.\nLet us let that service be in good spirit. Let us be glad to give up the things we are asked to\ngive up. Let us be glad to devote ourselves to His service. Let us do it without fear, without\ncompromise, with great courage, and with all the energy which we may possess. If we will do\nthis, my brethren and sisters, we will always enjoy the Spirit of God, that testimony will\nalways remain with us, and the devil will never prevail against us. God grant it, I pray, in the\nname of Jesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
