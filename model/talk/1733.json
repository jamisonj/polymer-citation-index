I am not dealing with men respecting my\ntithing&mdash;my dealings are with the Lord; that is, with reference to my own conduct in the\nChurch and with reference to my observance of the other laws and rules of the Church. If I\nfail to observe the laws of the Church, I am responsible to the Lord and will have to answer\nto him, by and by, for my neglect of duty, and I may have to answer to the Church for my\nfellowship. If I do my duty, according to my understanding of the requirements that the Lord\nhas made of me, then I ought to have a conscience void of offense. I ought to have\nsatisfaction in my soul that I have simply done my duty as I understand it, and I will accept\nthe consequences. With me, it is a matter between me and the Lord; so it is with every one of\nus.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A mission to accomplish<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHe who sent his Only Begotten Son into the world, to accomplish the mission that he\ndid, also sent every soul within the sound of my voice, and indeed every man and woman in\nthe world, to accomplish a mission, and that mission cannot be accomplished by neglect, nor\nby indifference, nor can it be accomplished by ignorance.\n<\/p><p>\nWe should learn the obligation that we are under to the Lord and to each other; these things\nare essential, and we cannot prosper in spiritual things, we cannot grow in knowledge of the\nLord or in wisdom, without devoting our thoughts and our efforts toward our own betterment,\ntoward the increase of our own wisdom and knowledge in the things of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is therefore proper, and indeed it becomes the duty of those who are placed upon the towers\nas watchmen in Zion, to exhort the people to diligence, to prayerfulness, to humility, to a love\nof the truth that has been revealed to them, and to earnest devotion to the work of the Lord,\nwhich is intended for their individual salvation; not that I can save any man, nor that any man\ncan save any other man or fit him for exaltation in the kingdom of God.\nThis is not given to me to do for others, nor is it given to any man to be a savior in this sense\nor in this way to his fellowmen. But men can set an example. Men can proclaim the truth to\nothers and can point out the way to them in which to walk. Men can only be saved and\nexalted in the kingdom of God in righteousness; therefore, we must repent of our sins and\nwalk in the light as Christ is in the light, that his blood may cleanse us from all sins and that\nwe may have fellowship with the Lord and receive of his glory and exaltation.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Obedience to law of the Lord<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThough the Lord should try me by withholding his blessings from me, that should\nmake no difference to me. The point is, what is the law of the Lord? And if I know that law,\nit is my duty to obey it, though I suffer death in consequence. Many a man has gone to the\nstake in obedience, as he believed, to the commandments of the Lord. Not one of the ancient\ndisciples who were chosen by Jesus Christ escaped martyrdom, except Judas and John. Judas\nbetrayed the Lord and sacrificed his own life, and John received the promise of the Lord that\nhe should live until He came again to the earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28561\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28561)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28561)\">John 21:21-23<\/a><\/span>). All the others were put to death&mdash;some\ncrucified, some dragged in the streets of Rome, some thrown from pinnacles, and some stoned\nto death. For what? For obeying the law of the Lord and bearing testimony to that which they\nknew to be true.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord will honor those who honor him, and will remember those who remember him. He\nwill uphold and sustain all those who sustain truth and are faithful to it. The Lord help us,\ntherefore, to be faithful to the truth, now and forever.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Spirit of forgiveness<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe hope and pray that you will go from this conference to your homes feeling in your\nhearts and from the depths of your souls to forgive one another, and never from this time\nforth to bear malice toward another fellow creature. We ought to say in our hearts, let the\nLord judge between me and thee (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15372\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15372)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15372)\">D&amp;C 64:11<\/a><\/span>),\nbut as for me, I will forgive. Go home and dismiss envy\nand hatred from your hearts; dismiss the feeling of unforgiveness; and cultivate in your souls\nthat spirit of Christ that cried out upon the cross, \"Father, forgive them; for they know not\nwhat they do\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31776\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31776)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31776)\">Luke 23:34<\/a><\/span>).\nThis is the spirit that the Latter-day Saints ought to possess all\nthe day long. It is a good thing to be at peace with the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Be true to the faith<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI will say now to all of the Latter-day Saints, let us live our religion. Let us do all in\nour power to plant in the hearts of the people the glorious truth that Jesus is the Christ, the\nRedeemer of the world, and that Joseph Smith is a prophet of the living God, whom the Lord\nraised up in these last days to restore the everlasting gospel and power of the Holy Priesthood.\nWe should set an example; we should be true to the faith; we should be true to our covenants,\ntrue to the Lord, and true to one another. I can tell you that the man who is not true to the\ninterests of the people will be the man who will be found, by and by, left out and in a pitiable\nspiritual condition. The man who stays with the kingdom of God, who is true to this people,\nwho keeps himself pure and unspotted from the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26222\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26222)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26222)\">James 1:27<\/a><\/span>)\nis the man that the Lord will accept, uphold, and sustain.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe it is good to seek knowledge out of the best books\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15410\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15410)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15410)\">D&amp;C 88:118<\/a><\/span>), to be able to comprehend the\npurpose of the Lord with reference to the nations of the earth; and I believe that one of the\nmost important things, and perhaps more important to us than studying the history of the\nworld, is studying the principles of the gospel, that they may be established in our hearts and\nsouls above all other things, to qualify us to go out into the world to preach and teach the\npeople the first principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Improvement of musical talents<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to say right here that it delights my heart to see our people everywhere\nimproving their talents as good singers. Everywhere we go among our people we find sweet\nvoices and talent for music. I believe that this is a manifestation to us of the\npurpose of the Lord in this direction toward our people, that they will excel in these things, as\nthey should excel in every other good thing. I can remember, when I was a young boy,\nhearing my father sing. I do not know how much of a singer he was, for at that time I was\nnot capable of judging as to the quality of his singing, but the hymns he sang became familiar\nto me in the days of my childhood.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we listen to this choir, we listen to music, and music is truth. Good music is gracious\npraise of the Lord. It is delightsome to the ear, and it is one of our most acceptable methods\nof worshiping. And those who sing in the choir and in all the choirs of the Saints should sing\nwith the Spirit and with understanding. They should not sing merely because it is a\nprofession, or because they have a good voice; but they should sing also because they have\nthe spirit of it, and can enter into the spirit of prayer\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15331\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15331)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15331)\">D&amp;C 25:12<\/a><\/span>) and praise the Lord who gave them their\nsweet voices. My soul is always lifted up, and my spirit cheered and comforted, when I hear\ngood music. I rejoice in it very much indeed.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Seek after salvation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThen let the Saints unite; let them hearken to the voices of the servants of the Lord\nthat are sounded in their ears; let them seek their own salvation, for, so far as I am concerned,\nI am so selfish that I am seeking after my salvation, and I know that I can find it only in\nobedience to the laws of the Lord in keeping the commandments, in performing works of\nrighteousness, following in the footsteps of our file leader, Jesus, the exemplar and the head\nof all. He is the way of life; he is the light of the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28515\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28515)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28515)\">John 8:12<\/a><\/span>); he is the door\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28518\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28518)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28518)\">John 10:9<\/a><\/span>) by which we must\nenter in order that we may have a place with him in the celestial kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Acknowledge hand of the Lord<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHow much happier we are in the presence of a grateful and loving soul, and how\ncareful we should be to cultivate, through the medium of a prayerful life, a thankful attitude. I\nbelieve that one of the greatest sins of which the inhabitants of the earth are guilty today is\nthe sin of ingratitude, the want of acknowledgment, on their part, of the Lord and his right to\ngovern and control.\n<\/p><p>\nWe see a man with extraordinary gifts, or with great intelligence, and he is instrumental in\ndeveloping some great principle. He and the world ascribe his great genius and wisdom to\nhimself. He attributes his success to his own energies, labor, and mental capacity. He does not\nacknowledge the hand of the Lord in anything connected with his success, but ignores him\naltogether and takes the honor to himself. This will apply to almost all the world. In all the\ngreat modern discoveries in science, in the arts, in mechanics, and in all the material\nadvancement of the age, the world says, \"We have done it.\" The individual says, \"I have done\nit,\" and he gives no honor or credit to the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I read in the revelations through Joseph Smith, the Prophet, that because of this, the\nLord is not pleased with the inhabitants of the earth; he is angry with them because they will\nnot acknowledge his hand in all things (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15368\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15368)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15368)\">D&amp;C 59:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren and sisters, let us not forget to be grateful to our Father in heaven and thank him for\nall his kindness to us and&mdash;the watch-care he has over us; and may he bless us with every\nrighteous desire of our hearts, I humbly pray, in the name of our Redeemer. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
