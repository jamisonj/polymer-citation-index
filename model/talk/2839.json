I\u2019ve appreciated so much their leadership and support these past six months. I also sustain the new members, the new presidents of the First Council, and pledge my full support.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p4\" class=\"\">A few years ago, in a mission presidents seminar, President Hugh B. Brown said: \u201cIf God would grant me one wish\u2014just one\u2014it would be this: that each missionary felt and enjoyed the spirit of his calling.\u201d He also stated that if all missionaries were blessed to feel this spirit, miraculous things would occur in the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p5\" class=\"\">If I were granted one wish, it would be similar to President Brown\u2019s. My wish, however, would apply to all members of the Church, not just the full-time missionaries. Within my heart is the compelling desire that all members of the Church, young and old, be influenced and motivated by that special spirit which accompanies the sharing of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Would that all Latter-day Saints had intimate and continuous association with the missionary spirit!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p6\" class=\"\">The spirit of which I speak is best understood by reading the accounts of great missionaries such as the sons of Mosiah. It was their desire that they might impart the word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites. Note the depth of their feelings:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cNow they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40434\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40434)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40434)\">Mosiah 28:3\u20134<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p9\" class=\"\">This and other scriptures describe a marvelous phenomenon which occurs among men when the light of the gospel illuminates their lives. Almost instinctively, it seems, that light of truth sparks a desire to share. When our minds are expanded by new knowledge, we want others to know; when our spirits are elevated by heavenly influence, we want others to feel; and when our lives are filled with goodness, we want others, particularly those whom we love, to enjoy similar experiences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p10\" class=\"\">You will recall that in Lehi\u2019s dream he \u201cbeheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy.\u201d So he went forth, partook of the fruit, and was filled with joy. Then, according to the record, he \u201cbegan to be desirous that his family should partake of it also; for,\u201d he said, \u201cI knew that it was desirable above all other fruit.\u201d This fruit motivated Lehi to beckon to his family and \u201cwith a loud voice\u201d invite them to come to him and partake.

Among other things, he indicated that it was his great desire to share the restored gospel with his family and friends. With tears in his eyes and a quiver in his voice, he said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cI want them <span class=\"emphasis\">to know<\/span> what I know.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cI want them <span class=\"emphasis\">to feel<\/span> what I feel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cI want them <span class=\"emphasis\">to do<\/span> what I have done.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p15\" class=\"\">There <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> a missionary spirit\u2014a spirit which urges us to live outside ourselves and to be concerned for the welfare of others. And anyone who has ever served an honorable mission, assisted in the conversion of a friend, supported a son or daughter in the mission field, or enjoyed close associations with missionaries will testify of its reality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p16\" class=\"\">One of the beautiful dimensions of the proselyting effort is that both parties involved, the teacher and the student, feel of the Spirit and are edified by what takes place. As revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith, \u201cHe that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and both are edified and rejoice together.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16674\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16674)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16674)\">D&amp;C 50:22<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p17\" class=\"\">Listen to what one missionary wrote about teaching and testifying by the power of the Spirit:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cFriday night I had the opportunity of bearing my testimony to an elderly couple and their son. I looked them straight in the eyes and said, \u2018I know Joseph Smith received an answer to his prayer in the grove.\u2019 My heart was filled with that burning feeling. \u2026 The lesson plan is great and so is [the language], but to bear testimony and have investigators feel of the Spirit is what really matters.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p19\" class=\"\">Permit me to share an experience which I believe illustrates further this edifying process.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p20\" class=\"\">A few years ago, some missionaries referred me to a lovely couple to whom they had been teaching the gospel. These people had been taught a number of lessons and had attended church on several occasions. But they were having some difficulty in recognizing a developing testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p21\" class=\"\">After some silent praying, I was impressed to ask the husband, \u201cWas prayer an important part of your life before you met the missionaries?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cUntil recently I seldom prayed.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p23\" class=\"\">I then inquired, \u201cDo you pray now?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cOh yes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pray all the time.

He seemed eager, however, to let me know that the missionaries had taught him some significant things, including the plan of salvation. Once more, I invited him to read with me: \u201cNow, we will compare the word unto a seed. \u2026 If ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves\u2014It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9244\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9244)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9244)\">Alma 32:28<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p28\" class=\"\">It required little persuasion for my friend to acknowledge that the word was true and good, and that he had felt the Spirit of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p29\" class=\"\">The third question I directed to his wife.

He confessed that before his meetings with the missionaries, his faith had wavered and that he had entertained serious doubts concerning the Savior. He pointed out that recently his faith had been strengthened because of the teachings and testimonies of the missionaries. I then requested that we read: \u201cFor behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for everything which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38404\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38404)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38404)\">Moro. 7:16<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p34\" class=\"\">Our discussion concluded with an open acknowledgment by my investigator friends that a new and precious spirit had entered their lives.

I\u2019m convinced that each time we walk our roads to Emmaus with nonmember friends, talking and opening up the scriptures to them, our eyes are opened to added truths and our hearts burn brighter. I\u2019m convinced that each time we extend the right hand to the lame in body and spirit at our gates Beautiful and lift people up, we walk a little straighter and praise God with greater fervor. I\u2019m convinced that each time we visit our Jacob\u2019s wells and invite friends to drink of living waters, our thirst is quenched and we draw closer to the Savior of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p37\" class=\"\">Last week I boarded a plane to attend a stake conference in the East. My spirit was sagging and my mood less than desirable. I took my assigned seat, opened my briefcase, and began to work on some materials which were quite pressing. The seat adjacent to mine was vacant, and I found myself hoping that it would not be taken. I wanted to travel undisturbed by conversation and other distractions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-spirit-of-missionary-work.p38\" class=\"\">Just before the boarding gate was closed, a very hairy and unkempt young man rushed through the door and took the only remaining seat\u2014the one next to mine.

A short distance into the air, my unwelcomed traveling companion turned to me and said, \u201cI feel that I offend you, and I want to make an explanation.\u201d He continued, \u201cI\u2019m from Canada, and I\u2019ve been attending a mechanics seminar in Utah. The seminar concluded with a workshop, and I\u2019ve been deep in grease and grime all day.
