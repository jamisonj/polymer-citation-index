Lot chose the more productive land to the east, and so Abraham took the land to the west. In course of time, Lot and all of his household were captured in battle and taken to Dan, over a hundred miles to the north. When Abraham heard of his fate, he armed 318 of his servants and went in pursuit. He not only rescued Lot and his family but also restored to them their property in Sodom. The king of Sodom returned from exile and, in gratitude, offered Abraham the spoils of the victory. But these Abraham declined, saying, \u201cI will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and \u2026 I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-98905_000_021\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24147\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24147)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24147)\">Gen. 14:23<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> In these episodes, Abraham demonstrated his fairness, integrity, and faith.

Time ran out and they didn\u2019t get done. In fact, they didn\u2019t even get started. When Mother came home and saw the kitchen, she put on her apron and went to the sink. She spoke only three words, which stung worse than the sting of a dozen hornets.
