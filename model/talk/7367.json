We have listened tonight to wonderful discourses given by women of great faith and ability. I wish the presidency of the Relief Society to know that we have complete confidence in them. We appreciate them in every way. We are grateful for the theme they have chosen from the Book of Mormon, from 2 Nephi\u2014\u201cEncircled Eternally in the Arms of His Love\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"45478\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45478)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45478)\">2 Nephi 1:15<\/a><\/span>). The women of the Relief Society are literally encircled eternally in the arms of our Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p6\" class=\"\">In my judgment, this is the greatest women\u2019s organization in all the world. It is a God-given creation. Joseph Smith spoke and acted as a prophet when he organized the Relief Society in 1842. At that time he said, \u201cThe organization of the Church of Christ was never perfect until the women were organized\u201d (Sarah M. Kimball, \u201cEarly Relief Society Reminiscences,\u201d Mar. 17, 1882, Relief Society Record, 1880\u201392, Archives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 30).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p7\" class=\"\">Today membership in the Relief Society is somewhere around five million. It is organized in many nations and teaches in many tongues. It enfolds within its ranks all women of the Church 18 years of age and older. Among these are single young women; women who have never married; those who are widowed or divorced; those with husbands and families; those old in years, many of whom have lost their eternal companions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p8\" class=\"\">A friend not of our faith once said to me, \u201cLDS stands for Love, Devotion, Service.\u201d What does Relief Society really stand for? What does it mean? Let me try to say something about this.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p9\" class=\"\">Relief Society stands for love. What a remarkable thing it is to witness the love of good women one for another. They mingle together in the bonds of love with friendship and respect for each other. This organization is actually the only resource that many women have for friendly association.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p10\" class=\"\">It is the natural instinct of women to reach out in love to those in distress and need. The welfare program of the Church is described as priesthood based, but it could not function without the Relief Society.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p11\" class=\"\">Relief Society stands for education. It is the obligation of every woman of this Church to get all the education she can. It will enlarge her life and increase her opportunities. It will provide her with marketable skills in case she needs them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p12\" class=\"\">Last week I received a letter from a single mother, a part of which I wish to read to you. She says as follows:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cIt has been 10 years since you mentioned our family in October conference in 1996. \u2026 The words of counsel and encouragement that you gave to me and other single sisters have been a pattern used in my daily life. The phrase that has become my motto and watchword [is] \u2018Do the very best you can,\u2019 and that is indeed what my sons and I are trying to do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAll four of my sons graduated from high school and seminary. Two of them served full-time missions. We are all working to provide for ourselves and continue to be true and faithful in the gospel. It is a great feeling to know that we have made it on our own for the past several years. \u2026 There is a certain feeling of accomplishment when you can once again stand on your own two feet and provide for your family\u2019s needs. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cI was encouraged to go back to college. \u2026 It is a real challenge to work full-time and attend classes at night. It has broadened my perspective on life and helped me to be a better person. My family, ward members, and co-workers have been very supportive. I will graduate this December.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cAs I pondered my patriarchal blessing and made it a matter of fasting and prayer, I was able to set some realistic goals in my life that have been used as a road map to keep me on track with the principles of the gospel. I attend my meetings, pray daily, and pay my tithing. I \u2026 take my calling as a visiting teacher very seriously. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cThe Church is true, and it is an honor and a privilege to be counted as a worthy and blessed member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We are led by inspiration from a loving Heavenly Father, who knows us and wants us to progress and grow. I thank you for your kind words of encouragement 10 years ago, and for the many continuing words of inspiration that come from the Lord through His servants. I know I am a child of God and my life is blessed by my membership in His Church.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p18\" class=\"\">Relief Society stands for self-reliance. The best food storage is not in welfare grain elevators but in sealed cans and bottles in the homes of our people. What a gratifying thing it is to see cans of wheat and rice and beans under the beds or in the pantries of women who have taken welfare responsibility into their own hands. Such food may not be tasty, but it will be nourishing if it has to be used.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p19\" class=\"\">Relief Society means sacrifice. I am always moved by this simple verse of Anne Campbell, written in behalf of her child.

Hanks conducted a panel discussion. Included in that panel was an attractive and able young woman, divorced, the mother of seven children then ranging in ages from 7 to 16. She said that one evening she went across the street to deliver something to a neighbor. Listen to her words, as I recall them:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cAs I turned around to walk back home, I could see my house lighted up. I could hear echoes of my children as I had walked out of the door a few minutes earlier. They were saying: \u2018Mom, what are we going to have for dinner?\u2019 \u2018Can you take me to the library?\u2019 \u2018I have to get some poster paper tonight.\u2019 Tired and weary, I looked at that house and saw the light on in each of the rooms. I thought of all of those children who were home waiting for me to come and meet their needs. My burdens felt heavier than I could bear.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cI remember looking through tears toward the sky, and I said, \u2018Dear Father, I just can\u2019t do it tonight. I\u2019m too tired. I can\u2019t face it. I can\u2019t go home and take care of all those children alone. Could I just come to You and stay with You for just one night?

The answer was: \u2018No, little one, you can\u2019t come to me now. You would never wish to come back.

She said, \u201cThat is the Lord\u2019s money\u2014you will not use that to buy food.\u201d Her faith was stronger than his. He put the money back, and they went to bed hungry that night.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p38\" class=\"\">The next morning they had no breakfast, and they went to church fasting.

They hadn\u2019t gone very far when a new member called to them from his house. This man was a fisherman and told them he had more fish than he could use. He wrapped five little fish in a newspaper for them, and they thanked him. As they continued to walk home, they were stopped by another member who gave them tortillas; then someone else stopped them and gave them rice; another member saw them and gave them beans.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/in-the-arms-of-his-love.p40\" class=\"\">When they arrived home, they had enough food for two weeks.
