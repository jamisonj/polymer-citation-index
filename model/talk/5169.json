We met for the first time on a Sunday morning. She accompanied the Sunday School president into the classroom and was presented to us as a teacher who actually requested the opportunity to teach us. We learned that she had been a missionary and loved young people. Her name was Lucy Gertsch. She was beautiful, soft-spoken, and interested in us. She asked each class member to introduce himself or herself, and then she asked questions that gave her an understanding and an insight into the background of each boy, each girl. She told us of her childhood in Midway, Utah; and as she described that beautiful valley, she made its beauty live, and we desired to visit the green fields she loved so much. She never raised her voice. Somehow rudeness and boisterousness were incompatible with the beauty of her lessons. She taught us that the present is here and that we must live in it. She made the scriptures actually come to life. We became personally acquainted with Samuel, David, Jacob, Nephi, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Our gospel scholarship grew. Our deportment improved. Our love for Lucy Gertsch knew no bounds.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/an-attitude-of-gratitude.p50\" class=\"\">We undertook a project to save nickels and dimes for what was to be a gigantic party. Sister Gertsch kept a careful record of our progress. As boys and girls with typical appetites, we converted in our minds the monetary totals to cakes, cookies, pies, and ice cream. This was to be a glorious occasion\u2014the biggest party ever. Never before had any of our teachers even suggested a social event like this one was going to be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/an-attitude-of-gratitude.p51\" class=\"\">The summer months faded into autumn; autumn turned to winter.

These were depression times; money was scarce. With a twinkle in her eyes, she asked, \u201cHow would you like to follow this teaching of the Lord? How would you feel about taking your party fund and, as a class, giving it to the Devenports as an expression of our love?\u201d The decision was unanimous. We counted very carefully each penny and placed the total sum in a large envelope.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/an-attitude-of-gratitude.p54\" class=\"\">Ever shall I remember the tiny band walking those three city blocks, entering Billy\u2019s home, greeting him, his brother, sisters, and father. Noticeably absent was his mother. Always I shall treasure the tears which glistened in the eyes of each one present as the white envelope containing our precious party fund passed from the delicate hand of our teacher to the needy hand of a grief-stricken father. We fairly skipped our way back to the chapel. Our hearts were lighter than they had ever been, our joy more full, our understanding more profound. This simple act of kindness welded us together as one.
