Perhaps we have not seen, in person, the risen Lord. But the testimony of his chosen witnesses is etched into our hearts by the Holy Spirit. We know, and knowing, we too must testify. Is there any question in the mind of any of us that this is one of the chief responsibilities we enjoy by reason of our membership in his Church? I began with Mormon\u2019s declaration, \u201cI have been called of him to declare his word among his people, that they might have everlasting life.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6217\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6217)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6217)\">3 Ne. 5:13<\/a><\/span>.)

I don\u2019t want to cut off a branch here and a branch there, I want to have the whole tree down. \u2026 Hand over the whole natural self, all the desires which you think innocent as well as the ones you think wicked\u2014the whole outfit. I will give you a new self instead. In fact, I will give you Myself: my own will shall become yours.\u2019\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Mere Christianity,<\/span> New York: Collier Books, 1960, p. 167.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>I Know That My Redeemer Lives<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/jesus-the-christ.p60\" class=\"\">As a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, I express my willingness to so submit myself to my Savior because I trust him, I believe him, and I love him.
