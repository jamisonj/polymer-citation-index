We made that order in our corporate capacity, and the City Marshal carried\n  it out. It is possible there may have been some better way, but I must confess that I could not see it.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">In relation to the writ served upon us, we were willing to abide the consequences of our own\n  acts,<span class=\"footRef\">1<\/span> but were unwilling, in answering a writ of that kind, to submit to illegal exactions sought to\n  be imposed upon us under the pretense of law, when we knew they were in open violation of it.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">When that document was presented to me by Mr. Bettisworth, I offered, in the presence of more\n  than 20 persons, to go to any other magistrate, either in our city or Appanoose, or any other place\n  where we should be safe, but we all refused to put ourselves into the power of a mob.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">What right had that constable to refuse our request? He had none according to law; for you\n  know, Governor Ford, that the statute law in Illinois is, that the parties served with the writ shall go\n  before him who issued it, or some other justice of the peace.

We sued for, and obtained a\n  writ of <i>habeas corpus<\/i> from the Municipal Court, by which we were delivered from the hands of\n  Constable Bettisworth, and brought before and acquitted by the Municipal Court.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">After our acquittal, in a conversation with Judge Thomas, although he considered the acts of\n  the party illegal, he advised, that to satisfy the people, we had better go before another magistrate\n  who was not in our Church.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">In accordance with his advice we went before Esq. Wells, with whom you are well acquainted;\n  both parties were present, witnesses were called on both sides, the case was fully investigated, and\n  we were again dismissed.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">And what is this intended desire to enforce the law, and these lying, base rumors put into\n  circulation for, but to seek, through mob influence, under pretense of law, to make us<\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"116510\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 116510)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(116510)\">D&amp;C 134:1<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
