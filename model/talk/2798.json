As we become more affluent and our bank accounts enlarge, there comes a feeling of security, and we feel sometimes that we do not need the supply that has been suggested by the Brethren. It lies there and deteriorates, we say. And suppose it does? We can reestablish it. We must remember that conditions could change and a year\u2019s supply of basic commodities could be very much appreciated by us or others. So we would do well to listen to what we have been told and to follow it explicitly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/family-preparedness.p12\" class=\"\">The story came from England during their siege of strikes, power blackouts, and three-day work weeks.

We wish to say another word about this in the next meeting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/family-preparedness.p15\" class=\"\">We encourage you to grow all the food that you feasibly can on your own property. Berry bushes, grapevines, fruit trees\u2014plant them if your climate is right for their growth. Grow vegetables and eat them from your own yard. Even those residing in apartments or condominiums can generally grow a little food in pots and planters. Study the best methods of providing your own foods. Make your garden as neat and attractive as well as productive. If there are children in your home, involve them in the process with assigned responsibilities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/family-preparedness.p16\" class=\"\">What President Romney has just said is basic. Children should learn to work. Parents should not spend their nights and days trying to find something to interest their children.

We reaffirm the previous counsel the Church has always given, to acquire and maintain a year\u2019s supply\u2014a year\u2019s supply of the basic commodities for us. And Brother Featherstone has pretty well outlined those commodities for us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/family-preparedness.p18\" class=\"\">Wherever possible, produce your nonfood necessities of life. Improve your sewing skills; sew and mend clothing for your family. All the girls want to learn to type, they all want to go to an office. They don\u2019t seem to want to sew anymore, and to plant and protect and renew the things that they use. Develop handicraft skills as the sisters have told us, and make or build needed items.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/family-preparedness.p19\" class=\"\">We encourage families to have on hand this year\u2019s supply; and we say it over and over and over and repeat over and over the scripture of the Lord where He says, \u201cWhy call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31957\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31957)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31957)\">Luke 6:46<\/a><\/span>.]  How empty it is as they put their spirituality, so-called, into action and call him by his important names, but fail to do the things which he says.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/family-preparedness.p20\" class=\"\">Keep in good repair and beautify your homes, your yards, farms, and businesses.
