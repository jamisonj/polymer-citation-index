As its contribution to a large spring fair, the sixth grade was producing a cookbook that would be distributed throughout the community. When the teacher announced the project and a deadline of a week from Friday, our son Brett immediately concluded there was plenty of time later to get the job done and dismissed it from his mind. Early the next week, when the teacher reminded the students of the Friday deadline, Brett decided he could easily complete the required task on Thursday night and until then he could occupy himself with other more enjoyable matters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/do-it-now.p6\" class=\"\">On the appointed Friday morning, the teacher directed the students to pass their recipes to the front of the class. Brett\u2019s procrastination had caused him to forget the assignment and be completely unprepared. Flustered, he turned to a fellow student seated nearby and confessed his problem. Trying to be helpful, the classmate said, \u201cI brought an extra recipe. If you want, use one of mine.\u201d Brett quickly grabbed the recipe, wrote his name on it, and turned it in, feeling he had escaped any consequences related to his lack of preparation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/do-it-now.p7\" class=\"\">One evening several weeks later, I arrived home from work to freshen up before going to my evening Church meetings. A few days prior, I had been called as a stake president after serving several years as a bishop. We were somewhat known in our community as members of the Church who tried to live the tenets of our religion. \u201cThere\u2019s something you need to see,\u201d my wife, Diane, said as I walked through the door. She handed me a bound book with a page marked. Glancing at the cover, titled <span class=\"emphasis\">Noelani School\u2019s Favorites\u20141985,<\/span> I turned to the identified page and read, \u201cHallstrom Family, Favorite Recipe\u2014Bacardi Rum Cake.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/do-it-now.p8\" class=\"\">Many of us place ourselves in circumstances far more consequential than embarrassment because of our procrastination to become fully converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ. We know what is right, but we delay full spiritual involvement because of laziness, fear, rationalization, or lack of faith. We convince ourselves that \u201csomeday I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d However, for many \u201csomeday\u201d never comes, and even for others who eventually do make a change, there is an irretrievable loss of progress and surely regression.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/do-it-now.p9\" class=\"\">As a partial self-appraisal of our spiritual-procrastination standing, what is our attitude when we attend the meetings of the Church?

Or do we have an \u201cI\u2019ve heard it all before\u201d mentality that immediately blocks the Spirit\u2019s access to our minds and our hearts and enables procrastination to become a major part of our character?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/do-it-now.p10\" class=\"\">Of a prominent early investigator of the restored Church, who covenanted that he would obey any command that the Lord would give him, it was said, \u201cAnd he received the word with gladness, but straightway Satan tempted him; \u2026 and the cares of the world caused him to reject the word\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"51461\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51461)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51461)\">D&amp;C 40:2<\/a><\/span>).
