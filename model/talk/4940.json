Thereafter, I received a special letter from a wonderful mother who, with her husband, a bishop, had accompanied their fourteen-year-old son, with some of his friends, to the meeting. These are the last few words of her letter:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p4\" class=\"\">\u201cPlease accept my thanks. \u2026 You spoke seriously to a group of youth who are used to being told how wonderful they are. They <span class=\"emphasis\">are<\/span> wonderful, but they needed to do some heavy thinking for a change. You helped them do that. Thank you!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p5\" class=\"\">I was pleased that the meeting had encouraged some serious thinking and consideration among at least some of those present. We referred, as we began, to the aimless habit some of us have of channel-hopping or dial-switching as we sit in front of a television set or radio, and suggested that in preparation, I had done a similar kind of searching through my memory and notes. I was seeking to select, out of many observations and experiences and thoughts, a few that might make a difference to those who were seriously listening and might thereafter think about what they had heard. I would like to do the same with you in these few moments this evening.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p6\" class=\"\">A picture forms on my monitor involving a father aboard an airplane on a short business trip. He has with him his five-year-old son and is almost wishing his son were not there because it is a very rough trip. There are downdrafts and updrafts and head winds alternating with tail winds, and some passengers are feeling a bit queasy. Apprehensively, the father glances at his son and finds him grinning from ear to ear. \u201cDad,\u201d he says, \u201cdo they do this just to make it fun for the kids?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p7\" class=\"\">Good parents and family and leaders and friends do go to great lengths to make it fun for the kids, but the fun they are thinking of is wholesome fun; it hurts no one, and it lifts the spirit and is good to remember tomorrow and through a lifetime and forever. It never detracts from the real, long-term joy we came into this world to experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p8\" class=\"\">The next scene on the screen illustrates that clearly\u2014it is a personal testimony of a noble and loving father to his children shortly before his death.

A grieving young father and his two children sit before a television set in their home after a makeshift dinner. The children have been staying with Grandmother while their mother has slowly slipped away in a lingering illness; now they and their father are home again after her funeral. The little girl drops off to sleep and is carried to her bed. The little boy fights off sleepiness until he finally asks his father if tonight, just tonight, he can sleep with him in his bed. As the two lie silently in the dark, the lad speaks: \u201cDaddy, are you looking at me?\u201d \u201cYes, son,\u201d the father replies, \u201cI am looking at you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p18\" class=\"\">The boy sighs and, exhausted, sleeps. The father waits a time and then, weeping, cries out in the dark, in anxious anguish: \u201cGod, are you looking at me? If you are, maybe I can make it. Without you, I know I can\u2019t.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p19\" class=\"\">Our Heavenly Father <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> looking at us. He loves us and he wants us to choose the path that leads us to happiness here and eternal life hereafter. In his plan he authorizes us to act for him, to be instruments of his concern for his children. But he won\u2019t force any of us to make choices that lead to happiness. He has given each of us the right and responsibility to make personal choices, individual decisions, and has made us accountable for them. He not only affects our lives, he is affected by our lives, and sometimes he weeps for us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p20\" class=\"\">The same prophet Lehi, to whom we referred, taught his children these truths:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cBecause \u2026 they are redeemed \u2026 they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore \u2026 they are free to choose liberty and eternal life \u2026 or to choose captivity and death.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4372\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4372)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4372)\">2 Ne. 2:26\u201327<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p23\" class=\"\">Switch channels with me to a scene on a Saturday night in a ranch home kitchen, where a boy who has just answered the telephone nervously approaches his mother with a question: \u201cMom,\u201d he says, \u201cBob is on the phone. He and his dad and Tom and his dad are going snowmobiling and shooting tomorrow morning, and they want to know if I can go with them.\u201d The mother seems startled at the question and uncertain as she answers. (Later, she explains that she was strongly tempted to respond sharply to her boy, reminding him that he had duties on Sunday morning, that in their family they went to church together, and that when Dad returned later that night he would not consider such a thing.) But instead, she says to her son, \u201cRichard, you are twelve years old. You hold the priesthood. You are president of the deacons quorum. I am sure Dad would want you to make up your own mind and answer Bob yourself.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p24\" class=\"\">The boy goes back to the telephone, and the mother goes to her room and prays that their son will give the right answer. Nothing more is said about the matter, and on Sunday morning the lad and his parents go into town to church, park in the lot across the street, and are crossing, arm-in-arm, when a pickup truck passes. Two men and two boys are in the seat, snowmobiles in the truck bed, guns slung in the rear window. The boys wave to Richard as they pass. He pauses a moment and says, \u201cGee, I wish \u2026\u201d The mother catches her breath a bit, and then Richard finishes: \u201cGee, I wish I had been able to talk Bob and Tom into coming to priesthood meeting this morning.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p25\" class=\"\">The mother, telling the story, thanks the Lord for this choice lad and his personal decision to do the right thing. And then she weeps freely as she explains how important that was to all of them. You see, their son was killed in a farm accident that week.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p26\" class=\"\">We push the remote-control, and a classic statement from a great mind and heart stands out boldly: \u201cAh, my soul, look to the road you are walking on.

His initial mistakes were understandable; he was young and away from home and friends and familiar standards, and he wanted to be independent. His intentions were not evil, but because he was a little arrogant and proud, he rejected good counsel and let himself be led away by individuals who were described perfectly in the Book of Mormon, thousands of years ago, in their sinful persuasion of others.

One of the most touching involved a young lady convert to the Church who had found in a Latter-day Saint fellow student, and in her fellow student\u2019s home, where she was invited for family home evening, a spirit and a caring relationship she had never known in her own life. She said that since her baptism, things had not really materially changed in her own home; there were still abuse and argument and alcohol and foul language. \u201cBut,\u201d she said, \u201cthere is one room at my house where I can go and shut the door and read the scriptures and listen to good music and pray and feel the Spirit of the Lord.

The sobering realities of our present Middle East involvement, where many of our people are in threatening conditions, make this memory particularly pertinent and particularly appreciated.

As I passed the back door, I looked in and saw a kind of human barrier that had been set up to separate the many young men who were lingering in the front part of the room from a few who were in the back. Three men had their hands on the head of another who sat on a chair. All four were dressed in battle gear; two had returned from air strikes to the north just in time for the meeting, and one was shortly to go. The three members of the district presidency were giving a blessing to an officer senior to them all, setting him apart as a district missionary.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/changing-channels.p42\" class=\"\">For some reason this sweet scene affected me more deeply than any priesthood sermon I have heard.
