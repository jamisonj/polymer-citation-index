As a sign of that respect, we always addressed our bishop as \u201cBishop Christensen\u201d or \u201cBishop Calder\u201d or \u201cBrother Jones.\u201d We never called our bishop \u201cMr.\u201d or by his first name, as we did in speaking to others. With the bishop, we always used an honored title.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p4\" class=\"\">When I was seventeen, I joined the Utah National Guard. There I learned that a soldier must use certain words in speaking to an officer. I saw this as another mark of respect for authority. I also observed that this special language served as a way of reminding both the soldier and the officer of the responsibilities of their positions. I later understood that same reasoning as explaining why full-time missionaries should always be called by the dignified titles of <span class=\"emphasis\">elder<\/span> or <span class=\"emphasis\">sister,<\/span> or the equivalent in other languages.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p5\" class=\"\">In my legal training I became familiar with the formal language lawyers use to address judges during court proceedings. After graduation I worked for a year as a law clerk to the chief justice of the United States. We always used the formal title of his office, Chief Justice. Similarly, communications to our most senior government leaders should be addressed in a particular way, such as Mr. President, Your Excellency, or Your Majesty. The use of titles signifies respect for office and authority.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p6\" class=\"\">The words we use in speaking to someone can identify the nature of our relationship to that person. They can also remind speaker and listener of the responsibilities they owe one another in that relationship. The form of address can also serve as a mark of respect or affection.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p7\" class=\"\">So it is with the language of prayer. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches its members to use special language in addressing prayers to our Father in Heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p8\" class=\"\">When we go to worship in a temple or a church, we put aside our working clothes and dress ourselves in something better. This change of clothing is a mark of respect. Similarly, when we address our Heavenly Father, we should put aside our working words and clothe our prayers in special language of reverence and respect. In offering prayers in the English language, members of our Church do not address our Heavenly Father with the same words we use in speaking to a fellow worker, to an employee or employer, or to a merchant in the marketplace. We use special words that have been sanctified by use in inspired communications, words that have been recommended to us and modeled for us by those we sustain as prophets and inspired teachers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p9\" class=\"\">The special language of prayer follows different forms in different languages, but the principle is always the same. We should address prayers to our Heavenly Father in words which speakers of that language associate with love and respect and reverence and closeness. The application of this principle will, of course, vary according to the nature of a particular language, including the forms that were used when the scriptures were translated into that language. Some languages have intimate or familiar pronouns and verbs used only in addressing family and very close friends. Other languages have honorific forms of address that signify great respect, such as words used only when speaking to a king or other person of high rank. Both of these kinds of special words are appropriately used in offering prayers in other languages because they communicate the desired feelings of love, respect, reverence, or closeness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p10\" class=\"\">Modern English has no special verbs or pronouns that are intimate, familiar, or honorific. When we address prayers to our Heavenly Father in English, our only available alternatives are the common words of speech like <span class=\"emphasis\">you<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">your<\/span> or the dignified but uncommon words like <span class=\"emphasis\">thee, thou,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">thy<\/span> which were used in the King James Version of the Bible almost five hundred years ago. Latter-day Saints, of course, prefer the latter. In our prayers we use language that is dignified and different, even archaic.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p11\" class=\"\">The men whom we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators have consistently taught and urged English-speaking members of our Church to phrase their petitions to the Almighty in the special language of prayer. President Spencer W. Kimball said, \u201cIn all our prayers, it is well to use the pronouns <span class=\"emphasis\">thee, thou, thy,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">thine<\/span> instead of <span class=\"emphasis\">you, your,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">yours<\/span> inasmuch as they have come to indicate respect.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Faith Precedes the Miracle,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1972, p. 201.) Numerous other Church leaders have given the same counsel. (See Stephen L Richards, in Conference Report, Oct. 1951, p. 175; Bruce R. McConkie, <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Jan. 1976, p. 12; and L. Tom Perry, <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1983, p. 13.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p12\" class=\"\">Perhaps some who are listening to this sermon in English are already saying, \u201cBut this is unfamiliar and difficult. Why should we have to use words that have not been in common use in the English language for hundreds of years? If we require a special language of prayer in English, we will discourage the saying of prayers by little children, by new members, and by others who are just learning to pray.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p13\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, the special language of prayer is much more than an artifact of the translation of the scriptures into English. Its use serves an important, current purpose. We know this because of modern revelations and because of the teachings and examples of modern prophets. The way we pray is important.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p14\" class=\"\">The English words <span class=\"emphasis\">thee, thou, thy,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">thine<\/span> occur throughout the prayers the prophets of the Lord have revealed for use in our day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p15\" class=\"\">A revelation given in 1830, the year the Church was organized, directs that the elder or priest who administers the sacrament \u201cshall kneel \u2026 and call upon the Father in solemn prayer, saying:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cO God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19783\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19783)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19783)\">D&amp;C 20:76\u201377, 79<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p17\" class=\"\">The prayer offered at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple in 1836 is another model that illustrates the language of prayer used by the Prophet Joseph Smith:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now, Holy Father, we ask thee to assist us, thy people, with thy grace, in calling our solemn assembly, \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cThat thy glory may rest down upon thy people, and upon this thy house, which we now dedicate to thee, that it may be sanctified and consecrated to be holy, and that thy holy presence may be continually in this house.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19939\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19939)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19939)\">D&amp;C 109:10, 12<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p20\" class=\"\">This prophetic model of the language of prayer has been faithfully followed in all of the sacred petitions by which the prophets have dedicated temples to the Lord.

It has been suggested that <span class=\"emphasis\">thee, thou, thy,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">thine<\/span> are simply holdovers from forms of address once used to signify respect for persons of higher rank. But more careful scholarship shows that the words we now use in the language of prayer were once commonly used by persons of rank in addressing persons of <span class=\"emphasis\">inferior<\/span> position. These same English words were also used in communications between persons in an intimate relationship. There are many instances where usages of English words have changed over the centuries. But the history of English usage is not the point.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p37\" class=\"\">Scholarship can contradict mortal explanations, but it cannot rescind divine commands or inspired counsel. In our day the English words <span class=\"emphasis\">thee, thou, thy,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">thine<\/span> are suitable for the language of prayer, not because of how they were used anciently but because they are currently obsolete in common English discourse. Being unused in everyday communications, they are now available as a distinctive form of address in English, appropriate to symbolize respect, closeness, and reverence for the one being addressed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p38\" class=\"\">I hope this renewal of counsel that we use special language in our prayers will not be misunderstood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-language-of-prayer.p39\" class=\"\">Literary excellence is not our desire.

When leaders or members of other churches or synagogues phrase their prayers in the familiar forms of <span class=\"emphasis\">you<\/span> or <span class=\"emphasis\">your,<\/span> this does not signify a lack of reverence or respect in their belief and practice but only a preference for the more modern language.
