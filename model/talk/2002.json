A survey of the historical landscape in the light of our existing knowledge shows that, up to date, history has repeated itself about twenty times in producing human societies of the species to which our Western society belongs, and it also shows that with the possible exception of our own, all these representatives of the species of society called civilizations are already dead or moribund. Moreover, when we study the histories of these dead and moribund civilizations in detail, and compare them with one another, we find indications of what looks like a recurring pattern in the process of their breakdowns, declines, and falls. We are naturally asking ourselves today whether this particular chapter of history is bound to repeat itself in our case. Is that pattern of decline and fall in store for us in our turn as a doom from which no civilization can hope to escape?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/choose-you-this-day.p18\" class=\"\">He goes on to express his opinion that the pattern of earlier successes or failures does not necessarily have to be repeated. He says: \u201cAs human beings, we are endowed with this freedom of choice, and we cannot shuffle off our responsibility upon the shoulders of God or nature. We must shoulder it ourselves. <span class=\"emphasis\">It is up to us.\u201d <\/span>He suggests what we should do to be saved, politically, economically, and religiously, and states: \u201cOf the three tasks, the religious one is, of course, in the long run by far the most important.\u201d (New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 38\u201340.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/choose-you-this-day.p19\" class=\"\">I suggest to you that if we were spiritually sound, if we were living the teachings of Jesus Christ, whom we <span class=\"emphasis\">must <\/span>serve if we are to survive as individuals and nations, then the political and economic problems already would be solved, because by living the Ten Commandments and other teachings of God we could all live together in peace and prosperity.

It is most important that we decide whether or not we are going to serve the Lord.

But as we read in detail about the limestone walls and marble columns of the forty-eight-year-old monument deteriorating, its mortar flaking away, stalactites and stalagmites transforming its basement into an eerie cavern, millions of spiders and tiny, winged midges swarming over the ceiling, it gives us an outstanding example of the fact that moth and rust doth corrupt treasures on earth.
