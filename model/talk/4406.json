There seems to be no limit to his questions, and the proposed answers that might have been true yesterday will probably change today and again tomorrow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/spiritual-security.p4\" class=\"\">This quest is not limited only to science, but to every aspect of our lives. More than ever before, our values and roles as men, women, and children are being challenged and scrutinized\u2014supposedly to liberate individuals from anxiety, bondage, fears, and bigotry, and to give them a feeling of security. It seems that the natural man always wants to secure his truths and knowledge to fit his own carnal security.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/spiritual-security.p5\" class=\"\">Submerged by this continual flow of conflicting reconsideration of every possible value, one should not be surprised to see that these constant changes bring a state of constant insecurity rather than security in the lives of common people to the point where many, especially the youth, have abdicated their responsibilities, and many have even given up their lives. What a paradox!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/spiritual-security.p6\" class=\"\">In our lives of trials and tribulations and constant changes, it is obvious that we all seek for some measure of security\u2014something steady and unchanging to cling to\u2014and we have surrounded ourselves with all kinds of devices or organizations that carry the word <span class=\"emphasis\">security.<\/span> For example, we use security blankets to soothe and comfort our children. We install security systems to protect our homes and our personal possessions. The Social Security system was created as a protection against temporal storms. In the political arena, the Security Council of the United Nations attempts to maintain peace among the nations of the world. At times we are amused by this all-consuming search for so-called security, but we require it and are willing to pay for it. However, despite all our efforts, we still do not gain the <span class=\"emphasis\">real<\/span> security that we seek. Is it because we put our trust in the arm of flesh?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/spiritual-security.p7\" class=\"\">Security is an essential ingredient in our lives. It includes knowledge about our true identity and the purpose of life, how to interact with others, and how to face our daily adversities and challenges. It can be a matter of life and death. Every day of our lives we are faced with what is good and what is evil, what is right and what is wrong. From childhood to old age, if we don\u2019t feel secure or if we live by deceiving carnal security, our attitudes, goals, and interrelationships with others will suffer. When we gain a feeling of security from loving parents as a child and continue on to experience the security enjoyed by obeying laws, we bless our own lives and the lives of others. The real issue, then, has always been where and how to find righteous security as opposed to carnal security. For our purpose here, we will call righteous security spiritual security.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/spiritual-security.p8\" class=\"\">Spiritual security provides interesting advantages: you do not have to pay taxes on it, it does not change, it does not take away your liberty or free agency, and it brings positive, comforting, spiritual, and eternal results.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/spiritual-security.p9\" class=\"\">Security cannot be guaranteed because free agency also brings insecurity, and spiritual security does not automatically suppress or eliminate danger, oppression, or opposition.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/spiritual-security.p10\" class=\"\">Then how can we gain spiritual security? The very simple answer is perhaps too simple for too many: first, turn to the Lord. King Limhi said, \u201cBut if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40665\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40665)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40665)\">Mosiah 7:33<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/spiritual-security.p11\" class=\"\">Second, trust the Lord.

Spiritual security comes from revelation that unveils the true nature of Deity. The kind of God in whom we believe generally determines the kind of people we are and will become. Without revelation about the true nature of Deity, the natural man will walk \u201cin his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18533\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18533)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18533)\">D&amp;C 1:16<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/spiritual-security.p15\" class=\"\">Spiritual security is derived from revelation describing a plan of salvation for our benefit. \u201cGod conversed with men, and made known unto them the plan of redemption, which had been prepared from the foundation of the world\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9590\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9590)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9590)\">Alma 12:30<\/a><\/span>). The plan of salvation gives a direction to be followed, a sure way to strengthen ourselves against the pitfalls of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/spiritual-security.p16\" class=\"\">Spiritual security is revelation that tells us about the source of the plan of salvation: Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/spiritual-security.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd we talk of Christ,\u201d said Nephi, \u201cwe rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4242\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4242)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4242)\">2 Ne. 25:26<\/a><\/span>). The source is identified, clarified, and verified. We do not need to seek elsewhere.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/spiritual-security.p18\" class=\"\">Spiritual security comes from revelation that relieves the anxiety of death. \u201cBut there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath no victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40667\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40667)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40667)\">Mosiah 16:8<\/a><\/span>).

In our day it has also been revealed to Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and to many others: \u201cBehold, I say unto you, my son\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18549\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18549)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18549)\">D&amp;C 9:1<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/spiritual-security.p23\" class=\"\">Knowing who we really are prepares us to use that knowledge to face temptations, to resist them, and then to act righteously.

The ordinances of salvation represent covenants with the Lord. John A.
