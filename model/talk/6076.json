I was one of several small children in our family, and our father had been unemployed for many months. There was no government assistance for the unemployed, and the Church welfare program was not yet in operation. Our needs were many. Some might have said we were destitute. Though I was only a child, I felt the anxiety and concern of my parents.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/tithing-a-privilege.p5\" class=\"\">Each morning we knelt together as a family, and each one in turn led our prayer. One memorable morning it was Mother\u2019s turn. She described some of our immediate needs, and then she thanked our Heavenly Father for the privilege of living the law of tithing. I immediately experienced a feeling of comfort and assurance. Living the law of the tithe was a privilege and would bring blessings. I did not doubt it because my mother knew it. [See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"10325\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10325)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10325)\">Alma 56:48<\/a><\/span>.]  Those feelings have remained and intensified throughout my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/tithing-a-privilege.p6\" class=\"\">The first time I paid tithing, the amount was five cents. With my father, I went to the office of the bishop, who solemnly accepted my five pennies and wrote out the receipt. Then he stood and, coming from behind his desk, sat next to me. With his hand on my shoulder, he gave me the small but significant slip of paper and said, \u201cRonald, you have made a good beginning, and if you continue as you have begun, you can be a perfect tithe payer.\u201d The idea of being perfect at anything seemed well beyond my ability. I was trying hard just to be a good boy. But with those words, the bishop inspired me to strive for perfection in that one basic aspect of the gospel. The blessings, both temporal and spiritual, have been abundant.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/tithing-a-privilege.p7\" class=\"\">During the intervening years, my testimony of tithe paying as a privilege has been reconfirmed frequently. Obedience to that law, among others, has enabled me to be ordained to the holy priesthood, to be endowed in the house of the Lord, to serve a full-time mission, and to be sealed to family members for time and eternity. In addition, I have been privileged to return to the temple repeatedly to serve others and to be instructed regarding things of eternal importance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/tithing-a-privilege.p8\" class=\"\">The sacred significance of the law of tithing was confirmed by the Savior Himself following His resurrection and during His ministry to the people in what is now known as the Americas.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/tithing-a-privilege.p9\" class=\"\">The Book of Mormon records that the Savior taught the Nephites from the scriptures they had, but spoke of other scriptures that they did not have, commanding them to write the words which the Father had given to Malachi, including these words:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/tithing-a-privilege.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cWill a man rob God?

I was studying law at the university and working nights in a gasoline station. We had very little money.

As that day approached, we discussed the possibility of postponing the paying of our tithing so that we could make an initial payment on a baby bed. In the spirit of the fast, and after praying, we decided to pay the tithing and trust our Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/tithing-a-privilege.p20\" class=\"\">A few days later, I was walking in the business district of the city and unexpectedly met my former mission president, who asked if I was in school or working at a job.
