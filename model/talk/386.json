I am sure we have all rejoiced in the testimonies and the instructions of our brethren,\nand I thank the Lord for them and for my association with them, and I am very grateful, as\nyou are, that he has permitted President Smith to be here with us today and to instruct us as\nhe has done.\n<\/p><p>\nI humbly pray that, in the few moments that are mine, I may leave some thought with you\nthat will help inspire you and help you feel compensated for the great work you are doing in\nthe Church of our Father in heaven.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE THINGS THAT MATTER\n<\/p><p>\nIt has been said that there are two kinds of things in this world, the things that matter and\nthen the other things, and I believe that if any people have learned to know the things that\nmatter, it is the Latter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nYou will recall that a teacher among the Jews went to Jesus by night, the Great Teacher, to\nlearn from him the things that matter, and when he met the Savior, he said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . Rabbi, we know that thou are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these\nmiracles that thou doest except God be with him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27359\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27359)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27359)\">John 3:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJesus did not reply with some great philosophy of men, but said to Nicodemus: \". . . Except a\nman be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd of course Nicodemus did not understand, and said: \"How can a man be born when he is\nold? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Jesus replied: \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the\nkingdom of God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27358\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27358)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27358)\">John 3:1-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA great many people, as Jesus instructed the teacher of the Jews, have been born again. Take\nas an illustration the Apostle Paul.\n<\/p><p>\nThere was a man who did not understand the truth. On the way to Damascus, our Savior\nappeared to him and informed him of the mistake he was making, and said: \"Saul, Saul, why\npersecutest thou me?\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7608\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7608)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7608)\">Acts 9:4-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPAUL AND PETER\n<\/p><p>\nAnd you know the life of Paul, from that time forward until he went to Rome and there\nappeared before Festus and King Agrippa. When he bore his testimony to them he told them\nhow he had seen a light and heard the voice of the Savior speak unto him, but they just could\nnot understand it. And Festus said with a loud voice: \". . . Paul, thou art beside thyself; much\nlearning doth make thee mad\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7620\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7620)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7620)\">Acts 26:24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo which Paul replied: \"I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth\nand soberness\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7621\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7621)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7621)\">Acts 26:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then Agrippa said: \"Almost thou persuadeth me to be a Christian.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd while Paul stood before them in chains, he said: \"I would to God, that not only thou, but\nalso all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these\nbonds\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7622\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7622)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7622)\">Acts 26:28-29<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPaul had found the thing that mattered in this world, and he was willing to give his life for it.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Peter, that great exponent of truth, after he had received the gift of the Holy Ghost, was\ncommanded that he should no longer preach Christ and him crucified in the streets of\nJerusalem, but he replied: \"Whom shall men obey, God or man?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7605\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7605)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7605)\">Acts 4:19<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7606\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7606)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7606)\">Acts 5:29<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he went on about his work as he had been commanded, because he had been born again\nand he knew the thing that was really worthwhile.\n<\/p><p>\nALMA'S CONVERSION\n<\/p><p>\nNow consider Alma, the son of Alma, who went about persecuting the Saints, until the angel\nof the Lord appeared to him and told him of his error, and the earth trembled as the angel\nspake to him (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40231\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40231)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40231)\">Mosiah 27:18<\/a><\/span>),\nbut after that, when Alma went forth to preach the gospel, he just could not\ntake unto himself the power that he would like in order that he might be able to cry\nrepentance to all the world. And he said: \"O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of\nmine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the\nearth, and cry repentance unto every people\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8879\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8879)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8879)\">Alma 29:1<\/a><\/span>), because he knew that when the\nangel spake to him it literally did shake the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so Alma found the thing that was really Worth while, the thing that mattered, and that\nwas the thing to which he devoted his life; and so it was with the prophets of that day and\nthis day.\n<\/p><p>\nJOSEPH SMITH'S TESTIMONY\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Prophet Joseph wrote his own story he said that he marveled that a boy, obscure as\nhe was, a farmer boy without education, should become the subject of such discussion and\nconcern by the great men of his community\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30289\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30289)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30289)\">JS&mdash;H 1:22-23<\/a><\/span>),\nand he said:\n<\/p><p>\nI had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two personages, and they did\nin reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a\nvision, yet it was true; and, while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all\nmanner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: \"Why persecute\nme for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God,\nor why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen?\" For I had seen a\nvision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it;\nat least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30290\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30290)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30290)\">JS&mdash;H 1:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, being born again, as the Prophet was, and learning the thing that mattered and was\nreally worth while, his whole life was devoted to his testimony, until he sealed his testimony\nwith his blood.\n<\/p><p>\nBRIGHAM YOUNG\n<\/p><p>\nIt took Brigham Young about two years to make up his mind to join the Church after he first\nheard the gospel, and then for the next ten years, we are told, he spent almost his entire time\nin the missionary service of the Lord. And when he went on his first mission he did not even\nhave an overcoat, and he took a quilt from the trundle bed, and his wife made him a cap out\nof a pair of old pantaloons, and at the end of ten years, he said, all he had ever had as a\nreward of his service was the half of a small pig that the Prophet Joseph had received from\none of the brethren and divided with him. And then, in this great Tabernacle later he said that\nhe had studied the gospel as any student of science had studied any branch of science for\nthirty years as he traveled by day and by night, by land and by sea, and he had only reached\nthe ABC's: his study lead him into the eternities.\n<\/p><p>\nThat is what it does for a man when he finds the thing that matters and is really worth while\nin this life, and it marks the life of that man just as the lives of you, my brethren, have been\nmarked because of the testimony that has come to you.\n<\/p><p>\nI like the statement that President Clark made from this stand, I think about a year ago, when\nhe said that a testimony is the mortar that holds this Church together, and if we did not have\na testimony we would not be doing the things we are doing today.\n<\/p><p>\nAll of you, as you look back over the history of your own people and your own families, are\nno doubt proud of your forebears and the sacrifices they have made, and their integrity and\ndevotion to the faith, and if you will pardon me for being a bit personal, I would like to refer\nto some of mine.\n<\/p><p>\nFAITH IN OWN FAMILY\n<\/p><p>\nMy grandfather, Franklin D. Richards, recorded in his diary, after he had been a member of\nthe Church for nine years, that he had come up in that time through the grades of the\npriesthood to the office of high priest, that he had received his endowments in the Nauvoo\nTemple, that he had filled five missions in the United States, and he was then serving as\ncounselor in the Presidency of the British Mission with a membership of over sixteen\nthousand. Then he states:\n<\/p><p>\nMost of all things, this day, I desire the Holy Spirit, which giveth life, yea life more\nabundantly to both body and spirit.\n<\/p><p>\nHe traded his home in Nauvoo, as many of the other brethren did, for a team of horses and a\nwagon; loaded on it all his possessions he could take with him; took his two wives (that was\npermissible in those days) and one little girl, and went to join the Saints at Winter Quarters.\nWhen he arrived there, the Prophet Brigham Young sent him back to England. And while he\nwas there again in the mission field, one of his wives died, his little girl died, and his brother\nwho was with the Mormon Battalion died. Previously he had lost a brother in the Haun's Mill\nMassacre, and he wrote in his journal something like this:\n<\/p><p>\nI hope that no matter what sacrifice may be required at my hands that God will give me the\nstrength to stand so that when the battle is fought and the race is run I may come out not one\nwhit behind my brethren.\n<\/p><p>\nYou know, that is when we know the things that matter and the other things, when we have\nbeen born again with the spirit of this great latter-day work.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like also to refer to Grandfather Willard Richards, cousin Stephen L's grandfather. He\nwas in jail in Carthage with the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum, and John Taylor.\nGrandfather Willard did not have to go there; there was no subpoena for him or warrant of\narrest. The Prophet Joseph turned to him and said: \"If we go into the cell, will you go with\nus?\"\n<\/p><p>\nDr. Richards replied: \"Brother Joseph, you did not ask me to cross the river with you: you did\nnot ask me to come to Carthage with you; you did not ask me to come to jail with you. Do\nyou think I would forsake you now? I will tell you what I will do. If you are condemned to\nbe hanged for treason, I will be hanged in your stead, and you shall go free.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet replied: \"You cannot do that.\" Dr. Richards replied: \"But I will.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThat is the kind of faith and testimony that has built this kingdom of God, because they have\nknown the things that matter, and the other things have been of little consequence to them.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to be pardoned for referring to my own father who is deprived of the privilege of\nbeing here today because of illness. President George F. Richards of the Council of the\nTwelve. A few weeks ago I sat by his side when he was in great pain and distress and I\nsympathized with him and he said: \"My son, it does not matter what happens to me as long as\nthe kingdom of God can go forward.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I felt grateful for a father with that kind of faith.\n<\/p><p>\nTo these testimonies, many of you brethren can add experiences of your own and your\nforebears. I remember when I was a boy I said to my father: \"Father, how is a person to\nknow when he gets a testimony?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well,\" he said, \"my boy, you just keep going the way you have been; you will not need to\nworry about that.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThere is not time today to relate my own experiences but I want to tell you that a testimony\nof the divinity of this work is the most treasured gift of my life, and I would rather have it\nburn in the hearts and souls of my children and my grandchildren than any other thing in all\nthe world.\n<\/p><p>\nTESTIMONY OF INDIAN SISTER\n<\/p><p>\nCould I be excused for reading a testimony of an Indian sister, that appeared in the Church\nsection of <i>The Deseret News<\/i>, a few weeks ago, to show you that the Lord gives to the poor\nand the humble of the earth just as well as he does to any others:\n<\/p><p>\nI joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I have never had any doubt in\nmy heart but that I have joined the fight Church. Before I joined the Latter-day Saint Church,\neverything that was pure and sweet seemed so far away, as if there were a deep gap, and I\ncould never get the edges together. But when the elders came and I heard the real truth,\neverything seemed so clear and beautiful. I wanted to be sure, and I would pray nights for\nGod to guide me and show me the right thing to do. He showed me the right way, and I just\ncannot explain the wonderful feeling I had. I was at peace with the world. I keep thanking\nGod for the privilege of being able to be a member of the true Church. I want to bear my\ntestimony in the name of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nI had the privilege of meeting that dear sister not long ago, and she was just like an angel\nfrom heaven to me. I learned that she had taken the beads and little trinkets that her mother\nbequeathed to her, amounting in value to a few hundred dollars, and sold them in order that\nshe might erect a room in which the elders could hold meetings in the vicinity where she\nlives.\n<\/p><p>\nIn closing, I would like to read the words of Nephi:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal\nFather! Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the\nhearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable of all things.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he [the angel] spake unto me saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the soul\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1480\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1480)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1480)\">1 Ne. 11:21-23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI bear you my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that there is nothing in this world to\ncompare with the love of God and the testimony of the truth that comes through being born\nagain and knowing the things that matter and are worthwhile, and then you will not need to\nworry about the other things.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you all, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
