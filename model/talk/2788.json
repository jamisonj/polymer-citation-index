I am greatly strengthened again, my brothers and sisters, by the energetic, vibrant, and humble spirit of President Kimball and all those who have spoken. President Kimball is not only a great leader but a great man. His faith and works are incomparable. In my estimation he is as great as any prophet that preceded him since the time of Adam. I know that he is one of the great and noble ones the Lord referred to while conversing with Abraham.

I see brown faces and white faces together, sitting shoulder to shoulder. I see big nations side by side with small nations. I see American faces with Lamanite faces. I see German faces next to French faces. I see Mexicans next to Chinese. I see Japanese faces next to Polynesians. My brothers and sisters, what I am seeing today demonstrates to me the true gospel in action. As I look over the audience today, I do not see Mexicans, or whites, or Japanese, or Chinese. What I see are children of God. To me you are all children of God. In fact, today I see a glimpse of heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/but-they-were-in-one.p8\" class=\"\">As I look at you I know there is no hate or animosity among you because of the love of God which is swelling in your hearts. There is great evidence of loving your neighbor among you today. But let me ask you, brothers and sisters, you in this tabernacle and all those listening, what about when you leave this conference? And you in this building, when you leave this building, will you have the same feeling? Will you have the same love and regard for everyone and for anyone? The Lord said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/but-they-were-in-one.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/but-they-were-in-one.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cThis is the first and great commandment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/but-they-were-in-one.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36477\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36477)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36477)\">Matt. 22:37\u201339<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/but-they-were-in-one.p12\" class=\"\">Of all the great commandments given to us by our Heavenly Father, he rates these number one and two. My brothers and sisters, you cannot live one without the other; both must be lived and practiced if we are to be found with Him in the celestial glory. In this church there is no place for hate, animosity, or prejudice. Nor are they found in the celestial kingdom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/but-they-were-in-one.p13\" class=\"\">Again we read in Fourth Nephi:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/but-they-were-in-one.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd they had all things in common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6532\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6532)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6532)\">4 Ne. 1:3<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/but-they-were-in-one.p15\" class=\"\">In like manner, my brothers and sisters, among you today there are really no rich, no poor. To me you\u2019re all equal in the sense that you are all Latter-day Saints and that you are all rich spiritually. What I see in the audience today are people from all walks of life. I see doctors and lawyers sitting next to common men. I see a farmer next to a professional person. I see professional people, educators, and teachers side by side. I see composers, musicians, and artists\u2014all kinds of people from all walks of life, sitting together side by side. And this is as it should be, because if you want to know what the celestial kingdom looks like, you are witnessing today a glimpse of the celestial kingdom and heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/but-they-were-in-one.p16\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, the Lord has commanded us to love each other, and to be one in Jesus Christ, and to become perfect as he is. But let me ask you again, brothers and sisters, what will happen after you leave this building and return home? Will you be common with all and listen to the cries of the poor, the deprived, and the oppressed? The Lord said, \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36485\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36485)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36485)\">Matt. 25:40<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/but-they-were-in-one.p17\" class=\"\">The mission of this church is to focus on others. The Lord has instructed us to give meat to the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, visit the sick and those in prison. Again Nephi said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/but-they-were-in-one.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cThe people were all converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land, both Nephites and Lamanites, and there were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6531\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6531)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6531)\">4 Ne. 1:2<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/but-they-were-in-one.p19\" class=\"\">In like manner today, as I look at you, you are all converted to the Lord and there is no disputation among you. You are all willing and capable of dealing justly with your neighbor. But again I must ask you, what will happen when you leave this building? What will happen when this conference is closed? Will you go out of this building and out into the world and deal justly with your fellowmen? Will you still be converted? Or will you compromise gospel principles and standards?
