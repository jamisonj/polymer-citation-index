Then, commencing with Moses and the prophets, he showed them how that in all things the prophets had testified of him. Then Peter tells us that he opened their understandings (that is, the understandings of his disciples with whom he was traveling) that they might understand the scriptures.

All we need to do is to look to the blueprint that the Lord has prepared through his prophets.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/prophecy.p50\" class=\"\">Then if you take the next step\u2014the coming of John the Baptist with the Aaronic Priesthood, the power to baptize by immersion for the remission of sins\u2014there wasn\u2019t anybody in this world holding that power when John the Baptist restored it to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and taught them how to baptize each other. Then Peter, James, and John brought the Melchizedek Priesthood, the power of the holy apostleship, the power to organize the church and kingdom of God on the earth for the last time, never to be thrown down nor given to another people. Then the coming of Moses that caused the gathering of Latter-day Israel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/prophecy.p51\" class=\"\">I like the statement of Jeremiah.

Where could you go in all the world and listen to pastors after His own heart like you have heard here in this conference? They are called of God and ordained by God.
