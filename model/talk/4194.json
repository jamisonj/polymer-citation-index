Some interpret mortality solely in terms of worldly accomplishments and possessions. In contrast, we who have a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ should interpret our experiences in terms of our knowledge of the purpose of life, the mission of our Savior, and the eternal destiny of the children of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/spirituality.p11\" class=\"\">Spirituality is not a function of occupation or calling. A scientist may be more spiritual than a theologian; a teacher may be more spiritual than an officer. Spirituality is determined by personal outlook and priorities. It is evident in our words and actions. Elder John Taylor showed his spirituality in these words, uttered as he reported on his mission to Europe in 1852:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/spirituality.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cSome people have said to me, sometimes, Are you not afraid to cross over the seas, and deserts, where there are wolves and bears, and other ferocious animals? \u2026 Are you not afraid that you will drop by the way, and leave your body on the desert track, or beneath the ocean\u2019s wave? No. Who cares anything about it? What of it, if we should happen to drop by the way? \u2026 These things don\u2019t trouble me, but I have felt to rejoice all the day long, that God has revealed the principle of eternal life, that I am put in possession of that truth, and that I am counted worthy to engage in the work of the Lord.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 1:17.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/spirituality.p13\" class=\"\">The scriptures contain great illustrations of spirituality as it relates to everyday living.

During a tragic afternoon on Calvary, a handful of soldiers waited at the foot of a cross. The most important event in all eternity was taking place on the cross above their heads. Oblivious to that fact, they occupied themselves casting lots to divide the earthly property of the dying Son of God.

In a BYU devotional several years ago, Elder Loren C. Dunn described how his father, a busy stake president in Tooele, gave his two young sons the responsibility of raising cows on the family farm. He gave the boys large latitude in what they could do, and they made some mistakes. These were observed by an alert neighbor, who complained to their father about what the young cow-raisers were doing. \u201cJim, you don\u2019t understand,\u201d President Dunn replied. \u201cYou see, I\u2019m raising boys, not cows.\u201d (\u201cOur Spiritual Heritage,\u201d in <span class=\"emphasis\">Brigham Young University 1981\u201382 Fireside and Devotional Speeches, <\/span> Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1982, p. 138.)

The Spanish conquerors took irreplaceable objects of art from the craftsmen of the New World and melted them down into gold bullion.

But when the men of Zion\u2019s Camp approached their intended destination, the Prophet Joseph Smith disbanded them. According to its ostensible purpose, the expedition was a failure. But most of the men who were to lead the Church for the next half-century, including those who would take the Saints across the plains and colonize the Intermountain West, came to know the Prophet Joseph and received their formative leadership training in the march of Zion\u2019s Camp.
