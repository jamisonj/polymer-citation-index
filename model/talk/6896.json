One day a mother I know felt impressed to call her daughter. (This kind of thing happens to mothers all the time.) It was the middle of the day, and Mom was at work, which made the call out of the ordinary. To her surprise, her son-in-law answered the phone\u2014he\u2019s not usually home on a workday either.

The doctor says we have no choice but to do a C-section and soon.\u201d Then came the real cause for the distress: \u201cAnd he says I can\u2019t lift anything heavier than the new baby for four weeks!\u201d She needed reassurance before going into the surgery that the Lord knew her need and loved her\u2014and that there would be help tending the three little ones at home, who were scarcely more than babies themselves. When mothers\u2014and fathers\u2014pray for the Lord to bless and strengthen their families, He often shows them the way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p8\" class=\"\">Sister Gayle Clegg of the Primary general presidency and her husband lived for a number of years in Brazil. Recently she had a Primary assignment in Japan. As she came into the chapel on Sunday, she noticed among the Japanese Saints a Brazilian family. \u201cThey just looked Brazilian,\u201d she said. She only had a minute to greet them and found the mother and children very enthusiastic but noticed that the father was rather quiet. \u201cI\u2019ll have a chance to talk with them after the meeting,\u201d she thought as she was quickly ushered to the stand. She delivered her message in English, which was translated into Japanese, and then she felt impressed to bear her testimony in Portuguese as well. She hesitated as there were no translators for Portuguese, and 98 percent of the people would not understand what she said.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p9\" class=\"\">After the meeting the Brazilian father came up to her and said, \u201cSister, the customs are so different here, and I have been lonely. It is difficult to come to church and not understand anything. Sometimes I wonder if I would be better off just reading my scriptures at home. I told my wife, \u2018I\u2019ll give it one more chance,\u2019 and I came today for what I thought would be the last time. When you bore your testimony in Portuguese, the Spirit touched my heart, and I knew that this was where I belonged. God knows I am here, and He will help me.\u201d And he joined the others in putting away the chairs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p10\" class=\"\">Was it a coincidence that the only Portuguese-speaking member of the Primary presidency was sent to Japan instead of to Portugal? Or was it because the Lord knew someone there needed what only she could give\u2014and she had the courage to follow a prompting of the Spirit? One of the great blessings of having a calling in the Church is that the Lord, through His Spirit, will inspire us to help those we are called to serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p11\" class=\"\">Each of us who pays a full tithe can testify that the blessings of the Lord come to us personally and meet our individual needs.

He was administered to, and some of the vision was restored to his right eye, but he was completely blind in his left. Because he couldn\u2019t see well, he lost his job. He tried to get employment with his wife\u2019s family, but their business failed due to the depression.

The branch president understood the situation but asked John to make it a matter of prayer and fasting so that he could find a way to pay his tithing. John and his wife, Alice, fasted and prayed and determined that the only thing of value they owned was her engagement ring\u2014a beautiful ring bought in happier times. After much anguish they decided to take the ring to a pawnbroker and learned it was worth enough to pay their tithing and some other outstanding bills. That Sunday he went in to the branch president and paid his tithing. As he left the office, he happened to meet the mission president, who noticed his damaged eyes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p14\" class=\"\">Brother Orth\u2019s son, now serving as a bishop in Adelaide, later wrote: \u201cWe believe that [the mission president] was an eye doctor, for he was commonly called President Dr. Rees.
