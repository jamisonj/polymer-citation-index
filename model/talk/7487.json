Our Heavenly Father places loving individuals on important crossroads to help us so that we are not left alone to grope in the dark. These men and women help by example and with patience and love. Such has been my experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/out-of-small-things.p22\" class=\"\">I recall a particularly important crossroad\u2014the decision to go on a full-time mission. I stood on that crossroad for a very, very long time. As I struggled to decide which road to take, my family, friends, and priesthood leaders came forward to take my hand. They encouraged and challenged me and offered countless prayers on my behalf. My full-time missionary sister wrote to me regularly and never gave up.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/out-of-small-things.p23\" class=\"\">Even today, I am still carried on the shoulders of good men and women. I suspect that we all are. To some degree we all depend on each other to be able to make it back to our heavenly home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/out-of-small-things.p24\" class=\"\">Sharing the gospel message is one of the most rewarding ways we can render service to those who are not of our faith. I recall a childhood experience with someone I will simply call Uncle Fred.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/out-of-small-things.p25\" class=\"\">When I was six years old, Uncle Fred was my worst nightmare. He was our neighbor, and he was always drunk. One of his favorite pastimes was to throw rocks at our home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/out-of-small-things.p26\" class=\"\">Because my mother was a great cook, single adult members from our small branch frequented our home. One day when Uncle Fred was sober, these members befriended him and invited him into our home. This development terrified me. He was no longer just outside but inside our home. This happened a few more times until, finally, they were able to convince Uncle Fred to listen to the missionaries. He accepted the gospel and was baptized. He served a full-time mission, returned with honor, pursued further education, and was married in the temple. He is now a righteous husband, father, and priesthood leader. Watching Uncle Fred today, one would find it difficult to believe that he once brought nightmares into the life of a six-year-old boy. May we always be perceptive to opportunities to share the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/out-of-small-things.p27\" class=\"\">My mother was a great example of helping others by giving them a boost. She taught us many important lessons. The one lesson that has had the most lasting effect on my life was her desire to help anyone in need who visited our home. It bothered me to see many of them leave with our food, our clothing, and even our money. Because I was young and we were poor, I did not like what I saw. How could she give to others when our family did not even have enough? Was it wrong to attend to our needs first? Didn\u2019t we deserve a more comfortable life?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/out-of-small-things.p28\" class=\"\">For years I struggled with these questions.
