The whole world, it seemed, prayed for one significant result: the safe return to earth of three brave men.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen one of them with restrained anxiety announced the startling information, \"We have had an explosion!\" the mission control in Houston immediately mobilized all the technically trained scientists who had, over the years, planned every conceivable detail pertaining to that flight.\n<\/p><p>\nThe safety of those three now depended on two vital qualifications: on the reliability of the skills and the knowledge of those technicians in the mission control center at Houston, and upon the implicit obedience of the men in the Aquarius to every instruction from the technicians, who, because of their understanding of the problems of the astronauts, were better qualified to find the essential solutions. The decisions of the technicians had to be perfect or the Aquarius could have missed the earth by thousands of miles.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Analogous to troublous times<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThis dramatic event is somewhat analogous to these troublous times in which we live. The headlines in the public press only this week made another startling announcement by a presidential commission to the President of the United States. \"U.S. Society Is in Peril.\" Many are frightened when they see and hear of unbelievable happenings the world over&mdash;political intrigues, wars and contention everywhere, frustrations of parents, endeavoring to cope with social problems that threaten to break down the sanctity of the home, the frustrations of children and youth as they face challenges to their faith and their morals.\n<\/p><p>\nOnly if <i>you<\/i> are willing to listen and obey, as did the astronauts on the Aquarius, can you and all your households be guided to ultimate safety and security in the Lord's own way.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are, in these troubled times, agonizing cries of distress among the peoples of the earth. There are intense feelings of a need for some way to find a solution to overwhelming problems and to ease this distress from all that affects mankind.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Fulfillment of prophecies<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTo one who is acquainted with and well versed in the prophetic teachings of the past generations, there should be little question as to the meaning of all that is going on among us today, when it seems as though everything is in turmoil.\n<\/p><p>\nProphecy may well be defined as history in reverse. Before our very eyes we are witnessing the fulfillment of prophecies made by inspired prophets in ages past. In the very beginning of this dispensation we were plainly told in a revelation from the Lord that the time was nigh at hand when peace would be taken from the earth and the devil would have power over his own dominion.

It was to be a standard for the Lord's elect and for all the world to benefit by it. Its purpose was to serve the needs of all men and to prepare the world for the second coming of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Participants in plan<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe participants in the formulation of this plan in the premortal world were all the spirit children of our Heavenly Father. Our oldest scriptures, from the writings of the ancient prophets Abraham and Jeremiah, affirm also that God, or Eloheim, was there; his Firstborn Son, Jehovah, Abraham, Jeremiah, and many others of great stature were there.\n<\/p><p>\nAll the organized intelligences before the earth was formed, who had become spirits, were there, including many great and noble ones whose performance and conduct in that premortal sphere qualified them to become rulers and leaders in carrying out this eternal plan.

A prophet-leader on this continent explained this to his son as recorded in an ancient scripture: that to bring about these, the Lord's eternal purposes, there must be opposites, an enticement by the good on the one hand and by the evil on the other, or to say it in the language of the scriptures, \". . . the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other being bitter.\" This father further explained, \"Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself.
