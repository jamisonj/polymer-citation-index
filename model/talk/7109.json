For the natural man, sacrifice does not come naturally. He has an insatiable appetite for more. His so-called needs seem to always outpace his income so that having \u201cenough\u201d is forever out of reach, just as it was for the miser Scrooge.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/tithing-a-commandment-even-for-the-destitute.p11\" class=\"\">Because the natural man tends to hoard or consume everything, the Lord wisely commanded ancient Israel to sacrifice not the last and poorest of the flock, but the firstlings\u2014not the leftovers of the field, but the firstfruits (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44188\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44188)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44188)\">Deut. 26:2<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44189\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44189)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44189)\">Mosiah 2:3<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44190\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44190)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44190)\">Moses 5:5<\/a><\/span>).

But how can you ask someone who is starving to eat less? <span class=\"emphasis\">Is<\/span> there a level of poverty <span class=\"emphasis\">so<\/span> low that sacrifice should not be expected or a family so destitute that paying tithing should cease to be required?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/tithing-a-commandment-even-for-the-destitute.p13\" class=\"\">The Lord often teaches using extreme circumstances to illustrate a principle. The story of the widow of Zarephath is an example of extreme poverty used to teach the doctrine that mercy cannot rob sacrifice any more than it can rob justice. In fact, the truer measure of sacrifice isn\u2019t so much what one gives to sacrifice as what one sacrifices to give (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44191\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44191)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44191)\">Mark 12:43<\/a><\/span>). Faith isn\u2019t tested so much when the cupboard is full as when it is bare. In these defining moments, the crisis doesn\u2019t create one\u2019s character\u2014it reveals it. The crisis is the test.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/tithing-a-commandment-even-for-the-destitute.p14\" class=\"\">The widow of Zarephath lived in the days of the prophet Elijah, by whose word the Lord brought a drought upon the land for three and a half years (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44192\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44192)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44192)\">Luke 4:25<\/a><\/span>). The famine grew so severe that many were finally at the point of death.

It is interesting that Elijah is not told to go to Zarephath until the widow and her son are at the point of death.

Didn\u2019t our parents teach us to let other people go first and especially for a gentleman to let a lady go first, let alone a starving widow? Her choice\u2014does she eat, or does she sacrifice her last meal and hasten death? Perhaps she will sacrifice her own food, but could she sacrifice the food meant for her starving son?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/tithing-a-commandment-even-for-the-destitute.p22\" class=\"\">Elijah understood the doctrine that blessings come <span class=\"emphasis\">after<\/span> the trial of our faith (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44196\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44196)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44196)\">Ether 12:6<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44197\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44197)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44197)\">D&amp;C 132:5<\/a><\/span>).
