In the spirit world before the creation of this earth, a great council was held in which God the Father presented his plan having to do with the eternal life of man. The plan was to teach the people righteousness and permit them to exercise their free agency, choosing for themselves which way they would go. Jesus Christ espoused the plan saying, \u201cFather, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39456\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39456)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39456)\">Moses 4:2<\/a><\/span>.)

It is a cause worth giving one\u2019s life for. It is the cause of righteousness. It is a cause that every youth in this Church should rally to as he declares war on Satan and his legions. As David said to Goliath, so each youth should declare to Satan, \u201cThou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2622\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2622)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2622)\">1 Sam. 17:45<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/is-there-not-a-cause.p18\" class=\"\">In all this I have the greatest of faith in the outcome. Never before in history has there lived a more valiant generation of youth. I am convinced the spirits of this generation were held to come forth at this important time in history. Their potential is unlimited.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/is-there-not-a-cause.p19\" class=\"\">In this optimism there is also realism. We are taught there must needs be opposition in all things, hence, the need for good and evil, the one led by the Savior and the other by Satan. Satan is just as real as is the Savior. He is clever. He is strongly motivated. In his battle to enslave he will resort to any lie, any trickery, any means to accomplish his end. Perhaps his most pernicious lie is in teaching that there is no God. It is at this point I again declare to the youth of the Church there is a cause, and that cause should motivate all youth to firmly grasp the banner of the gospel of Jesus Christ and carry it to all the world, declaring to all that he does live, that the heavens are open, that there is a prophet on the earth today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/is-there-not-a-cause.p20\" class=\"\">I am suggesting that each individual put on the whole armor of God. He will then become an example to others, and many will follow in his footsteps. As each individual does this, he helps form the army that will win the great victory and ultimately prepare the world for the second coming of the Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/is-there-not-a-cause.p21\" class=\"\">In putting on the whole armor of God, we must become acquainted with the Savior. At 14 Joseph Smith, in his quest for knowledge and wisdom, sought the Lord in prayer. God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ appeared to him in a vision. He saw two personages, one saying of the other, \u201cThis is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30577\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30577)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30577)\">JS\u2014H 1:17<\/a><\/span>.) This was the beginning of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth. If we have faith, we can prepare ourselves through prayer and study and gain the same assurance Joseph Smith had that God lives and that he and his Son are separate personages. Jesus of Nazareth then will become the center of our lives. With this assurance, our cause cannot be hindered. Without it, we have no cause.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/is-there-not-a-cause.p22\" class=\"\">Many battles have been lost because of difficulty in not always having a clearly defined battlefront. This is not the case in this war. There is but one real battlefront, and that is with each individual. The only real attack comes upon you and me individually; and, of course, that is where the only effective defense will be made.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/is-there-not-a-cause.p23\" class=\"\">If Satan could but capture our minds, he would have won the battle and the war. He can only do this if we let him. If we refuse to walk with him, he will have no power over us, for God gave us our free agency and Satan cannot take it away. So what I am suggesting is that we refuse to even walk on the same street with Satan. In other words, not only should we avoid evil, we should avoid the very appearance of evil.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/is-there-not-a-cause.p24\" class=\"\">Let us look at a few of the issues we are doing battle over.
