They seem happy, even enthusiastic about life. When difficult choices are to be made, they seem to invariably make the right ones, even though there were enticing alternatives available to them. We know that they are subject to temptation, but they seem oblivious to it. Likewise, we have observed how others are not so valiant in the decisions they make. In a powerfully spiritual environment, they resolve to do better, to change their course of life, to set aside debilitating habits. They are very sincere in their determination to change, yet they are soon back doing the same things they resolved to abandon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/full-conversion-brings-happiness.p5\" class=\"\">What is it that makes the difference in the lives of these two groups? How can you consistently make the right choices? The scriptures give us insight. Consider enthusiastic, impetuous Peter. For three years he had served as an Apostle beside the Master, observing miracles and hearing transforming teachings and private explanations of parables. With James and John, Peter experienced the glorious Transfiguration of Jesus Christ with the accompanying visitations of Moses and Elijah.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-22905_000_011\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"33690\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33690)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33690)\">Matt. 17:3<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"1173\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1173)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1173)\">1 Kgs. 17:1<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"11402\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11402)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11402)\">D&amp;C 110:13<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Yet with all of this, the Savior could see that Peter still lacked consistency. The Master knew him very well, as He does each of us. In the Bible, we read:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/full-conversion-brings-happiness.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you. \u2026 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art <span class=\"emphasis\">converted,<\/span> strengthen thy brethren.

It is a sobering reminder to each of us that knowing to do right, even ardently desiring to do right, is not enough. It is often very hard to actually do what we clearly know we should do. We read:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/full-conversion-brings-happiness.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cBut a certain maid beheld [Peter] \u2026 and said, This man was also with him.

And Peter said, Man, I am not. \u2026 Another confidently affirmed, \u2026 Of a truth this fellow also was with him: \u2026 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, \u2026 and \u2026 went out, and wept bitterly.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-22905_000_011\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31056\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31056)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31056)\">Luke 22:56\u201362<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/full-conversion-brings-happiness.p10\" class=\"\">As painful as that confirmation of prophecy must have been for Peter, his life began to change forever. He became that unwavering, rock-solid servant essential to the plan of the Father after the Crucifixion and Resurrection of the Savior. This tender passage also illustrates how very much the Savior loved Peter. Although He was in the midst of an overpowering challenge to His own life, with all of the weight of what was to transpire upon His shoulders, yet He turned and looked at Peter\u2014the love of a teacher transmitted to a beloved student, giving courage and enlightenment in time of need. Thereafter, Peter rose to the full stature of his calling. He taught with power and unshakable testimony despite threats, imprisonment, and beatings. He was truly converted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/full-conversion-brings-happiness.p11\" class=\"\">Sometimes the word <span class=\"emphasis\">converted<\/span> is used to describe when a sincere individual decides to be baptized. However, when properly used, <span class=\"emphasis\">conversion<\/span> means far more than that, for the new convert as well as the long-term member. With characteristic doctrinal clarity and precision, President Marion G. Romney explained conversion:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/full-conversion-brings-happiness.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cConverted means to turn from one belief or course of action to another. Conversion is a spiritual and moral change. <span class=\"emphasis\">Converted<\/span> implies not merely mental acceptance of Jesus and his teachings but also a motivating faith in him and his gospel. A faith which works a transformation, an actual change in one\u2019s understanding of life\u2019s meaning and in his allegiance to God in interest, in thought, and in conduct. In one who is really wholly converted, desire for things contrary to the gospel of Jesus Christ has actually died. And substituted therefore is a love of God, with a fixed and controlling determination to keep his commandments.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/full-conversion-brings-happiness.p13\" class=\"\">To be converted, you must remember to apply diligently in your life the key words \u201ca love of God, with a fixed and controlling determination to keep his commandments.\u201d Your happiness now and forever is conditioned on your degree of conversion and the transformation that it brings to your life. How then can you become truly converted? President Romney describes the steps you must follow:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/full-conversion-brings-happiness.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cMembership in the Church and conversion are not necessarily synonymous. Being converted and having a testimony are not necessarily the same thing either. A testimony comes when the Holy Ghost gives the earnest seeker a witness of the truth. A moving testimony vitalizes faith. That is, it induces repentance and obedience to the commandments. Conversion is the fruit or the reward for repentance and obedience.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-22905_000_011\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[In Conference Report, Guatemala Area Conference 1977, 8\u20139.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/full-conversion-brings-happiness.p15\" class=\"\">Stated simply, true conversion is the fruit of <span class=\"emphasis\">faith, repentance, <\/span>and <span class=\"emphasis\">consistent obedience.

As I repeat the explanation that Jesus gave His disciples of the parable of the sower, mentally examine your life.
