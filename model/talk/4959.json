She was now ten years old and facing another new school. Marcia\u2019s mother could see the concern on her daughter\u2019s face and sat down with her to discuss what was bothering her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p5\" class=\"\">Marcia talked about the challenge of joining classes at midterm and trying to get in step with the subject matter, teacher, and other students. Mother pledged her support to help Marcia make the adjustment. Then tears welled up in Marcia\u2019s eyes. In all honesty, she shared with her mother, \u201cI can overcome the difficulties with the academics and the new teachers.

But I like the word <span class=\"emphasis\">kindness <\/span>because it implies action. It seems like something you and I can do. Kindness can be shown in so many ways. My favorite examples of kindness come from what Jesus did. He spent his ministry searching for the weary, the sick, the poor, and the lonely, that he might show kindness toward them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p8\" class=\"\">The book of Mark in the New Testament tells us of the Savior\u2019s kind attention to a young girl.

President Ezra Taft Benson tells us that a person who is kind is sympathetic and gentle with others, is considerate of others\u2019 feelings, is courteous in his or her behavior, and has a helpful nature. He goes on to say, \u201cKindness pardons others\u2019 weaknesses and faults. Kindness is extended to all\u2014to the aged and the young, to animals, to those low of station as well as the high.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1986, p. 47.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p11\" class=\"\">Now, you might ask, \u201cWhat do the examples of Jesus and the words of the prophet mean in my life?\u201d Jesus has shown us the pattern of God\u2019s plan for us by his example. Our prophet, the head of the Church today, helps us learn how we can follow God\u2019s plan and return to live with Jesus and Heavenly Father. I know it will be rare that any of us will witness such a miracle of kindness as I have shared from the scriptures. Seldom are we asked to sacrifice our safety or comfort as Jesus did when he was challenged by his enemies or when he was physically worn down. However, I truly believe we can, each in our own way, practice being kind within our own families, among our friends, in our schools, and in our communities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p12\" class=\"\">Recently, I spoke with Merrie Miss girls about kind people in their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p13\" class=\"\">Kate and Laura were best friends. The two of them also included others in their circle of friends. This group of girls planned a party, inviting all in the group except Kate.

In his five years on earth, he knew little of the world of those who run, play hide-and-seek, skip rope, or feel free of pain. But he knew how he could feel better. When things were tough, when he suffered and those around him were weary and discouraged, he would hold up his arms and ask, \u201cLet me hold you?\u201d In his innocence, he knew he could kindly lift others\u2014even while he endured hardship.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p24\" class=\"\">It is important to develop the attribute of kindness even if we feel we are too shy or too busy. For some, like young Derek, it requires little forethought; for others who have not developed the natural inclination to be kind, it demands a greater effort.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p25\" class=\"\">The summers of my youth on the farm helped me appreciate and respect the world of insects and animals. I have always been fascinated by the industry of the honeybee. It is intent on its task to gather nectar. It looks for every opportunity to sink its tongue into the colorful and even not-so-colorful blossoms. It is not discouraged when it is not successful in finding nectar in a blossom, but seeks out its next opportunity with buzzing energy. While it is busy with the gathering of nectar, it in turn pollinates the blossoms to help them fulfill the measure of their creation. Finally, laden with success, it returns, and the nectar becomes the honey of the hive, nurturing not only itself, but the next generation of bees.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p26\" class=\"\">Now, you and I both know that the honeybee gathers nectar purely by instinct.

We can develop our own sort of \u201ckindness instinct\u201d by consciously seeking opportunities to act kindly. Wouldn\u2019t it be a fine world if we had a natural instinct for kindness and just couldn\u2019t help ourselves when we had the opportunity to be kind? We can nurture others with kindness, and our acts can become the sweet honey in this garden of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p28\" class=\"\">There may be times when we excuse ourselves for unkindness because we are not feeling our best or our mood is not just right. It is easy to act kindly toward others when things are going well in our lives.

None of us will experience anything equal to the physical pain and the mental anguish of Jesus on the cross. Yet at that moment of his great suffering, a thief hanging beside him \u201crailed on him.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32407\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32407)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32407)\">Luke 23:39<\/a><\/span>.) Jesus did not respond to him. The second thief rebuked the first and pleaded with the Savior to speak to the Father in his behalf. Jesus put aside his own suffering to console the thief. \u201cToday shalt thou be with me in paradise\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32408\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32408)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32408)\">Luke 23:43<\/a><\/span>), he told the thief. It would soon be over, and he would have relief. \u201c\u2018Twas a thief said the last kind word to Christ: Christ took the kindness and forgave the theft.\u201d (Robert Browning, <span class=\"emphasis\">Familiar Quotations,<\/span> comp.

Close to the end of his earthly ministry, Jesus met with his Apostles, giving them the sacrament and final instructions. Jesus took a towel, poured water in a basin, and began to wash and dry the feet of the disciples. Peter, one of the disciples, said, \u201cThou shalt never wash my feet.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29476\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29476)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29476)\">John 13:8<\/a><\/span>.) Perhaps Peter resisted because he felt that Jesus should not stoop to perform an act of this nature. But Jesus insisted, washing the feet of all of the Apostles, even the feet of Judas, whom he knew would soon betray him. After the Savior had washed their feet, he said unto them, \u201cKnow ye what I have done to you?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cYe call me Master and Lord: \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cIf I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p33\" class=\"\">\u201cFor I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p34\" class=\"\">\u201cIf ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29477\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29477)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29477)\">John 13:12\u201317<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p35\" class=\"\">He gave a commandment with a promise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p36\" class=\"\">The Savior promises to give us kindness eternally and unconditionally. \u201cFor the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6210\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6210)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6210)\">3 Ne. 22:10<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"25677\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25677)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25677)\">Isa. 54:10<\/a><\/span>.) \u201cWith everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6209\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6209)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6209)\">3 Ne. 22:8<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"25668\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25668)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25668)\">Isa. 5:8<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/kindness-a-part-of-gods-plan.p37\" class=\"\">The Merrie Miss motto is I Will Follow God\u2019s Plan for Me.
