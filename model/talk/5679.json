The Special Olympics are held each year to allow people with disabilities to enjoy friendly competition. We observed that as the runners were taking their positions for the fifty-yard dash, they were being encouraged by special friends affectionately known as huggers. Seconds before the start of the race, these huggers took their places at the finish line of the race. It didn\u2019t matter who crossed the finish line first. What did matter was that every runner completed the race and that every runner received a congratulatory hug. Both the courageous runners and the caring huggers taught important principles of truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/encircled-in-the-saviors-love.p5\" class=\"\">The Lord spoke in plainness, \u201cBe faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20247\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20247)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20247)\">D&amp;C 6:20<\/a><\/span>).

Our discipleship includes the sacred responsibility to follow His example of reaching out and loving those with disabilities.

Sensitive to her needs, several young women invited her to participate in the ward road show. Her family was invited to the performance. Mary\u2019s father wanted to know more about a church whose people cared enough about his daughter to include her.

Her body is afflicted with arthritis, and she suffers significant pain as she walks with the help of a cane. Every Sunday for nineteen years, she takes the hand of her daughter who is mentally disabled and, aided by a cane, shuffles two miles to attend church. Her calling as chorister in the Relief Society means everything to dear Sister Navarro. Her willingness to reach out to others is like a magnet for others to be of help to her disabled daughter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/encircled-in-the-saviors-love.p13\" class=\"\">The Savior in his infinite goodness allows all to enjoy. \u201cAll men are privileged the one like unto the other, and none are forbidden\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4614\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4614)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4614)\">2 Ne. 26:28<\/a><\/span>).
