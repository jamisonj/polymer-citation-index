Let me offer some thoughts on how to lengthen our stride in missionary work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p10\" class=\"\">First, too much of the missionaries\u2019 time is spent in finding people to teach. Ways must be found to increase the time missionaries spend in teaching. One of the best ways to do this is to make the \u201cevery member a missionary\u201d program work more effectively, with the members finding and fellowshipping people for the missionaries to teach.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">A three-point formula for members to be successful finding and fellowshipping missionaries consists of:<\/p>\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Living the gospel principles. Thousands join the Church each year as they are attracted to the Church by the life of a good member.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Beginning a gospel conversation by asking your friends and neighbors what they know about the Church. Whether they know little or much, we can follow with another question: \u201cWould you like to know more?\u201d If they would like to know more, invite them into your home to be taught the gospel by the missionaries. If it is impossible to invite them into your home, send their names to the missionaries so that they can follow up. Many of these referrals can give the missionaries the names of other interested persons, and this can go on indefinitely, if pursued with enthusiasm.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Inviting your friends and neighbors to Church meetings, socials, and other events. When they are fellowshipped, it is much easier for them to make the necessary social transition.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p15\" class=\"\">When the referral and fellowshipping program is effective, it makes it possible for the missionaries to spend more time teaching, resulting in more convert baptisms.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p16\" class=\"\">Another fruitful missionary field is part-member families. Thousands of our members have married nonmembers. Our goal is to fellowship these nonmembers, teach them and their families the missionary discussions, and, when they have received a testimony, bring them into the Church through the waters of baptism.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p17\" class=\"\">A large number of prospective elders have married nonmembers, and by teaching these part-member families, many of these men can be prepared for the Melchizedek Priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p18\" class=\"\">We would suggest that these part-member families be taught in groups. By teaching in groups, the strong strengthen the weaker ones and more convert baptisms result with less time and effort.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p19\" class=\"\">Another area deserving special attention is the size of our missionary staff. Although we now have more than 25,000 full-time missionaries, young men and women and older couples are needed in greatly increased numbers as more and more missions are organized in many parts of the world. President Kimball has asked that more and better-prepared missionaries from overseas stakes and missions be called, and this is being accomplished. Since many of these missionaries, particularly those called from overseas areas, are not able to meet the entire cost of their missions, priesthood quorums and Church members can assist these missionaries by making contributions to the Church Missionary Fund.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p20\" class=\"\">Recently, a quorum president, in sending in a contribution, closed his letter by saying, \u201cWe are thrilled with the progress reports we receive and hope we can be a part of an increased effort in sharing the gospel.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p21\" class=\"\">A sister living in California wrote, \u201cI feel impressed to send another check to the Church Missionary Fund. What greater work is there than this? I love the gospel and couldn\u2019t live without it. I am so excited about the family fellowshipping missionary program. The Lord is leading me to families and also to single people\u2014in fact, this Sunday several of them are coming to church with me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p22\" class=\"\">These are typical of many testimonies that we receive constantly, and I want to commend those who are giving of their means to this great missionary work. Many of these contributions, though small, represent a real sacrifice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p23\" class=\"\">We now have thousands of stake missionaries, but we could use the services of thousands more. It is recommended that each new convert be given a position in the Church, and many of these new converts would make excellent stake missionaries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p24\" class=\"\">With the reorganization of the First Quorum of the Seventy by President Kimball last October, renewed emphasis has been placed on stake missionary work. The First Quorum of the Seventy has the responsibility to strengthen the quorums of seventies in the stakes and to promote the work of the stake missions. We are emphasizing the importance of these stake missionaries coordinating their missionary efforts with those of the full-time missionaries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p25\" class=\"\">Another area that must not be overlooked is our men and women that are serving in the military. It may surprise you to know there are some 20,000 members of the Church in the military service. These men and women can be, and many are, real missionaries. As they live their religion, they are respected and admired by their associates. This group can be instrumental in bringing untold numbers of converts into the Church and developing thousands of referrals each year for the missionaries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p26\" class=\"\">Yes, the \u201cevery member a missionary\u201d program is inspired. As these suggestions I have made and others are utilized, Church members can find the people for the missionaries to teach; and as they are being taught, the members can fellowship them before and after their baptism. And truly as the apostle Paul wrote to the Ephesians, \u201cYe are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21898\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21898)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21898)\">Eph. 2:19<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p27\" class=\"\">May we get the vision of more than 3 1\/2 million member missionaries bringing souls into the kingdom of God and feeling the joy and happiness that comes from missionary work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p28\" class=\"\">And again, to all seekers of truth: A new life-style awaits those who accept the restored gospel and let it work in their lives; truly they will find the answer to their question, \u201cWhat is the purpose of life?\u201d We encourage you to investigate \u201cMormonism\u201d\u2014The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p29\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, we are engaged in building the kingdom of God.
