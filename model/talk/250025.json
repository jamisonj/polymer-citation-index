We are not always able to determine with certainty the character of any transaction&#x2014;that is to say, of the spirit and motive that influence and promote action&#x2014;merely from what we see, nor yet from what somebody may tell us. It is necessary that we become enlightened by the Holy Spirit, to enable us to see as God sees, and to understand the motives, purposes and designs of the hearts of our fellow men. God judges us all according to the motives and designs of the heart.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"92120\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 92120)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(92120)\">D&amp;C 137:9<\/a><\/span> If our purpose is to do good, and that which is right in His sight, he judges us accordingly, though we may, through our weakness, or through circumstances that we are not always able to control, do things that are not strictly in their outward appearance right and correct, or we may neglect to do that which we should do. The Lord judges all men according to the motives that prompt the action, rather than from the action itself. It is not murder in the sight of heaven always, when a man is killed, for sometimes he brings his blood upon his own head by thrusting himself upon some other one to destroy him and is himself slain in the attack, and his blood is therefore upon his own head, and it is not counted murder to the man that slew him. The one who only saw a part of the transaction might accuse the other of murder; but when it comes to be sifted to the foundation, and both hearts can be scanned, and the cause that resulted in the conflict discovered, it is found that the man that slew is innocent, and the man that was slain is the guilty one. I refer to this as a sample. So with many of the transactions of life. So also we may neglect duties that we should attend to, but we neglect them in our ignorance, when we are <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"195b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0195.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;195b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8949\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> uninformed, and the Lord does not lay it to our charge until we are better instructed and our defects pointed out to us. Then if we neglect them He holds us responsible for that neglect. So also we may do things that in themselves are not right, not strictly correct, and yet if we are not posted and are ignorant of the evil of the transaction, it is not imputed to us as evil. This is the doctrine that Jesus laid down. &#x201C;That servant, which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"67655\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 67655)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(67655)\">Luke 12:47-48<\/a><\/span> That is, a few stripes shall be meted out to him merely to vindicate the law, and to make an impression upon him that what he had done was wrong, though he was ignorant of it before; but a little punishment is meted out, just enough to satisfy and vindicate the law, and to correct the impression upon the individual, to show him that he must be careful, for he had trodden upon forbidden ground. This is a rule that our Father is governed by in judging His children, and it is a rule that we should strive also to be governed by in regard to one another, and especially those who are called to be judges in Israel, or whose calling and duty it is to settle difficulties and assist in adjusting differences among their brethren and sisters. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n642\"> &#x201C;And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"58103\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 58103)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(58103)\">Isa. 11:4<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n643\"> I understand this to be a figurative expression of the Prophet Isaiah: the rod of His mouth by which He should smite the earth.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"90669\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 90669)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(90669)\">D&amp;C 113:3<\/a><\/span> I understand that to be the word that proceeded out of His mouth, the words given  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"196a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0196.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;196a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8948\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>of His Father; for His word was that which He received from the Father, and that which goeth forth among the children of men, conquering and to conquer.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"79244\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 79244)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(79244)\">Rev. 6:2<\/a><\/span> It is that word that has made impressions upon the Latter-day Saints in other lands and countries where they were born, and brought them to believe and obey the Gospel, and gathered them to this land.

It always did produce a separation between the righteous and the wicked.  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"198a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0198.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;198a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8946\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>It drew the line of distinction. It was always like putting yeast into a beer barrel. It sets it to working, and whoever has examined a beer barrel while the beer is working in it under a microscope, will see the way that the beer works itself clear. It is by the different properties it contains running in different directions. You will see the liquid full of little animals running in different directions, and it continues to work in this sort of a way until it becomes clear. Well, the working of beer in a barrel reminds me of the preaching of the Gospel in the earth. It sets Saints to running together. It works out apostates from among us, and they take the opposite direction. It draws the line of distinction between the righteous and the wicked, and that work begins from the moment the Gospel is sounded among the people. The Spirit of truth operates upon the hearts of those who are open to receive it. It draws them to the fountain of life and light. It draws them into the water and then to Zion, and then keeps drawing them nearer and nearer to God; while with those that reject the Gospel, they keep going further and further from the Lord and His people. They harden their hearts more and more against them, and give way to wickedness and all manner of corruption. But while the wicked on the one hand are thus filling up their cup of iniquity, the righteous, on the other hand are called to sanctify themselves and be prepared for the glorious coming of the Savior. It is for this cause that we build temples, and that God reveals to us the ordinances for the sanctification of His people and further glory and exaltation. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n660\"> The ordinance of baptism, simple as it is, is appointed by the Father <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"198b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0198.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;198b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8946\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> as the firstfruits of repentance&#x2014;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"83588\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 83588)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(83588)\">Moro. 8:25<\/a><\/span>that is, baptism in water for the remission of sins.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129095\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129095)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129095)\">2 Ne. 31:17<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"129096\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129096)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129096)\">D&amp;C 33:11<\/a><\/span> He did not appoint Presbyterian baptisms and Roman Catholic baptisms, sprinkling a little water on the forehead and calling that baptism.

But does this apply to the wicked, to the disobedient, or to the unbelieving? No, not at all; nor does remission of sins come to the wicked and unbelieving by merely being baptized. We have an example of this kind in the New Testament when Philip baptized the people of Samaria, and Simon the sorcerer, was baptized also; but he was a hypocrite and a corrupt man, and he only sought to gain power whereby he might hoodwink and deceive the people and filch money from them.

Simple as the ordinances are, simple to look upon and to think upon, there is power in them, power accompanies them, power is made manifest among the people. The people are gathered together; the people are made one; the differences that existed among us depart. The traditions of the fathers are cast away. We are united in receiving the light and truth from above. Our hearts are made as one, no matter where we were born, or what race of people we have sprung from. This spirit working among the people, and going abroad in the earth is accomplishing what the Lord and His servants have predicted.

It follows us up. When we were a small people organized resistance and persecution commenced by townships in the United States. As we grew and became a stronger people, more extensive organizations were arrayed against us by counties or larger communities. At first the Latter-day Saints were driven from their homes in the State of New York, and they fled to Kirtland, Ohio, where persecution was again waged against them, until by and by the opposition was combined to such an extent in all the surrounding country, that they were obliged to flee from that region to <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"200b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0200.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;200b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8944\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> Missouri. Here opposition became still more extensive until the whole State rose up against them&#x2014;rose up and became a mob, even Governor Lilburn W. Boggs, of Missouri, became a sort of Solicitor General for the mob, and issued an exterminating order against the Saints, as utterly illegal as the decree of any tyrant that ever lived. In that order he called upon his aids and principal generals to rally the militia of the State to execute the order of extermination that he issued. They despoiled us of our goods. They compelled us to sign a deed of trust of lands, houses and possessions to defray the expenses of the &#x201C;war,&#x201D; as they termed it. That is, they robbed us, and drove us out of the State, and then compelled us to give them what we had, to pay them for doing it. Persecution still followed us in the States of Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri, and finally the Saints fled to these Rocky Mountains where there was nobody to oppose us, save the savages who roamed throughout the country. Here the Lord has planted our feet and made us strong. But it was predicted in early times that we should not only be persecuted by townships and counties, but by and by States should rise against us, and at last the whole United States would rise up against us. But in the midst of it all we have continued to grow, we have waxed strong. It is the power of God and not of man. It is by the word of God that we thrive.
