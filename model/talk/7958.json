As a young teenager, he was troubled by the religious turmoil in his community and wanted to know which of all the churches was true. The wooded area close to his home became a holy place as he knelt among the trees and offered his first vocal prayer. His prayer was answered, and today Latter-day Saints refer to these woods as the Sacred Grove.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/your-holy-places.p8\" class=\"\">Young women around the world stand in holy places in nature at Young Women camp. A leader shared with me the story of one young woman\u2019s experience. This girl was less active and was a bit skeptical about having a spiritual experience in the woods. After the first day, she reported to the leader, \u201cI\u2019m having a great time, but could we please cut out all of the talk about the Spirit? I\u2019m here to camp, enjoy nature, be with my friends, and have some fun!\u201d However, at the concluding testimony meeting, this same girl tearfully admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go home. How can I have what I am feeling right now, this Spirit, with me all the time?\u201d She had discovered a holy place.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/your-holy-places.p9\" class=\"\">Another holy place in Joseph Smith\u2019s life was his own bedroom. This may be hard to believe because, like many of you, he shared his bedroom with siblings. It became a holy place when he prayed with great faith, humility, and need. He explained, \u201cAfter I had retired to my bed for the night, I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-10705_000_045\">4<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124342\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124342)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124342)\">Joseph Smith\u2014History 1:29<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> The three years which had passed since Joseph had the vision in the Sacred Grove had not been easy. Seventeen-year-old Joseph had endured endless mockery, ridicule, and bullying. But that night in Joseph\u2019s bedroom, the angel Moroni appeared in answer to his pleadings. Joseph received knowledge and comfort. That night, his bedroom became a holy place.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/your-holy-places.p10\" class=\"\">While watching a Mormon Message for Youth, I witnessed another bedroom that had become a holy place.

She says, \u201cIt is good to know we have a place where we can get away from the things of the world and receive sacred ordinances and help those who couldn\u2019t receive them in this life.\u201d As she speaks, the video shows Ingrid reading her scriptures, surrounded by Mormonads, quotations, a Personal Progress book, pictures of her family and the temple, and yes, her favorite stuffed animals.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-10705_000_045\">5<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See \u201cPractice, Celebration, Dedication: Temple Blessings in El Salvador,\u201d lds.org\/youth\/video.]<\/span><\/sup> Perhaps without even realizing it, she has created her holy place away from the things of the world.

There were no degrading or belittling remarks, no profanity. Instead, we heard words of encouragement and love. We exercised kindness. It was a happy place. The band room was filled with the Spirit as we practiced and performed music. The room was like this in large measure because of the influence of the band instructor. He was a good Christian man. Looking back, high school was a refining place. It was difficult, but I learned resilience.
