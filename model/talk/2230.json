There has been here an overwhelming spiritual endowment, attesting, no doubt, that in all likelihood we are in the presence of personages, seen and unseen, who are in attendance. Who knows but that even our Lord and Master would be near us on such an occasion as this, for we, and the world, must never forget that this is his church, and under his almighty direction we are to serve! Indeed, I would remind you what he declared in a similar conference of Saints in Fayette, New York, and undoubtedly would remind us again today.

There, in prayerful meditation, I looked upon the paintings of those men of God\u2014true, pure men, God\u2019s noblemen\u2014who had preceded me in a similar calling.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/may-the-kingdom-of-god-go-forth.p17\" class=\"\">A few days ago in the early morning hours, in my private study at home and all alone with my thoughts, I read the tributes paid to each of the Presidents by those who had been most closely associated with each of them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/may-the-kingdom-of-god-go-forth.p18\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith was the one whom the Lord raised up from boyhood and endowed with divine authority and taught the things necessary for him to know and to obtain the priesthood and to lay the foundation for God\u2019s kingdom in these latter days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/may-the-kingdom-of-god-go-forth.p19\" class=\"\">There was President Brigham Young, who was foreordained before this world was, for his divine calling to lead the persecuted Saints in fleeing from the wrath that threatened the Saints in those early gathering places in Missouri and Illinois and to pioneer the building of an inland commonwealth in the tops of these majestic mountains, to fulfill God\u2019s purposes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/may-the-kingdom-of-god-go-forth.p20\" class=\"\">To look upon the features of President John Taylor was to gain a realization that here was one, as President Joseph F.

Smith. As I looked upon his noble stature. I thought of the nine-year-old boy helping his widowed mother across the plains and the 15-year-old missionary on the slopes of Haleakala on the isle of Maui being strengthened by a heavenly vision with his uncle, Joseph Smith. It was he who presided during the stormy days when an antagonistic press maligned the Church, but his was the steady arm by the Lord\u2019s appointment to carry off the Church triumphantly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/may-the-kingdom-of-god-go-forth.p24\" class=\"\">I suppose I never drew closer to the meaning of a divine calling than when President Heber J.

As his picture looked down upon me, there came again to my mind the prophetic words of his inspired blessing when I was ordained in the holy temple trader his hands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/may-the-kingdom-of-god-go-forth.p25\" class=\"\">President George Albert Smith was a disciple of friendship and love.

It has never been so, but from the beginning some one that understands the Spirit and counsel of the Almighty, that knows the Church, and is known of her, is the character that will lead the Church.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> vol. 1, p. 123.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/may-the-kingdom-of-god-go-forth.p31\" class=\"\">As I have known of the lives of those who have preceded me, I have been made aware that each seemed to have had his special mission for his day and time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/may-the-kingdom-of-god-go-forth.p32\" class=\"\">Then, with searching introspection, I thought of myself and my experiences of which Orson Hyde\u2019s appraisal had made reference. Then I recalled the words of the Prophet Joseph\u2019s characterization of himself, which seemed somewhat analogous to myself.

I suppose, by experiences, that I too might overcome and become a polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/may-the-kingdom-of-god-go-forth.p35\" class=\"\">Maybe it was necessary that I too must learn obedience by the things that I might have suffered\u2014to give me experiences that were for my good, to see if I could pass some of the various tests of mortality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/may-the-kingdom-of-god-go-forth.p36\" class=\"\">In the selection of my noble counselors, President N.
