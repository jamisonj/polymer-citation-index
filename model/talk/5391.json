Someone said, \u201cThe one who doesn\u2019t live to serve doesn\u2019t serve to live\u201d\u2014wise words which are applied to each priesthood holder. Another word to describe the priesthood is <span class=\"emphasis\">service;<\/span> literally, every man who receives the priesthood is \u201ccalled to serve.\u201d The Apostle Peter said about you, \u201cBut ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2439\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2439)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2439)\">1 Pet. 2:9<\/a><\/span>). I will illustrate with one story.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p4\" class=\"\">Mar\u00eda Coj was a seventeen-year-old member of the Church, the oldest of eight children. She was sick with cysticercosis, a parasitic infection that comes from eating contaminated food, that with time spread to her brain, causing terrible headaches and then blindness. To give her relief from the pain, it was necessary to move her from her home in Solol\u00e1 to Guatemala City. Because of convulsions caused by the advances of the illness, her condition worsened, and it was only with life-support systems that she was kept alive. It was evident that she could not live long under those conditions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p5\" class=\"\">At this same time, Erika Alonzo, a twelve-year-old and partially blind member of the Church, traveled twenty-two hours by bus from Honduras to Guatemala City to receive an eye operation. For two weeks she waited for an acceptable cornea from the United States to be transplanted to her eye, but none was available.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p6\" class=\"\">At this same time Mar\u00eda died. Because her blindness was caused by pressure to her brain, her corneas were healthy. Mar\u00eda\u2019s father and mother authorized the cornea donation. The operation was a success.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p7\" class=\"\">On the twelfth of July 1993, Erika traveled to Solol\u00e1 to meet the Coj family for the first time. The surprised family asked her, \u201cCan you see?\u201d She answered, \u201cI see everything clearly.\u201d It was a spiritual meeting. Sister Coj, who did not understand much Spanish because her native language is Cakchiquel, felt the love and the spirit of the conversation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p8\" class=\"\">Because of the donation of Mar\u00eda\u2019s eyes, Erika can now see and enjoy everything around her. The death of one person and the love of her parents blessed the life of another. The medical miracle of one person being able to look through eyes of another is a surprising reality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p9\" class=\"\">Spiritually speaking, as you Aaronic Priesthood youth contemplate the blessings of this life and of eternity through the eyes of your faithful parents, teachers, bishops, Apostles, and prophets, you will discover that, through the small donations of daily time to ponder, pray, and study the scriptures, they will teach you of the divine that is in you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p10\" class=\"\">Expand your vision and recognize that you have ties with God; lift your sight and live worthy of the priesthood that you hold. Learn in your youth to control your passions, desires, and appetites. Seriously prepare yourselves to fulfill your glorious responsibility to preach the truths of the Restoration, which are that Jesus is the Christ and that salvation comes only through Him, that Joseph Smith was a prophet who was instructed by divine messengers to restore with power and authority all covenants and ordinances that are found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p11\" class=\"\">In each priesthood holder should burn the personal conviction that the mission of Jesus Christ was unique: The Son of the Eternal Heavenly Father and of a mortal mother, especially chosen, He became the Only Begotten Son of God, which qualified Him to be the Mediator, Savior, and Redeemer of mankind. Even though He was slandered, spit upon, slapped, whipped, and humiliated, \u201cyet he opened not his mouth\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25715\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25715)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25715)\">Isa. 53:7<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p12\" class=\"\">He died at an early age; He was strong and young, of unlimited wisdom. When you are thirty-three, you will understand better. His sacrifice was painful but indispensable. He was the first to be resurrected, clothed in glory and eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p13\" class=\"\">The atonement of the Son of God opened the possibility that all mankind could return to the presence of the Father. Now He teaches us, \u201cFollow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4550\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4550)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4550)\">2 Ne. 31:12<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p14\" class=\"\">It will be your privilege to serve two years as a missionary with an eye single to glorify God and build His kingdom (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"19743\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19743)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19743)\">D&amp;C 4:5<\/a><\/span>). During that time, Christ will refine your spirit. He will mold your character and plant in your heart the principles that will permit you to live in righteousness and joy in this life and for eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p15\" class=\"\">You might think that you will sacrifice much to leave your family, your education, and your comfortable life. Others might complain that missionary life is rigorous. The thousands who have served will testify to you that when you count your blessings, sacrifice does not exist.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p16\" class=\"\">I would like to share an experience of faith. Being the only child, Elder Hermelindo Coy said good-bye to his mother and left for the first time in his life his small village in the mountains of Senah\u00fa, Guatemala. He entered the Missionary Training Center the fourteenth of March 1991. Although he had been a member of the Church for only two years and also very timid about talking to people, his determination to serve was great. His formal education was less than five years of elementary school in his native language of Kekchi. Spanish, the official language of Guatemala, was foreign to him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p17\" class=\"\">During his mission he learned to live with pain in his leg. He rarely complained. In August 1992 he noticed that in addition to the increase in the pain, something was abnormal about his knee. He had a medical exam\u2014the diagnosis: <span class=\"emphasis\">bone cancer.<\/span> A more careful exam revealed cancer in the liver, lungs, and lymphatic system; in other words, his illness was terminal. He did not understand the nature of the illness nor its seriousness. With the help of a translator and using examples from the farm life with which he was familiar, he understood that he had little time to live.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p18\" class=\"\">He never asked, Why is this happening to me? He did not lament, nor express negative feelings. He was obedient to all that was required of him. He was asked if he would like to return home, but he asked to remain in the mission and serve as long as possible, even until his death. By October of the same year, he walked with difficulty, requiring the use of a cane. He could work only a few hours each day. By December he was unable to walk. For the first time he was discouraged because he could not proselyte. His worry was always who would take care of his mother after he died.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p19\" class=\"\">In one of his visits, the mission president asked him to teach more of the basic doctrine to his mother, who, along with mission nurses, was providing twenty-four-hour care. When he taught the plan of salvation to his mother in his native tongue, his face radiated assurance and light. Elder Coy was understanding with power and conviction what he was teaching.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p20\" class=\"\">As his strength declined, he placed his complete trust in the Lord. On one occasion when the pain was very strong, he expressed in prayer, \u201cHeavenly Father, I do not know the day nor the hour that I will die, but I want to know soon from thee about my new assignment.\u201d He died in February 1993. His death blessed all the missionaries, leaders, members, and even nonmembers who learned of his courage to serve and endure to the end. His faith was so simple that it was contagious. He never feared death. He strengthened all who knew him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/an-eternal-vision.p21\" class=\"\">My beloved youth, I promise you that as you serve with faith as did Elder Coy, and as you look through the eyes of your parents and leaders who love you also, your testimony will be strengthened, your vision will expand, which will illuminate all who are spiritually blind and will help them to return to Christ. Arise and shine; be like the over forty-nine thousand missionaries who today are taking the light, hope, and knowledge to those who need it. I add my own testimony of the divinity of this work in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
