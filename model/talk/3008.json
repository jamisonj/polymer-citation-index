After thinking many hours on this assignment, I am persuaded to make a few remarks in an attempt to teach a principle that, if understood and practiced, will make us all more effective in this God-given responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-fathers-duty-to-foster-the-welfare-of-his-family.p5\" class=\"\">We have great concern about the growing number of homes in the Church where the influence of a father is hardly felt. In more and more families the mother and children are left to carry out the father\u2019s duties as well as their own. Divorce, pursuit of wealth, and indifference to sacred things are only three of many reasons why fathers neglect the welfare of their families. In this life a father is never released from his responsibility. We call bishops, and they serve for a time and are released. Stake presidents likewise are called, serve, and are released. But a father\u2019s calling is an eternal calling if he lives worthily.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-fathers-duty-to-foster-the-welfare-of-his-family.p6\" class=\"\">In 1 Timothy we read some rather sobering words from the Lord:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-fathers-duty-to-foster-the-welfare-of-his-family.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cBut if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2858\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2858)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2858)\">1 Tim. 5:8<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-fathers-duty-to-foster-the-welfare-of-his-family.p8\" class=\"\">The positive definition of the word <span class=\"emphasis\">welfare<\/span> is \u201chappiness, prosperity, and well-being.\u201d The father\u2019s duty is to foster the happiness, prosperity, and well-being of each family member. He is to \u201cprovide \u2026 for his own.\u201d He does this when he provides spiritual and temporal leadership to family members. He provides for the welfare of each family member as he sees their needs and provides a way to help each one satisfy those needs. Of course, when there is no father in the home, the head of the household must assume these duties.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/the-fathers-duty-to-foster-the-welfare-of-his-family.p9\" class=\"\">We can learn from Brigham Young\u2019s example.

It has been wisely said that \u2018that which is worth doing is worth doing well.\u2019 If a man is to drive the plow, let him do it well; if only to cut bolts, make good ones; if to blow the bellows, keep the iron hot.

Not only through his observations but also in personal interviews the father evaluates his family\u2019s needs.

This would be a time when the father would not monopolize the conversation but rather would lead out with a simple, well-chosen question or two and then sit back and listen. There is nothing that can take the place of a listening father. His ears and heart must both be in tune.

Remember, fathers, you are always teaching\u2014for good or for ill. Your family is learning your ways and beliefs.
