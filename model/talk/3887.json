We are grateful for the increasing numbers of young men and couples who are serving missions. We assure you that there is no more important thing you can do than prepare for a mission by prayerfully studying the scriptures, keeping yourselves morally clean, and conducting your temporal and spiritual lives with the goal of a mission firmly in mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/our-responsibility-to-take-the-gospel-to-the-ends-of-the-earth.p33\" class=\"\">I have tried to teach you according to your covenants as members of the Church and as priesthood bearers.
