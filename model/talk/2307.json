She was in one location in the Salt Lake Valley and he was to come from another nearby town. Heavy snows and winds had closed the highways during the night and early morning hours. After many hours of anxious waiting, some of us were able to help them get to the temple and complete their marriage plans before the day was over.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/in-his-strength.p4\" class=\"\">How grateful they, their families, and friends were for the assistance and concern in their keeping this most important appointment.

Often this is done for self-convenience and an unwillingness to listen. Countless numbers today reject Joseph Smith and his message because they will not accept a 14-year-old \u201cnobody.\u201d Others turn away from eternal restored truths available today because they will not accept a 19-year-old elder or a 21-year-old lady missionary or a neighbor down the street because they are \u201cnobody,\u201d so they may suppose.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/in-his-strength.p16\" class=\"\">There is no doubt in my mind that one of the reasons our Savior Jesus Christ was rejected and crucified was because in the eyes of the world he was blindly viewed as a \u201cnobody,\u201d humbly born in a manger, an advocate of such strange doctrine as \u201cPeace on earth, good will toward men\u201d [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"31857\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31857)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31857)\">Luke 2:14<\/a><\/span>].<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/in-his-strength.p17\" class=\"\">I bear witness to you and the world that Joseph Smith knew with earth-shattering impact he was \u201csomebody\u201d when, in answer to humble prayer, God appeared with his Son, Jesus Christ, and spoke unto Joseph, calling him by name.

I have never met this missionary\u2019s mother or father, probably never will, but wherever they are, in my mind they are \u201csomebody\u201d just to have him for their son.
