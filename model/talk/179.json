McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1945, pp. 119-124<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nAs I listened to that inspiring rendition of \"O My Father,\" I thought, music is truly the\nuniversal language, and when it is excellently expressed how deeply it moves our souls!\n<\/p><p>\nThough the exigencies of war have limited the attendance, this is a great conference. It is\ngreat because we have had from the first meeting, throughout all the sessions, an outpouring\nof the Spirit of the Lord. You have all felt it. The brethren who have spoken have been\nblessed and inspired by it. Now, you leaders in the priesthood have a double mission and will\nreceive a double blessing, as you carry the spirit of this conference out to your wards and\nstakes.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat I am going to say tonight I wish could be said to the people out in the stakes, because\ntwo-thirds of what I have in mind will apply to them; one-third possibly to\nyou brethren. So I am going to ask that you give it to the young people especially in your\nwards.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are three very remarkable parables recorded by Luke in the fifteenth chapter\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31149\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31149)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31149)\">Luke 15:1-32<\/a><\/span>). They are\ncalled the parables of the lost and found. Usually whenever they are referred to, the principles\nof repentance and forgiveness are emphasized, and the rejoicing over the lost, because the lost\nhas been found. To that phase of the parable I am not going to refer tonight, except to say\nthat I think that part of these parables is sometimes misinterpreted, or at least misapplied.\nThere is another phase of these parables which appeals to me even more than the rejoicing,\nand that is what I want to speak about tonight. I desire to refer to the conditions that\ncontributed to their being lost.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE MEANING OF THE PARABLE OF THE LOST SHEEP\n<\/p><p>\nThe scene is a gathering of publicans and sinners who have assembled, it seems, in quite large\nnumbers to hear the message of Jesus. Standing out are pictured Pharisees and Sadducees who\nare sneering at the Man of Nazareth who is speaking to these publicans and sinners, and the\nPharisees and Sadducees are judging him, I suppose, by the company he is keeping. By the\nSadducees, the publicans and sinners are looked upon as lost. To the multitude Jesus speaks\nthree parables. The first, the parable of the lost sheep:\n<\/p><p>\nWhat man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety\nand nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31150\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31150)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31150)\">Luke 15:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI ask you tonight, how did that sheep get lost? He was not rebellious. If you follow the\ncomparison, the lamb was seeking its livelihood in a perfectly legitimate manner, but either\nstupidly, perhaps unconsciously, it followed the enticement of the field, the prospect of better\ngrass until it got out beyond the fold and was lost.\n<\/p><p>\nSo we have those in the Church, young men and young women, who wander away from the\nfold in perfectly legitimate ways. They are seeking success, success in business, success in\ntheir professions, and before long they become disinterested in Church and finally\ndisconnected from the fold; they have lost track of what true success is, perhaps stupidly,\nperhaps unconsciously, in some cases, perhaps willingly. They are blind to what constitutes\ntrue success.\n<\/p><p>\nTRUE SUCCESS\n<\/p><p>\nJesus gave an apt definition of success, I think, when he spoke of Mary Magdalene, saying,\n\"She hath done what she could\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32986\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32986)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32986)\">Mark 14:8<\/a><\/span>).\nTrue success is reaching the level of our best in our\nassociation with our fellowmen. Many of these wandering away as the lost sheep are\nseeking success for selfish purposes, not for the benefit of their fellow-men.\nSee the difference?\n<\/p><p>\nOver twenty years ago we had a truly excellent group of missionaries in the European\nMission. I have been interested in watching them during the intervening years. One of these\nwas a brilliant missionary, and he was faithful. He came home, completed his education, and\nsucceeded in obtaining a high position in his profession. For twenty years now he has been\nfollowing that profession. He is successful in it, but he has gone so far, and has so little\ncontact with the flock, the body of the Church, that he hesitates about affiliating himself with\nit.\n<\/p><p>\nThere was another missionary who came home about the same time who also started out to\nsucceed, and he has succeeded. He is a prominent business man in this city, highly successful;\nbut he has always kept in touch with the Church. I think he is a success. He has succeeded in\nhis business, but he has used his means to help the Church of Christ; he is in the fold. There\nis no need of striking out in selfishness, thinking you have to leave the Church in order to\nsucceed. In the Church we can ask God's help to guide us.\n<\/p><p>\nYou remember the story of the business man who went into his private office in the morning\nand closed the door, and one of his agents\ncame in and said to the secretary: \"I want to see the manager.\" The secretary answered: \"He is\nin conference.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"I have come a long way to see him, I want to see him this morning, I cannot wait.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well, he is in conference.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe man arrogantly pushed by the secretary, opened the door of the manager's office and then\nquietly closed it, and apologetically said: \"I did not know that he is that kind of man.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSaid the secretary: \"I told you that he was in conference.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe man was on his knees asking God's aid that day in his business.\n<\/p><p>\nI ask our young men at home who are striking out in legitimate enterprises to remember that\ntrue success is not just in achieving that one aim, but in keeping in touch with the\norganization in which they can serve their fellow men, in which they can live to the level of\ntheir best.\n<\/p><p>\nAN APPLICATION OF THE PARABLE OF THE LOST COIN\n<\/p><p>\nThe second parable is the parable of the lost coin\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31151\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31151)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31151)\">Luke 15:8-10<\/a><\/span>).\nA woman lost it and, looking in vain to\nfind it, called in the neighbors to help her search for it.\n<\/p><p>\nIn this case the thing lost was not in itself responsible. The one who had been trusted with\nthat coin had, through carelessness or neglect, mislaid it or dropped it. There is a difference,\nand this is the one-third, which I think applies to us tonight. Our charge is not only coins, but\nliving souls of children, youth, and adults. They are our charges. Some of\nthem may be wandering tonight because of the neglect of the ward teachers whose duty it is\nto&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\n. . . watch over the Church always, and be with and strengthen them; And see that there is no\niniquity in the Church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil\nspeaking (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12090\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12090)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12090)\">D&amp;C 20:53-54<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nand to see that each one does his duty. Someone may be wandering because of the careless\nremark of a girl of her age in Mutual, (and I have in mind a case), and the president of the\nMutual lets her go, fails to follow her next Tuesday night and invite her to come. Another\nmay be lost because of the inactivity of the Sunday School teacher, or the indifference of the\nSunday School teacher who is satisfied with the fifteen people there that morning, instead of\nthinking of the fifteen who are wandering because of neglect. I will just summarize this\nthought by calling your attention to a little rhyme that is in one of the deacon's manuals. The\npoetry is not excellent, but the thought is applicable:\n<\/p><p>\nHe stood at the crossroads all alone,<br \/>\nThe sunlight in his face;<br \/>\nHe had no thought for the world unknown,<br \/>\nHe was set for a manly race.<br \/>\nBut the road stretched east, and the road stretched west, <br \/>\nAnd the lad knew not which road was best;<br \/>\nSo he chose the road that led him down,<br \/>\nAnd he lost the race and the victor's crown.<br \/>\nHe was caught at last in an angry snare;<br \/>\nBecause no one stood at the crossroads there,<br \/>\nTo show him the better way.\n<\/p><p>\n(That is the lost coin).\n<\/p><p>\nAnother day, at the selfsame place,<br \/>\nA lad with high hopes stood;<br \/>\nHe, too, was set for a manly race&mdash;<br \/>\nAnd was seeking the things that were good; <br \/>\nBut one was there who the roads did know. <br \/>\nAnd that one showed him which way to go. <br \/>\nSo he turned from the road that led him down, <br \/>\nAnd he won the race and the victor's crown. <br \/>\nHe walks today the highway fair,<br \/>\nBecause one stood at the crossroads there<br \/>\nTo show him the better road.\n<\/p><p>\nOur responsibility is to keep the trust that God has reposed in us, calling us to guard these\nprecious souls.\n<\/p><p>\nPARABLE OF THE PRODIGAL SON APPLIED TO YOUTH OF TODAY\n<\/p><p>\nThe third parable is the prodigal son (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31154\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31154)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31154)\">Luke 15:11-32<\/a><\/span>),\nthe \"younger son,\" we are told, so he was immature in\nhis judgment. He was irking under the restraint, and he rather resented the father's careful\nguiding eye. He evidently longed for so-called freedom, wanted, so to speak, to try\nhis wings. So he said, \"Father, give me my portion, and I will go\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31155\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31155)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31155)\">Luke 15:12<\/a><\/span>). The\nfather gave him his portion, and out the lad went.\n<\/p><p>\nHere is a case of volition, here is choice, deliberate choice. Here is, in a way, rebellion\nagainst authority. And what did he do? He spent his means in riotous living, he wasted his\nportion with harlots. That is the way they are lost.\n<\/p><p>\nYouth who start out to indulge their appetites and passions are on the downward road to\napostasy as sure as the sun rises in the east. I do not confine it to youth; any man or woman\nwho starts out on that road of intemperance, of dissolute living will separate himself or herself\nfrom the fold as inevitably as darkness follows the day.\n<\/p><p>\n\"My spirit shall not always strive with man\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23497\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23497)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23497)\">Gen. 6:3<\/a><\/span>),\nsays the Lord. \"My spirit will not\ndwell in an unclean tabernacle\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50070\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50070)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50070)\">Mosiah 2:37<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50071\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50071)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50071)\">Hel. 4:24<\/a><\/span>).\nHe who tries to live a double life, who does live a double\nlife in violation of his covenants, to quote one author, \"is either a knave or a fool.\" Often he\nis both, because he himself is using his free agency to gratify his passions, to waste his\nsubstance in riotous living, to violate the covenants that he has made in the house of God.\n<\/p><p>\nIn such cases there is little we can do but warn and plead until the recreant, as the prodigal\nson, at last \"comes to himself\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31156\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31156)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31156)\">Luke 15:17<\/a><\/span>).\nI am simply trying to picture how these three different\nparables can be applied to our own groups.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE WAY TO TRUE HAPPINESS\n<\/p><p>\nI wish I could say to every young man in this Church, that if you would be successful, if you\nwould be happy, if you would conserve your strength, intellectual, physical, and spiritual, you\nwill resist temptation to indulge your appetites and your passions. That is gospel\ntruth&mdash;indulgence does not strengthen youth or manhood; restraint and self-control do. That is\npsychologically sound, because, instead of expending your energy as animals, self-control\ngives you more power and energy to expend intellectually and spiritually. Chastity strengthens\nmanhood. It is the source of virility, not impotence; it is the crown of beautiful womanhood;\nand it is the source of peace and happiness in the home when you start to build it; it is the\nsource of strength and perpetuity of the race.\n<\/p><p>\nHe is unwise who starts out as the prodigal son to waste in riotous living the substance which\nGod has given him in physical manhood and intellectuality. Much better to follow the\nexample of old Adam as mentioned by Shakespeare in As You Like It. I wish every student\nwould get the implied lessons, and that every teacher of English literature would pause before\nhis class of young men and women and let them absorb the picture that that old man gives\nwhen Orlando refuses to let the servant go with him out into the forest. The old servant, who\nreared Orlando and nursed him, watched him, and trained him in his youth, said:\n<\/p><p>\nLet me go with you,<br \/>\nThough I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;<br \/>\nFor in my youth I never did apply<br \/>\nHot and rebellious liquors in my blood, <br \/>\nNor did not with unbashful forehead woo <br \/>\nThe means of weakness and debility; <br \/>\nTherefore my age is as a lusty winter, <br \/>\nFrosty, but kindly.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us that we as leaders may try to guide those who are wandering away from the\nflock. God give us power to inspire them with the true ideal of success as contained in\nanother saying of our Savior, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all\nthese things will be added\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33960\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33960)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33960)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>),\nI pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
