If he had learned the ceremony of these Protestant and Catholic denominations, he might have said&#x2014;&#x201C;I pronounce you husband and wife until death shall separate you.&#x201D; No, I think he had never learned that; death had not then come into our world; the forbidden fruit had not been eaten then; there were no fallen beings then on the earth, no mortality yet upon the face of our fair creation, but two immortal beings who were capable of enduring to all ages of eternity were united together in marriage. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n145\"> This, then, was marriage for eternity, not for a little speck of time, not for a hundred or a thousand years, not for a million years, but for all eternity, to be as durable in its nature, action and effects as the immortal beings themselves. &#x201C;But,&#x201D; inquires one, &#x201C;are you sure that Adam and Eve were immortal?&#x201D; I am; the Scriptures inform me that by transgression sin came into the world, and death by sin.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"72355\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 72355)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(72355)\">Rom. 5:12<\/a><\/span> If sin had not come into the world there would have been no death. &#x201C;But, do you really think that Adam and Eve would have been alive today?&#x201D; Yes.

A great many of those good people abroad, who, with their ancestors, back for seventeen hundred years, while God had no authority or Church on the earth, have gone down to their graves, without knowing anything about the pattern of marriage as recorded here in the Bible, which is eternal in its nature. What are you going to do with them? I answer, it would look rather hard if there was no provision made for them, would it not? There are about seventeen centuries or generations, and if we compute a thousand million of people for every generation, coming upon and passing away from the earth, we shall have about fifty thousand million altoge<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"52a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD18\/JoD18_0052.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;52a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7089\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>ther, who have gone down to their graves without baptism, without the administration of the ordinances, without divine authority to administer in their marriages! Do you suppose that the Lord has made no provision for all these things? All must have a chance. There is not an individual that ever lived upon the earth, from the days of Adam down to this time, whether it was among the heathen or savages, who never heard of Jesus or of the true God, and who went down to his grave in total ignorance; there never was a man or woman on the face of the globe, but what will have an opportunity, either in this life or in the life to come, to obey and enjoy the benefits of the Gospel of Salvation. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n160\"> &#x201C;But did you not say that there was no opportunity for them to attend to these ordinances in the life to come?&#x201D; I did. &#x201C;Then why did you say, that there will be an opportunity for them?&#x201D; There is quite a difference between having an opportunity, and attending to the ordinances. You cannot attend to the latter in the life to come. Parties who have died in this generation or in the generations passed, without having an opportunity to be baptized by a man holding authority, will have an opportunity of hearing the Gospel in the life to come; but they cannot attend personally to the ordinances thereof. Why? Because God has ordained that men, here in the flesh, shall be baptized in this life; or, if they die without a knowledge of the Gospel and its ordinances, that their friends in the flesh, in the day of his power, when he brings forth the everlasting Gospel, shall officiate for them, and in their behalf. This is another peculiarity of the doctrine of the Latter-day Saints&#x2014;baptism for the dead. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n161\"> You see a Temple building here, <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"52b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD18\/JoD18_0052.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;52b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7089\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> east of this tabernacle, and a great many inquiries are made respecting the nature of this building. Some suppose that we are going to hold meetings in it, and preach to the people; but no, that pertains to the tabernacle. God has pointed out the uses of a Temple by new revelation, the same as he pointed out the object of a tabernacle in the days of Moses, and the object of the Temple of the Lord in the days of Solomon; and among those objects he has told us that in the basement of the Temple there should be a baptismal font. What for? That those who are living here on the earth may be baptized for and in behalf of those who die without a knowledge of the Gospel. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n162\"> Does that reach back to all generations who have died in ignorance? Yes. To all our ancestors? Yes; it reaches back to our fathers, our grandfathers and their progenitors away back to ancient days, when the Priesthood was upon the earth. Baptism for the dead! The same thing was attended to in ancient times, so that we have not got a new pattern, it is the old pattern renewed. Paul says, in the 15th chapter of the first of Corinthians&#x2014;&#x201C;Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"73887\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 73887)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(73887)\">1 Cor. 15:29<\/a><\/span> Sure enough! It was a strong argument to prove the resurrection of the dead, that the people who belonged to the ancient Christian Churches had the privilege of going and being baptized for those who had died before the Gospel came among them. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n163\"> Now do you not see that we are not so uncharitable as a great many would suppose?

The ordinances thus attended to here on the earth in behalf of the dead, will be recorded and sealed here by proper authority; and what is thus recorded and sealed here will be recorded and sealed in the heavens in behalf of those individuals; and if those spirits who are in prison and in the eternal worlds will repent when the Gospel is taken to them, they can have the benefit of the ordinances administered for and in their behalf here, and they will have part in the first resurrection. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n165\"> Then again, if baptism for the dead is true, every other divine ordinance is equally true and necessary for the dead, for one is just as consistent as the other. The laying on of hands in confirmation upon a person that is living here in the flesh, for and in behalf of those who are in their graves, is just as consistent as baptism for the dead. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n166\"> Again, if our fathers and mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers, have died without being married by divine authority, the same authority that would cause a people to act for the dead in relation to baptism, would cause them to act for and in behalf of the dead in relation to their marriage ceremonies too. Such a plan gives them all a chance. For there are no marryings, nor baptisms, nor confirmations, in and after the resurrection.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"65419\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 65419)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(65419)\">Matt. 22:30<\/a><\/span> The resurrected dead can do none of these things; but if it is done here for them, and they will accept of it, it will be acknowledged in the heavens.

A great many have wondered why so many people in the eastern, southern and middle States have been stirred up for a number of years past in searching out their ancestors. Now the Lord does a great many things unknown to the people, and this is one of them. The people do not know why they are interested in their ancestry, but they are wrought upon by some invisible operation, and they feel very anxious to know about their progenitors. I think that some four hundred different families have already got extended family records, tracing their ancestry back from generation to generation to the first settlements of the New England States, and then back into Old England if it is possible, to make out the connection. Do they know what they are doing this for? No; they feel wrought upon, that is all they know about it. Now I will tell you why it is, for a great many of the people in this congregation, and many who are scattered through the villages, towns and settlements in this Territory, emigrated from the New England States, and they had fathers and mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers, and ancestors, now in their graves, who were just as pure, upright, virtuous and honest in their feelings as we their children are.

Our pilgrim fathers were a good people, just as worthy as we are, but unfortunately they did not happen to live in the time that God has set for establishing his kingdom on the earth, and sending his angels from the heavens. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n169\"> Thus you see that this Gospel reaches after the dead as well as the living. Our Savior set the example in regard to this matter, for we are told that when his body lay in the tomb, his spirit was not idle; and instead of going off into the heavens and sitting down there for three days and three nights in perfect idleness, he had something to do, and while his body lay in the tomb, his spirit went and opened the prison doors in which were confined those who were drowned in the flood. What! Were they in prison? Yes. Did Jesus truly visit them? Yes. Did he preach to them? Yes. Where have we this recorded? In Peter&#x2019;s declaration. He says that, &#x201C;Jesus was put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the Spirit: By which he also went and preached to the spirits which were in prison; Which sometime were disobedient when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"77973\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 77973)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(77973)\">1 Pet. 3:18-20<\/a><\/span> Oh indeed; He went to those old antediluvians then, that had not received their resurrection, and preached to them.

For instance, here is a good young man who courts up a wife in the kingdom of God. He says to her, &#x201C;Let us go and be married for time and all eternity, according to the requirements of heaven.&#x201D; Very well; they are agreed in it; they attend to the ordinance, and it is sealed upon their heads and recorded  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"55a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD18\/JoD18_0055.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;55a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7086\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>for their benefit. We will say that, in the course of two or three months after this marriage, some accident befalls the wife and she dies. They loved each other and were married for all eternity, and he mourns over the fact that in his youth, in the very prime of his manhood, he is left alone, a widower. Now is it right for him to marry another wife after having been married to one for time and for all eternity? Is it right for him again to receive a young lady for a wife? &#x201C;Oh, yes,&#x201D; you answer, &#x201C;it is perfectly right, because that would not be living with two on the earth at the same time.&#x201D; Very well, he goes and marries again; and now the question arises, suppose that they only marry for time, or until death shall part them&#x2014;we will suppose this, because the man already has a wife on the other side of the veil&#x2014;what is to become of the second wife in the morning of the resurrection? Can you answer that question? If he only marries her for time, she has no husband when the resurrection comes. Perhaps she is just as good a woman as the wife the man married first for all eternity. What are you going to do with her? Shall she be left in a condition where she can have no posterity, no endless increase, no kingdom in connection with a husband, and no husband? Shall she be left throughout all the future ages of eternity without any such privilege, while the first wife, no better than she is, is married for all eternity, and inherits all the blessings arising therefrom? Would not there be partiality in this? There certainly would. How are you going to remedy this? We answer, when this widower takes this second wife, let her also be married to him for time and all eternity, the same as the first; then, by and by, when the resurrection comes, there come up the <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"55b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD18\/JoD18_0055.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;55b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7086\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> two women. What will you do then? This introduces plurality into the next life, does it not? Polygamists in the next world? It certainly does; and these two women, both having received this man as their husband for all eternity, one of them will now be in just as good a condition as the other. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n172\"> Let this principle be extended. There are some cases in life where two women might die, and a man be still left in his young days without a wife, and he marries a third and perhaps a fourth; in the resurrection they are contemporaneously his wives. Plurality, therefore, would be perfectly consistent in the world to come, but, &#x201C;Oh,&#x201D; says a sectarian, &#x201C;how awful it is in this world!&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n173\"> Thus you see that the very moment we admit the eternity of marriage, the very moment that we admit that Adam and Eve were immortal beings, when they were married, and we undertake to follow that pattern, plurality necessarily comes along; either marriage has no bearing upon eternity, and no bearing upon immortality and immortal beings, or else plurality of wives necessarily must exist in eternity. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n174\"> Says one&#x2014;&#x201C;Turn it about the other way, then we shall have plurality of husbands.&#x201D; Let me say to the congregation that the object of marriage is to fulfill the commandment which God gave to immortal beings. Could a woman multiply faster by having two husbands? Everybody knows that in this respect there is a difference between the male and the female. In this life, at any rate, if one woman had two husbands, instead of making her more fruitful, the probability is that it would prevent her raising any offspring at all; and if she did, how would the father be known? And hence, God has strictly forbidden, in  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"56a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD18\/JoD18_0056.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;56a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7085\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>this Bible, plurality of husbands, and proclaimed against it in his law.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"127243\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 127243)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(127243)\">Lev. 20:10<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"127244\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 127244)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(127244)\">Deut. 22:22<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"127245\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 127245)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(127245)\">Rom. 7:2-3<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n176\"> I should be glad to touch upon a great many other points, in relation to plurality, but time will not permit. You have heard partially explained some of the peculiarities of the faith of the people called Latter-day Saints. Now what is necessary in regard to polygamists? Our enemies say, &#x201C;There should be a law passed that all polygamists should be shut up in prison from five to ten years, as the case may be, and pay a heavy fine.&#x201D; Very well; this is the voice of the people. But does the voice of the people rule in a manner that is inconsistent with the Constitution of our country, by taking away the rights of the minority? Is it the order of our government that the minority must have their rights wrenched from them because the majority decide against them? Let me ask, suppose the majority of the people should decide against infant sprinkling, many look upon that with the utmost horror, and it is only a small minority in our nation that believe in that awful doctrine, suppose the majority should take it into their heads that those who practice infant sprinkling should be imprisoned, they have the same right to do that as to do the other thing which I have named. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n177\"> Again, there is a certain class of people, and they are far in the minority in this great nation, who believe in dancing on the Sabbath day. I allude to the Shaking Quakers. Would it be right to pass a law against this small minority, and say they shall be imprisoned, because the voice of the people in general happens to denounce their practice of dancing as a crime? &#x201C;But then,&#x201D; says one, &#x201C;polygamy is a crime.&#x201D; Who told you so? Does the Bible tell you so?

He gave to Jacob his four wives and children, so Jacob tells us in Genesis.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"53491\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 53491)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(53491)\">Gen. 29:1-35<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"53511\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 53511)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(53511)\">Gen. 30:1-24<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n178\"> Then we might continue and show that every Christian denomination in the United States possesses peculiarities which the majority do not believe in, and which they are convinced should be denounced by the civil law as criminal, and that those who practice such peculiarities ought to be imprisoned for doing so. But because the majority of people condemn a principle, that is no proof that it is a crime. Supposing that the great majority of the people condemned the principle of baptism by immersion, would it be right to pass laws punishing those who practice it? No, the Constitution of our country was framed to protect the people in every item of doctrine that they might glean out of this Bible, and instead of condemning these doctrines as criminal, all the States and all the Territories ought to leave Bible principles as matters of conscience; especially the great principle of marriage should be left open and free to all, either to marry one wife, or two or three, or a dozen, as the case may be, only making laws in relation to criminal abuses of the marital state, and in regard to property, how it should descend to the children, etc. But the very moment that they pass laws that are proscriptive and restrictive in their nature, condemning principles that are not condemned in the Bible, taking away the privileges of the people to believe that which is contained in the word of God, religious liberty is in danger, and there is no telling where that infringement  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"57a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD18\/JoD18_0057.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;57a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7084\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>will lead to.
