Kimball, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1961, pp. 29-34<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy beloved brothers and sisters, I hope that of the estimated million who may have been\nlistening this morning, there may have been many among them who might have been kings\nand their courts, presidents and their cabinets, prime ministers and their associates, editors,\ncommanders of armies and navies and air forces, and all others in the world, particularly our\nfellow men of the Americas from Tierra del Fuego to Point Barrow&mdash;for the prophet of the\nLord spoke in stirring tones of warning to all the people of this world.\n<\/p><p>\nOur world is in turmoil. It is aging toward senility. It is very ill. Long ago it was born with\nbrilliant prospects. It was baptized by water, and its sins were washed away. It was never\nbaptized by fire, for that is still to come. It has had shorter periods of good health, but longer\nones of ailing. Most of the time there have been pains and aches in some parts of its anatomy,\nbut now that it is growing old, complications have set in, and all the ailments seem to be\neverywhere.\n<\/p><p>\nThe world has been \"cliniced,\" and the complex diseases have been catalogued. The\nphysicians have had summit consultations, and temporary salve has been rubbed on afflicted\nparts, but it has only postponed the fatal day and never cured it. It seems that while remedies\nhave been applied, staph infection has set in, and the patient's suffering intensified. His mind\nis wandering. It cannot remember its previous illnesses nor the cure which was applied. The\npolitical physicians through the ages have rejected suggested remedies as unprofessional since\nthey came from lowly prophets. Man being what he is with tendencies such as he has, results\ncan be prognosticated with some degree of accuracy.\n<\/p><p>\nIn an ancient situation somewhat comparable to our own, there was a great destruction, and\nwhen the quiet came, those who were spared were wailing: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and then would our brethren\nhave been spared . . . and our mothers and our fair daughters, and our children . . . not have\nbeen buried\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5622\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5622)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5622)\">3 Ne. 8:24-25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nToday is another day, but history repeats itself. We read the headlines. The great powers warn\nand threaten. Bombs are detonated. Terror is substituted for reason. Defense stockpiles\nincrease. Nuclear races get swifter. The radios whine. The newspapers carry glaring headlines,\npoliticians wrangle, students and authorities harangue. Everybody expresses opinions, but few\napproach the real cause or the real cure.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat is the illness? Its symptoms are manifested in every corner of the globe. They are found\namong men in high places, in hut and mansion. Its symptoms are carelessness, casualness,\ncovetousness, slothfulness, selfishness, dishonesty, disobedience, immorality, uncleanness,\nunfaithfulness, ungodliness.\n<\/p><p>\nOur national and international authorities should know that men have \". . . been destroyed\nfrom generation to generation according to their iniquities; and never hath any of them been\ndestroyed save it were foretold them by the prophets of the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3669\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3669)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3669)\">2 Ne. 25:9<\/a><\/span>). And\nmodern prophets are warning frequently, constantly. People are destroyed by their own acts.\n<\/p><p>\n\"There is one principle,\" a modern prophet said, \"(that we should) understand:&mdash;that is of\nblessings and cursings. For instance, we read that war, pestilence, plagues, famine, etc., will\nbe visited upon the inhabitants of the earth, but if distress through the judgments of God\ncomes upon this people, it will be because the majority have turned away from the Lord.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe world's living prophet has warned and pleaded that the people return to God, who has\nsaid again: \"I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye\nhave no promise\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14009\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14009)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14009)\">D&amp;C 82:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis America is no ordinary country. It is a choice land, \"choice above all other lands\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1565\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1565)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1565)\">1 Ne. 2:20<\/a><\/span>).\nIt has a tragic and bloody past, but a glorious and peaceful future if its\ninhabitants really learn to serve their God. It was consecrated as a land of promise to the\npeople of the Americas, to whom God gave these great promises: \n<\/p><p>\n\"It will be a land of liberty to its people\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3654\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3654)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3654)\">2 Ne. 1:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"They shall never be brought down into captivity\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3655\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3655)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3655)\">2 Ne. 1:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"And there shall be none to molest them\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3657\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3657)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3657)\">2 Ne. 1:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"It is a land of promise\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1566\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1566)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1566)\">1 Ne. 2:20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"It shall be free from all nations under heaven.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"There shall be no enemies come into this land.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"It shall be free from bondage\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22225\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22225)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22225)\">Ether 2:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"There shall be no kings upon the land\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3664\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3664)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3664)\">2 Ne. 10:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"I will fortify this land against all other nations\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3666\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3666)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3666)\">2 Ne. 10:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"He that fighteth against Zion shall perish\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3667\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3667)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3667)\">2 Ne. 10:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBut these promises, glorious though they be, desirable as they are, can come only \". . . if they\nwill but serve the God of this land who is Jesus Christ\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22226\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22226)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22226)\">Ether 2:12<\/a><\/span>). There is only one\nway. That infallible cure is simply righteousness, obedience, Godliness, honor, and integrity.\nThere is no other cure. Mountains of arms and ammunitions will not guarantee safety, for\nenemies can also build fortifications and missiles and bomb shelters. If we would but believe\nthe prophets! For they have warned that if the \"inhabitants of this land are ever brought down\ninto captivity and enslaved, it shall be because of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound cursed\nshall be the land\" (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"3656\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3656)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3656)\">2 Ne. 1:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe prophet exclaims again with fervor: \"And now we . . . behold the decrees of God\nconcerning this land, that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall\nserve God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come upon them.\nAnd the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22220\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22220)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22220)\">Ether 2:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nO that men would listen! Why should there be spiritual blindness in the day of brightest\nmaterial vision? Why must men rely on fortifications and armaments when the God of heaven\nyearns to bless them? One stroke of his omnipotent hand could make powerless all nations\nwho oppose and save a world even in its death throes.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus Christ our Lord is under no obligation to save this world. The people have ignored him,\ndisbelieved him, failed to follow him. They stand at his mercy which will be extended only if\nthey repent. But to what extent have we repented? Another prophet said, \"We call evil good,\nand good evil\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25213\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25213)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25213)\">Isa. 5:20<\/a><\/span>).\nMen have rationalized themselves into thinking that they are \"not so bad.\" Are\nthey fully ripe? Has the rot of age and flabbiness set in? Can they change? They see evil in\ntheir enemies, but none in themselves. Even in the true Church numerous of its people fail to\nattend their meetings, to tithe their incomes, to have their regular prayers, to keep all the\ncommandments. We can transform, but will we? It seems that we would rather tax ourselves\ninto slavery than to pay our tithes; rather build protections and walls than drop to our knees\nwith our families in solemn prayers night and morning.\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems that rather than fast and pray, we prefer to gorge ourselves at the banquet tables and\ndrink cocktails. Instead of disciplining ourselves, we yield to urges and carnal desires.\nNumerous billions we spend on liquor and tobacco. A Sabbath show or a game or a race\nreplaces solemn worship. Numerous mothers prefer the added luxuries of two incomes to the\nsatisfactions of seeing children grow up in the fear of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21237\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21237)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21237)\">Deut. 31:13<\/a><\/span>). Men golf and boat and hunt and\nfish rather than to solemnize the Sabbath. Old man rationalization is with us. Because we are\nnot vicious enough to be confined in penitentiaries, we rationalize that we are pretty good\npeople; that we are not doing so badly. The masses of the people are much like those who\nescaped destruction in the ancient days of this continent. The Lord said to them: \n<\/p><p>\n\"O all ye that are spared because ye were more righteous than they [the slain ones], will ye\nnot now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5623\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5623)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5623)\">3 Ne. 9:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Great Wall of China with its 1,500 miles of unbreakable walls, with its twenty-five feet\nhigh impregnableness, with its innumerable watchman towers, was breached by the treachery\nof men.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Maginot Line in France, these forts thought to be so strong and impassable, were violated\nas though they were not there. Strength is not in concrete and re-enforcing steel. Protection is\nnot in walls nor mountains nor cliffs, yet foolish men still lean on \"the arm of flesh.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe walls of Babylon were too high to be scaled, too thick to be broken, too strong to be\ncrumbled, but not too deep to be undermined when the human element failed\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10659\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10659)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10659)\">Dan. 5:1-31<\/a><\/span>). When the\nprotectors sleep and the leaders are incapacitated with banqueting and\ndrunkenness and immorality, an invading enemy can turn a river from its course and enter\nthrough a river bed\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25220\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25220)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25220)\">Isa. 44:27-28<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25221\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25221)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25221)\">Isa. 45:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe precipitous walls on the high hills of Jerusalem deflected for a time the arrows and spears\nof enemies, the catapults and firebrands. But even then wickedness did not lessen, men did\nnot learn lessons. Hunger scaled the walls; thirst broke down the gates; immorality,\ncannibalism, idolatry, godlessness stalked about till destruction came.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Experience is a dear teacher but fools will learn by no other.\" But we continue on in our\ngodlessness. While the iron curtains rise and thicken, we eat, drink, and make merry. While\narmies are marshaled and march and drill and officers teach men how to kill, we continue to\ndrink and carouse as usual. While bombs are detonated and tested, and fallout settles on the\nalready sick world, we continue in idolatry and adultery. While corridors are threatened and\nconcessions are made, we live riotously and divorce and marry in cycles like the seasons.\nWhile leaders quarrel, and editors write, and authorities analyze and prognosticate, we break\nthe Sabbath as though no command had ever been given. While enemies filter into our nation\nto subvert us and intimidate us and soften us, we continue with our destructive thinking: \"It\ncan't happen here.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWill we ever turn wholly to God? Fear envelops the world which could be at ease and peace.\nIn God is protection, safety, peace. He has said, \"I will fight your battles\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14044\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14044)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14044)\">D&amp;C 105:14<\/a><\/span>). But his\ncommitment is on condition of our faithfulness. He promised to the children of Israel: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I will give you rain in due season,\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe land shall yield her increase and trees their fruit.\n<\/p><p>\nGranaries and barns will bulge in seed time and harvest.\n<\/p><p>\nYe shall eat your bread in abundance.\n<\/p><p>\nYe shall dwell in your land safely and none shall make you afraid.\n<\/p><p>\nNeither shall the sword go through your land.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to\nflight (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"30895\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30895)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30895)\">Lev. 26:4-6,8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<i>But if you fail to serve me:<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nThe land will be barren, (perhaps radioactive or dry from drought.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe trees will be without fruit and the fields without verdure.\n<\/p><p>\nThere will be rationing and a scarcity of food and hunger sore.\n<\/p><p>\nNo traffic will jam your desolate highways.\n<\/p><p>\nFamine will stalk rudely through your doors and the ogre cannibalism will rob you of your\nchildren and your remaining virtues.\n<\/p><p>\nThere will be pestilence uncontrollable.\n<\/p><p>\nYour dead bodies will be piled upon the materialistic things you sought so hard to accumulate\nand save.\n<\/p><p>\nI will give no protection against enemies.\n<\/p><p>\nThey that hate you shall reign over you.\n<\/p><p>\nThere will be faintness of heart \"and the sound of a shaken leaf\" shall chase you into flight\nand you will fall when none pursueth.\n<\/p><p>\nYour power&mdash;your supremacy&mdash;your pride in superiority&mdash;will be broken.\n<\/p><p>\nYour heaven shall be as iron and your earth as brass.

Yet \"These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord\nmade between him and the children of Israel in Mt. Sinai by the hand of Moses\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30899\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30899)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30899)\">Lev. 26:46<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Israelites failed to heed the warning. They ignored the prophets.\nThey suffered the fulfillment of every dire prophecy.\n<\/p><p>\nDo we twentieth century people have reason to think that we can be immune from the same\ntragic consequences when we ignore the same divine laws?\n<\/p><p>\nWith such innumerable blessings as are available to godly people of this land, how can any\nsane one continue in his careless patterns of life?\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a cure for the earth's illness, an infallible one.\n<\/p><p>\nWar clouds gather, fear heightens; tenseness increases, yet there need be no fear and worry\nand sleepless nights.\n<\/p><p>\nOur God rules in the heavens. He lives. He loves. He desires the happiness and well being of\nall his children. He has a prophet on the earth today who receives his revelations. He is a\nprophet to all the world. He has on numerous occasions outlined the cure for all international\nas well as local ills. The diagnosis is sure, and the remedy certain. Today's prophet stands in\nthe same position between God and the people as did Isaiah, Samuel, and even Moses who\ngave to the world the ten commandments.\n<\/p><p>\nBut a controlling majority of the people of this world have relegated them to the past.\n<\/p><p>\n\"<i>Thou shalt have no other gods before me<\/i>\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22684\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22684)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22684)\">Ex. 20:3<\/a><\/span>, italics added). Yet today we\nworship the gods of wood and stone and metal. Not always are they in the form of a golden\ncalf, but equally real as objects of protection and worship. They are houses, lands, bank\naccounts, leisure. They are boats, cars, and luxuries. They are bombs and ships and\narmaments. We bow down to the god of mammon, the god of luxuries, the god of dissipation.\n<\/p><p>\n\"<i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain<\/i>\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22685\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22685)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22685)\">Ex. 20:7<\/a><\/span>, italics added).\nYet on the corner, in public places, on work projects, at banquet tables, there come ringing\ninto our ears the sacred names of Deity without solemnity.\n<\/p><p>\n\"<i>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy<\/i>\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22687\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22687)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22687)\">Ex. 20:8<\/a><\/span>, italics added). Yet work goes on,\nmerchandise is sold, athletic entertainments, fishing, hunting go forward without regard to\ncommandments. Conventions, unnecessary travel, family picnics, the Sabbath is violated\ngenerally. A relatively few people attend their church services, pay their tithing, serve their\nfellow men. Few live up to the truth they know. The taverns are full, the beaches crowded,\nthe grandstands packed, man servants, and maid servants hired to duty, the ski lifts busy,\ncanyon picnic tables loaded. Scriptures are read little, and the holy day becomes a holiday.\n<\/p><p>\n\"<i>Six days shalt thou labour<\/i>\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22689\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22689)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22689)\">Ex. 20:9<\/a><\/span>, italics added). Yet ever-increasing hours of\nleisure provide ever increasing opportunities for Sabbath breaking and commandment\nignoring, and strikes and lobbying go on to increase damaging leisure and decrease work\nhours further.\n<\/p><p>\n\"<i>Thou shalt not commit adultery<\/i>\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22691\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22691)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22691)\">Ex. 20:14<\/a><\/span>, italics added). Yet this common sin and\nidolatry run hand in hand. Free love and indiscretions and deviations of every nature are\ncommon in our day. Illegitimate births are said to reach as high as one in ten, yet promiscuity\nfar exceeds illegitimacy. This ugly deviation is found among youth and married people.\nDivorce, ever on the increase, jumping from one divorce for thirty-six weddings in Civil War\ndays now has reached somewhere near one to four. Flirtations, rationalized to be innocent\nones, are the root of numerous of the divorces and other ills.\n<\/p><p>\n\"<i>Thou shalt not steal<\/i>\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22693\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22693)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22693)\">Ex. 20:15<\/a><\/span>, italics added). Yet in high places and in low, in\ngovernment office and in business, in everyday life, men have rationalized until consciences\nseem to have been seared in the matter of honesty. Yet here are bribery, fraud, deceit, theft,\npadding of expense accounts, tax evasion, installment buying beyond ability to pay, and\ngambling running into the billions.\n<\/p><p>\nThe outlook is bleak, but the impending tragedy can be averted. But it can be only through a\ngreat repentance and transformation.\n<\/p><p>\n\"What can I do?\" asks the fearful one. I can transform my own life till it is perfected and then\ninfluence others when thus transformed. I am prepared to live or die and\nneed not fear. The righteous were saved in Enoch's day and the wicked were drowned in the\nflood. Other rebellious people were destroyed in the convulsions of the earth in the meridian\nof time, and they who were more righteous were saved.\n<\/p><p>\nConcerning Jerusalem the Lord said: \"I will defend this city\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3179\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3179)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3179)\">2 Kgs. 19:34<\/a><\/span>) when the\npowerful, invincible Assyrian army camped at the gates.

If race tracks were closed on the Sabbath, if gambling ceased, drinking\neliminated, work and play confined to week days; if stores were closed and all people went to\ntheir sanctuaries truly to worship even as best they know; if taverns never opened, and\ntransgressors all repented, and broken homes were mended, and children were trained in\nuprightness; if families all knelt in prayer night and morning, if tithes were paid and integrity\nand worship reigned in the lives of men, the era of total peace would be ushered in. Fear\nwould vanish, and enemies would be subdued.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I will fight your battles,\" says the Lord God Omnipotent\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14045\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14045)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14045)\">D&amp;C 105:14<\/a><\/span>).
