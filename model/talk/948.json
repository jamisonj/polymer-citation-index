I respond humbly to the assignment to speak to you in the opening of\nour conference with unusual anxiety in the thought that many may expect the usual\ninspirational opening address by the President.  I counsel those who are disappointed to be\npatient, because they will be amply rewarded in a later session.\n<\/p><p>\nI am taking the liberty of addressing my remarks in large measure to our friends who\ncompliment us by listening to the conference over radio and television.  The message I have\nfor them I give with frankness, hoping that they will not misconstrue my frankness for\ndisrespect of them and their beliefs. Only by being outspoken can I hope to make any\ncontribution.\n<\/p><p>\nSome time ago a member of my family sent to me a critical article written by Mr. Edmund\nFuller in a publication called <i>Saturday Review<\/i>.  The criticism of the writer is directed against\nthe effort made to satisfy what the author designates as \"general religious hunger,\" with\nbooks, articles, and public appearances of nationally advertised individuals, carrying on a\npropaganda for what is characterized as (these are quoted) \"the good life,\" \"peace of mind,\"\n\"positive thinking,\" and \"successful\" or \"confident living.\" What the author objects to most\nstrenuously is not so much that propaganda should be issued for the optimism of \"peace of\nmind\" and \"positive thinking,\" but that this psychological optimism should be held out in any\nform as an interpretation of or a substitute for the real Christian religion.\n<\/p><p>\nHe expresses deep concern in the situation, not so much because such propagandists are taking\nfrom an uninformed and unthinking public millions of dollars from the sale of their books and\nservices, but that the uninformed victims of the propaganda are losing something far more\nimportant than their money&mdash;an intelligent and true concept of religion and Christianity.\n<\/p><p>\nMr. Fuller, the critic, asks, \"Where, in all the morass of false witness, whether in quests for\nsuccessful living or in saccharine sentimentality&mdash;where are the great, historic central themes,\nsubjects, words of Christianity through the ages?  Where are considerations of the Trinity,\nincarnation, covenant, atonement, redemption, salvation, sin, offering, judgment, worship,\nsacrament, sacrifice, communion, and the idea of the Holy?\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn general, I find myself in agreement with this criticism.  I think, however, that Mr. Fuller\nhimself is only partially informed with reference to the true Christian religion, and I think,\ntoo, that the trends which he analyzes and criticizes have come about and are in part tolerated\nby people of the world because of inadequate understanding of the vital concepts of true\nreligion.\n<\/p><p>\nNot infrequently do we see and hear the statement published that what the world needs is to\ncome to Christ, and that only Christ can save the world. We subscribe, of course, to these\nstatements, but we question with ample justification the interpretation of the\nChrist and his teachings which has been brought to the world these many years.  I believe we\nare justified in ascribing many of these attempts to find substitute for the real Christian faith,\nand the failure of that faith to find true lodgment in the hearts of innumerable people, to this\ninadequate interpretation.\n<\/p><p>\nWe criticize no honest soul in choosing his religion and living by it, but when the truth is\navailable, we take the position that every individual, adequately to exercise his free agency\nand power of choice, should have and must have, wherever and whenever circumstances will\npermit, the truth about the Christian religion presented to him. We feel that he cannot be\nultimately bound in the sight of God by the choice he makes unless he does have such\nopportunity.  We agree with the critic, Mr. Fuller, that it is an intolerable imposition upon the\nunsuspecting and uninformed to offer to them what he calls \"ersatz foods\" to satisfy their\nreligious hunger, but we go further. We believe it is likewise an imposition to foist upon the\nuninformed an incorrect and unwarranted interpretation of Christ and his gospel, and we\nbelieve that generation after generation over centuries of time have been held in darkness and\ndenied the saving truths of the gospel because of such misinterpretations.  Indeed, we ascribe\nthe present condition of the world and the limited acceptance of the true Christian faith\nlargely to ignorance of the true gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nHow much of tolerance should be allowed for the mistakes in interpretation and practices of\nthe past, as pertaining to the followers of Christ, we are not prepared to say. The Lord will\njudge, and his judgment will be righteous and merciful. We are constrained to deplore the\nresults of these misinterpretations.  The revelations predict the outcome which has literally\ncome to pass.  Isaiah foresaw both the conditions and results.  You will recall this impressive\nand portentous statement: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour\nme, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the\nprecept of men:<br \/>\n\"Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a\nmarvelous work and a wonder\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25190\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25190)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25190)\">Isa. 29:13-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis great statement is corroborated by the Savior in Matthew 15:8-9, and by revelations and\nprophecies of modern times (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34872\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34872)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34872)\">Matt. 15:8-9<\/a><\/span>).\nIn March of 1831, less than a year after the organization of the\nChurch, the Prophet Joseph Smith received from the Lord a comforting and encouraging\nassurance confirmatory of the predictions which had been made centuries before, which reads\nas follows: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And when the times of the Gentiles is come in, a light shall break forth among them that sit\nin darkness, and it shall be the fulness of my gospel\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13626\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13626)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13626)\">D&amp;C 45:28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat light, my brethren and sisters and friends, has come to the world.  It is the light of\nrevelation, and through revelation has come the true interpretation of the Christ, his mission,\nand his gospel. All men of all nations embraced within the family of the Eternal Father are\nentitled by his decree to receive the light and to receive an understanding of the true, revealed\norder of the kingdom of God.  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, established\nunder the direction of the Father and the Son, is the custodian of the revealed principles of the\nrestored gospel and the authority to administer its ordinances under divine commission.  I am\naware that by many this will be regarded as an extreme and presumptuous statement. We\nmake it only because we are constrained by the revelations so to do. I assure you it would be\nmuch easier to attempt to win a reputation for tolerance by modifying and ameliorating our\nposition. If we did so, we and our message would be of little value to our brothers and sisters\nin the world, and we should be untrue to our commission.\n<\/p><p>\nRevelation is the foundation of our faith.  We are not ashamed to declare that the Lord has\nspoken through his servants in modern times as he did in days of old.  Why should men find\nso much difficulty in accepting revelation? I assume that it is because it seems to them\nunnatural that messages should come from the unseen world, but certainly it\nis no more unnatural in the present day than in the past, and few would deny the need of\nGod's guidance in the world of today.\n<\/p><p>\nI think that the Apostle Paul was inspired to foresee the conditions of the world when he gave\nhis famous definition of the gospel: \"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is\nthe power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42733\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42733)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42733)\">Rom. 1:16<\/a><\/span>). He must\nhave foreseen that men, lacking in faith, would be ashamed of the gospel of Christ, and\nparticularly revelation, the seemingly unnatural process by which the Lord communicates with\nman.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, we assert that there is no true religion without revelation.  Men may contrive all sorts\nof societies, associations, and establishments, but men of themselves cannot create the gospel\nof Christ and the kingdom of God. That is a divine function limited to divine power only.\n<\/p><p>\nI submit this conclusion in humility to my friends, hoping and praying that they may\nrecognize the logic and truth of it, and muster sufficient faith to accept revelation as the basis\nfor all true religion and the interpretation of the gospel. I assure all my friends who listen that\nthis custody of the truth and divine commission is not a light assignment.  It is heavy,\nweighted with a responsibility both institutional and personal, not exceeded, and I think not\nequaled, by responsibilities borne by any other people or cause.  All of us within the restored\nChurch of our Lord take this responsibility most seriously. The assumption of responsibility of\nmembership in the Church often brings a radical change in living, behavior, and philosophy. \nThe obligation felt by the membership to consecrate and dedicate themselves to the\ndissemination of what the revelations call \"pure knowledge\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13685\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13685)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13685)\">D&amp;C 121:42<\/a><\/span>) among the inhabitants of the\nworld becomes an obsession, not fanatical, but practical. In the concept of each member is the\nrecognition of a debt&mdash;a debt to be paid not so much to the donor of the gift he has received,\nbut a repayment in terms of conscious effort to give to others the light and truth which\nsomeone has brought to him.\n<\/p><p>\nMany people have asked: \"What is the sustaining philosophy behind your marvelous\nmissionary system?\" Well, I have just stated it. It is the recognition of a noble obligation and\npurpose to extend the knowledge of truth, born out of gratitude for blessings received.\n<\/p><p>\nThis condition creates zest and enthusiasm for missionary work, and what to many is a very\nstrange feature of it, is that the enthusiasm is not evanescent. It does not die periodically and\nthen have to be revived.  It persists.  And why? First, I think, because of the absolute\nunquestioning conviction in the cause. And secondly, because of the love of humanity\nengendered by the gospel, that all are in reality of the family of God, and that such parentage\nmakes all men brothers.\n<\/p><p>\nI wish I had some way of making all friends who listen appreciate the depth of conviction\nthat actuates the members of the Church in carrying forth its great work in the world. Perhaps\nit is a little indelicate to cite a personal experience in the effort to give my friends\nunderstanding on this point.  I hope, however, you will tolerate the recital of my experience.\n<\/p><p>\nMore than fifty years ago I began the practice of law with a deep love for the profession, and\na long-cherished ambition to succeed. I went through what is commonly called the starvation\nperiod, and after thirteen years achieved some modest success, at least sufficient to encourage\nme and build up my hopes for the future.\n<\/p><p>\nOne day while sitting in my office I received a telephone call.  I was advised that the\nPresident of the Church wished to see me immediately. I went as requested to a meeting in the\ntemple, where the President of the Church, his Counselors, and the Council of the Twelve\nApostles were in attendance.  I was told by the President of the Church that I had been\nselected to become a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and then asked if I\nwould accept this position. Obeying my concepts and convictions regarding the government of\nthe Church, I accepted and was ordained to the position.\n<\/p><p>\nWithin the space of twenty minutes the whole course of my life had been changed.  My\nprofessional career and ambitions were abandoned, and for more than forty years I have\ndevoted myself to the ministry under my call, although I had no previous preparation, as the\nchurches of the world give, for this undertaking.\n<\/p><p>\nI cite this circumstance merely as an example of everyday occurrence in the restored Church\nof Jesus Christ. Of course apostles are not called every day, but so-called laymen are being\ncalled every day to serve in positions of trust and honor.  These calls in numerous cases\ninvolve substantial change in occupations and professions, and in some instances, as in the\ncallings of mission presidents and missionaries, complete abandonment for a period of years\nof all gainful occupation, and a personal assumption of considerable responsibility to fulfil the\nassignment.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, my point is, and I think it ought to be clear to our friends, that men do not do these\nthings without complete conversion and complete conviction as to the rightness of their\ncourse.  I am aware that many may say that sincerity of belief is not proof of the truth, and I\nam not contending, as the old clich\u00e9 has it, \"that fifty million Frenchmen can't be wrong.\"\nThere are, however, at least two legitimate and justifiable deductions that our friends may\nmake from the circumstances I have mentioned.  First, that the unmistakable evidence of\nconviction in the rightness of their cause and conduct are exceptional in a day of materialistic\nliving and purpose, not readily duplicated in other causes; and the second point of appeal held\nout to our brothers and sisters in the world is that the circumstances warrant investigation. \nThat is all our missionaries the world over are advised to request of the people they\nvisit&mdash;investigate, discover for yourself. Use your own Bibles.  Diminish none of your love for\nGod and Christ and your fellow men, but study and investigate the Christian religion with the\nlight which the restored gospel has brought to it.  Why should any true searcher for truth have\nobjection to these two elements&mdash;a demonstrated sincerity and conviction on the part of the\nmissionary, and an invitation to hear and investigate the message?\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I wish to extend my remarks to cover an additional aspect of this subject.  I am of the\ndefinite opinion that the religious hunger of the people, as Mr. Fuller puts it, cannot be\nsatisfied with the current interpretation of the Christ put forth by many professing\nChristianity. All proclaim him a great teacher.  Most assert that he is Savior of mankind, and\nall invest him with the highest and noblest attributes.  Altogether too many, however, worship\nat the shrine of his attributes, but deny the sovereignty of the King.  In my humble opinion,\nwhat the world so urgently needs is a present realistic concept and recognition of the Christ as\nLord of this earth, as Lawgiver and Judge.  If he were recognized as the author and projector\nof all moral codes and righteousness, and if it were recognized that infraction of his law is\nsin, I am sure there would be less violation than we see today, and there would be far less\ntolerance for violation, which is today undermining the morality of nations.  Christ will save\nthe world when and only when men and women of the world put themselves in position to be\nsaved.  It is unthinkable that he can deviate from the inexorable laws of righteousness, which\nfrom the beginning to the end he has set for mankind. When men sin, there is no substitute\nfor repentance to bring to them a restoration of blessings they have forfeited. So any\ninterpretation of the Christ as Lord of the earth which would invest him with capricious and\nvariable judgment founded on so-called grace and pity is harmful and not true. The true\ngospel is not a spiritual sedative.  It is a challenge to the strength and will of mankind to\nenter into an everlasting covenant with injunctions and promises, the observance of which\nyields the reward of exaltation in the eternal presence.  Christ is the author of mercy, but he\nhimself said that he came to fulfil the law and not do away with it, and he declared that\nmercy shall not rob justice.\n<\/p><p>\nI am deeply concerned, too, with the tendency to invest the Lord our Savior\nwith a mystical character.  I am not sure that I know just what is contemplated by \"mystical.\"\nHe is not mystical to me, nor to the great body of his followers with which I have the honor\nto be associated. It is true that he does not move about among us in the form in which he\nonce presented himself to humanity, but he is real.  He was resurrected in the form in which\nhe was crucified, and he lives in the heavens he has described. He will return as he has\npromised, and in the meantime he has left an organization which he established through his\ncommissioned servants, in fulfillment of prophecy, to build his kingdom and prepare the way\nfor his coming.  I hope that they who profess to love and adore him will not make him less\nthan he himself said that he was&mdash;the Son of the Father, on the right hand of God, Lord,\nLawgiver, and Judge of all men in the earth, invested with powers and authorities everlasting.\n<\/p><p>\nSo, it is the worship of our Lord so interpreted, it is the acceptance of his revealed and\nrestored gospel, and that alone, which will adequately and perpetually satisfy the \"hunger for\nreligion,\" which I sincerely hope pervades the world today. Christ has been seen in modern\ntimes. There are creditable witnesses whose testimony has never been successfully refuted to\ntwo such appearances&mdash;first, when he appeared to the young prophet, Joseph Smith, in\nanswer to prayer, accompanying his Father, the Eternal God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30377\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30377)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30377)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>). This heavenly vision, without\nargument, brought to the world an irrefutable and true concept of the Father and the Son. \nThen he appeared to this same prophet with an associate when he was more mature in a\ntemple which had been erected to his name.  This is the testimony of that appearance: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony,\nlast of all, which we give of him: That he lives!<br \/>\n\"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that\nhe is the Only Begotten of the Father&mdash;<br \/>\n\"That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the\ninhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13644\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13644)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13644)\">D&amp;C 76:22-24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nEvery fiber of my being responds to that testimony.  I am completely convinced that the men\nwho bore the testimony told the truth.  Every interpretative sense which I possess tells me\nwithout doubt or equivocation that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, lives as a resurrected eternal\nbeing, and that he is my Lord and my Savior, and the Lord of all men.  I could wish for no\ngreater happiness, peace, and satisfaction to come to all our friends than that they should\nenjoy the blessing, the incomparable blessing, of this knowledge and assurance.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the world come to peace and happiness through the recognition of the true Christ, I ask\nhumbly in his name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
