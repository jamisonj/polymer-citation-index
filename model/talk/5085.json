We have now received the legal action in which each of you has been named as a party defendant. I and others of the trial team have reviewed the pleadings carefully and have confirmed that the real purpose of opposing counsel is to prove that you are <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> eligible to receive your ultimate inheritance.

Humbly, softly, meaningfully, and compellingly, he pled your case. I knew the impact he was having when I saw tears streaming down the cheeks of many in the courtroom. I don\u2019t remember all of his arguments and logic, but I do remember him saying that man is a little lower than the angels (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"42036\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42036)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42036)\">Ps. 8:5<\/a><\/span>) and that the worth of souls is great (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"19395\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19395)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19395)\">D&amp;C 18:10<\/a><\/span>).

These are simply questions that are the point of beginning, or the starting place.

A negative response will reveal your fraud, and you will stand judged by your own testimony.
