On a Saturday, my wife and I decided to take the children for a drive and to do some shopping. During the drive the children fell asleep, and not wanting to wake them, I volunteered to stay in the car while my wife ran into the store.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p5\" class=\"\">While waiting, I glanced at the car parked in front of me. It was full of children, and they were looking at me. My eyes caught the eyes of a small boy, six or seven years old. As our eyes met, he immediately stuck his tongue out at me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p6\" class=\"\">My first reaction was to stick my tongue out at him. I thought, <span class=\"emphasis\">What have I done to deserve this?<\/span> Fortunately, before I reacted, I remembered a principle taught in general conference the week before by Elder Marvin J. Ashton (see Conference Report, Oct. 1970, 36\u201338; or <span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era,<\/span> Dec. 1970, 59\u201360). He taught how important it was to act instead of react to the events around us. So I waved at the little boy. He stuck his tongue out at me again. I smiled and waved again. This time he waved back.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p7\" class=\"\">Soon he was joined in his enthusiastic waving by a little brother and sister. I responded by waving this way and that until my arm became tired. Then I rested it on the steering wheel and continued with every creative wave I could muster, all the time hoping their parents would quickly return or that my wife would soon come back.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p8\" class=\"\">The parents finally did come, and as they pulled away, my newfound friends continued to wave for as long as I could see them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p9\" class=\"\">That was a simple experience, but it demonstrated that in most encounters we can <span class=\"emphasis\">determine<\/span> the kind of experience we are going to have by how we respond. I was grateful that I chose to act in a friendly way rather than react to my young friend\u2019s childish behavior. In doing so I avoided the negative feelings I would have felt had I followed my natural instinct.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p10\" class=\"\">In His instructions to the Nephites, the Savior taught, \u201cTherefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5379\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5379)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5379)\">3 Ne. 14:12<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p11\" class=\"\">Imagine the effect it would have in the world if everyone practiced this Golden Rule. But to do so seems contrary to human nature. King Benjamin declared that \u201cthe natural man is an enemy to God,\u201d and will remain such until he \u201cyields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man\u201d and learns to be \u201csubmissive, meek, humble, patient, [and] full of love\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40072\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40072)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40072)\">Mosiah 3:19<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p12\" class=\"\">In today\u2019s fast-paced world there seems to be a greater tendency for people to act aggressively toward each other. Some are quick to take offense and respond angrily to real or imagined affronts, and we\u2019ve all experienced or heard reports of road rage or other examples of rude, insensitive behavior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p13\" class=\"\">Unfortunately, some of this spills over into our homes, creating friction and tension among family members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p14\" class=\"\">It may seem natural to react to a situation by giving back what is given to us. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Reflecting on his horrendous wartime experiences, Viktor Frankl recalled: \u201cWe who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms\u2014<span class=\"emphasis\">to choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances,<\/span> to choose one\u2019s own way\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Man\u2019s Search for Meaning<\/span> [1985], 86; emphasis added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p15\" class=\"\">That is noble behavior and a high expectation, but Jesus expects no less of us. \u201cLove your enemies,\u201d He said, \u201cbless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33593\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33593)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33593)\">Matt. 5:44<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p16\" class=\"\">A favorite hymn reinforces this teaching:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">School thy feelings, O my brother;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Train thy warm, impulsive soul.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Do not its emotions smother,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">But let wisdom\u2019s voice control.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p21\" class=\"\">(\u201cSchool Thy Feelings,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns, <\/span>no. 336)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p22\" class=\"\">The decisions we make and the way we behave are what ultimately shape our character. Charles A. Hall aptly described that process in these lines: \u201cWe sow our thoughts, and we reap our actions; we sow our actions, and we reap our habits; we sow our habits, and we reap our characters; we sow our characters, and we reap our destiny\u201d (quoted in <span class=\"emphasis\">The Home Book of Quotations,<\/span> sel. Burton Stevenson [1934], 845).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p23\" class=\"\">It is in the home that our behavior is most significant. It is the place where our actions have the greatest impact, for good or ill. Sometimes we are so much \u201cat home\u201d that we no longer guard our words. We forget simple civility. If we are not on guard, we can fall into the habit of criticizing one another, losing our tempers, or behaving selfishly. Because they love us, our spouses and children may be quick to forgive, but they often carry away in silence unseen injuries and unspoken heartache.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/our-actions-determine-our-character.p24\" class=\"\">There are too many homes where children fear their parents or where wives fear their husbands.
