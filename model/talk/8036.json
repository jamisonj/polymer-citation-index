All the women of the Church eight years of age and older have been invited to join with us tonight. Many of us have prayed that the Holy Ghost would be with us. That blessing was granted as we heard these sisters speak and listened to the uplifting music.

I hope that those of you who came into the kingdom recently are blessed to be sitting near your mother. If you are, you might send her a smile of thanks right now. I can remember the feeling of joy and gratitude as I sat behind my mother on the drive home from my baptism in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/general-womens-meeting\/daughters-in-the-covenant.p11\" class=\"\">My mother was the one who had carefully prepared me for making that covenant and all the others that would follow.

That is part of your divine heritage from Him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/general-womens-meeting\/daughters-in-the-covenant.p21\" class=\"\">You were tutored by Him before you came into this life. He helped you understand and accept that you would have trials, tests, and opportunities perfectly chosen just for you.

This plan is marked by covenants with God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/general-womens-meeting\/daughters-in-the-covenant.p22\" class=\"\">It is our free choice whether we make and keep those covenants.

She was the wife of Elder David\u00a0B. Haight, who was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. As a young man he served as the president of the Palo Alto stake in California. He prayed over, and worried about, the girls in the Mia Maid class in his own ward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/general-womens-meeting\/daughters-in-the-covenant.p27\" class=\"\">So President Haight was inspired to ask the bishop to call Ruby Haight to teach those young girls.

Yet 40 years after she taught them, each time she would meet my wife, who had been one of the girls in her class, she would put out her hand, smile, and say to Kathy, \u201cOh! My Mia Maid.\u201d I saw more than her smile. I felt her deep love for a sister she still cared for as if she were her own daughter. Her smile and warm greeting came from seeing that a sister and daughter of God was still on the covenant path home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/general-womens-meeting\/daughters-in-the-covenant.p29\" class=\"\">Heavenly Father smiles on you as well whenever He sees you help a daughter of His move along the covenant path toward eternal life.

I had such a mother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/general-womens-meeting\/daughters-in-the-covenant.p31\" class=\"\">What I didn\u2019t know when I was young was that my Heavenly Father, your Heavenly Father, sees greater potential in His children than we or even our earthly mothers see in us. And whenever you move upward on that path toward your potential, it brings Him happiness. And you can feel His approval.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/general-womens-meeting\/daughters-in-the-covenant.p32\" class=\"\">He sees that glorious potential in all of His daughters, wherever they are. Now, that puts a great responsibility on each of you. He expects you to treat every person you meet as a child of God. That is the reason He commands us to love our neighbors as we love ourselves and to forgive them. Your feelings of kindness and forgiveness toward others come as your divine inheritance from Him as His daughter. Each person you meet is His loved spiritual child.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/general-womens-meeting\/daughters-in-the-covenant.p33\" class=\"\">As you feel of that great sisterhood, what we thought divides us falls away. For instance, younger and older sisters share their feelings with the expectation of being understood and accepted. You are more alike as daughters of God than you are different.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/general-womens-meeting\/daughters-in-the-covenant.p34\" class=\"\">With that view, young women should look forward to their entry into Relief Society as an opportunity to enlarge their circle of sisters whom they will come to know, admire, and love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/general-womens-meeting\/daughters-in-the-covenant.p35\" class=\"\">That same capacity to see what we can be is increasing in families and in Primary.
