After getting her oldest daughter off to school, we decided that what Jen needed most was rest. So the best help I could give was to take her daughter Chloe home with me so her mom and new baby sister could have some quiet time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/if-ye-love-me-keep-my-commandments.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">I buckled Chloe into her car seat, secured my own seat belt, and drove out of their driveway. However, before we reached the end of the street, Chloe had unbuckled her seat belt and was standing up, looking over my shoulder, and talking to me! I pulled the car over to the side of the road, got out, and buckled her back into her seat.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/if-ye-love-me-keep-my-commandments.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">We started again but had gone only a short distance when she was out of her seat again. I repeated the same steps, but this time before I could even get back into the car and fasten my own seat belt, Chloe was already standing up!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/if-ye-love-me-keep-my-commandments.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">I found myself sitting in a car, parked on the side of the road, having a power struggle with a three-year-old.

I didn\u2019t want to lose that feeling, but I knew I had an opportunity, so I got out and secured her in her car seat. Then I asked, \u201cChloe, will you please stay in your car seat?\u201d And she did\u2014all the way to the market for a treat! And she stayed buckled all the way from the market to my home, where we made bread and played with play dough because Chloe did not forget!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/if-ye-love-me-keep-my-commandments.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">As I drove back onto the road that day, a scripture filled my mind: \u201cIf ye love me, keep my commandments.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-12461_000_045\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131390\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131390)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131390)\">John 14:15<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> We have rules to teach, guide, and protect children. Why? Because of the great love we have for them.

She felt her seat belt limited her freedom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/if-ye-love-me-keep-my-commandments.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">Like Chloe, we can choose to see commandments as limitations. We may feel at times that God\u2019s laws restrict our personal freedom, take from us our agency, and limit our growth.
