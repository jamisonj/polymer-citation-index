His grand design cannot succeed without you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p6\" class=\"\">A few days ago, a letter came to the office addressed to President Benson. I wish to read a portion of it, and then perhaps comment on it. I will not use the writer\u2019s name. She may be listening somewhere, and I would not wish to embarrass her in any way. I will call her Virginia. With that change, I read a part of her letter:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cDear President Benson,<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cMy name is Virginia. I am fourteen years old, and a matter has been on my mind a lot lately. In the scriptures I could not seem to find anywhere whether women may enter into the celestial kingdom if they are worthy. Also, when someone such as Joseph Smith had a vision of the celestial kingdom, he only seemed to see men there. I have prayed about it, but felt that I needed your words. \u2026 In the scriptures, they talk about a woman being blessed if she is righteous, but not about celestial glory. This truly bothers me. If we are all Heavenly Father\u2019s children, then why do the scriptures say that men are to rule over women? And why in the scriptures was Eve created from Adam? I may be foolish, but I honestly do not understand. I love the gospel, and I am learning of its truth. I have a testimony, and I know that I have a divine purpose in life. But I suppose what I am asking is\u2014are men more important than women? And can women go to the celestial kingdom also? \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cI am still young and learning, and I need help in this matter.

Your letter was acknowledged by the secretary to the First Presidency. But I feel that it is so sincere in tone that it deserves a more complete answer. And perhaps the questions you ask are on the minds of many women\u2014young women of your age, women of your mother\u2019s age, and women of your grandmother\u2019s age, be they single, married, or whatever their circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p12\" class=\"\">First, you ask whether women may enter into the celestial kingdom.

At least some of the rules of eligibility for acceptance into that kingdom are clearly set forth, but other than that, we are given little understanding.

However, as I have noted before, there is something very interesting about this situation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p34\" class=\"\">In the sequence of events as set forth in the scripture, God first created the earth, and the earth was without form, and void.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24058\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24058)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24058)\">Gen. 1:2<\/a><\/span>.) He then separated the light from the darkness, and the waters from the land. Then came the creation of vegetation of all kinds, giving the beauty of trees and grass, flowers and shrubs. Then followed the creation of animal life in the sea and upon the land.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p35\" class=\"\">Having looked over all of this, He declared it to be good. He then created man in His own likeness and image. Then as His final creation, the crowning of His glorious work, He created woman. I like to regard Eve as His masterpiece after all that had gone before, the final work before He rested from His labors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p36\" class=\"\">I do not regard her as being in second place to Adam. She was placed at his side as an helpmeet. They were together in the Garden, they were expelled together, and they labored together in the world into which they were driven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p37\" class=\"\">Now, Virginia, you call attention to the statement in the scriptures that Adam should rule over Eve. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24061\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24061)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24061)\">Gen. 3:16<\/a><\/span>.) You ask why this is so. I do not know. I regrettably recognize that some men have used this through centuries of time as justification for abusing and demeaning women. But I am confident also that in so doing they have demeaned themselves and offended the Father of us all, who, I am confident, loves His daughters just as He loves His sons.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p38\" class=\"\">I sat with President David O. McKay on one occasion when he talked about that statement in Genesis. His eyes flashed with anger as he spoke of despotic husbands and stated that they would have to make an accounting of their evil actions when they stand to be judged by the Lord. He indicated that the very essence of the spirit of the gospel demands that any governance in the home must be done only in righteousness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p39\" class=\"\">My own interpretation of that sentence is that the husband shall have a governing responsibility to provide for, to protect, to strengthen and shield the wife. Any man who belittles or abuses or terrorizes, or who rules in unrighteousness, will deserve and, I believe, receive the reprimand of a just God who is the Eternal Father of both His sons and daughters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p40\" class=\"\">You ask whether men are more important than women. I am going to turn that question back to you. Would any of us be here, either men or women, without the other? The scripture states that God created man in His own image, male and female created He them. He commanded them together to multiply and replenish the earth. Each is a creation of the Almighty, mutually dependent and equally necessary for the continuation of the race. Every new generation in the history of mankind is a testimony of the necessity for both man and woman.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p41\" class=\"\">You say in your letter, \u201cI do have a testimony, and I know that I have a divine purpose in life.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p42\" class=\"\">You do have a divine purpose, indeed you do. There is that same element of divinity in you and your sisters as there is in your brothers. All of us are here as part of a divine plan made by a loving Father who is concerned with our immortality and eternal life. The mortal sphere in which we live is preparatory to that which will follow when we return to dwell with God our Father, provided we live worthy of that privilege.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p43\" class=\"\">You state that most scripture is addressed to men.

Last April, I spoke to the regional representatives of the Church, as I have done for a number of years on each occasion when they have come for general conference. These are training meetings where the regional representatives get information that they may carry with them across the Church. There is nothing secret or hidden about what is done there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p50\" class=\"\">However, recently I heard that someone had secured a copy of my talk, looking upon that as a singular accomplishment, as if it had been given in a secret and sinister manner, designed to keep it from the world.

I give it to all, in this forum, because of the activities of a few who evidently are seeking to lead others in the paths which they are following. I speak of those who advocate the offering of prayers to our Mother in Heaven.

The record states that \u2018He himself also knelt upon the earth; and behold he prayed unto the <span class=\"emphasis\">Father,<\/span> and the things which he prayed cannot be written, and the multitude did bear record who heard him.\u2019 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6227\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6227)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6227)\">3 Ne. 17:15<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p61\" class=\"\">\u201cFurthermore, He said: \u2018Pray in your families unto the <span class=\"emphasis\">Father,<\/span> always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed.\u2019 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6234\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6234)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6234)\">3 Ne. 18:21<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p62\" class=\"\">\u201cOn another occasion, \u2018Jesus departed out of the midst of them, and went a little way off from them and bowed himself to the earth, and he said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p63\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018<span class=\"emphasis\">Father,<\/span> I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto these whom I have chosen; and it is because of their belief in me that I have chosen them out of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p64\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018<span class=\"emphasis\">Father,<\/span> I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all them that shall believe in their words.\u2019 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6235\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6235)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6235)\">3 Ne. 19:19\u201321<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p65\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd so I might continue with other specific instances from the scripture. Search as I have, I find nowhere in the standard works an account where Jesus prayed other than to His Father in Heaven or where He instructed the people to pray other than to His Father in Heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p66\" class=\"\">\u201cI have looked in vain for any instance where any President of the Church, from Joseph Smith to Ezra Taft Benson, has offered a prayer to \u2018our Mother in Heaven.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p67\" class=\"\">\u201cI suppose those \u2026 who use this expression and who try to further its use are well-meaning, but they are misguided. The fact that we do not pray to our Mother in Heaven in no way belittles or denigrates her.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p68\" class=\"\">That is the end of the quotation from the talk I gave earlier, to which I may add that none of us can add to or diminish the glory of her of whom we have no revealed knowledge.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p69\" class=\"\">Now in conclusion, may I express my gratitude to you faithful Latter-day Saint women, now numbered in the millions and found across the earth. Great is your power for good. Marvelous are your talents and devotion. Tremendous is your faith and your love for the Lord, for His work, and for His sons and daughters. Continue to live the gospel. Magnify it before all of your associates. Your good works will carry more weight than any words you might speak. Walk in virtue and truth, with faith and faithfulness. You are part of an eternal plan, a plan designed by God our Eternal Father. Each day is a part of that eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p70\" class=\"\">I know that many of you carry terribly heavy burdens. May your associates in the Church, your brethren and sisters, help you with those burdens. May your prayers ascend to Him who is all powerful, who loves you, and who can bring to bear forces and factors which can help you. This is a work of miracles. You know it, and I know it. It is easy for me to tell you not to become discouraged, but I say it nonetheless, as I urge you to go forward in faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p71\" class=\"\">May you be blessed with strength for the work of the day and with love for all who are entrusted to your care.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/daughters-of-god.p72\" class=\"\">You know this work is true, as do I. You know that God our Eternal Father lives and that His Son Jesus Christ, born of Mary as the Only Begotten of the Father, was and is the Redeemer of the world. You know that their work has been restored in this dispensation through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith. You can bear testimony of that as I can and do, as I leave my love and my blessing upon you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Note<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-91911_000_041\"><a name=\"-91911_000_041\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-91911_000_041\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>I am aware of Abigail Adams\u2019s correspondence with John Adams on this point.
