No one may know what reveries troop through her mind as she sits alone, \ndisconsolate. . . The boy that lay nestled under her heart, the boy she nourished from her \nown body during his helpless infancy, the boy for whose future she had dreamed dreams into\nwhich were woven the praises of men's tongues as they extolled his achievements and whose\nchildren should one day sit upon her knee as she told them the story of his rise to fame. . . .\nNow all seems ended, the promise of life cut off, made fruitless, all sacrifices and strivings\nvain. Her boy is dead, victim of blundering human stupidity in a recreant, \nwilfully-disobedient world.\n<\/p><p>\nThen, perhaps, as she sits with her musings, companioned by despair, she sees a vision of\nhope born of the story of that other mother, who with a few women and one tone disciple,\nwatched so long ago at the foot of the cross as her first born, nailed high upon it, died in\nagony between malefactors, 'mid the jeers and taunts of a ribald soldiery and the gloatings of\napparently victorious, bigoted and vengeful adversaries. His birth had been\nheaven-proclaimed, for the angel of God came to that mother at Nazareth and said:\n<\/p><p>\nFear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.\n<\/p><p>\n. . . thou shalt conceive . . . and bring forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus.\n<\/p><p>\nHe shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give\nunto him the throne of his father David:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no\nend (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31116\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31116)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31116)\">Luke 1:30-33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen the bereft mother of today may catch an understanding glimpse of the conflicting\nemotions which must have tugged and pulled at the heart of Mary as, after seeing him laid in\nthe tomb, she reviewed the checkered and mysterious life of this heaven-heralded Son.\n<\/p><p>\nREVIEWING EVENTS IN THE SAVIOR'S LIFE\n<\/p><p>\nEtched ineffaceably upon her memory must have been that angelic salutation: \"Hail, thou that\nart highly favored, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31113\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31113)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31113)\">Luke 1:28<\/a><\/span>). And again her\nheart must have throbbed as she recalled the prediction of eternal kingship for her promised\nChild. As memory's scroll unrolled, she would live again those thirty years of filial obedience\nuntil he went to be baptized of that strange man, John\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33862\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33862)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33862)\">Matt. 3:13-17<\/a><\/span>). She would relive that long vigil in the\nwilderness, where he scorned the temptation to prostitute his power or to barter his soul for\nall the kingdoms of the world and their glory\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33863\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33863)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33863)\">Matt. 4:1-11<\/a><\/span>).\nTracing his steps back to his native province\nshe would recall how he \"went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching\nthe Gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease\namong the people (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33868\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33868)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33868)\">Matt. 4:23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were\ntaken with divers diseases and torments . . . and he healed them.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and\nfrom Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond Jordan\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33870\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33870)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33870)\">Matt. 4:24-25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nShe would probably see herself seated as a member of that congregation at Nazareth when he\nwent into the synagogue on the Sabbath day whence, because he said that the scriptures were\nfulfilled in him, his own townspeople drove him out and through the city to the edge of the\nescapement with evident intent to cast him headlong into the abyss below. But apparently for\nonce exercising his power in his own behalf he passed through them and went his way\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31119\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31119)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31119)\">Luke 4:16-30<\/a><\/span>). There\nwould pass in review before her mind his triumphal entry into Jerusalem when the people\nthronged to meet Him and strewed the way with their garments and with palm branches and\nshouted: \"Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33918\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33918)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33918)\">Matt. 21:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAgain she would hear His penetrating words from the side of the mountain by the seashore as\nin that most wonderful of all sermons ever uttered by the lips of man He called blessed the\npoor in spirit, the meek, the merciful, the pure in heart, the peacemakers, they who hunger\nand thirst after righteousness and those who are reviled and persecuted and evil spoken of for\nHis name's sake (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33871\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33871)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33871)\">Matt. 5:3-12<\/a><\/span>),\nand would witness again in retrospect His compassionate\nfeeding of the multitude (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27126\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27126)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27126)\">John 6:5-14<\/a><\/span>)\nand see them attempt forcibly to crown Him king\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27128\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27128)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27128)\">John 6:15<\/a><\/span>) only to turn back\nand \"walk no more with him\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27131\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27131)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27131)\">John 6:66<\/a><\/span>)\nwhen he explained that his doctrines laid heavy exactions\nupon those who followed him in the matter of the purity and fidelity of their personal lives\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27129\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27129)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27129)\">John 6:60<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLooking back she would recall how He had astonished the learned by the depth of His\nunderstanding, and confounded hypocritical questioners by the power of His unfailing\nwisdom; how He showed mercy to the sinner, brought comfort to the disconsolate, hope to\nthe oppressed, cheer to the heavy laden, and healing to the broken hearted.\n<\/p><p>\nAll these triumphs Mary must have witnessed or heard report of. And then last of all would\ncome the sickening vision of His being tried before Herod and Pilate, meekly submitting to be\ndressed in a purple robe, with a crown of thorns crushed upon His brow, and mocked and\nscourged (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32978\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32978)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32978)\">Mark 15:17-20<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27167\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27167)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27167)\">John 19:1-5<\/a><\/span>). And finally\nthere would haunt her the sight of His staggering under the weight of\nHis own cross and dying in agony upon it.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat was to be made of it all? This ignominious death seemed to spell the failure of His life,\nthe frustration of His mission and the thwarting of the promise of perpetual reign over the\nkingdom which should be without end.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE WONDER OF THE RESURRECTION\n<\/p><p>\nBut Mary had not long to wrestle with these perplexities for: \"In the end of the Sabbath, as it\nbegan to dawn toward the first day of the week. . .\" came the women to the sepulchre to\nperform certain unfinished offices for the dead. Their wonder grew as an angel who was\nseated upon the stone which had been rolled back from the door of the tomb said:\n<\/p><p>\nFear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here: for he is\nrisen, as he said . . . And go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33938\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33938)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33938)\">Matt. 28:1-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSuch is the glorious message of that great triumphal morning. It bore to Mary the answer to\nher bewilderment. Now she could know the promises for her Son made at the annunciation\nhad not failed, that his life of anxiety and care and suffering and sorrow had not been in vain.\nSo in like manner may every brooding mother who has received a \"We regret to inform you\"\nletter draw strength from the assurance that the life of her loved one has not failed. Perhaps,\nwithin his finite limitations, in a weak similitude of the great vicarious offering of the Lord\nfor the redemption of the race, her boy, too, has given his life, a vicarious offering. For in\nthis world he himself will never reap the fruits of his own sacrifice.\n<\/p><p>\nAs such mother sits alone with her anguish and reviews the events of the life of her martyred\nson there may unfold before her vision the scroll upon which are written the experiences of\nMary, the mother of the Son of God, and from the final triumph of His life she may draw the\nsustaining power of hope and faith; for the resurrection is as universal as the\nrace.\n<\/p><p>\nIts bringing about was the great crowning achievement of Christ's life. To that consummation\nits whole course had been directed. As He approached the time of His agony, He said, \"but\nfor this cause came I unto this hour\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27143\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27143)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27143)\">John 12:27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,\" said He again, \"will draw all men unto me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27146\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27146)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27146)\">John 12:32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFurther He told His disciples: \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into\nthe ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27141\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27141)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27141)\">John 12:24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSo His death and burial and resurrection from the dead bears fruit in the raising of all who\ndie. That was the whole burden of the message of the disciples.\n<\/p><p>\nPAUL'S TESTIMONY BEFORE AGRIPPA\n<\/p><p>\nPaul, standing in bonds before Agrippa, said:\n<\/p><p>\nAt midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun,\nshining round about me and them which journeyed with me.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the\nHebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the\npricks.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7533\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7533)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7533)\">Acts 26:13-15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThese are not the words of an unlettered man, nor of one infatuated by living under the spell\nof the powerful personality of Jesus, or deluded by the stories told of Him by His admirers.\nFor by his own confession Paul had lived a Pharisee, the strictest sect of his religion\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7530\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7530)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7530)\">Acts 22:3<\/a><\/span>), they\nwho had been the subjects of the Lord's severest chastisements.\n<\/p><p>\nHe hated the Christians with a bitter hate. He had testified against them when they were\ncondemned to death; had hounded them from city to city, thrown them into prison, compelled\nthem to blaspheme, and had vilely persecuted them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7519\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7519)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7519)\">Acts 8:1-4<\/a><\/span>).\nHe was on such mission to Damascus\nwhen the light appeared before him in the way and he heard the risen Lord's voice\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7521\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7521)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7521)\">Acts 9:1-9<\/a><\/span>). The\nreality of his experience&mdash;the sincerity of his conversion&mdash;is attested by the devotion of his\nsubsequent life, enduring shipwreck, privation, persecution, chains, and finally death for his\ntestimony of the reality of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus. With faultless logic he wrote to the\nCorinthians:\n<\/p><p>\nNow if Christ be preached that he arose from the dead, how say some among you that there is\nno resurrection of the dead?\n<\/p><p>\nBut if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. . . .\n<\/p><p>\nBut now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120)\">1 Cor. 15:12-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat doctrine is the center and pivot of Christian theology, the foundation of the Christian\nreligion, the very basis of Christian hope. Strip that dogma from your creed, and you destroy\nChristianity. Take it away, and you devitalize your New Testament, for it is the fundamental\nfact of that whole record.\n<\/p><p>\nMR. MOODY'S ADVICE TO A YOUNG PREACHER\n<\/p><p>\nIt is related that in Europe, the great evangelist, Mr. Moody, was asked by a young minister,\n\"What makes the difference between the success of your preaching and mine; one of us is\nwrong?\"\n<\/p><p>\nMoody said: \"You have heard me preach and I haven't heard you, you tell me the difference.\"\nThe minister answered: \"You make a good deal out of the death of Christ. . . I don't think\nthat has anything to do with it. I preach life.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen Mr. Moody quoted him several scriptures declaring the atonement and asked the young\npreacher with respect to each, \"What do you do with that?\" He said in each instance, \"I never\npreached that,\" and finally asserted: \"I think the whole thing is a sham.\" Then said Mr.\nMoody:\n<\/p><p>\n\"I advise you to get out of the ministry very quickly. I would not preach a sham. If the Bible\nis untrue, let us stop preaching, and come out like men and fight against it if it is a sham and\nuntrue; but if these things are true, and Jesus Christ left heaven and came into this world to\nshed His blood and save sinners, then let us lay hold of it and preach it in season and out of\nseason.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThat is one of the things that admit of no compromise. It is of the \"all or none\" variety. The\nsame record which recounts the miracle of the resurrection contains all we know about the\nmoral teachings of Jesus. You can't very well repudiate it as to the one and enlist enthusiastic\nallegiance for it in respect of the other. Today is kept a memorial by all Christendom. The\nvery commemoration of the day assumes the reality of the occurrence it signalizes, for you\ncannot commemorate an event that never happened.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE RESURRECTION THE FOUNDATION OF FAITH AND HOPE\n<\/p><p>\nThe great stumbling block to acceptance of the crucifixion and the resurrection, seems to be\nthat they are thought opposed to natural law. But what is natural law? Who established it? It\nis conceded on almost all sides that there is a supernatural law operative in this universe. Who\nis to say that in effecting the purposes of God it may not transcend natural law? If you grant\nGod at all, does it seem consistent to suppose that He set laws in motion which froze Him\noutside of them and rendered Him impotent before the works of His own hands?\n<\/p><p>\nWe know so little about this wondrous world in which increasing knowledge only reveals\nvistas stretching further and further into the realm of the unknown that he must be a reckless\nman indeed who would dare affirm of his own finite wisdom what is and\nwhat is not possible with God.\n<\/p><p>\nIn far too great degree the professedly Christian world has to its own obvious harm become\napostate to the reality of the announcement, \"He is risen from the dead\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33942\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33942)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33942)\">Matt. 28:7<\/a><\/span>). Take away belief in\nthat reality and you make rubble of the foundations of faith and rob the disconsolate of their\nfairest hope.\n<\/p><p>\nThe record tells of an occurrence when Jesus with His disciples and \"much people\" was\nentering the city called Nain. They were met by a funeral procession taking to his burial the\nonly son of a widow. Having compassion upon that mother, Jesus bade her cease weeping and\nbidding the young man to arise from the bier He delivered him alive to her\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31122\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31122)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31122)\">Luke 7:11-16<\/a><\/span>). As He stopped\nthat funeral procession and restored the dead to life so by His death and resurrection He has\nstopped forever the triumph of death for all men.\n<\/p><p>\nTo every weeping mother the empty tomb proclaims aloud the glad tidings that whether the\nbones of her child lie bleaching on Africa's hot sands, or find their rest in the bottom of the\nsea, or his body is lowered into the grave he shall be raised up again and live.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
