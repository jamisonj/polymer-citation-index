He lived on the American continent a few hundred years after the advent of Christ. He had at his disposal a continuous religious and historical record of the people who had migrated to, and lived for hundreds of years on, the American continents. Mormon made an abridgment of these records, which contained the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The record was engraved on gold plates and deposited in a hill known as Cumorah, located in what we now know to be the state of New York. In this latter day, under divine direction, Joseph Smith obtained the plates and translated them by the power of God. This abridgment was titled the Book of Mormon.

Yet because of transgressions there was a turning away from these truths, and there was a fulfillment of the prediction of the apostle Paul, who said: \u201cNow we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/touchstone-of-truth.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cThat ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that day of Christ is at hand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/touchstone-of-truth.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cLet no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5055\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5055)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5055)\">2 Thes. 2:1\u20133<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/touchstone-of-truth.p10\" class=\"\">President Joseph Fielding Smith summed up well what had happened as he said: \u201cIt should be remembered that the entire Christian world in 1820 had lost the true doctrine concerning God. The simple truth which was understood so clearly by the apostles and saints of old had been lost in the mysteries of an apostate world. All the ancient prophets, and the apostles of Jesus Christ had a clear understanding that the Father and the Son were separate personages, as our scriptures so clearly teach. Through apostasy this knowledge was lost, and in the year 325 <span class=\"small\">A.D.<\/span>, a strange doctrine was introduced and soon spread throughout the Christian world. This doctrine confounded the persons of the Godhead, and distorted the true doctrine of God.\u201d (Joseph Fielding Smith, <span class=\"emphasis\">Answers to Gospel Questions,<\/span> vol. 3, p. 117.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/touchstone-of-truth.p11\" class=\"\">There is no question that Jesus taught the very nature of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost\u2014three personages of form and substance, individual and distinct. He taught that the true knowledge of the Godhead was essential to eternal life.
