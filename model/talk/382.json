I trust it may be answered,\nespecially in my behalf I believe in prayer, the power of prayer; and I sincerely desire, my\nbrethren and sisters, and would appreciate a silent prayer at this time by all of you in my\nbehalf.\n<\/p><p>\nI am happy that the mission presidents and their wives are with us in this conference. The\nmission presidents depend so much upon their wives that I am sure they are all happy that\ntheir wives were also invited to come to this conference. The more I associate with you\nmission presidents and you stake presidencies, the more convinced I am that the leaders who\nare responsible for calling you are inspired of God.\n<\/p><p>\nMEXICAN MISSION\n<\/p><p>\nSister McKay and I just recently returned from a tour of the Mexican Mission where President\nArwell L. Pierce and his lovely wife are in charge. They have done and are doing a\nwonderful work. It was one delightful surprise after another to go through their mission with\nthem. We were delighted to meet so many fine missionaries there&mdash;142 of them&mdash;and twenty\nof those 142 we were glad to find were native Mexicans, full-time missionaries, and doing a\nsplendid work. With the experience that these young people are getting, I am sure they will be\nfuture leaders, not only of the Church but will also perhaps occupy state and federal positions.\n<\/p><p>\nWe were delighted also to find several very fine meetinghouses with chapels not too large,\ncommodious recreation halls, classrooms, baptismal font, Relief Society rooms with modern\nkitchens adjoining. The architecture is Spanish and with the red-tiled roofs and the white\nwalls these meetinghouses stand out as monuments of good fellowship. The new chapel at\nChautla dedicated last year by President McKay has now been parked with a hedge,\nshrubbery, trees, and lawn, under the direction of Brother Abegg, who has supervision of the\nbuildings and grounds, and it is now referred to proudly by the citizens as the \"House\nBeautiful.\" Splendid progress is being made especially by applying the program of the M.I.A.\nsupervised recreation. The Spanish people love to sing and to dance. Their Gold and Green\nballs are outstanding, as are also their quartets, their choruses, and their athletics. Basketball\nhas swept into the Mexican republic, and our missionaries are leading in that sport. They have\nplayed in two leagues and won the championship in both. The last one was in Mexico City.\nThe final game of the series was being played. The score had been tied several times; and\nnow with only four minutes to play, our team was behind. The captain, a sweet character,\ncalled time out. He said, \"We got our heads together, Brother McKay, and we prayed.\" God\nbless him. They won the game by one point. They are making many friends also with their\nEnglish classes. In Morelia, for example, a college town where they have been working less\nthan a year, a meeting was arranged, and a program given by investigators. We have only two\nmembers there. They have an advanced English class and a beginner's class. There were\nsixty-two at that meeting so they are making fine progress.\n<\/p><p>\nThe mission home is a credit to the Church, beautifully located in a new residential section. It\nis what I call an ideal mission home, not just a place for the mission president and his wife,\nbut a place where the missionaries are made to feel at home. Sister Pierce in her quiet,\ngenerous way, looking after everybody, can always make room for one more. When\nmissionaries are ailing, they are brought to the home and nursed back to health. They are\nmade to feel welcome. Each morning at seven o'clock a class in Spanish is held for the office\nforce and those who are there recuperating. At eight o'clock the gong sounds; they come to\nbreakfast; they sing a song around the piano and stand in a circle, and each one repeats in\nSpanish a passage of scripture he must learn by heart, then they kneel in a circle in prayer. I\nthink that prayer circle does more for these missionaries who are recuperating and probably a\nlittle discouraged and homesick, maybe lovesick, than almost anything else.\n<\/p><p>\nPOWER IN PRAYER\n<\/p><p>\nYes, there is power in prayer. I thought while participating in the fine spirit of those mission\nhome prayers of an evil that has been referred to here already&mdash;the divorce evil. A menace to\nthe very foundation of our government, of our civilization; it seems that the devil is using this\nweapon of divorce overtime, and I believe that if a survey were made, very few, if any, of\nthose thousands of couples who are applying for divorce would be found praying together, or\nwho are having family prayer. I think prayer is a remedy for divorce.\n<\/p><p>\nOne writer, in speaking of prayer, puts it this way, and I like it:\n<\/p><p>\nThe most unused resource in the world today is prayer. The greatest undeveloped resource is\nfaith and the greatest unused resource is prayer.\n<\/p><p>\nI like that, referring to <i>faith<\/i> and <i>prayer<\/i> as resources. I hope, in our Church, that is not true,\nbut that prayer as a resource is used, and I am sure it is. Quite a number of articles are being\nwritten in our leading magazines and even books on \"Back to God,\" \"The Need of Religion,\"\netc. I think it is a wholesome indication. I received something the other day from one of my\nvery dear friends, who calls on me occasionally and always brings me something worthwhile;\nhe is ninety-two years old now. He said he has had ninety-two birthdays but is not nearly that\nold. He said, \"I have here something, Brother McKay, that I think you will like on prayer.\"\nHe said, \"It is a clipping from one of our local papers.\" It is from Dr. Alexis Cartel, who is\nfamed the world over after thirty-three years of biological research work in the famous\nRockefeller Institute.\n<\/p><p>\nQUOTATIONS ON PRAYER\n<\/p><p>\nHe says:\n<\/p><p>\nPrayer is not only worship, but it is also the most powerful form of energy that one can\ngenerate. The influence of prayer on the human mind and body is as demonstrable as that of\nsecreting glands. Its results can be measured in terms of increased physical buoyancy, greater\nintellectual vigor, moral stamina, and a deeper understanding of the realities underlying\nhuman relations.\n<\/p><p>\nIf you make a habit of sincere prayer your life will be very noticeably and profoundly altered.\nPrayer stamps with its indelible mark our actions and demeanor. A tranquility of bearing, a\nfacial and bodily repose are observed in those whose inner lives are thus enriched. Within the\ndepths of his consciousness a flame kindles, and man sees himself&mdash;his selfishness, his silly\npride, his fear, his blunders. He develops a sense of moral obligation, intellectual humility.\nThus begins a journey of the soul toward the realm of peace.\n<\/p><p>\nPrayer is a force as real as terrestrial gravity. As a physician I have seen men, after all other\ntherapy had failed, lifted out of disease and melancholy by the serene effort of prayer.\n<\/p><p>\nPrayer is the effort of man to reach God, to commune with an invisible being, creator of all\nthings, supreme wisdom, truth, beauty and strength, father and redeemer.\n<\/p><p>\nToday as never before, prayer is a binding necessity in the lives of men and nations. The lack\nof emphasis on the religious sense has brought the world to the edge of destruction. Our\ndeepest sense of power and perfection has been left miserably undeveloped. Prayer, the basic\nexercise of the spirit, must be actively practiced in our lives. The neglected soul of man must\nbe made strong enough to assert itself once more. For if the power of prayer is again released\nand used in the lives of common men and women, if the spirit declares its aims clearly and\nboldly, there is yet hope that our prayers for a better world may be answered.\n<\/p><p>\nThat from a scientist, brothers and sisters.\n<\/p><p>\nThis same dear friend of mine called my attention to an article, in the December number, I\nthink, of the <i>Arizona Highways<\/i> on \"Look to the Skies.\" It is a very well-written article, well\nworth reading, and in speaking of the skies, it reminded me of a poem that I read and used\njust at the close of the war. It is a poem that was found on the body of a dead soldier. He\nwrote it just before the zero hour. It refers to the skies and to the power of prayer in taking\naway fear.\n<\/p><p>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . . . And God Was There\n<\/p><p>\nLook, God, I have never spoken to you.<br \/>\nBut now I want to say. \"How do you do?\"<br \/>\nYou see, God, they told me you didn't exist,<br \/>\nAnd, like a fool, I believed all this.\n<\/p><p>\nLast night from the shell hole I saw your sky&mdash;<br \/>\nI figured right then they had told me a lie.<br \/>\nHad I taken time to see things you made,<br \/>\nI'd have known they weren't calling a spade a spade.\n<\/p><p>\nI wonder, God, if you'd shake my hand.<br \/>\nSomehow I feel that you will understand.<br \/>\nFunny I had to come to this hellish place<br \/>\nBefore I had time to see your face.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, I guess there isn't much more to say.<br \/>\nBut I'm sure glad, God, I met you today<br \/>\nI guess the \"zero hour\" will soon be here.<br \/>\nBut I'm not afraid since I know you're near.\n<\/p><p>\nThe signal! Well, God, I'll have to go;<br \/>\nI like you lots, this I want you to know.<br \/>\nLook, now, this will be a horrible fight&mdash;<br \/>\nWho knows, I may come to your house tonight.\n<\/p><p>\nThough I wasn't friendly to you before,<br \/>\nI wonder, God, if you'd wait at your door.<br \/>\nLook. I'm crying! Me! Shedding tears&mdash;<br \/>\nI wish I had known you these many years\n<\/p><p>\nWell, I have to go now, God, good-bye!<br \/>\nStrange, since I met you, I'm not afraid to die.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE MASTER'S PRAYER\n<\/p><p>\nOur Master, just before his zero hour, spent the night in the garden in prayer. We are told that\nhe shed drops of blood, but the concluding words of that prayer show that he received his\nstrength.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . not my will, but thine, be done\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31249\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31249)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31249)\">Luke 22:42<\/a><\/span>)\nwere his concluding words and then on the cross:\n<\/p><p>\nFather forgive them; for they know not what they do\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31250\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31250)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31250)\">Luke 23:34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe are here today, brethren and sisters, because this great Church of ours has been\norganized&mdash;a wonderful organization&mdash;established for the last time, never to be taken away\ntaken away from the earth or given to another people, and all in answer to a prayer, a prayer\nin a garden, the Sacred Grove. Yes, there is power in prayer, and I trust that we will look up\nbrethren and sisters, look up to the skies, that from now on that statement that prayer is the\nmost unused resource of the world will not, at least, apply to Latter-day Saints and also the\nsaying that people use their prayers very much as a spare tire, only in times of emergency,\nwhen we are sick or have trouble. May that also not be true of us, but may we pray always\nand live, as we pray so that we, too, can say, \"Not my will, O Lord, but thine be done,\" I\npray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
