Moyle, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1951, pp. 12-16<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI join with you my brethren and sisters in expressing to our Father in heaven our thanks and\ngratitude for our great leader and president who stands at the head of the Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter day Saints here and now. I hope that we shall all have that faith in his\nadmonitions which will permit us to go forward and enact in our lives the teachings which we\nthus receive through the mouthpiece of our Heavenly Father, here on this earth.\n<\/p><p>\nDIVINITY OF THE WORK\n<\/p><p>\nI know that I speak the thoughts of all who are here assembled when I say that we uphold\nand sustain President David O. McKay as our prophet, seer, and revelator. And so it is with\ngreat humility that I stand here before you and in his presence, in the presence of my\nbrethren, to bear my testimony to you of the divinity of the work in which we are engaged.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful for the unity which exists among the General Authorities of this Church, and I\nknow that there is, thus, an example set to the people of the Church by which they could very\nwell profit. That same unity should extend into every stake and into every ward, every\nmission, every branch of the Church. I am grateful for the sustaining power and influence that\ncomes into my life and assists me in my work as a result of your faith and prayers, my\nbrethren and sisters. I am grateful for the affection, the sustaining power and influence, the\nfaith and prayers of my brethren with whom I have the privilege to associate day by day, and\nacknowledge before you and my Heavenly Father that our ministry would be empty were it\nnot for these sustaining influences. I know with all my heart that God lives and that Jesus is\nthe Christ, and I want for nothing but to dedicate my life, my energy, to proclaiming this\ntestimony to the world, to let my fellow men know that there can be no joy in life, and\ncertainly no salvation hereafter, unless we understand the laws of God, given to us for our\nhappiness and our salvation, and in turn lend obedience to them.\n<\/p><p>\nOBEDIENCE TO LAW\n<\/p><p>\nI feel to repeat the revelation given us by the Prophet Joseph Smith, which President McKay\nhas already quoted you this morning,\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world,\nupon which all blessings are predicated,\n<\/p><p>\nAnd when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which\nit is predicated (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12946\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12946)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12946)\">D&amp;C 130:20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has said:\n<\/p><p>\nI, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have\nno promise (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12906\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12906)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12906)\">D&amp;C 82:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay has told us here this morning the responsibilities we have resting upon us as\nfathers and mothers in Israel. I testify to you that if we do that which we have been\ncommanded, our children and our children's children will be blessed and will be encouraged\nto walk in our footsteps and will be crowned eventually with us in the glory of our Father's\nkingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nFor a long time past I have been tremendously impressed with the fact that God is no\nrespecter of persons (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7653\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7653)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7653)\">Acts 10:34<\/a><\/span>),\nthat his Church and kingdom here upon this earth is governed and\nregulated and controlled by law, and that that law is your law; it is my law; and to that law\nthere are no exceptions.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have been told in the scriptures that,\n<\/p><p>\nFor there is no respect of persons with God.\n<\/p><p>\nFor as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law; and as many as\nhave sinned in the law shall be judged by the law\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42691\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42691)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42691)\">Rom. 2:11-12<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nI say that those of us who have received the law must of necessity be judged by it and be\nresponsible for any disobedience we contribute to it.\n<\/p><p>\nFor not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be\njustified (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42692\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42692)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42692)\">Rom. 2:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat is the law of the gospel, and so, as we understand these simple fundamental laws of the\ngospel, we must live them; we must teach them to our children; we must be bound by them;\nand we must claim no exemption for ourselves.\n<\/p><p>\nNO SPECIAL PRIVILEGES\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Widtsoe, who is absent from our midst today, has recently written, \"Full happiness\nwithin the Church demands that men comply with all its laws, regulations, and ordinances.\nObedience is incomplete if a person decides to obey one and disobey another gospel\nrequirement. Usually, an attempt to select some practices and ignore others leads to a\nweakening of the will for righteousness, and soon complete disobedience sets in\"\n(<i>Joseph Smith<\/i>, p. 166). I am sure we will accept that as true, that we must do nothing which weakens\nour will.\n<\/p><p>\nI have a feeling that sometimes we are inclined to exempt ourselves from the law. We seek\nspecial privileges. I don't know whether it has become so common in the world for men\npolitically and socially to claim exemptions from the operation of the civil law as applied to\nthem that they think maybe, within the realm of the kingdom and Church of God they are\nlikewise entitled to special privileges. I am sure of one thing, that President McKay does not\nclaim any special privileges for himself, and that the General Authorities follow his example,\nand we know and we believe that we are bound by the law.\n<\/p><p>\nSTRICT CONFORMITY\n<\/p><p>\nI believe it is time when many of us should feel that it is important to hew strictly to the line,\nto keep our own houses in order. So I ask you in light of these suggestions, should we insist\nupon going on a mission or sending our sons unless we are worthy? Can we meet the\nrequirements that have been laid down for those entitled to go? Should we ever feel it\nnecessary to call upon our bishop or our stake president for a recommend to go to the temple\nif we know that we have not first met the law in respect thereto and have made ourselves\nworthy to receive this special privilege? Some of us may feel that we can impose upon the\nbishop a little bit, that we will be forgiven. I wonder how many of us realize that we cannot\nexpect, if we go to the House of the Lord unworthily (whether we go there for our own\nendowments or to do vicarious work for those who have preceded us), the same efficacy will\nattach to our work as would to the work of those who go to the House of the Lord worthily.\nLet us think about that, and in place of asking for a special privilege, see that we keep the\nlaws of God in our own homes and in our own lives, and encourage our own sons and\ndaughters to do likewise in order that they might go to the House of the Lord worthily.\n<\/p><p>\nThe same could be said of the Word of Wisdom, the payment of tithes, fasting. We have\ncarried on in the Church, all this year, a great campaign connected with the welfare program\nof the Church to encourage our people to fast. I say to you today that there are none of the\nblessings of the fast that can come to you and me unless we fast. We must all fast in the same\nmanner. There is no exception to the requirement that we do fast if we are ultimately going to\nhave a real interest in the kingdom of our Heavenly Father, as King Benjamin once said\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40239\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40239)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40239)\">Mosiah 4:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn speaking of charity, Brigham Young and the Twelve said, in April, 1842, while building\nthe temple in Nauvoo: \n<\/p><p>\nThis is not all. It will be in vain for us to build a place where the Son of Man may lay\nhis head (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34436\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34436)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34436)\">Matt. 8:20<\/a><\/span>),\nand leave the cry of the widow and the fatherless unheard by us ascending\nup to the orphan's God and the widow's Friend. It is in vain we cry \"Lord, Lord\" and\ndo not the things our Lord hath commanded\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31290\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31290)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31290)\">Luke 6:46<\/a><\/span>),\nto visit the widow, the fatherless, the\nsick, the lame, the blind, the destitute, and minister to their necessities (<i>DHC<\/i>\n4:591).\n<\/p><p>\nI call attention to prayer. Can we accomplish the purposes that President McKay has outlined\nfor us with reference to our children if we do not pray, as a family, in the home, bring into\nour homes and into the lives of our youths the spirit as well as the power and inspiration of\nprayer? And so I say that no home should be surprised if its children do not receive the same\nstrength and courage that other children reared in a home of prayer receive, if they are reared\nin a household which is a stranger to prayer.\n<\/p><p>\nHONESTY IN DAILY LIVES\n<\/p><p>\nSome of us claim the privilege of withholding support from our bishop, our stake president,\nand some of us feel that for one reason or another it is not incumbent on us to sustain the\nGeneral Authorities of the Church, each man in his office and calling. But I say to you that\nwe cannot fail to respond, especially those of us who hold the priesthood and our wives and\nour families, to the requirement which God has written into his law in respect thereto and\nreceive the blessings that might otherwise be ours. In our daily lives it is impossible for us to\ncheat a little and still be honest.\n<\/p><p>\nThe commandment is to pay every man his dues, and no man can get to heaven who\njustly owes his brother or his neighbor, who has or can get the means and will not pay\nit; it is dishonest, and no dishonest man can enter where God is (Brigham Young and\nthe \"twelve,\" April 1842, <i>Ibid.<\/i>, 593).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is impossible for us to take advantage of one another in any way, shape, or form and still\nhave that brotherly love which should characterize the membership of the Church of Jesus\nChrist. We could go on and review all of the activities of life and come to the same\nconclusion on each. It is therefore proper for us today to\n<\/p><p>\nBring forth fruits meet for repentance,\n<\/p><p>\nAnd think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father; for I say unto\nyou, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham\n(see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"34402\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34402)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34402)\">Matt. 3:8-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFor the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his\nseed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42693\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42693)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42693)\">Rom. 4:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn other words, no matter whether we today boast of being of the seed of Abraham, just as\nthe house of Israel did in the days of old, we are nevertheless to be justified only by our\nobedience to the law of God.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to\nevery man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2245\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2245)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2245)\">1 Pet. 1:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe must never forget.\n<\/p><p>\nThat which breaketh a law, and abideth not by law, but seeketh to become a law unto\nitself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, cannot be sanctified by\nlaw, neither by mercy, justice, nor judgment. Therefore, they must remain filthy still\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12912\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12912)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12912)\">D&amp;C 88:35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBe not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also\nreap.\n<\/p><p>\nFor he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to\nthe Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23231\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23231)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23231)\">Gal. 6:7-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI hope and pray, my brethren and sisters, we shall as a result of this great conference go to\nour homes, to our work, to our wives, and to our families, and realize and appreciate that we\nmust teach the law as it has been revealed to us in these latter days and then lend strict\nobedience to it, and dedicate our lives to our families and to our children that they might\nlikewise be obedient, and this I humbly pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
