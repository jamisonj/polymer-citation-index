The gallery proudly proclaims its Rembrandt Room and Constable Corner and urges all to take the tour of Turner\u2019s masterpieces. Visitors come from every corner of the earth. They depart uplifted and inspired.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p5\" class=\"\">During a recent visit to the National Gallery, I was surprised to see displayed in a most prominent location magnificent portraits and landscapes which featured the name of no artist. Then I noticed a large placard which provided this explanation:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cThis exhibition is drawn from the large number of paintings that hang in a public but somewhat neglected area of the Gallery: the lower floor. The exhibition is intended to encourage visitors to look at the paintings without being too worried about who painted them. In several instances, we do not precisely know.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cThe information on labels on paintings can often affect, half-unconsciously, our estimate of them; and here labeling has been deliberately subordinate in the hope that visitors will read only after they have looked and made their own assessment of each work.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p8\" class=\"\">Like the labels on paintings are the outward appearances of some men\u2014often misleading. The Master declared to one group: \u201cWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men\u2019s bones, and of all uncleanness. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cYe \u2026 outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36955\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36955)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36955)\">Matt. 23:27\u201328<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p10\" class=\"\">Then there are those who may outwardly appear impoverished, without talent, and doomed to mediocrity. A classic label appeared beneath a picture of the boy Abraham Lincoln as he stood in front of his humble birthplace\u2014a simple log cabin. The words read: \u201cIll-housed, ill-clothed, ill-fed.\u201d Unanticipated, unspoken, and unprinted was the real label of the boy: \u201cDestined for immortal glory.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p11\" class=\"\">As the poet expressed:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Nobody knows what a boy is worth,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">We\u2019ll have to wait and see.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">But every man in a noble place,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">A boy once used to be.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p16\" class=\"\">At another time, and in a distant place, the boy Samuel must have appeared like any lad his age as he ministered unto the Lord before Eli.

However, after Eli had listened to the boy\u2019s account and told him it was of the Lord, Samuel followed Eli\u2019s counsel and subsequently responded to the Lord\u2019s call with the memorable reply, \u201cSpeak; for thy servant heareth.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2657\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2657)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2657)\">1 Sam. 3:10<\/a><\/span>.)

Such was a cold and very old city in eastern Canada. The missionaries called it \u201cStony Kingston.\u201d There had been but one convert to the Church in six years, even though missionaries had been continuously assigned there during the entire interval. No one baptized in Kingston. Just ask any missionary who labored there. Time in Kingston was marked on the calendar like days in prison. A missionary transfer to another place\u2014any place\u2014would be uppermost in thoughts, even in dreams.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p27\" class=\"\">While I was praying about and pondering this sad dilemma, for my responsibility then as a mission president required that I pray and ponder about such things, my wife called to my attention an excerpt from the book, <span class=\"emphasis\">A Child\u2019s Story of the Prophet Brigham Young,<\/span> by Deta Petersen Neeley (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1959, p. 36). She read aloud that Brigham Young entered Kingston, Ontario, on a cold and snow-filled day. He labored there about thirty days and baptized forty-five souls. Here was the answer. If the missionary Brigham Young could accomplish this harvest, so could the missionaries of today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p28\" class=\"\">Without providing an explanation, I withdrew the missionaries from Kingston, that the cycle of defeat might be broken. Then the carefully circulated word: \u201cSoon a new city will be opened for missionary work, even the city where Brigham Young proselyted and baptized forty-five persons in thirty days.\u201d The missionaries speculated as to the location. Their weekly letters pleaded for the assignment to this Shangri-la. More time passed. Then four carefully selected missionaries\u2014two of them new, two of them experienced\u2014were chosen for this high adventure. The members of the small branch pledged their support. The missionaries pledged their lives. The Lord honored both.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p29\" class=\"\">In the space of three months, Kingston became the most productive city of the Canadian Mission. The grey limestone buildings still stood, the city had not altered its appearance, the population remained constant. The change was one of attitude. The label of doubt yielded to the label of faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p30\" class=\"\">The branch president of the Kingston Branch of the Church wore his own identifying label. Gustav Wacker was from the old country. He spoke English with a thick accent. He never owned or drove a car. He plied the trade of a barber. The highlight of his day would be when he had the privilege of cutting the hair of a missionary. Never would there be a charge. Indeed, he would reach deep into his pockets and give the missionaries all of his tips for the day. If it were raining, as it often does in Kingston, President Wacker would call a taxi and send the missionaries to their apartment by taxi, while he himself, at day\u2019s end, would lock the small shop and walk home\u2014in the driving rain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p31\" class=\"\">I first met Gustav Wacker when I noticed that his tithing paid was far in excess of that expected from his potential income. My efforts to explain that the Lord required no more than ten percent as tithing fell on attentive but unconvinced ears. He simply responded that he loved to pay all he could to the Lord. It amounted to about half his income. His dear wife felt exactly as he did. Their unique manner of tithing payment continued throughout their earning lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p32\" class=\"\">Gustav and Margarete Wacker established a home that was a heaven. They were not blessed with children but mothered and fathered their many Church visitors. A sophisticated and learned leader from Ottawa told me, \u201cI like to visit President Wacker. I come away refreshed in spirit and determined to ever live close to the Lord.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p33\" class=\"\">Did our Heavenly Father honor such abiding faith? The branch prospered. The membership outgrew the rented Slovakian Hall and moved into a modern and lovely chapel of their own. President and Sister Wacker had their prayers answered by serving a proselyting mission to their native Germany and later a temple mission to the beautiful temple in Washington, D.C. Then, just three months ago, his mission in mortality concluded, Gustav Wacker passed away peacefully while being held in the loving arms of his eternal companion. Only one label appears fitting for such an obedient and faithful servant: \u201cWho honors God, God honors.\u201d (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"2654\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2654)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2654)\">1 Sam. 2:30<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p34\" class=\"\">A label frequently seen and grudgingly borne is one which reads: \u201cHandicapped.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p35\" class=\"\">Years ago, President Spencer W. Kimball shared with President Gordon B. Hinckley, Elder Bruce R. McConkie, and me an experience he had in the appointment of a patriarch for the Shreveport Louisiana Stake of the Church. President Kimball described how he interviewed, how he searched, and how he prayed, that he might learn the Lord\u2019s will concerning the selection. For some reason, none of the suggested candidates was the man for this assignment at this particular time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p36\" class=\"\">The day wore on. The evening meetings began. Suddenly President Kimball turned to the stake president and asked him to identify a particular man seated perhaps two-thirds of the way back from the front of the chapel. The stake president replied that the individual was James Womack, whereupon President Kimball said, \u201cHe is the man the Lord has selected to be your stake patriarch. Please have him meet with me in the high council room following the meeting.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p37\" class=\"\">Stake president Charles Cagle was startled, for James Womack did not wear the label of a typical man. He had sustained terrible injuries while in combat during World War II. He lost both hands and one arm, as well as most of his eyesight and part of his hearing. Nobody had wanted to let him in law school when he returned, yet he finished third in his class at Louisiana State University. James Womack simply refused to wear the label \u201cHandicapped.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p38\" class=\"\">That evening as President Kimball met with Brother Womack and informed him that the Lord had designated him to be the patriarch, there was a protracted silence in the room. Then Brother Womack said, \u201cBrother Kimball, it is my understanding that a patriarch is to place his hands on the head of the person he blesses. As you can see, I have no hands to place on the head of anyone.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p39\" class=\"\">Brother Kimball, in his kind and patient manner, invited Brother Womack to make his way to the back of the chair on which Brother Kimball was seated. He then said, \u201cNow, Brother Womack, lean forward and see if the stumps of your arms will reach the top of my head.\u201d To Brother Womack\u2019s joy, they touched Brother Kimball, and the exclamation came forth, \u201cI can reach you! I can reach you!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/labels.p40\" class=\"\">\u201cOf course you can reach me,\u201d responded Brother Kimball. \u201cAnd if you can reach me, you can reach any whom you bless.
