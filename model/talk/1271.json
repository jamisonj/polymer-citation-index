Joseph Smith, to whom the inspiration came, was but twenty-five years\nof age. It is a marvelous declaration, great in its pretention, comprehensive in its scope&mdash;\"Mine\neverlasting covenant [the gospel] is sent into the world, to be a light unto the world.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOn Bedloe Island, at the entrance of New York Harbor, there stands a Statue of Liberty, a\nlight to the nations. What it has meant to thousands and hundreds of thousands of the\ndowntrodden of Europe has been most graphically expressed by Israel Zangwill in that\nimpressive production <i>The Melting Pot<\/i>, from which I quote (David, the immigrant Jew, is\nspeaking): \n<\/p><p>\n\"When I look at our Statue of Liberty, I just seem to hear the voice of America: 'Come unto\nme all ye who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest&mdash;rest.'\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhat that Statue of Liberty has symbolized to the oppressed and downtrodden of Europe, the\ngospel of Jesus Christ is to the world.\n<\/p><p>\nThe restored gospel, the Church, has reared an ensign to the nations, and with words as\ncomprehensive as those I have read in the revelation, invites the world to peace, to rest, to\ncontentment.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd what does that ensign offer to the nations?\n<\/p><p>\nForty-three years ago, Elder Stephen L Richards, speaking from this pulpit, answered that\nquestion as follows: \"There are provided within the Church agencies and facilities which meet\nevery requirement of social life. Our wards, to my thinking, constitute the most advantageous\nsocial units that have ever been devised or suggested in the history of society. There are\npresented within the organizations of the wards opportunities for every person to receive\nlegitimate training in society, proper social intercourse, and the cultivation of all the desirable\ntraits of character that go to make up good men and good women.\" (<i>Annual Conference<\/i>, April\n6, 1920.)\n<\/p><p>\nSitting in the audience on that occasion was a statesman who had won national and\ninternational eminence, not only as a great leader in the political world, but also as a speaker\nand writer on religious topics. He was William Jennings Bryan, who only a few months\nbefore had written an article for a current magazine entitled \"In the World, of the World, and\nfor the World,\" wherein he outlined a number of ways in which he thought the church could\nmake the world a better place in which to live. \"My suggestion, therefore,\" I read from his\narticle, \"is that an effort should be made to set up a Christian standard for Christian\ncommunities, and to create an environment that will be helpful to the Church and the spiritual\nthings for which the Church stands.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSuch an organization is the restored Church of Jesus Christ, functioning effectually, as the\nApostle Paul says, \"For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the\nedifying of the body of Christ: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a\nperfect man, [even] unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21755\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21755)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21755)\">Eph. 4:12-13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI invite you today to have in mind the various organizations of the Church: <i>first<\/i>, the\n<i>priesthood quorums; second,<\/i> the <i>auxiliaries; third, educational opportunities; fourth, judicial<\/i>\n<i>phases of the Church;<\/i> and <i>fifth, the ecclesiastical groups.<\/i> To elaborate on each one would\noccupy more time than I can give, but we can just glimpse it.\n<\/p><p>\nConsider the priesthood of the Church. Picture therein the men and boys organized in working\nsections or groups, from the father ninety years old, down to the boy twelve years of age. In\nthese groups you find exemplified all that human society seeks in social groups and in\nsocieties. There is opportunity in these quorum groups for fellowship, brotherhood, and\norganized service. No man who is worthy of that fellowship can be kept out from it&mdash;not\none!\n<\/p><p>\nThose who are active are working in an organized way for the betterment of one another, for\nthe personal welfare of the membership and for the good of society as a whole. If we\nconsidered no further than the quorums, is not that a sublime picture, where men and boys\nmay congregate, associate, affiliate in service for humanity, in which every man considers\neveryone a brother? In that quorum the doctor sits by the side of a carpenter, each interested\nin the most ennobling of aspirations&mdash;worship of God and helpful service to humanity! There\nis the essence of priesthood work in the Church, and, in the achievement of the purpose,\nevery act and influence should be performed or wielded only \"by persuasion, by\nlong-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned.\" The words of the\nProphet! (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14342\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14342)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14342)\">D&amp;C 121:41<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn addition to quorums, there are Young Men's and Young Women's Mutual Improvement\nAssociations, having charge of the recreation for the young, guiding the leisure hours of the\nyouth as emphasized by Mr. William Jennings Bryan&mdash;one of the great\nproblems facing civilization today! In these groups you have an organization of young men\nand young women, directing in music, in art, in debating, in drama, as well as in other\nuplifting activities of community life.\n<\/p><p>\nAll quorums and groups are in themselves educational factors. It is surprising how many\nofficers and teachers are engaged in the teaching and directing of youth just in quorums and\nauxiliary organizations.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us take one stake for example: I refer now to notes taken on a visit made in 1950 here in\nSalt Lake City. Among the groups in the Melchizedek Priesthood of that stake were 804 men\nserving without one penny of compensation for the betterment of society every week, and\nsome of them every day.\n<\/p><p>\nIf the high council and members of the bishoprics in that stake who are working with young\nboys between the ages of twelve and twenty-one be included, there were a total of 1,022 men.\n<\/p><p>\nThe number of officers and teachers in the auxiliaries in the twelve wards of that stake was\n1,950, so adding this number to the 1,022, we have a total of 2,972, or approximately 3,000\nmen and women teachers.\n<\/p><p>\nIn addition, there were missionaries laboring under the direction of the stake presidency. In\nthis one stake, they had held 2,715 meetings in homes in this city. They had baptized, since\nthe first of the year, 106 converts and ten children who had gone beyond the age of eight\nyears.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church progresses only as fast as these groups work in perfect harmony.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the Doctrine and Covenants, we read: \"It is the duty of the [priesthood] to watch over the\nChurch always, to be with and strengthen them\"\n(see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"14252\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14252)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14252)\">D&amp;C 20:53<\/a><\/span>). This is a laymen's\nChurch.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd what a message the Church has for this distracted world! \"Its appeal,\" as Kent says of\ntrue Christianity, \"is universal&mdash;to the rich and the poor, the strong and the weak, the learned\nand the unlearned. It proclaims God to be not only the one Supreme Ruler of the Universe,\nbut the Father of each individual, a God of justice, yet a God of love, constantly watching\nover and guiding even the humblest of His children.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church, with its complete organization, offers service and inspiration to all. It is\n\"pre-eminently a social religion.\" In quorums and auxiliaries it \"aims by training the\nindividual conscience and will to establish a closely knit, worldwide fraternity.\" It is in no\nsense ascetic. Instead of taking men out of the world. it seeks to develop perfect, Godlike men\nin the midst of society, and through them to solve the problems of society.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is not a principle which is taught by the Savior of men but is applicable to the growth,\ndevelopment, and happiness of mankind. Every one of his teachings seems to touch the true\nphilosophy of living. I accept them wholeheartedly. I like to study them. I like to teach them.\nIt is a job to try to live them. Even phase of the restored Church is applicable to the welfare\nof the human family.\n<\/p><p>\nTwelve thousand missionaries and more, each paying individually or with the aid of parents\nhis or her own expenses. are declaring to a troubled world that the message heralded at the\nbirth of Jesus, \"Peace on earth, good will toward men,\" (see\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31577\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31577)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31577)\">Luke 2:14<\/a><\/span>) may become a reality\nby compliance to the principles of the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the Savior said to the eleven disciples, and to all whom they appointed, so he says to his\nauthorized servants today: \"Go ye therefore and make disciples of all nations, teaching them\nto observe all things whatsoever I have commanded\" (see\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35290\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35290)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35290)\">Matt. 28:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhere, however, each missionary of old could speak only to one person, the representatives\nof Christ today can speak to millions. A sentence uttered in an ordinary tone of voice can\nencircle the globe in less than a minute. Daily, nations are becoming more closely united. The\ninterest and destiny of each one becomes more closely the interest and destiny of all.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the ecclesiastical groupings, there is opportunity for social welfare such as cannot be found\nin any other organization in the world. Thus does the Savior and his Church\nbecome my inspiration, my ideal in life. I think it is the one great thing for which man should\nstrive. It presents the most efficient methods for human service, social uplift, and progressive\nsteps toward universal peace and brotherhood; and in its idea of salvation it comprehends the\nwhole of the human family.\n<\/p><p>\nMay he bless the priesthood throughout the Church, the auxiliary associations, and all men\nand women who seek to instill into the hearts of men the redemptive power of Jesus Christ,\nthe Son of the Living God. May all utilizing the organization of the Church continue more\nzealously \"For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of\nthe body of Christ: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a\nperfect man, [even] unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21756\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21756)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21756)\">Eph. 4:12-13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless and prosper the Church as it bears witness to the reality of the personality of Deity\nand to the fact that God has again revealed himself to man and established a means whereby\nspirituality, brotherhood, and universal peace may be fostered among the children of men.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord help us to be able to prove to the world that the restored gospel is just what the\nworld today is longing for; and when they see it, may they know, as you know and as I\nknow, that the everlasting gospel is a light to the world. May it ever be a light to the nations,\na guiding solution of all the world problems, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
