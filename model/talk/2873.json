If I were a bishop now, I think I could go home and do a better job than I\u2019ve ever done before, understanding more clearly my responsibilities and having been taught how to perform them. It\u2019s important that we know our duty.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/go-and-do-the-work.p5\" class=\"\">I\u2019d like to know how many bishops have been called and ordained since last April conference; will you stand please\u2014all new bishops. Thank you very much. That gives you an idea of why these meetings are held as they are, so that you might understand your duty and responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/go-and-do-the-work.p6\" class=\"\">Would the Relief Society presidents who have been called and set apart since last April please stand. They\u2019re fewer, but they are certainly important. Thank you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/go-and-do-the-work.p7\" class=\"\">The repetition is good for those who have been in office for some time. We go home with a greater desire and better feeling about this work, and with a better ability to perform it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/go-and-do-the-work.p8\" class=\"\">Two or three things that were mentioned here today appealed to me particularly. One is that material help should be temporary and spiritual help should be permanent. Now if we\u2019re going to do that, we\u2019re going to do all we can to help people be employed so that they can take care of their own temporal needs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/go-and-do-the-work.p9\" class=\"\">There\u2019s one thing that hasn\u2019t been emphasized but has been mentioned here this morning, and that is the great importance of maintaining self-respect. That\u2019s so important. Help these people in such a way that they\u2019ll feel that they\u2019re helping themselves and contributing to the welfare program.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/go-and-do-the-work.p10\" class=\"\">Now that we have had this meeting, my advice to you is to go and do what you\u2019ve been instructed to do. You\u2019re responsible. The work of the Lord in this area, and in all areas in fact, is upon your shoulders. May the Lord give you strength and courage and understanding and the realization that you\u2019re members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with a proper program for those who need help, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
