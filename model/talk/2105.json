That is, it is easy for me to get in, but difficult for me to get out. The difficulty comes when I am stopped by prisoners who want to talk. During my last visit, a young man stopped me, and we talked for about fifteen minutes, time I didn\u2019t think I had to spare. As I was leaving him he said, and I will never forget it, \u201cThank you for talking to me.\u201d As I drove home that night, I recalled that in fifteen minutes I may have said twenty-four or twenty-five words; however, I believe that is the kind of talking and listening we need to have more of. But that is another subject. Let\u2019s get back to Roger. He said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/you-can-get-there-from-here.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t want to blame anyone back home for my being in prison today, but it is factual that I had no family relationships. I am involved in the family home evening program at the prison. Without the parents who have been assigned to me through this social services program, many times I would have given up. These people love me as if I were their own son. I have never had that, even when I was a small boy. Now, with their help and that of others, I believe I can now make it back a day at a time. I am not proud of being in prison, but I am proud of my recent experiences while being there. We have a tendency to blame others. We don\u2019t want to blame our parents for not loving us, because we know they do, but maybe they didn\u2019t have the guidance and direction in their lives to apply when they were bringing us up.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/you-can-get-there-from-here.p16\" class=\"\">Perhaps in the minds of many of us, Roger would be justified in believing he couldn\u2019t make it back.

As I was waiting to participate with them and others in the services, they seemed to be involved in serious conversation. \u201cWhat could they be talking about?\u201d I wondered to myself. My curiosity prompted me to step closer to them for a chance to catch a few of their words. I was moved when I heard one of the girls raise this question to her friends: \u201cI wonder if someone will come today who will want to take me home.
