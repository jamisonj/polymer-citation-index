I cautioned the\n  Saints to beware of such, for they were throwing out insinuations here and there, to level a dart at\n  the best interests of the Church, and if possible destroy the character of its Presidency.

From the writings of the Scriptures, and more especially those which have come to us in this dispensation, we know that the ancient peoples, when they were guided by the Spirit of the Lord, had the true conception of the universe. The Lord revealed to Abraham great truths about the heavenly bodies, their revolutions, times and seasons, and these were published by the Prophet Joseph Smith before modern astronomers were familiar with these facts. From the writings of Abraham we learn that the Egyptians understood the nature of the planets. Moses also recorded much about this and other worlds, but because of the unbelief and apostasy from truth, these writings were eliminated from his writings. In the Book of Abraham we find the following:<\/p>\n      <p class=\"std\">&ldquo;But the records of the fathers, even the patriarchs concerning, the right of Priesthood the Lord my God preserved in mine own hands\n        therefore a knowledge of the beginning of the creation, and also of the planets, and of the stars, as they were made known unto the fathers, have I kept even unto this day, and I shall endeavor to write some of these things upon this record, for the benefit of my posterity that shall come after me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n      <p class=\"std\">We learn from the Book of Mormon (Helaman 12:13-15) that the Ne-<\/p>\n    \n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
