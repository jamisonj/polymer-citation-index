Lee, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1956, pp. 107-111<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nSeveral days ago my attention was attracted to a picture in one of the local newspapers. The\npicture shows two men with a shovel setting a highway sign. Within the block \"U,\" which is\nthe official designation of the Utah state highway department, is the figure 187, and then a\nsign underneath the block \"U,\" which reads: \"The shortest designated highway in the state.\"\nThen I read the cutlines underneath and the accompanying article which described this short\nhighway as being only one-quarter of a mile in length.  It curved gracefully\noff to the right of the main highway 91 going south and led down over the brow of the hill,\nseemingly to invite anyone who wanted to travel that pleasant way.  Then I looked more\nclosely to see what the picture was. One of the men in the picture was the warden of the Utah\nState Penitentiary, and the other was a member of the state prison board.  The highway\nmarked U 187 led to a building which I could distinguish at the foot of the hill. With\nsomewhat of a shock I recognized this building as the Utah State Penitentiary. The shortest\ndesignated highway in the state was a wide paved road from the mainly traveled road to the\nstate prison!\n<\/p><p>\nIf I could get the spirit of this great conference, I think probably I would like to title the few\nwords of my brief address this afternoon as \"The Shortest Designated Highway in Life\" and\ndraw something of a parallel to that other \"shortest designated highway\" to which I have\nmade reference.  As I seek for that guidance, my earnest prayer would be that what I say\nwould be in harmony with the great messages of our beloved leaders, the First Presidency.  I\nsuppose there is nothing that a General Authority desires more than that what he does and\nwhat he says will be in harmony with their desires, and more than that, what he says would\nbe in harmony with Him of whom we have sung so beautifully at the opening of this service.\n<\/p><p>\nThis other highway in life is also broad.  It is a way to destruction, as the Master explained to\nhis disciples when he said in a very significant statement,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many\nthere be which go in thereat (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34773\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34773)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34773)\">Matt. 7:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI would like now for the next few minutes to talk about that highway because it is clearly\nblueprinted in the records of life which the Lord has given us.  I remember a remark the late\npresident Charles A. Callis made to me one day&mdash;we were talking about some of these\nmatters, and he remarked, \"You know, I think that probably the most important thing we as\nGeneral Authorities ought to be preaching is not only repentance from sin, but even more\nimportant than that, to teach the young people particularly, and the entire Church generally,\nthe awfulness of sin and the terror that follows him who has so indulged.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYears of experience since that time and interviews with those who have unfortunately taken\nthat short, broad highway, have convinced me that because of their suffering, those who have\nor are living lives of unrepented sinning would have given all that they possessed if someone\ncould have warned them and could have told them of the awfulness of the sins from which they now\nsuffer.\n<\/p><p>\nNephi predicted and spoke of the sad state of those who habitually sinned and would not\nrepent when he said: \n<\/p><p>\nFor the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with man.  And when the Spirit\nceaseth to strive with man then cometh speedy destruction, and this grieveth my soul\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3600\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3600)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3600)\">2 Ne. 26:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMormon described some people, his people, from whom the spirit of the Lord had departed,\nand when I read that and then read what I shall now read to you, it seems clear to me that\nwhat he was talking about was not merely the inability to have the companionship of or the gift of the\nHoly Ghost, but he was talking of that light of truth to which every one born into the world is\nentitled (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27673\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27673)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27673)\">John 1:9<\/a><\/span>)\nand will never cease to strive with the individual unless he loses it through his own\nsinning. This is what Mormon said: \n<\/p><p>\nFor behold, the Spirit of the Lord hath already ceased to strive with their fathers; and\nthey are without Christ and God in the world; and they are driven about as chaff\nbefore the wind.<br \/>\n. . . behold, they are led about by Satan, even as chaff is driven before the wind, or as\nan vessel is tossed about upon the waves, without sail or anchor, or without anything\nwherewith to steer her; and even as she is, so are they\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37967\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37967)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37967)\">Morm. 5:16,18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe story is told of the late President Calvin Coolidge who was a master of few words in his\nexpressions.  He came home from his church meeting one morning, and his wife asked,\n\"What did the preacher talk about this morning?\" His reply was, \"Sin.\" She again asked\n\"What did the minister say about it?\" His reply was, \"The minister was agin' it.\" And so are\nall preachers of righteousness, they are against this thing called sin.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat is sin?  The Apostle John described it or defined it as the transgression of the law.\n<\/p><p>\nWhosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the\nlaw (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1049\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1049)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1049)\">1 Jn. 3:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBrigham Young made that definition still more meaningful when he said that \"Sin consists in\ndoing wrong when we know and can do better and it will be punished with a just retribution\nin the due time of the Lord.\" (<i>Journal of Discourses<\/i> 2:242.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe source of sin is a subject oft debated and theorized by philosophers and others as to how\nit originates and from whence it comes, but we with the sacred scriptures are left with a\ncertainty which removes all question as to the author and the beginning of sin.  The record\ntells us that Satan came among the children of Adam and Eve and said unto them: \n<\/p><p>\nI am also a son of God; and he commanded them, saying: Believe it not; and they\nbelieved it not, and they loved Satan more than God.  And men began from that time\nforth to be carnal, sensual, and devilish\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39086\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39086)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39086)\">Moses 5:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then King Benjamin taught: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and quarrel\none with another, and serve the devil, who is the master of sin, or who is the evil\nspirit which hath been spoken of by our fathers, he being an enemy to all\nrighteousness (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40277\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40277)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40277)\">Mosiah 4:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Master understood how powerful was this master of sin when he spoke of him as the\n\"Prince of this world\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27697\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27697)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27697)\">John 14:30<\/a><\/span>),\nand he taught his disciples to pray that they might not be led into\ntemptation (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34765\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34765)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34765)\">Matt. 6:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis like that other highway to the Utah state prison is also a very short highway down the\nroad of sin.  You will remember the Lord's warning to Cain when he said,\n<\/p><p>\nIf thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at\nthe door (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23639\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23639)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23639)\">Gen. 4:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is just that short to the way of sin&mdash;right at our very doors.\n<\/p><p>\nNow the scriptures have told us about the identity of those who are going to inhabit that\nprison which lies at the end of that short highway: \n<\/p><p>\nThese are they who liars, and sorcerers, and adulterers, and whoremongers, and\nwhosoever loves and makes a lie.<br \/>\nThese are they who suffer the wrath of God on earth.<br \/>\nThese are they who suffer the vengeance of eternal fire.<br \/>\nThese are they who are cast down to hell [and that is the name of the prison] and\nsuffer the wrath of Almighty God, until the fulness of times, when Christ shall have\nsubdued all enemies under his feet, and shall have perfected his work\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13485\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13485)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13485)\">D&amp;C 76:103-106<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again, the nature of the punishment which shall be received in that prison is clearly\nexplained: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For behold,\" said the prophet Amulek, \"if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance\neven until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal\nyou his; therefore the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you,\nand the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8972\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8972)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8972)\">Alma 34:35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow as to the location of that place, reference is made to it in these words: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd the end thereof, neither the place thereof, nor their torment, no man knows\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13481\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13481)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13481)\">D&amp;C 76:45<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLike all broad highways of life which beckon to that prison, there are allurements which we\nare ofttimes encouraged to follow.  As Father Lehi explained to his son, Jacob\n<\/p><p>\n. . . it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in\nopposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3587\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3587)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3587)\">2 Ne. 2:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn other words, he set the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in opposition to the tree of\nlife.  The fruit of the one which was \"bitter\" was the tree of life, and the forbidden fruit was\nthe one which was \"sweet to the taste.\"\n<\/p><p>\nJames Russell Lowell caught this great truth in his poem, \"The Present Crisis:\"\n<\/p><p>\n      Careless seems the great Avenger; history's pages but record<br \/>\n      One death-grapple in the darkness 'twixt old systems and the word; <br \/>\n      Truth forever on the scaffold, wrong forever on the throne,<br \/>\n      Yet that scaffold sways the future, and, behind the dim unknown<br \/>\n      Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own.\n<\/p><p>\nWe see some of the signs which like the signs to the state penitentiary we know lead us\ndownward.  Some are called taverns; some are called lounges; and some are called\nroadhouses.  They have bright, neon-lighted signs outside with catch-phrase names.  They are\ndimly lighted inside; they have sensuous music.  These are the unmistakable trademarks of the\nhell holes of Satan.\n<\/p><p>\nNephi spoke of some teachings against which we must be on guard lest we follow that road,\nwhen he said that in a day to come, which we realize now is our day, there would be those\nwho would \"teach us to become angry against that which is good, to lull us away into carnal\nsecurity and to flatter us by telling us there is no devil, there is no hell\" (see\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3602\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3602)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3602)\">2 Ne. 28:20-22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn President Joseph Fielding Smith's impressive discourse this morning over the CBS\nbroadcast, he explained the meaning and the need of a Redeemer, in order to redeem a\n\"fallen\" world. The \"fall,\" by which men became subject to the temptation of the devil, is as\nnecessary to the progress of man as is the creation.\n<\/p><p>\nDr. J. M. Sjodahl makes this rather interesting comment: \n<\/p><p>\nSome have asserted that the story of the fall is but a myth, or an allegory, but it is\ngiven in the Scriptures as part of the history of the human family, and must be either\naccepted as such, or rejected as fiction. The fall was as necessary for the development\nof the race as was the creation.\n<\/p><p>\nNow mark you this statement: \"The story of the first fall is, moveover, the story of every sin\"\n(<i>D &amp; C Commentary<\/i>, 1919 edition, p. 211).\n<\/p><p>\nNow consider, for illustration, the various sins; the breaking of the Word of Wisdom,\nunchastity, dishonesty, etc., and then think of what is said here: \n<\/p><p>\nTemptation begins with doubt as to the truth of the prohibition. \"Has God said?\" [is\nalways the question of him who doubts and is tempted to sin.] \"It is continued by a\ncontemplation of the pleasure that may be derived from doing that which has been\nprohibited.  It ends with a sense of shame and degradation and dread of the presence\nof God. Such is the beginning and development of every transgression (<i>Idem.<\/i>).\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow the way to eternal life has fortunately been marked out just as plainly.  There sits in this\ncongregation a young woman who was about to fail in her faith because of a sudden sorrow\nwhich she was not quite prepared to bridge over after having been a convert of a few years. \nShe had a dream in which she saw herself going back to the church of her previous\nacquaintance. As she drove along in her car, she came to a road which she took only to find\nthat it was a road under construction, and after ten tortuous miles returning she found to her\namazement that there were plain warning signs all along the way which, if she had observed,\nwould have guided her along a safe detour road and passed the shoals of difficulty.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, the Master said it: \n<\/p><p>\nEnter ye in at the strait gate .  .  .\n<\/p><p>\nBecause strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few\nthere be that find it (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34774\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34774)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34774)\">Matt. 7:13-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs Jesus was teaching in the cities and villages towards Jerusalem as to what the kingdom of\nheaven was like, one asked him, \"Are there few that be saved?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31434\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31434)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31434)\">Luke 13:23<\/a><\/span>). That question reminded me of\nthe remark of a good friend of mine who had heard one of the Brethren talk about the\nrequirements in order to attain the celestial kingdom.  This friend said to me somewhat\nwearily after he had heard the sermon, \"He has made it so difficult that I don't think anyone\ncould qualify for the celestial kingdom.\"\n<\/p><p>\nContrary to that, the Master said,\n<\/p><p>\nTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye\nshall find rest unto your souls.\n<\/p><p>\nFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34785\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34785)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34785)\">Matt. 11:29-30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhen you think about it there is so much promised in the gospel for so little required on our\npart; for example, the ordinance of baptism is given us for the remission of sins, for entrance\ninto the kingdom&mdash;a new birth; the gift of the Holy Ghost gives us the right\nto companionship with one of the Godhead; administration to the sick, qualifies the individual\nwith faith for a special blessing; by paying our tithing, the windows of heaven may be opened\nunto us (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32754\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32754)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32754)\">Mal. 3:8-10<\/a><\/span>);\nby fasting and by paying our fast offerings, we are told that then we might call on\nthe Lord and he will hear our cry and our call\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25179\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25179)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25179)\">Isa. 58:9<\/a><\/span>);\ncelestial marriage promises us that family life\nwill exist beyond the grave.  But all of these blessings are ours on one condition, and this is\nspoken of by Nephi, when he said: \n<\/p><p>\nFor we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children and also our brethren, to\nbelieve in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we\nare saved, [but mark you this condition,] <i>after all we can do<\/i>\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3597\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3597)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3597)\">2 Ne. 25:23<\/a><\/span>, italics added).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Master did not directly answer that question, \"Are there few that be saved?\" But he\nanswered, \"Strive to enter in at the strait gate\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31435\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31435)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31435)\">Luke 13:24<\/a><\/span>). Strive means to struggle in opposition or\ncontention, to contend, to battle for or against a person or a thing opposed, to strive as against\ntemptation, and to strive for truth.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, in all that striving, remember Temple Bailey's parable for mothers: \"The young mother\nsaid to the guide at the beginning of her way, 'Is the way long?' And the guide replied, 'Yes,\nand the way is hard, and you will be old before you reach the end of it.  But the end will be\nbetter than the beginning.'\"\n<\/p><p>\nOh, that we might think of these warnings and remember the prayer of the Prophet Joseph in\nthe midst of his persecutions, when he cried out, asking why the Lord would not see and hear\nthe sufferings of the Saints\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13524\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13524)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13524)\">D&amp;C 121:1-6<\/a><\/span>),\nand then hear the Lord answer: \n<\/p><p>\nMy son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a\nsmall moment; \n<\/p><p>\nAnd then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over\nall thy foes (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13525\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13525)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13525)\">D&amp;C 121:7-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOh, may we pray the prayer of the Alcoholics Anonymous, those men who are striving to\ncome back: \"O Lord,\" they pray, \"give me the humility to accept the things I cannot change,\nand the courage to change the things I can change, and then the wisdom to tell the\ndifference.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd may we pray that prayer which I heard set to beautiful music at a stake conference just\nrecently: \n<\/p><p>\n      Lord, when the twilight of life is falling<br \/>\n      Help me and guide me where you want me.<br \/>\n      Lord, when I hear that your voice is calling,<br \/>\n      Make me worthy to abide with thee.\n<\/p><p>\n      Lord, when I feel that at times I'm straying<br \/>\n      Lead me, O Lord, lead me aright.<br \/>\n      Send forth thy light and thy love I'm praying<br \/>\n      That the dark and dreary way be bright.\n<\/p><p>\n      Lord, give me faith that I may heed thy call<br \/>\n      Lord, give me strength that I may never fall.<br \/>\n      Help me to find the path that thou hast trod,<br \/>\n      Help me to love, and obey thee, my Lord, my God.<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;                        &mdash;C.
