Brown, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1963, pp. 89-92<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nBrethren and fellow workers: \n<\/p><p>\nOf the many groups we are asked to address from time to time, there is none more inspiring,\nbut more humbling, than this body of priesthood, thousands of whom we can see and\nprobably tens of thousands whom we cannot see. One approaches the responsibility of a few\nmoments talk with deep humility and a prayer for divine guidance. I shall speak for a few\nminutes only, as we are all anxious to hear from President McKay.\n<\/p><p>\nI certainly congratulate Brother Lee on his excellent presentation of a difficult program, which\nhas taken the committee several years to work out. He has been trying to get us to see it in\njust a few minutes and has done a very good job of compressing into those few minutes what\ncould well occupy several hours.\n<\/p><p>\nAmong other things I have been impressed by the fact that it is not easy to be a Latter-day\nSaint. I notice these charts call for work, work, work on the part of all concerned. In some\nchurches, one man, as has already been indicated, does most of the work. In this Church all of\nus are expected to participate.\n<\/p><p>\nAnother thing that impressed me as I listened to Brother Lee's explanation of this program\nthat will be carried forward under the direction of the President of the Church is that it\nprovides opportunity for everyone who is willing to make some contribution to the cause. We\nrecognize in the Church a cause which is greater and more important than we are as\nindividuals, and in it we enjoy the fellowship of our brethren who hold the priesthood. Unless\nwe with them can cooperate in advancing that cause we shall not make a success of this\nprogram. We should all give to this committee not only a vote of thanks by expressing it in\nwords but a vote of appreciation by putting into operation the work as here outlined and as it\nwill be more fully explained as we go forward. Let no one of us feel or say or think that the\nbrethren are just trying to find something more for us to do&mdash;don't think that because they\nare&mdash;they are trying to find something for us to do because they know there is only one way\nto salvation, that is by active participation.\n<\/p><p>\nIn all teaching&mdash;and one of the functions of the priesthood is teaching&mdash;what the teacher is\ncounts for more than what he says. What we are as members of the priesthood and as\nmissionaries in the field, at home or abroad, means more to those to whom we go than what\nwe teach. So my first thought is, let us be what we teach. The teacher and the truth taught\nshould be of the same pattern. Let each one be an example to all whose lives we touch; let us\nrecognize in all of our fellow workers some value, some worth, and never forget that each\none of them has a heart, has feelings, has ambition, has a certain amount of pride; therefore,\nlet us never by virtue of the priesthood or the positions we hold trample on the rights or the\nfeelings of our fellow men; let us never be sharp in what we say to them by way of criticism,\nbut let us be kindly, considerate, and have in our hearts a love for our fellow\nmen, for in each one of them there is value.\n<\/p><p>\nI read something this morning I'd like to leave with you. Every human life has in it more or\nless gold which is usually not readily apparent to the casual observer. Kindness is a part of\nthat gold, the gold of the spirit, that part which is known to others because it has lessened\ntheir burdens and made their pathways lovelier. The man who has gold in his life has\nsomething that is bigger than anything that can happen to him. He doesn't worry about\ndefeats or obstacles or sorrows, for he knows these are but froth on the river of life to last but\na brief time and then be blown away. What matters is not the froth, but the strong, pulsating,\nongoing current in the river, which is never disturbed by the leaves floating up at the quiet\neddies of the surface. One day you may find that your house of life has collapsed, but in the\nwreckage you may find the gold which cannot be destroyed. not by the worst disaster, for the\ngold of life is imperishable and immortal. Search for it in the wreckage, for out of it you can\nmint new coins. Out of defeat arises the gold of life.\n<\/p><p>\nPriesthood involves presidency, authority, and power; it involves the right and duty under\ncertain circumstances to reprove others. You remember what the Prophet said, \"Reproving\nbetimes with sharpness . . . and then showing forth . . . increase of love\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14343\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14343)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14343)\">D&amp;C 121:43<\/a><\/span>). Let\nus be very careful about this matter of reproving, and yet part of our duty is to see that there\nis no iniquity in the Church (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14253\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14253)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14253)\">D&amp;C 20:54<\/a><\/span>).\nAgain I say, let us be careful how we trample on the feelings of\nour brothers and sisters. Let us lift them and bless them and benefit them as we go forward\nand never be guilty of humiliating them or causing them to think that we do not appreciate\ntheir work.\n<\/p><p>\nThe next thought I'd like to leave with you is that we must not be deceived by the boom in\nnumbers and dollars and buildings going on in the Church. We thank the Lord for them, but\nthey are not the main part of our work. All we need to say on that is that the body without\nthe spirit is dead (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26166\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26166)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26166)\">James 2:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs we go forward in the special work of the priesthood, which is missionary work both for\nthe living and the dead, and as we carry the gospel to our friends who are not members of the\nChurch, let us try to keep things in proper balance. The revealed order is faith and then\nrepentance and then baptism. A Baptist minister was heard to say about some of his own\npeople recently that the church had recruited some people who had been starched and ironed\nbefore they were washed. I think we might take a lesson from that thought and convert the\npeople before we baptize them.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us read from the Doctrine and Covenants with respect to priesthood. This is a section with\nwhich you are more or less familiar, but I never hesitate to refer again to that which has been\nreferred to so often any more than I would hesitate to invite a friend to come to my table\nwhen I had only the things that we usually serve at the table. We do not complain much\nbecause we do not have something different at every meal. We enjoy that which is set before\nus if we have an appetite for it. The Lord said: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and\nthe magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14295\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14295)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14295)\">D&amp;C 84:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, I bear testimony to the fact that that promise has been realized in the lives of many\nof us. I know that it has been realized in the life of President David  O. McKay, that he has\nbeen sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of his body, and some of the rest of us are\nbetter off today than we were many years ago so far as physical health is concerned&mdash;and we\nattribute that fact to his blessing.\n<\/p><p>\n\"They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and\nkingdom, and the elect of God.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord; \n<\/p><p>\n\"For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me; \n<\/p><p>\n\"And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father; \n<\/p><p>\n\"And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father\nhath shall be given unto him.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore, all those who receive the priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father,\nwhich he cannot break, neither can it be moved\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14299\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14299)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14299)\">D&amp;C 84:34-40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is important that we consider occasionally the oath and the covenant which each of us has\ntaken. All who have been baptized and all who hold the priesthood are under covenant to do\nand refrain from doing certain things. We must remember and keep our covenants, one of\nwhich is that we be willing to give of ourselves, our means and all that we have to the\nupbuilding of the Church and kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung fellow workers, deacons and teachers and priests, we who are growing older have\ngreat confidence in you, based upon what we believe to be a fact, that you would not now be\nholding the priesthood unless God had thought you worthy of it and unless he had something\nfor you to do. Each one of you young men who is listening tonight has a future. What that\nfuture is to be will depend upon your attitude toward your calling, your faith in yourselves,\nyour belief that there is some gold in you. It is important that you young men and all of us\ntry to refine that gold by active participation and not wait until the house is burned down, and\nwe have passed through the fire. It is very important that every young man make up his mind\nthat he is going to respond to the voice of conscience, that he is going to be true to himself\nand not yield to the down-drag of any environment in which he may find himself.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I tell a story to illustrate the point that a man must respond to his better self if he is\ngoing to be a worthy holder of the priesthood. The story is told that the Arabians, when they\nare training their horses, put them to a final test of character and stamina. It is said that the\nfinest of the Arabian horses which are kept for breeding stock are trained from the time they\nare colts to respond to a bell which rings intermittently at the tent of the master. Wherever\nthey are and whatever they are doing, they must run to the tent of the master when the bell\nrings. Their mothers were taught it before them, and they respond, and the colt, running\nbeside the mother, habitually as time goes on responds to the bell and knows that it is the call\nof duty. When the colts are three years old, they are placed in a corral, a pole corral that they\ncan see through. They are left there three days and nights without food or water. At the end\nof the third day hay and grain and water are placed just outside the corral. You can imagine\nthe eagerness of the young colts as they look through the bars at the food and water. When\nthe gate is opened the young colts rush out, and just as they are about to reach the food and\nwater, the bell rings. Only those of them that have stamina enough to respond to the bell and\nresist the urge of appetite are kept for the breeding stock of the future.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, as we go forward, we become increasingly aware of the fact that there is a bell\nwhich rings very frequently throughout life. Sometimes men become unresponsive or hard of\nhearing and disregard the bell to their own sorrow. You young men are going to hear it many\ntimes between now and the time you are our age. We plead with you to resist the call of\nappetite and passion and hearken to the bell which is your conscience. If you are tempted to\ndo wrong, there will always be something within you saying, \"Don't do it.\" Hearken and\nrespond to that bell, and you will be worthy of the confidence that the President of the\nChurch has in you, worthy to take over the responsibilities now held by your fathers, your\nbrothers, your leaders.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you and all of us that we may co-operate with the General Authorities, with the\nstake and ward and mission authorities, and be responsive to their\nadmonitions. The Church&mdash;your Church and my Church is growing in numbers and influence\nwith an accelerating speed beyond anything that we who are older could have imagined in our\nyouth. I am grateful for and testify to the truth of the restored gospel in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
