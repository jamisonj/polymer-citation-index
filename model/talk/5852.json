Some may be desperately worried about a husband or a wife or a child, worried about their health or their happiness or their faithfulness in keeping the commandments. Some are living with physical pain, or emotional pain, or disabilities that come with age.

Some of us, on the other hand, need to make some changes, need to make greater effort in gospel living. And change we can. The very beauty of the word <span class=\"emphasis\">repentance<\/span> is the promise of escaping old problems and old habits and old sorrows and old sins. It is among the most hopeful and encouraging\u2014and yes, most peaceful\u2014words in the gospel vocabulary. In seeking true peace some of us need to improve what has to be improved, confess what needs to be confessed, forgive what has to be forgiven, and forget what should be forgotten in order that serenity can come to us. If there is a commandment we are breaking, and as a result it is breaking us and hurting those who love us, let us call down the power of the Lord Jesus Christ to help us, to free us, to lead us through repentance to that peace \u201cwhich passeth all understanding.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote9-96911_000_031\">9<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41347\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41347)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41347)\">Philip. 4:7<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p18\" class=\"\">And when God has forgiven us, which He is so eternally anxious to do, may we have the good sense to walk away from those problems, to leave them alone, to let the past bury the past.

Someone once said that repentance is the first pressure we feel when drawn to the bosom of God. For real peace may I recommend an immediate rush to the bosom of God, leaving behind you all that would bring sorrow to your soul or heartache to those who love you. \u201cDepart from evil,\u201d the scripture says, \u201cand do good.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote10-96911_000_031\">10<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42093\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42093)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42093)\">Ps. 34:14<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p19\" class=\"\">Closely related to our own obligation to repent is the generosity of letting others do the same\u2014we are to forgive even as we are forgiven.

But\u2014for whatever reason\u2014life has its moments when uninterrupted peace may seem to elude us for a season.

Those who feel no need for mercy usually never seek it and almost never bestow it. Those who have never had a heartache or a weakness or felt lonely or forsaken never have had to cry unto heaven for relief of such personal pain. Surely it is better to find the goodness of God and the grace of Christ, even at the price of despair, than to risk living our lives in a moral or material complacency that has never felt any need for faith or forgiveness, any need for redemption or relief.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p24\" class=\"\">A life without problems or limitations or challenges\u2014life without \u201copposition in all things,\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote13-96911_000_031\">13<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4634\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4634)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4634)\">2 Ne. 2:11<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> as Lehi phrased it\u2014would paradoxically but in very fact be less rewarding and less ennobling than one which confronts\u2014even frequently confronts\u2014difficulty and disappointment and sorrow.
