She wanted to know if a Seventy was higher or lower in the Mormon church than a bishop. When I asked her why she would ask such a question, she replied that she was interested to know just what I\u2019d be doing. She said she understood that in the Mormon church, every calling from a bishop on down was all work, and everyone from a bishop on up was all talk. This may be the reason for my wanting to <span class=\"emphasis\">talk,<\/span> tonight, to you Aaronic Priesthood brethren.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p4\" class=\"\">Many of you during your lifetime have had a pet that may have come to a tragic end, with sad moments following. Some years ago while traveling on a family vacation, we acquired a rather unusual pet, which was a small, friendly, not-too-long, water snake from the beaches of Puget Sound. My children named him Sneaky, as short for Sneaky Snake.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p5\" class=\"\">Early one morning while the family was off walking near the motel, Sneaky somehow got out of his cardboard box. When the room attendant entered to tidy up the room in our absence, Sneaky, seeing the open door, headed for it. She slammed the door shut in absolute terror, and since Sneaky got caught in the door, we might say he came all apart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p6\" class=\"\">It was the end of Sneaky, the beginning of a nervous breakdown for the girl attendant, and a time of weeping and disappointment on the part of our children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p7\" class=\"\">Now, there is a lesson here. The attendant had erroneously perceived Sneaky as something less than the friend he was.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p8\" class=\"\">We\u2019ve heard from Bishop Hales tonight about true friends. May I add a thought or two about them? All of us may have been at one time or other confused as to just who our true friends are. Let me give you an example of what I mean as it relates to the Word of Wisdom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p9\" class=\"\">Some years ago in my medical office I had occasion to examine a young man who was approximately the same age as you young men of the Aaronic Priesthood. I was puzzled by what seemed to be his medical problem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p10\" class=\"\">After several tests and x-rays, I found <span class=\"emphasis\">myself<\/span> amazed at the diagnosis. He was an alcoholic at his young age.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p11\" class=\"\">He told me that he had begun having alcoholic drinks at a very early age due to the encouragement of his so-called friends.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p12\" class=\"\">I wondered to myself, Are friends that encourage us to break the Word of Wisdom really our true friends?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p13\" class=\"\">Phrases like \u201cjust try it once\u201d or \u201ceverybody does it\u201d or \u201cwho is going to know\u201d are all too commonly used. If they were true friends, would they pressure us that way?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p14\" class=\"\">Indeed, in life it may be difficult to tell at times just who our true friends are. Were my young patient\u2019s friends the kind he should strive to keep? The room attendant perceived Sneaky as a potentially harmful enemy instead of a friend, and yet the reverse was true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p15\" class=\"\">A true friend of yours and mine gave us the Word of Wisdom through his Prophet Joseph Smith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p16\" class=\"\">Medical research tells us that by far the majority of young people who begin using alcohol or tobacco products do so with the urging of their friends.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p17\" class=\"\">The Lord has told us that neither strong drinks, meaning alcoholic drinks, nor tobacco are for the body and that they are not good for man.

As a physician, who for forty years has witnessed firsthand the truth of those statements in the Word of Wisdom, I testify that they are true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p19\" class=\"\">The beautiful scenes in magazine advertisements are not what the end results of cigarette smoking prove to be. This advertising in these magazines and newspapers is very deceptive. The end results are not nearly so pretty. They are oxygen masks and intravenous medication and literally hours of pain, misery, and gasping for breath.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p20\" class=\"\">Remember that approximately 5,000 people a day quit smoking, and another 1,000\u2014every single day\u2014die from cigarette smoking, or one in every ninety seconds, in the United States alone. This means that each day 6,000 people either kick the habit or kick the bucket. No wonder the cigarette companies spend billions to keep their unwitting customers buying their lethal wares.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p21\" class=\"\">I had my own comment printed and pasted on all cigarette advertising in the magazines of my medical office waiting room. It states:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cMany of the ads in this magazine are misleading, deceptive, and are a rip-off. For example, smoking does not make one glamorous, macho, or athletic. It does make one sick, poor, and dead.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p23\" class=\"\">How true this is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p24\" class=\"\">Smoking is indeed becoming less and less popular as the heavy smokers one by one pass on. If an industrial accident killed everyone in the entire Salt Lake Valley, the nation would be horrified. That, however, is the scale of the annual tobacco disaster. One out of every six people that die in the United States dies as a result of smoking.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p25\" class=\"\">Almost inevitably, the user of hard drugs begins first with alcohol or tobacco, both of which are drugs of the highly addicting kind themselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p26\" class=\"\">In addition, the real damage from the use of these things is usually even more severe to our spiritual lives than it is to our physical bodies. Now, would a true friend be one to entice you to use them? I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/who-is-a-true-friend.p27\" class=\"\">Look closely at your friends. Cultivate good friends. They\u2019re so valuable. Remember the Savior valued his friends so highly that he would lay down his life for them.
