I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. I know that Joseph Smith was a true prophet.\u201d You knew those things because others told you. Because of your trust in your parents, your bishop, and others, you never questioned that knowledge. But now, as you grow more independent in understanding, comprehension, and perception of all the different variables that this intense and beautiful life presents to you, frequently you realize that not all men have the same testimony or the \u201cpeace of God, which passeth all understanding\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41206\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41206)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41206)\">Philip. 4:7<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-own-personal-testimony.p6\" class=\"\">Maybe, Jonathan, you have already realized that some adults are cynical and will not talk to you about the beautiful concepts of the Atonement, the Resurrection, and eternal life. Instead, they will tell you to \u201ceat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3282\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3282)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3282)\">2 Ne. 28:7<\/a><\/span>). Others you will see groping and grasping, looking for answers which they do not find. And yet they will still try to demonstrate to you a knowledge of that which they do not have. Even others will say, \u201cWell, maybe these things are true, but maybe they aren\u2019t. The best thing we can do is live our own lives the way we see fit, and then if there is a life after this one, we will see what happens.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-own-personal-testimony.p7\" class=\"\">Now, Andrew, I can understand the thoughts and feelings you may have in your mind and heart.

The truth is that you will not be condemned for wondering or questioning if you make a sincere effort to find the answer. Our mental powers have been given to us to use. Faith based on personal prayer, study, and obedience is more lasting than blind faith; it is more rewarding, and for sure it is better grounded.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-own-personal-testimony.p9\" class=\"\">And you, Paul, do you remember when the Savior said: \u201cVerily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven\u201d?

We are benefited by retaining the humility and teachableness of a child, but we must be sure to continue growing and not be content with the limited knowledge or comprehension of the gospel which a child has. Remember, Paul, what the Apostle of your same name said to the Corinthians: \u201cBrethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44)\">1 Cor. 14:20<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-own-personal-testimony.p10\" class=\"\">Well now, my dear Russell, you will ask yourself, \u201cIn that case, do I have to go and look for the answer myself? Can anybody have this kind of testimony? Is it a gift only for a few?

Widtsoe said that those who truly have a testimony of the gospel have \u201cthe highest type of knowledge. It comes as a revelation when truth is known and obeyed. \u2026 It is really <span class=\"emphasis\">man\u2019s chief possession<\/span>\u201d (\u201cWhat Does It Mean to Have a Testimony?\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era,<\/span> May 1945, 273; emphasis added). Do you realize that a testimony is defined as \u201cthe highest type of knowledge\u201d and \u201cman\u2019s chief possession\u201d and that in the Doctrine and Covenants the Savior mentions it as a knowledge \u201cwhich shall dwell in your heart\u201d? (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10841\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10841)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10841)\">D&amp;C 8:2<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-own-personal-testimony.p12\" class=\"\">Maybe it will be difficult to understand this at your age, but our testimony is something that we will take with us to the next life. We will leave all our earthly possessions behind, but that knowledge, that inner conviction, will remain with us. Think of Joseph Smith: those who took his life could not take his chief possession\u2014his testimony. The Prophet Joseph took that priceless possession with him through death\u2019s veil into eternity, where the Lord had promised him \u201ca throne for you in the kingdom of my Father\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11029\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11029)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11029)\">D&amp;C 132:49<\/a><\/span>).

We hear the resounding witness of God\u2019s Prophet testifying \u201cthat [Christ] lives!

The Lord declared, \u201cIf ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1346\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1346)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1346)\">1 Ne. 15:11<\/a><\/span>). Now, we can review the steps Nephi described.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-own-personal-testimony.p15\" class=\"\">First, <span class=\"emphasis\">don\u2019t harden your heart.<\/span> Seek to know. In other words, have an intense, consuming desire to know. Give place for a seed to be planted in your heart. And if you do this, do you know what the promise is? Alma tells us, \u201cHe that will not harden his heart, to him is given \u2026 to know the mysteries of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8500\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8500)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8500)\">Alma 12:10<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-own-personal-testimony.p16\" class=\"\">Second, <span class=\"emphasis\">ask in faith.<\/span> In your study of the scriptures, have you noted how many times the phrase \u201cbelieving that ye shall receive\u201d accompanies the commandment of praying and asking? In the process of asking for knowledge, we have to exercise faith\u2014believing before receiving. To illustrate this part of our conversation, Alma gives us a good example when he explained how he obtained his testimony:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-own-personal-testimony.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself.

King Benjamin declared to his people, \u201cIf you believe all these things see that ye do them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40019\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40019)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40019)\">Mosiah 4:10<\/a><\/span>).

But there is yet the most important help available that can give us confirmation and absolute assurance, and it is your right when you live worthy to receive the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Remember the promise in Moroni: \u201cAnd by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38142\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38142)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38142)\">Moro. 10:5<\/a><\/span>). Pay attention that I said to <span class=\"emphasis\">receive<\/span> the companionship of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost has the power to bring light and understanding to our lives, but we must pay the price to seek and win His companionship.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-own-personal-testimony.p20\" class=\"\">Elder Marion G. Romney once wrote: \u201cIt is the mission of the Holy Ghost to reveal the truth of heaven to those who qualify to receive it. Every one of us, if we will, may so qualify. We must ever keep in mind, however, that he will not dwell in an unholy environment. He is used to the society of God, for he is an associate of the Father and the Son. When we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, we are commanded to receive him; he is not commanded to come to us. But if, with all our hearts, we truly seek him, he will come to us and guide us in the making of decisions at every crisis of our lives\u201d (\u201cRevelation in Our Personal Affairs,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Relief Society Magazine,<\/span> Oct. 1955, 647). The Holy Ghost is given to us to witness of the Father and the Son; that Jesus Christ is our Redeemer; that there is a prophet upon the earth who presides over the true Church that carries the Savior\u2019s name, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and that all the works and promises of God will be fulfilled in His time and in His own way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-own-personal-testimony.p21\" class=\"\">And now, my youngest grandson, Tate, we can end this conversation, mentioning what a testimony is. Maybe the best way to define it would be by looking at what a testimony represents in our lives. It is to say, \u201cI will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1334\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1334)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1334)\">1 Ne. 3:7<\/a><\/span>), and then to act in consequence. It is to have the peace that comes with knowing that all possible has been done, that all talents have been exercised to the maximum. It is to follow the commandment of the Lord to Joshua: \u201cBe strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30013\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30013)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30013)\">Josh. 1:9<\/a><\/span>).

It is to never give up, but to stand up as an example to others. It is to \u201cbe ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2195\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2195)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2195)\">1 Pet. 3:15<\/a><\/span>).
