It was evident from his appearance and troubled look that he was seeking help. He had been a student at the Brigham Young University, married for two years, and now his wife was requesting a divorce. They had a young son.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-foundation-whereon-men-cannot-fall.p5\" class=\"\">Filled with remorse, he told me how he had been unsuccessful in holding numerous jobs, had tampered with drugs, had taken a so-called treatment at a commune-type ranch, and had not assumed his responsibility of providing for his wife and infant son.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-foundation-whereon-men-cannot-fall.p6\" class=\"\">As I visited with him, I found he had never worked at a paying job or assumed any responsibility prior to his college and marriage. His parents had separated. This young man was the product of a home where the parents ignored the teachings of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-foundation-whereon-men-cannot-fall.p7\" class=\"\">I know of another young man who recently returned from Vietnam. He told of the close bond of love in his family. He said, \u201cMy buddies tried to persuade me to go into Saigon and live it up. This went on day after day, but I kept thinking of my family and their influence and the memories of our family home evenings and of my patriarchal blessing. It seemed to give me the courage I needed to resist them.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-foundation-whereon-men-cannot-fall.p8\" class=\"\">He then said, \u201cI got out my blessing and read it and reread it.

My parents were concerned with the activities of each child. They planned fun evenings at home. We would watch the honey candy boil, then pour it out so it could cool, and then we would all stand around and pull it into strings so we could cut it and enjoy it. This was great fun!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-foundation-whereon-men-cannot-fall.p20\" class=\"\">I remember our family around the piano singing and trying to learn harmony.

They all point to the home, not more laws. They say, \u201cIf only the <span class=\"emphasis\">father <\/span>would take command!

The trend is growing more acute daily. Latter-day Saint parents must analyze the foundation on which their homes are being built, for the rains of evil are descending.

How well equipped are we as parents to be the trust officers of the most precious of God\u2019s possessions\u2014innocent young spirits? They are in your charge during eighteen or twenty of these critical years. This is your opportunity and responsibility to help them gain a testimony and prepare for celestial life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-foundation-whereon-men-cannot-fall.p25\" class=\"\">But chances are it will not happen accidentally.
