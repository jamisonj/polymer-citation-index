I add my congratulations to our beloved President, Ezra Taft Benson, on the recognition he has received. It is an honor well deserved, and it compliments not only him but also the entire Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p4\" class=\"\">It is a great tribute to the consistency of his life. I congratulate the Scout organizations in selecting a man whose entire life has been a shining example of the finest teachings of Scouting. He is now in his ninetieth year, and as I think of his life, I see an undeviating pattern of adherence to principle. He has kept the faith. He has lived the commandments. He has been persuasive with all of us in his urging that we do likewise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p5\" class=\"\">It has been a long time since I have been in a Scout troop meeting. I am not familiar with the present agenda for those meetings. But I do have vivid recollections of the way in which they were conducted when I was a boy. I became a Scout in 1922, nearly sixty-seven years ago. At that time there was no Cub program. A boy had to be twelve before he could enroll in Scouting. We met in our troop meeting on Tuesday evening. We were a noisy group as we assembled. Our Scoutmaster, Charlie Robinson, would blow his whistle, and we would all fall in line. We would raise our right arm to the square and repeat together the Scout oath: \u201cOn my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p6\" class=\"\">It was something of a ritual each Tuesday. We did not think about it very deeply, but the words of that oath became fixed in our minds. They have remained with me through all of these years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p7\" class=\"\">Now, this is not a Scout meeting tonight, although some wonderful things have been said about Scouting. It is a priesthood meeting. For the purposes of this meeting, I should like to suggest another pledge for every man and boy assembled in this great gathering wherever you may be: \u201cOn my honor I will do my best to magnify the priesthood of God which has been conferred upon me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p8\" class=\"\">That word <span class=\"emphasis\">magnify<\/span> is interesting. As I interpret it, it means to enlarge, to make more clear, to bring closer, and to strengthen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p9\" class=\"\">I have here a pair of binoculars. I treasure them not only for their practical value, but also for sentimental reasons. They are useful in enlarging objects at which I might look. They are also a reminder of a good and great man who magnified his priesthood. They were given to me in 1962, at the conclusion of a wonderful series of meetings with all of our missionaries then in Europe and the British Isles, by President Henry D. Moyle, who was a Counselor in the First Presidency. Whenever I use them, I think of the giver as well as the gift.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p10\" class=\"\">All of you, of course, are familiar with binoculars. When you put the lenses to your eyes and focus them, you magnify and in effect bring closer all within your field of vision. But if you turn them around and look through the other end, you diminish and make more distant that which you see.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p11\" class=\"\">So it is with our actions as holders of the priesthood. When we live up to our high and holy calling, when we show love for God through service to fellowmen, when we use our strength and talents to build faith and spread truth, we magnify our priesthood. When, on the other hand, we live lives of selfishness, when we indulge in sin, when we set our sights only on the things of the world rather than on the things of God, we diminish our priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p12\" class=\"\">Jacob, the brother of Nephi, in speaking of the call which he and his brother Joseph had received, said: \u201cAnd we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25934\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25934)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25934)\">Jacob 1:19<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p13\" class=\"\">To every officer, to every teacher in this Church who acts in a priesthood office, there comes the sacred responsibility of magnifying that priesthood calling. Each of us is responsible for the welfare and the growth and development of others. We do not live only unto ourselves. If we are to magnify our callings, we cannot live only unto ourselves. As we serve with diligence, as we teach with faith and testimony, as we lift and strengthen and build convictions of righteousness in those whose lives we touch, we magnify our priesthood. To live only unto ourselves, on the other hand, to serve grudgingly, to give less than our best effort to our duty, diminishes our priesthood just as looking through the wrong lenses of binoculars reduces the image and makes more distant the object.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p14\" class=\"\">Jacob says further: \u201cNow, my beloved brethren, \u2026 according to the responsibility which I am under to God, to magnify mine office with soberness, \u2026 I \u2026 declare unto you the word of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25936\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25936)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25936)\">Jacob 2:2<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p15\" class=\"\">Every missionary has the responsibility to magnify his calling in teaching the plan of God.

He magnified that priesthood as a witness to the Book of Mormon, as a Counselor to the Prophet, as one to select the Twelve Apostles and to instruct them, as a missionary in moving the Church across the frontiers of the western territories, and as a teacher and speaker whose voice rang with great and persuasive power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p22\" class=\"\">But he turned and began to look through the wrong end of the lens.

I wrote with my own pen the entire Book of Mormon (save a few pages) as it fell from the lips of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and he translated it by the power and gift of God, by means of the Urim and Thummim, or as it is called by that book, \u2018Holy Interpreter.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cI beheld with my eyes and handled with my hands, the gold plates from which it was translated. \u2026 That book is true, Sidney Rigdon did not write it; Mr. Spaulding did not write it; I wrote it myself as it fell from the lips of the Prophet. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/magnify-your-calling.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cI was present with Joseph when an Holy Angel from Heaven came down and conferred upon us \u2026 the Aaronic Priesthood, and said to us, at the same time, that it should remain on earth while the earth stands.

But they have had much of wisdom, and they have had much of faith. They are men who since the days of their youth have held the priesthood of God, have walked in its light, and have magnified their callings. They have left home at personal sacrifice to serve as missionaries and as mission presidents. They have served as bishops and presidents of stakes.
