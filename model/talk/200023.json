We also are required to arrive at a state of perfection before the Lord; and the Lord in this case, the same as in every other, has not made a requirement that cannot be complied with, but on the other hand, He has placed for the use of the Latter-day Saints the means by which they can conform to His holy order. When the Lord made this requirement of Abraham, He gave him the means by which he could become qualified to obey that law and come up fully to the requirement. He had the privilege of the Holy Spirit, as we are told the Gospel was preached to Abraham,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"74501\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 74501)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(74501)\">Gal. 3:8<\/a><\/span> and through that Gospel he could obtain that divine aid which would enable him to understand the things of God,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"73068\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 73068)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(73068)\">1 Cor. 2:11<\/a><\/span> and without it no man could arrive at a state of perfection before the Lord. So in reference to the Latter-day Saints, they could not possibly come up to such a moral and spiritual standard except through supernatural aid and assistance. Neither do we expect that the Latter-day Saints, at once will or can conform to this law under all circumstances. It requires time; it requires much patience and <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"188b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD20\/JoD20_0188.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;188b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7337\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> discipline of the mind and heart in order to obey this commandment. And although we may fail at first in our attempts, yet this should not discourage the Latter-day Saints from endeavoring to exercise a determination to comply with the great requirement. Abraham, although he might have had faith to walk before the Lord according to this divine law, yet there were times when his faith was sorely tried, but still he was not discouraged because he exercised a determination to comply with the will of God. We may think that we cannot live up to the perfect law, that the work of perfecting ourselves is too difficult. This may be true in part, but the fact still remains that it is a command of the Almighty to us and we cannot ignore it. When we experience trying moments, then is the time for us to avail ourselves of that great privilege of calling upon the Lord for strength and understanding, intelligence and grace by which we can overcome the weakness of the flesh against which we have to make a continual warfare. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v20n523\"> Abraham was called to leave his kindred and country.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"53015\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 53015)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(53015)\">Gen. 12:1<\/a><\/span> Had he not complied with this requirement, he would not have been approved of the Lord. But he did comply; and while he was leaving his home, he no doubt was living in obedience to this divine law of perfection. Had he failed in this, he certainly could not have obeyed the requirements of the Almighty. And while he was leaving his father's house, while he was subjecting himself to this trial, he was doing that which his own conscience and the Spirit of God justified him in doing, and nobody could have done better, providing he was doing no wrong when he was performing this labor. <\/div> <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"189a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD20\/JoD20_0189.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;189a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7336\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v20n525\"> When the Latter-day Saints received the Gospel in the nations afar, and when the voice of the Almighty to them was, to leave the lands of their fathers, to leave their kindred as Abraham did, so far as they complied with this requirement, so far they were walking in obedience to this law; and they were as perfect as men could be under the circumstances, and in the sphere in which they were acting, not that they were perfect in knowledge or power, etc.; but in their feelings, in their integrity, motives and determination. And while they were crossing the great deep, providing they did not murmur nor complain, but obeyed the counsels which were given them, and in every way comported themselves in a becoming manner, they were as perfect as God required them to be. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v20n526\"> The Lord designs to bring us up into the celestial kingdom. He has made known, through direct revelation, that we are His offspring, begotten in the eternal worlds, that we have come to this earth for the special purpose of preparing ourselves to receive a fullness of our Father's glory when we shall return into his presence. Therefore, we must seek the ability to keep this law, to sanctify our motives, desires, feelings and affections, that they may be pure and holy, and our will in all things be subservient to the will of God, and have no will of our own except to do the will of our Father.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"69254\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 69254)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(69254)\">John 6:38<\/a><\/span> Such a man in his sphere is perfect, and commands the blessing of God in all that he does and wherever he goes.

This I understand is the meaning of the word perfection, as expressed by our Savior and by the Lord to Abraham. A person may be perfect in regard to some things and not others. A person who obeys the word of wisdom faithfully, is perfect as far as that law is concerned. When we repented of our sins and were baptized for the remission of them, we were perfect as far as that matter was concerned. Now we are told by the Apostle John, that &#x201C;we are the sons of God, but it does not appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"78658\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 78658)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(78658)\">1 Jn. 3:2<\/a><\/span> &#x201C;And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he [Christ] is pure.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"78686\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 78686)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(78686)\">1 Jn. 3:3<\/a><\/span> The Latter-day Saints expect to arrive at this state of perfection; we expect to become as our Father and God, fit and worthy children to dwell in his presence; we expect that when the Son of God shall appear, we shall receive our bodies renewed and glorified, and that &#x201C;these vile bodies will be changed, and become like unto his glorious body.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"75525\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 75525)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(75525)\">Philip. 3:21<\/a><\/span> These are our expectations.

There was the Apostle Peter, for instance, a man valiant for the truth, and a man who walked before God in a manner that met with his divine approval; he told the Savior on a certain occasion that though all men forsook him he would not.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"66250\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 66250)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(66250)\">Matt. 26:33,35<\/a><\/span> But the Savior, foreseeing what would happen, told him that on that same night, before the cock crowed, he would deny him thrice,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"66252\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 66252)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(66252)\">Matt. 26:34<\/a><\/span> and he did so.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"127950\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 127950)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(127950)\">Matt. 26:69-75<\/a><\/span> He proved himself unequal for the trial; but afterwards he gained power, and his mind was disciplined to that extent that such trials could not possibly affect him. And if we could read in detail the life of Abraham, or the lives of other great and holy men, we would doubtless find that their efforts to be righteous were not always crowned with success. Hence we should not be discouraged if we should be overcome in a weak moment; but, on the contrary, straightway repent of the error or the wrong we may have committed, and as far as possible repair it, and then seek to God for renewed strength to go on and do better. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v20n528\"> Abraham could walk perfectly before God day after day when he was leaving his father's house, and he showed evidences of a superior and well-disciplined mind in the course he suggested when his herdsmen quarreled with the herdsmen of his nephew, Lot.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"53048\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 53048)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(53048)\">Gen. 13:5-9<\/a><\/span> There came a <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"190b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD20\/JoD20_0190.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;190b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7335\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> time in Abraham's life, however, which must have been very trying; in fact anything more severe can scarcely be conceived of; that was when the Lord called upon him to offer as a sacrifice his beloved and only son,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"53277\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 53277)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(53277)\">Gen. 22:1-2<\/a><\/span> even him through whom he expected the fulfillment of the great promise made him by the Lord;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"127951\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 127951)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(127951)\">Gen. 15:4-5<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"127952\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 127952)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(127952)\">Gen. 17:1-8<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"127953\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 127953)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(127953)\">D&amp;C 132:30<\/a><\/span> but through manifesting a proper disposition he was enabled to surmount the trial, and prove his faith and integrity to God. It can hardly be supposed that Abraham inherited such a state of mind from his idolatrous parents; but it is consistent to believe that under the blessing of God he was enabled to acquire it, after going through a similar warfare with the flesh as we are, and doubtless being overcome at times and then overcoming until he was enabled to stand so severe a test. &#x201C;Let this same mind be in you,&#x201D; says the Apostle Paul, &#x201C;which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"75414\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 75414)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(75414)\">Philip. 2:5-6<\/a><\/span> Now every man that has this object before him will purify himself as God is pure,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"78688\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 78688)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(78688)\">1 Jn. 3:3<\/a><\/span> and try to walk perfectly before him.

If the husband can live with his wife one day without quarreling or without treating anyone unkindly or without grieving the Spirit of God in any way, that is well so far; he is so far perfect.

If the Apostle Peter had become discouraged at his manifest failure to maintain the position that he had taken to stand by the Savior under all circumstances, he would have lost all; whereas, by repenting and persevering he lost nothing but gained all, leaving us too to profit by his experience.
