One day he was swimming at a party given by the company for which he was working that summer in Nebraska. He dove into the water and hit a shallow spot very hard.

It was inconceivable, the emotional and physical pain that he must go through as a quadriplegic.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/count-your-blessings.p19\" class=\"\">Even though he was in this condition in the University of Utah Medical Center, he was determined to graduate from law school. It was an almost impossible task, but good friends, true Samaritans, brought him notes and taped lectures from Provo. Oh, God bless these true Christians. He turned pages by a mouthstick, and if his book flipped shut, he waited for a long time until someone came to help him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/count-your-blessings.p20\" class=\"\">Finally, he graduated from law school, passed the Utah bar exam, and became a licensed attorney.
