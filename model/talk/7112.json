In the midst of that stress, Joseph Smith had the remarkable prophetic prompting to send some of his ablest men (ultimately the entire Quorum of the Twelve Apostles) abroad on missions. It was a bold, inspired move, one that would in the end save the Church from the perils of the day, but in the near term it imposed great burdens on the Saints\u2014painful for those who went away and perhaps even more painful for those who stayed at home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/our-most-distinguishing-feature.p25\" class=\"\">I quote from Elder Robert B.

He then, like the patriarchs, and by virtue of his office, laid his hands upon their heads individually, leaving a father\u2019s blessing upon them, \u2026 commending them to the care and protection of God, while he should be engaged preaching the Gospel in a foreign land. While thus engaged [in giving those blessings] his voice was almost lost in the sobs of those around [him], who [were trying in their youthful way to be strong but having a very hard time doing so.] \u2026 He proceeded, but his heart was too much affected to do so regularly. \u2026 He was obliged to stop at intervals, while \u2026 big tears rolled down his cheeks, an index to the feelings which reigned in his bosom.
