Hanks, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1967, pp. 123-126<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nA few days ago as I pondered this responsibility a letter arrived from an anguished parent\nwhose child had taken a wrong turn in the road and had become enmeshed in serious trouble.\nAbout the same time a telephone call brought a request for help from a mother, under similar\ncircumstances. That weekend the \"Church Section\" quoted in an article a letter from another\nheartbroken mother whose promising son had been destroyed by drugs. Experience recalls many such matters.\n<\/p><p>\nEach of these instances involved parents who had earnestly tried to do their duty, had\nthemselves lived honorable, devoted lives, had reared choice families, had loved and found\nmuch to praise in the child who had made the wrong decisions. Nevertheless, the child had\nmade the wrong decision.\n<\/p><p>\nBeyond the anguish caused by the errant child in such cases is often the added burden of\ncensure from neighbors, and self-condemnation as scriptures are read or alluded to in classes\nand meetings and discussions.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat has the Church to say to a sincere parent who, like all parents, has made mistakes, but\nwho has really tried &mdash;only to have a child disregard his teachings and example and choose\nanother way?\n<\/p><p>\nPossibly no subject is more frequently and earnestly treated in Church instruction and\nadmonition and programming these days than that of the responsibility of parents to their\nchildren. All who have association with youth and families know the importance of this\nemphasis, and none could question the validity of the effort.\n<\/p><p>\nOutside the Church, people of honest interest and goodwill feel the same and seek the same\nobjectives.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The charge to parents to teach children<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFew scriptural admonitions are more clearly or strongly given than those relating to the\nresponsibility of parents and adults to their children and the younger generation. If we were to\nselect a scripture that is perhaps as frequently referred to as any other by speakers and\nteachers, we would be reasonably safe in choosing the 68th Section of the Doctrine and\nCovenants, where a well-known instruction from the Lord to his children is recorded. Certain\nof the brethren received counsel, and instructions of general application were included.\nAmong the choice directions from the Lord is this verse: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are\norganized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the\nSon of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the\nhands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14968\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14968)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14968)\">D&amp;C 68:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nParenthood, the revelation teaches, involves the responsibility to \"teach their children to pray,\nand to walk uprightly before the Lord\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14971\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14971)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14971)\">D&amp;C 68:28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMy purpose today is to express my own deep appreciation of the validity and relevance of\nthese instructions, and to say that I believe and accept them as the word of the Lord. But\nthere is another side of this story that deserves attention and compassionate consideration.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Potent influences upon children<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe are all aware that home and parental and adult influence are of greatly persuasive\nimportance in the lives of children. In commenting on the relationship of adult to child over\nthis pulpit some years ago, I noted that among other things the following are true: \n<\/p><p>\n1. Children are inclined to be like their parents and the homes from which they come.\n<\/p><p>\n2. Children are also influenced by associates who come from other homes and therefore are\ninfluenced by the nature of the other homes and the parents who live in them.\n<\/p><p>\n3. Other adults and environments have great influence on young people.\n<\/p><p>\n4. Young men and women soon discover the truth about parents or other adults whose lives\nare not consistent with their expressed convictions in the way they live.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is true that there are a number of examples of fine young people who rise above their home\nand family environments and their training and the example of the adult generation. They\nsomehow find the way themselves and, setting high goals, manifest the determination and\ncourage and capacity to achieve them. There are exceptions on the other side of the coin also,\nand it is of this that I would like to speak for a moment.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Solace for the heart-broken<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat of the earnest, sincere parents who do their best to rear their family with integrity and\ndevotion, only to see a child (or several children) choose paths leading to destinations that\nbreak the hearts of the parents? Like other parents, this father and mother, aware of their\nvulnerabilities and limitations, have earnestly tried to rear their children in the nurture and\nadmonition of the Lord. As they hear the sermons and testimonies and observe the good\nfortune of neighbors whose children follow the established way, their hearts break and their\nspirits sag. They are sickened by questions they cannot answer, critical of\nthemselves, assisted in their own self-criticism by the sometimes unthinking judging of others.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat shall be said to such heart broken parents? Is there any encouragement for them in the\nscriptures? What have the prophets said?\n<\/p><p>\nEzekiel was a prophet during the captivity of Israel. He preached to a people to whom it was\ncomforting to attribute their current problems to the sins of former generations. They were\nhabituated to quoting a prophecy: \"The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth\nare set on edge\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23132\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23132)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23132)\">Ezek. 18:2<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nThere is, of course, a measure of truth in this proverb, as every parent or close observer of\nthe human experience knows. Our children do suffer in many ways from our defections or\nderelictions, just as they prosper from our proper instruction and our love and good example.\n<\/p><p>\nAs Ezekiel admonished Israel he spoke these words, recorded in the 18th chapter of Ezekiel: \n<\/p><p>\n\"The word of the Lord came unto me again, saying,\n<\/p><p>\n\"What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers\nhave eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?\n<\/p><p>\n\"As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in\nIsrael\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23131\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23131)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23131)\">Ezek. 18:1-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Individual responsibility<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAs I read the record, Ezekiel was not minimizing the sorrowful imposition of trouble in the\nlife of a child who is deprived of the truth or misled by the faithlessness of a parent. Ezekiel\nwas reemphasizing for Israel the great importance of individual responsibility before God and\nof God's impartiality in dealing with every man according to his own character. Hear these\nwords of the Lord through the Prophet, immediately following his instruction that they no\nmore use (or misuse) the proverb in Israel: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold, all souls are mine, as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the\nsoul that sinneth, it shall die\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23133\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23133)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23133)\">Ezek. 18:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nRepeating those last words, \"the soul that sinneth, it shall die,\" the Lord added: \n<\/p><p>\n<b>Compensation for righteousness<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of\nthe son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the\nwicked shall be upon him\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23134\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23134)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23134)\">Ezek. 18:20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nEzekiel then encouraged repentance and obedience, noting that the repentant sinner may avoid\nthe eternal consequence of his deed through the forgiveness of the Lord. A wicked man who\nrepents and becomes righteous will live. A righteous man who becomes wicked will die.\nEvery man must stand before God and answer for his own choices and for his own character.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat Ezekiel said to ancient Israel, I believe we must understand and apply to modern Israel.\nWhere homes and hearts are sundered by the resentful or rebellious bad choices of a child\nwho is accountable and has made his own stubborn decisions, which cross in their willfulness\nthe purposes of the parents, God understands and does not condemn the honest parents.\n<\/p><p>\nJeremiah quoted and refuted the same proverb: \n<\/p><p>\n\"In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's\nteeth are set on edge.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth\nshall be set on edge\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26517\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26517)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26517)\">Jer. 31:29-30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is some solace for the sorrowing heart in recalling the first family of the Bible. Seeking\nearnestly to live obediently in response to their knowledge of good and evil, faithful parents\ntried to teach their children. One son understood and offered unto God an acceptable sacrifice.\nAnother son did not or would not understand. To him and his offering God had no respect. So\nserious was his misunderstanding and his response that he rose up against his brother and slew\nhim (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23756\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23756)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23756)\">Gen. 4:3-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhat of the first family of the Book of Mormon? Reared by the same mother and father in\nthe same household, some of the brothers loved God and followed the\ncounsels of their parents. They were loyal to their heritage and possibilities. Other sons took\nan opposite course. They were willful and rebellious and unresponsive to the instructions and\nexample and entreaties of their father and mother. Repeatedly they followed their own\nwayward wills, to the heartbreak of their parents and to their own ultimate disaster.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Father's compassion<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIf there needs be more evidence of the widespread nature of the problem and the deep\ncompassion of the Father for those who suffer through it, consider another family in which\none choice son humbly accepted the counsel and plan of his father and followed that plan\naccording to his father's will, while another son, also an authority in the kingdom of his\nfather, followed his own wayward will and base arrogance, rebelled against his father and his\ninstructions, and, not content with this, induced a third of his brothers and sisters to rebel\nagainst their father and to follow him, to their own heartbreak and sorrow.\n<\/p><p>\nWhatever application is to be made of Ezekiel's instructions, surely there is this invitation to\nthose in whose households there is peace and joy and rejoicing because of their posterity: be\nhumble. Be compassionate and considerate and prayerful in behalf of those who have suffered\nthe misfortune of a wayward child. Thank God, watch and pray, and be humble.\n<\/p><p>\nTo those to whom the sorrow of a child unresponsive to parental instruction and example has\ncome, be comforted. God understands. He knows what it means to have a rebellious son and\nwayward children. Many others understand.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Freedom and its consequences<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAgain let it be said that there is no disposition to minimize the importance of our doing all\nwe can to lead and direct and inspire obedience in our children. We can tragically impose\nupon their lives by our failures. But let there be concern and consideration also in recognizing\nthe principle of agency in accountable people and the responsibility to answer for the choices\nthat are made.\n<\/p><p>\nGod requires that we accept responsibility for our individual decisions; he deals with every\nman according to his own character. He has taught us through Ezekiel not alone that every\nman must stand on his own and answer for his own decisions, but that God desires that all\nshall turn to him and live, he having no pleasure in the suffering of his children for their sins\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23136\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23136)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23136)\">Ezek. 33:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn a recent magazine it is quoted: \"On the last six days of Passover, Jews say a special prayer\n&mdash;the half Hallel. Tradition has it that when the Egyptians, in pursuing the Jews, were\ndrowning in the Red Sea, the Lord kept his angels from singing his praises, admonishing\nthem, 'How can you sing hymns while my creatures are drowning in the sea?' \"\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to be humble if we are blessed with children who follow the way they have been\nshown. God help us to be gracious and compassionate with others whose experience has not\nbeen so favorable. God help choice parents who have truly tried, but have had heartbreak, to\nknow his love and his warmth and the gracious encouragement of his understanding heart. In\nthe name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
