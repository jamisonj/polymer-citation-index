Be sensitive to the thoughts and feelings of others, always careful not to demean or belittle by either word or act. Be encouraging, uplifting, careful not to break down a person\u2019s confidence. It was my experience even in the legal profession\u2014combative as it can sometimes be\u2014that there was still much room to show consideration and respect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p24\" class=\"\">Second, be complimentary. Look for attributes and acts of others that you can be genuinely complimentary of. Everyone is lifted by sincere and deserved commendation. Third, be charitable. The prophet Moroni counsels us with respect to the need for charity: \u201cFor if he have not charity he is nothing.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38572\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38572)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38572)\">Moro. 7:44<\/a><\/span>.) In his epistle to the Corinthians, the Apostle Paul sums up the importance of charity in that familiar verse: \u201cThough I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"821\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 821)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(821)\">1 Cor. 13:1<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p25\" class=\"\">What does it mean to be charitable? Charity is the opposite of selfishness. It means being generous and giving of both one\u2019s means and one\u2019s time in the service of others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p26\" class=\"\">We should have an element of sacrifice in our offerings and in the consecration of our time. We should strive to lift those within our reach who are forlorn or who despair. We should take a special interest in the youth around us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cCharity is the pure love of Christ.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38576\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38576)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38576)\">Moro. 7:47<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p28\" class=\"\">Fourth, be grateful. If we would show our love to our Heavenly Father, we would be grateful. We would show our gratitude by the way we live, not just by what we say or profess.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p29\" class=\"\">It has been said that the sin of ingratitude is more serious than the sin of revenge.

Lee related a story to a group of college graduates that has always stayed with me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p31\" class=\"\">He told of a woman who was widowed early in life and left with several children to support and care for.

A reporter was sent to the home to interview this remarkable mother who, by now, was somewhat stooped and gray.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p33\" class=\"\">Several questions were asked by the reporter in an attempt to learn the secret of her success. She had accomplished so much with so little.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p34\" class=\"\">The reporter asked his final question: \u201cWith such a wonderful family of children, which one did you love the most?\u201d With a tear softly moistening her eye she replied:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p35\" class=\"\">\u201cI loved most the one who was sick until she was better.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p36\" class=\"\">\u201cI loved most the one who was away until he returned.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p37\" class=\"\">\u201cI loved most the one who was failing until he succeeded.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p38\" class=\"\">\u201cI loved most the one who was sad until she was happy.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p39\" class=\"\">In closing, may I quote from Solomon Bennett Freehof:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/love.p40\" class=\"\">\u201cYears ago I preferred clever people. There was a joy in beholding \u2026 a mind \u2026 bearing thoughts quickly translated into words, or ideas expressed in a new way. I find now my taste has changed. Verbal fireworks often bore me. They seem motivated by self-assertion and self-display. I now prefer another type of person; one who is considerate, understanding of others, careful not to break down another person\u2019s self-respect. \u2026 My preferred person today is one who is always aware of the needs of others, or their pain and [their] fear and [their] unhappiness, and their search for self-respect. \u2026 I once liked clever people.
