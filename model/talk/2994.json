The rightness or appropriateness or effect on a youthful society does not matter as long as it sells. But the day will come when the world will follow the ways of the Church.

The Lord has given them authority to preach, teach, expound, exhort, baptize\u2014a divine commission to act for and in behalf of the Lord Himself. The young man you may be with probably is a priest. He wants to be worthy to receive the higher priesthood and, if worthy, to someday have authority and keys of spiritual blessings. He is not \u201cjust another young man.\u201d He is a very special young man. He is in training. He is going on a mission. You can be a great blessing to him.
