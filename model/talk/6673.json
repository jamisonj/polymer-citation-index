The tulips are well out of the ground and will soon be bursting into flowering beauty. In the winter of our doubt there came the hope of spring. We knew it would come. Such was our faith, based on the experiences of earlier years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p5\" class=\"\">And so it is with matters of the spirit and soul. As each man or woman walks the way of life there come dark seasons of doubt, of discouragement, of disillusionment. In such circumstances, a few see ahead by the light of faith, but many stumble along in the darkness and even become lost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p6\" class=\"\">My call to you this morning is a call to faith, that faith which is \u201cthe substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24188\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24188)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24188)\">Heb. 11:1<\/a><\/span>), as Paul described it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p7\" class=\"\">In the process of conversion, the investigator of the Church hears a little. He may read a little. He does not, he cannot, comprehend the wonder of it all. But if he is earnest in his search, if he is willing to get on his knees and pray about it, the Spirit touches his heart, perhaps ever so lightly. It points him in the right direction. He sees a little of what he has never seen before. And with faith, whether it be recognized or not, he takes a few guarded steps. Then another, brighter vista opens before him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p8\" class=\"\">Long ago I worked for one of our railroads whose tracks threaded the passes through these western mountains. I frequently rode the trains. It was in the days when there were steam locomotives. Those great monsters of the rails were huge and fast and dangerous. I often wondered how the engineer dared the long journey through the night. Then I came to realize that it was not one long journey, but rather a constant continuation of a short journey. The engine had a powerful headlight that made bright the way for a distance of 400 or 500 yards. The engineer saw only that distance, and that was enough, because it was constantly before him all through the night into the dawn of the new day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p9\" class=\"\">The Lord has spoken of this process. He said: \u201cThat which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cThat which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11300\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11300)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11300)\">D&amp;C 50:23\u201324<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p11\" class=\"\">And so it is with our eternal journey. We take one step at a time. In doing so we reach toward the unknown, but faith lights the way. If we will cultivate that faith, we shall never walk in darkness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p12\" class=\"\">Let me tell you of a man I know. I will not mention his name lest he feel embarrassed. His wife felt there was something missing in their lives. She spoke with a relative one day who was a member of the Church. The relative suggested that she call the missionaries. She did so. But the husband was rude to them and told them not to come again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p13\" class=\"\">Months passed. One day another missionary, finding the record of this visit, decided that he and his companion would try again. He was a tall elder from California who carried a big smile on his face.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p14\" class=\"\">They knocked on the door; the man answered. Could they come in for a few minutes? they asked. He consented.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p15\" class=\"\">The missionary said, in effect, \u201cI wonder if you know how to pray.\u201d The man answered that he knew the Lord\u2019s Prayer. The missionary said, \u201cThat is good, but let me tell you how to give a personal prayer.\u201d He went on to explain that we get on our knees in an attitude of humility before the God of heaven. The man did so. The missionary then went on to say, \u201cWe address God as our Father in Heaven. We then thank Him for His blessings, such as our health, our friends, our food. We then ask for His blessings. We express our innermost hopes and desires. We ask Him to bless those in need. We do it all in the name of His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, concluding with \u2018amen.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p16\" class=\"\">It was a pleasant experience for the man. He had gleaned a little light and understanding, a touch of faith. He was ready to try another step.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p17\" class=\"\">Line upon line, the missionaries patiently taught him. He responded as his faith grew into a dim light of understanding. Friends from his branch gathered around to reassure him and answer his questions. The men played tennis with him, and he and his family were invited to their homes for dinner.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p18\" class=\"\">He was baptized, and that was a giant step of faith. The branch president asked him to be a Scoutmaster to four boys. That led to other responsibilities, and the light of faith strengthened in his life with each new opportunity and experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p19\" class=\"\">That has continued. Today he stands as a capable and loved stake president, a leader of great wisdom and understanding, and above all, a man of great faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p20\" class=\"\">The challenge which faces every member of this Church is to take the next step, to accept that responsibility to which he is called, even though he does not feel equal to it, and to do so in faith with the full expectation that the Lord will light the way before him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p21\" class=\"\">Let me give you a story of a woman in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. She worked while going to school to provide for her family. I use her own words in telling this story. She says:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cThe university in which I studied had a regulation that prohibited the students that were in debt from taking tests. For this reason, when I received my salary I would first separate the money for tithing and offerings, and the remainder was allotted for the payment of the school and other expenses.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cI remember a time when I \u2026 faced serious financial difficulties. It was a Thursday when I received my salary. When I figured the monthly budget, I noticed that there wouldn\u2019t be enough to pay [both] my tithing and my university. I would have to choose between them. The bimonthly tests would start the following week, and if I didn\u2019t take them I could lose the school year. I felt great agony. \u2026 My heart ached. I had a painful decision before me, and I didn\u2019t know what to decide. I pondered between the two choices: to pay tithing or to risk the possibility of not obtaining the necessary credits to be approved in school.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cThis feeling consumed my soul and remained with me up to Saturday. It was then that I remembered that when I was baptized I had agreed to live the law of tithing. I had taken upon myself an obligation, not with the missionaries, but with my Heavenly Father. At that moment, the anguish started to disappear, giving place to a pleasant sensation of tranquility and determination. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cThat night when I prayed, I asked the Lord to forgive me for my indecision. On Sunday, before the beginning of sacrament meeting, I contacted the bishop, and with great pleasure I paid my tithing and offerings. That was a special day. I felt happy and peaceful within myself and with Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cThe next day I was in my office; I tried to find a way to be able to take the tests that would begin on Wednesday. The more I thought, the further I felt from a solution. At that time I worked in an attorney\u2019s office, and my employer was the most strict and austere person I had ever met.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cThe working period was ending when my employer approached and gave the last orders of the day. When he had done so, with his briefcase in his hand he bid farewell. \u2026 Suddenly, he halted, and looking at me he asked, \u2018How is your college?\u2019 I was surprised, and I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. The only thing I could answer with a trembling voice was, \u2018Everything is all right!\u2019 He looked thoughtfully at me and bid farewell again. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cSuddenly the secretary entered the room, saying that I was a very fortunate person! When I asked her why, she simply answered: \u2018The employer has just said that from today on the company is going to pay fully for your college and your books. Before you leave, stop at my desk and inform me of the costs so that tomorrow I can give you the check.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cAfter she left, crying and feeling very humble, I knelt exactly where I was and thanked the Lord for His generosity. I \u2026 said to Heavenly Father that He didn\u2019t have to bless me so much. I only needed the cost of one month\u2019s installment, and the tithing I had paid on Sunday was very small compared to the amount I was receiving! During that prayer the words recorded in Malachi came to my mind: \u2018Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it\u2019 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32690\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32690)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32690)\">Mal. 3:10<\/a><\/span>). Up to that moment I had never felt the magnitude of the promise contained in that scripture and that this commandment was truly a witness of the love that God, our Heavenly Father, gives to His children here on earth.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/we-walk-by-faith.p30\" class=\"\">Faith is the very fiber that gives strength to this work.
