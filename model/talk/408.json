Smith, <i>Conference Report<\/i> October 1949,  pp. 9-12<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nThere is one advantage in being called on early. I can assure you I will enjoy this conference\nmore than any I have enjoyed before, and I hope that I will have your faith and prayers with\nme while I stand before you because I assure you I need them.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a very inspiring sight to look over this audience, and it is also a frightening feeling not\nonly to see all these people and have them watching me and sensing that responsibility, and\nusing your time, but also adding to it all the people who are listening, as President Smith has\nannounced, through the broadcasting systems, and through television. No one knows how\nmany thousands there are there&mdash;I assure you I sense the responsibility of the time I use here\nand hope I have your faith and prayers in my behalf in helping me to say those things which\nwill be of benefit.\n<\/p><p>\nGOAL OF PERFECTION\n<\/p><p>\nIt has been the goal of all who are striving to do the will of the Lord to accomplish the\nrequest of the Savior in his Sermon on the Mount:\n<\/p><p>\nBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34254\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34254)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34254)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis is rather a large order, is it not? It would seem almost impossible to attain. We are only\nhuman. And certainly, to err is human. The conflicting forces of good and evil in the world,\nand our free agency to choose what course we will, make it very hard to do what is right all\nthe time.\n<\/p><p>\nLAW OF REPENTANCE\n<\/p><p>\nGod has given us commandments and instructions and shown us the way, and it is for us to\nfollow. He knows we will step aside at times, so he has given us the law of repentance.\nRepentance is not only sorrow for our sins, but also turning aside and exerting ourselves to\nthe utmost to make retribution.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are four kinds of people in the world. There is the kind that does not know when things\nare wrong, and the kind that knows when things are wrong but does not care. There is the\nkind that knows when things are wrong and does care, but does not care enough to make\nthem right. And there is the fourth kind that knows when things are wrong and strives\nintelligently to make them right and to keep them right. Those are the people who know how\nto progress.\n<\/p><p>\nWe must be aware of our sins and repent every day of our lives if we would strive for\nperfection. Repentance is not only for some big sin or for our past sins before we are\nbaptized&mdash;it is also regretting every slip we make and honestly striving to do better.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord in his wisdom has divided our time into daylight and darkness\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23546\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23546)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23546)\">Gen. 1:14-19<\/a><\/span>). With the dawning of\neach new day comes a new chance to improve upon the mistakes of yesterday. Let us call\nupon the Lord for help. Every morning and throughout the day we should pray for strength to\ndo his will. We need it, for it is the little, trivial daily trials that are the hardest to bear\nserenely. It is the seeming little sins which we scarcely recognize that are the hardest to\novercome. Pray for strength, then, constantly, to be kind, honest, charitable; and each night let\nus pray for forgiveness of the sins we have committed, repent and try harder the next day to\ndo better.\n<\/p><p>\nOVERCOMING EVIL\n<\/p><p>\nThere is an old saying, \"There is nothing noble in being superior to some other man. The true\nnobility is in being superior to your previous self.\" Without opposition there would be no\nprogress, for it is only as we overcome that we develop strength.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the steel which is heated and quenched becomes much stronger and more valuable, as a\nresult of that tempering, so do we become stronger and more valuable as we overcome our\nsins, be they great or small. Each one has his trials to go through, and\nthey all seem to be different. In the process of this tempering of the soul of man, we learn\none great principle among many others: the need for repentance. It is this spirit of repentance\nthe Lord requests as a prerequisite to baptism, that through the act of repentance man may\nstart on the road to perfection and receive baptism and the Holy Ghost. But repentance does\nnot stop there. That is the beginning of progress; and as soon as repentance stops, progress\nstops.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we are to become perfect, we must constantly overcome the powers of evil. We find the\npowers of evil on every hand, every day. We learn to combat them in earliest childhood. We\nare taught by our parents to do good and avoid evil. We are taught to distinguish to some\ndegree between good and evil. We are taught the law of repentance by correcting things that\nare wrong. Those teachings by mother and father are most enduring, and many great men\naccredit their success to those early teachings.\n<\/p><p>\nParents, there is the challenge to us. Can we give our children the right start in life? There is\nalso the challenge to the rest of us. Can we so live to be true and faithful to the teachings in\nrighteousness given to us by our parents? Can we be more like the \"lonesome pine\" seen so\noften on the uppermost levels of these beautiful mountains of ours&mdash;this pine which stands\nalone, bending and swaying in the wind? These gallant timbers are known to naturalists as\n\"limber pine,\" so named because of their resiliency, which enables them to ride through the\nheavy storms that rage around them on occasions. You can tie their branches in knots without\nbreaking the bark. When untied, the branches snap back into their original position.\n<\/p><p>\nRESILIENCY NEEDED\n<\/p><p>\nWe see, in their survival, not strength alone, but victory in their ability to spring erect again,\nafter bending to the gale's fury. Resiliency is an important factor in the goal of perfection.\nThe winds of life may bend us, but if we have resiliency of spirit, they cannot break us. To\nstraighten again courageously after our heads have been bowed in defeat, disappointment, and\nsuffering, is the supreme test of character. Such people live on the mountaintops of life and\nare on the road to perfection.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many who have bowed to disappointment or criticism or for some other such reason\nhave stopped their progress in the priesthood, and have lacked the resiliency to rise to the\noccasion and, in spite of opposition, continue to progress. Can you acknowledge your\nmistakes and intelligently try to correct them? Can you also make allowances for others'\nweaknesses and give them the opportunity to make retribution?\n<\/p><p>\nPROCRASTINATION\n<\/p><p>\nThere is one important thing to remember. As the time of repentance is procrastinated, the\nability to repent grows weaker. Neglect of opportunity in holy things brings a forfeit of the\nchance.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom the Book of Mormon in the Book of Alma we read:\n<\/p><p>\nYe cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I\nwill return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth\npossess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will\nhave power to possess your body in that eternal world.\n<\/p><p>\nFor behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death,\nbehold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seat you\nhis; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place\nin you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the\nwicked (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8886\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8886)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8886)\">Alma 34:34-35<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nTEACHINGS OF CONFERENCE\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless us to be able always to keep his commandments to the best of our ability.\nAnd I bless you, my brothers and sisters, with a strength of memory sufficient to take home\nwith you the spirit and teachings of this conference that you may not be forgetful of the\nkernels of truth and light, and that you may not be so burdened with the numerous teachings\nof this conference, that you will lose sight of the important things, and that you will\nremember them and put them into practice and teach them to the many hundreds of our\nmembers who are not able to attend this conference.\n<\/p><p>\nI bless you, my brethren and sisters, that you may be saints in very deed, through your\nfaithfulness and your devotion to the teachings which are given in this conference, and may\nGod be with us all, that we may ever honor and glorify him. May God be ever honored and\nglorified for his manifold mercies unto us, his children. I pray through Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
