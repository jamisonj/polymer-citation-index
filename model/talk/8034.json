There is tremendous strength in our unity this evening. As I see all of us gathered together in the Conference Center and contemplate the thousands of others who are viewing this broadcast from locations around the world, the combined power of our testimonies and faith in Jesus Christ surely constitutes one of the most faith-filled and powerful assemblies of women in the history of the Church, if not the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/general-womens-meeting\/sisterhood-oh-how-we-need-each-other.p7\" class=\"\">Tonight we rejoice in our many different roles as women in the Church. Though in many ways we are different and unique, we also acknowledge that we are all daughters of the same Heavenly Father, which makes us sisters. We are unified in building the kingdom of God and in the covenants which we have made, no matter what our circumstances. This combined assembly is, without a doubt, the most glorious sisterhood upon the face of the earth!<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10905_000_62oscarson\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See Barbara\u00a0B.

Women naturally seek friendship, support, and companionship. We have so much to learn from one another, and we often let self-imposed barriers keep us from enjoying associations which could be among the greatest blessings in our lives. For example, we women who are a little older need what you Primary-age girls have to offer. We can learn much from you about Christlike service and love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/general-womens-meeting\/sisterhood-oh-how-we-need-each-other.p12\" class=\"\">I recently heard a wonderful story about a little girl named Sarah, whose mother had the opportunity to help another woman in her ward named Brenda, who had multiple sclerosis. Sarah loved to go with her mother to help Brenda. She would put lotion on Brenda\u2019s hands and massage her fingers and arms because she was often in pain. Sarah then learned to gently stretch Brenda\u2019s arms over her head to exercise her muscles. Sarah brushed Brenda\u2019s hair and visited with her while her mother took care of her other needs. Sarah learned the importance and joy of serving another person and came to understand that even a child can make a big difference in someone\u2019s life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/general-womens-meeting\/sisterhood-oh-how-we-need-each-other.p13\" class=\"\">I love the example we have in the <span class=\"citation\" id=\"129803\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129803)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129803)\">first chapter of Luke<\/a><\/span> which describes the sweet relationship between Mary, the mother of Jesus, and her cousin Elisabeth.
