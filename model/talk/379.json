They become unsettled in their minds as they study our\npresent-day problems. Attacks are made on their religious beliefs which have been held sacred\nby them ever since they were children in their homes. They often come to wonder about the\nteachings of the Holy Bible, particularly the belief in God and the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nThey often become indifferent to what is right in their daily living. They have just cause to\nwonder! The fires of revolution are burning everywhere&mdash;I fear even at our very doors. In\nAmerica, and of course in the whole world, we are in need of a spiritual awakening, an\nawakening that makes men respect old truths, the finer lessons of history, <i>and the word of God;<\/i>\na realization that a man owes a lot more to his country, than his country owes him: a\nreturn to the old standards of character that makes it easy for a man to become indignant over\ncorruption, and to hate sin and wrong. A study of the word of God, faith, and prayer will\nbring about a better feeling in the minds of the youth, and it is up to the fathers and mothers\nto be patient with their children, for they are living in a new age.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA\n<\/p><p>\nEvery household should keep in mind the two divinely appointed events in modern history\naround which must be centered our future lives as a people. The discovery of America was\nfor a divine purpose, and the formation of this Republic was an event ordered of God for a\nglorious new day. The Prophet Nephi some six centuries before the birth of the Savior wrote:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was separated from the seed of my\nbrethren by the many waters; and I beheld the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought\nupon the man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren,\nwho were in the promised land.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it came to pass that I beheld the Spirit of God, that it wrought upon other Gentiles; and\nthey went forth out of captivity, upon the many waters\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1484\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1484)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1484)\">1 Ne. 13:12-13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHow deeply did Christopher Columbus feel that inspired directive purpose of God when he\nwrote of his discovery of America:\n<\/p><p>\nBut these great and marvelous results are not to be attributed to any merit of mine, but to the\nholy Christian faith, for that which the unaided intellect of man could not compass, the Spirit\nof God has granted to human exertions. For God is wont to hear the prayers of his servants\nwho live his precepts even to the performance of apparent impossibilities. . . . Let Christ\nrejoice on earth, as he rejoices in heaven in the prospect of the salvation of the souls of so\nmany nations hitherto lost.\n<\/p><p>\nWith what inspired knowledge did John Winthrop, one of the old Puritan fathers, write:\n<\/p><p>\nIt will be a service to the Church of great consequence to carry the gospel into those parts of\nthe world to help on the coming of the fulness of the Gentiles.\n<\/p><p>\nWASHINGTON'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n<\/p><p>\nIn his first inaugural address, Washington said:\n<\/p><p>\nSuch being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the public summons, repaired\nto the present station, it would be peculiarly improper to omit, <i>in this first official act, my<\/i>\n<i>fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the<\/i>\n<i>councils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect,<\/i> that his\nbenediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States a\ngovernment instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every\ninstrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his\ncharge. In tendering this <i>homage to the great Author of every public and private good,<\/i> I\nassure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own; nor those of my\nfellow-citizens at large, less than either. No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore\nthe <i>invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men,<\/i> more than the people of the United\nStates.\n<\/p><p>\nThe people whom Columbus found in America, and to whom Washington was the means of\nbringing a knowledge of an Old World, were a deeply religious people. In a recent visit to the\nMaricopa Stake, I was impressed with the group of Indians that was present. Noble-looking\npeople, they were. Some of them were Navajos, some Zunis, and a few Apaches. In speaking\nto them, I recalled a visit, made to Boston many years ago, of some Zunis. We are told that\nthey were taken down the harbor, that they might worship. Landing on an island, the Indians\ndisappeared for a time, and on their return they walked into the sea, and, with deep solemnity,\nsang their mystic chant. They then threw out upon the air from their uplifted hands the grain\nthey offered to the god of waters, and let it float away as a thanks offering. That was worship\nof the Great Spirit.\n<\/p><p>\nAMBASSADORS OF TRUTH\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Jesus sent forth the Twelve and Seventy as his ambassadors of the divine truths which\nhe was teaching, he charged them to reproduce the miracles of his own personal ministry.\nSuch an extension of his work was a part of his original project of evangelizing the country\nroundabout Palestine and eventually the world.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter these things, the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before\nhis face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore said he unto them, the harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye\ntherefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.\n<\/p><p>\nGo your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd into whatever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31235\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31235)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31235)\">Luke 10:1-3,5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSome days afterward, we read in the gospel of St. Luke:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us\nthrough thy name.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he turned . . . unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the\nthings that ye see (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31238\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31238)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31238)\">Luke 10:17,23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo Jesus it was a provocation of purest happiness that God had chosen these men, unlearned\nand simple men, in preference to intellectual and aristocratic leaders. Throughout his ministry,\npeasants and fishermen, the unlearned and landless were called and he rejoiced that their\nmission had been sealed by God: that through the faith of the Twelve and the Seventy they\nhad been invested with mysterious gifts of his Spirit. Jesus lifted up the ideal of life in the\nkingdom of God to inspire his disciples to heightened aspirations and endeavor. He did not\nlay down a rigid legalism, but as one English writer, Dr. Church, in his Essays and Reviews\nhas written:\n<\/p><p>\nHe wooed his pupils by persuasive ideals. He transferred the source of happiness and the\nunderstanding of the gospel from external circumstances to the inward life of man. Goodness,\nmorals, ideals depend upon one's attitude toward God. It was fundamental to the ethic of\nJesus. For this reason the Beatitudes are conjoined with purity of heart. It denotes simplicity,\na singleness of aim in allegiance to the divine teachings of the Master. The ethical and\nreligious teachings pervading Christ's instructions to these first Christian missionaries has\nbecome the foundation of the inner light of the Seventies of today. Their lives exhale the\naroma of complete consecration. They are the salt of the earth, the Light of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nGOD'S SERVANTS\n<\/p><p>\nGod's first demands of his servants are pure hearts, upright lives, truthfulness, mercy, and\nhonesty. Good manners were regarded as matters of religion and morality. Boasting,\nostentation, conceit, were of old considered the patent evidence of vulgarity. These are\ncondemned by the scriptures. The Seventies must always keep in mind the grandeur of the\nFirst Article of Faith (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6626\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6626)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6626)\">A of F 1:1<\/a><\/span>),\nwhich is the greatest statement of Truth since the days of Christ our\nRedeemer. They must keep in mind the supreme test of religion, which is <i>revelation<\/i>. No\nreligion can be persuasive unless it relies on the principle of revelation. All true men reveal\nGod, but the completest carrier of revelation can be no other, or less than a chosen\npersonality. This is the Christian conception. The nobler the person, the truer the revelation.\n<\/p><p>\nIt will be a noble resolution for every Seventy to say to himself: \"I shall read more diligently\nand more deeply the Holy Scriptures than ever before.\" The Holy Bible, Book of Mormon,\nD&amp;C, and Pearl of Great Price are not intended for the few. Their subject-matter constitutes\ntruth, necessary for us all. Every quorum of seventy will from now on become a study group,\nwhere vital truths are discussed. It is within such a group that men are stimulated to think and\nto converse in preparation for the teaching of the gospel. At a time when so much of our\nworld literature is strangely blind to the glory and excellence of human nature at best, we\nshould dedicate ourselves again to the study of the truths and the beauties and holiness of the\nsacred word of God.\n<\/p><p>\nMISSION OF SEVENTIES\n<\/p><p>\nThe Seventies, because of their calling, have a high mission set before them. They should\nresolve that they will develop their mental and spiritual powers toward maturity and learn to\nhave communion with great souls through the reading of their messages of truth. The habit of\nreading must be formed as early in life as possible. A few minutes every day will soon be a\ngreat many hours. Do not miss the thoughts of men who have lived in former times. Broaden\nyour understanding, enliven your sympathy for other peoples and their ways of living. Make\nyour own lives richer and deeper by learning other ideas and visions of people. Read good\nbooks. Read them again and again until you have drawn the essence of thought and feeling\nfrom them. These are some of the reasons why the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best\nbooks words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12693\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12693)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12693)\">D&amp;C 88:118<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJoy will be the characteristic of the quorums of Seventy so long as they are growing,\nexpanding, and creating healthfully. When they cease to grow, they cease to live. God sent us\ninto the world to create and to enrich our own personality in the process Yet we have to rely\non God's help to make anything worth making. If we devote ourselves to God, we must see\nto it that we have <i>ourselves<\/i> to devote. \"Self consecration is not a negative thing: it is a very\npositive thing,\" says a noted evangelist. This leads us to the knowledge that what we are is\nmore important than what we do or say. If we are really wise in our concepts of God, then\nour thoughts lie deeply, though often misunderstood. It takes deep thoughts to understand the\ndepths of the message of divine truth. For this reason the brethren can hear God speak, and\nthose whose hearts God has touched can find their way easily to the hearts of others.\n<\/p><p>\nTRUE TO REVEALED WORD\n<\/p><p>\nIn the difficult times that surround us today, the brethren holding the priesthood of God must,\nabove all things, be true to the word of God as revealed by the Master <i>and as revealed today.<\/i>\nThe words of truth are ever the same. Love, joy, peace, faith, humility: these are the\ncharacteristic Christian ideas. How beautiful are the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith when\nhe said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might,\nmind, and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify him for the\nwork.\n<\/p><p>\nRemember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness,\ncharity, humility, diligence (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12589\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12589)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12589)\">D&amp;C 4:2,5-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHerein is the Prophet conveying the charm of his teachings and an heroic conception of the\ngood in life. His concept of the Christian virtues and graces is noble and comprehensive. He\nexalted and glorified the principles of morals as given by the Savior of the world, and aroused\nthe adoration of men for the gospel which is the only road to peace. It is the mission of the\nSeventies and all who hold the priesthood to stimulate healthy and majestic ideals through\nself-discipline and the knowledge that in \"pure religion and undefiled\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26075\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26075)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26075)\">James 1:27<\/a><\/span>), is life eternal.\n<\/p><p>\nA testimony, my brethren, of the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ is a sacred trust. It\ncan come only to one who has opened his heart and mind to hallowed living with earnest\nprayer and deep faith in the Living God. It is the most divine gift of all. \"For it is faith and\nnot wisdom which carrieth the key to the kingdom of heaven,\" says Sholem Asch.\n<\/p><p>\nSir Francis Drake in admonishing his men, said:\n<\/p><p>\nMen pass away, but people abide. See that ye hold fast the heritage we leave you, yea, and\nteach your children its value, that never in the coming centuries their hearts may fail them, or\ntheir hands grow weak. Hitherto we have been too much afraid. Henceforth, we will fear only\nGod.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
