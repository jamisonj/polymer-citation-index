Oh, to be sure, I don\u2019t sit in the choir seats because I don\u2019t sing well enough, but I do sit here below and silently sing along with them because their music is so beautiful. A line from one of their numbers that we all love is, \u201cAs I have loved you, love one another.\u201d May I talk about this for a few minutes today\u2014the love of God and loving one another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/love-one-another.p4\" class=\"\">A little story given by one of your missionary sons in Italy a few weeks ago brought this clearly into focus for me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/love-one-another.p5\" class=\"\">He recounted that one morning a poor little crippled boy in ragged clothes and badly worn shoes came to a busy street corner and went from person to person, begging for a few lira without success.

At its center is the reality of a literal Father in Heaven whose love for His children knows no bounds. All truths, wisdom, power, goodness, and love He desires to share with His children, whom He created and sent to earth. He would have us reach up and know Him as a Father, as one who forgives, as a helper, as friend, as lawgiver\u2014as one anxious to grant to every man the full opportunity of His love and potential and ultimately the blessing to one day become like Him. This love from Father in Heaven and its effects upon <span class=\"emphasis\">one<\/span> of His children or the whole world is miraculous and contagious. He is constantly and everlastingly watching over us to lovingly and gently nudge us along.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/love-one-another.p8\" class=\"\">He reaches down, through His Son; through prayer, His spirit, His prophets; and through His commandments to express His love and concern and provide His guidance and discipline to everyone who will listen.

To help us understand their importance, He revealed and surrounded them in sacred and holy settings. Who does not remember how the Ten Commandments were given? Men have constantly changed these commandments, but we testify to the world, they have been restored on this earth through a prophet of God because they are essential, eternal truths and if altered by man, lose their power. We testify to the world that these laws\u2014commandments\u2014standards\u2014are one of the highest manifestations of the love God has for His children. Yes, they are commandments\u2014absolutes\u2014to plant the seeds of God\u2019s love, His ways, and His divinity in us. They are the fountainhead of all real security, and the inner man recognizes this instinctively and rejoices.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/love-one-another.p10\" class=\"\">This same loving God also \u201cso loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29059\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29059)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29059)\">John 3:16<\/a><\/span>) to perform a myriad of blessings for all mankind, including the offering of His own life to atone for man.

There is a newness of life\u2014a spiritual awakening\u2014that comes to man, its own witness that it is true. It is never forced or brought about by fear, but rather by a bond of love that develops between our Father in Heaven and His children. It is no wonder that we are counseled to look to God and live. This love reaches deep into the inner man, removes barriers, and causes an open spirit to emerge to be receptive to truth, goodness, and change. As it develops in man, he is turned outward toward others\u2014gradually overcoming himself. When we humbly seek our Father in Heaven by prayer, and by learning and keeping His commandments, He transfers to us His love and many of His powers. Thousands bear witness that His words \u201cIf ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29093\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29093)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29093)\">John 15:10<\/a><\/span>) are true. We then, as the Savior said, begin to attach ourselves as branches to the \u201ctrue vine\u201d and receive the same strength and power and can expect the same fruit.

After a stake conference I was asked to bless a little child. A couple was ushered into a room, and I learned that day what the love of God really was. They had adopted six or seven abandoned, physically handicapped little children who would need their love and care the rest of their lives. I felt humble in their presence, and the love of God filled that room that day. They were no more strangers to God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/love-one-another.p14\" class=\"\">As man perceives this love, he begins to overlook the flaws that make up every mortal being and to \u201cesteem his brother as himself.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17588\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17588)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17588)\">D&amp;C 38:24<\/a><\/span>.)
