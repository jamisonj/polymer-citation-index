I received this Nephite\nrecord with thanksgiving and applied myself to the task which had been assigned to me.\nThere are certain passages that have been stamped upon my mind, and I have never forgotten\nthem. One of these is in the 27th chapter of 3rd Nephi, verses 19 and 20. It is the word of\nour Redeemer to the Nephites as he taught them after his resurrection. It is as follows:\n<\/p><p>\n\"And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest\nsave it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the\nrepentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be\nbaptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye\nmay stand spotless before me at the last day\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5680\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5680)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5680)\">3 Ne. 27:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe other passage is in the 10th verse of chapter 41 in the book of Alma and is as follows:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored\nfrom sin to happiness. Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9045\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9045)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9045)\">Alma 41:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Fundamental Teachings of the Prophets<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThese two passages I have tried to follow all the days of my life, and I have felt to thank the\nLord for this counsel and guidance, and I have endeavored to stamp these sayings on the\nminds of many others. What a wonderful guide these teachings can be to us if we can get\nthem firmly fixed in our minds! These thoughts are of course not peculiar to the Book of\nMormon. They are fundamental teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ and have been\nexpressed many times by the prophets of old and our Redeemer when they were upon the\nearth. It is a fact beyond successful dispute that no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of\nGod and obtain what is known as eternal life. This is to say that the Redeemer of this world,\nthrough the great sacrifice which he made, opened the graves and restored all mortal things,\nboth mankind, fowls of the air, fishes of the sea, and every creature that partook of death\nthrough the \"fall\" of Adam. In the 5th chapter of John, verses 28 and 29, we have the definite\nstatement of our Redeemer proclaiming this truth as follows:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear\nhis voice,\n<\/p><p>\n\"And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that\nhave done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28113\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28113)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28113)\">John 5:28-29<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Old Things Shall Pass Away\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nPermit me to quote some other passages of scripture from the revelations that have come to us\nby divine decree in this dispensation. This is from the Doctrine and Covenants, section 29,\nverses 22 to 25:\n<\/p><p>\n\"And again verily, verily, I say unto you that when the thousand years are ended, and men\nagain begin to deny their God, then will I spare the earth but for a little season;\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the end shall come, and the heaven and the earth shall be consumed and pass away, and\nthere shall be a new heaven and a new earth.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For all old things shall pass away, and all things shall become new, even the heaven and the\nearth, and all the fulness thereof, both men and beasts, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of\nthe sea;\n<\/p><p>\n\"And not one hair, neither mote, shall be lost, for it is the workmanship of mine hand\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14383\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14383)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14383)\">D&amp;C 29:22-25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAgain the Lord spoke to the Prophet Joseph Smith in a revelation in answer to the question:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Q. What are we to understand by the four beasts, spoken of in the same verse (see\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42362\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42362)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42362)\">Rev. 4:6<\/a><\/span>)?\n<\/p><p>\n\"A. They are figurative expressions, used by the Revelator, John, in describing heaven, the\nparadise of God, the happiness of man, and of beasts, and of creeping things, and of the fowls\nof the air; that which is spiritual being in the likeness of that which is temporal; and that\nwhich is temporal in the likeness of that which is spiritual; the spirit of man in the likeness of\nhis person, as also the spirit of the beast, and every other creature which God has created\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14420\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14420)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14420)\">D&amp;C 77:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Resurrection A Complete Restoration<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a strange doctrine in the world concerning the resurrection even among those who\nbelieve there will be a reuniting of the spirit and body, which is to the effect that only the\nrighteous will come forth to receive rewards of exaltation. This, however, is a\nmisunderstanding. Through the atonement wrought by the Son of God, our Savior, the\nresurrection is a complete restoration of all things mortal, even of this earth itself on which\nwe stand. The earth is to be purified and become the abode of the righteous. Peter understood\nthis doctrine and in his second epistle made the following statement:\n<\/p><p>\n\"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass\naway with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the\nworks that are therein shall be burned up.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in\nall holy conversation and godliness,\n<\/p><p>\n\"Looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on\nfire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein\ndwelleth righteousness\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4882\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4882)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4882)\">2 Pet. 3:10-13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Earth to Receive Resurrection from Mortality<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nLet us not misunderstand this expression. The new heaven and new earth will be the same\nheaven and the same earth on which we now sojourn, for this earth is to receive the\nresurrection after this day of mortality and be the abode of the righteous in eternity. Without\nthe revelations of the Lord given to men, this truth would not be made known. Neither would\nwe have knowledge of the final glory to which this earth will be assigned. Even now, where\nmen are without divine guidance and revelation, this truth is unknown.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Darkness Covered the Earth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI am very grateful to my Father in heaven for the privilege that has been granted to me to\ncome into this world in this dispensation when once again the fulness of the gospel has been\nrevealed. I have been grateful and have thanked the Lord many times for the privilege which\ncame to me to live in the present dispensation and that I was not born two or three hundred\nyears ago during the great period when the fulness of the gospel was not had among men and\nthey were running, as the scriptures say, \"to and fro\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10430\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10430)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10430)\">Amos 8:12<\/a><\/span>)\nseeking for the truth which could not be\nfound because of the deep spiritual darkness which covered the entire earth. This condition\nwas not the fault of the Lord but the fault of mankind, for they had been offered the fulness\nof the gospel, but in course of time they refused to have it, and their teachers turned away\nand caused to enter into the Church false doctrines and false ordinances and, worse than all, a\nfalse conception in relation to God our Eternal Father and his Son Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was a day when there was not one left in mortality with the divine power to officiate in the\nvital and saving ordinances of the gospel&mdash;a day when false teachings, false ordinances, and\nfalse instructors came upon the scene. This condition left the entire Christian world in a state\nof confusion, without divine inspiration, so that the notion prevailed universally that the\nheavens were closed. Contact with the Father and his Beloved Son had ceased, and the angels\nfor a long, long past had ceased to visit mortal man on the face of the earth. Under such\nconditions it was a natural thought encouraged by clergy that our Eternal Father had ceased to\ncommune with his children on the earth. Moreover, the false notion became prevalent that\nmortal man was left with the teachings of the Bible and that it contained all of the revelation\nthat mankind needed to insure his salvation in the kingdom of God. Under such conditions\nand practice no doubt Satan rejoiced; false teachers arose, and the people, no matter how\ndevout they were, found themselves in spiritual darkness. Moreover, for a long time the edict\nwent forth that mortal men who had not been prepared for the clergy should not seek for\nknowledge or search the scriptures, for this was the sole responsibility of the clergy.\nTherefore I am exceedingly grateful for the Prophet Joseph Smith and the coming of the\nFather and the Son to him and their directing him in the course he should take. Moreover, I\nam thankful that the time came for the restoration of divine truth and the power of the Holy\nPriesthood so that the inhabitants of the world could find the path to eternal life, and the\nordinances of the Holy Priesthood could again be exercised in behalf of the salvation of all\nmankind.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Plan of Salvation Heaven's Gift to Mankind<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOn January 22, 1834, the Prophet Joseph Smith said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"The great plan of salvation is a theme which ought to occupy our strict attention, and be\nregarded as one of heaven's best gifts to mankind. No consideration whatever ought to deter\nus from showing ourselves approved in the sight of God, according to His divine requirement.\nMen not infrequently forget that they are dependent upon heaven for every blessing which\nthey are permitted to enjoy, and that for every opportunity granted them they are to give an\naccount. You know, brethren, that when the Master in the Savior's parable of the stewards\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35401\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35401)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35401)\">Matt. 25:14-30<\/a><\/span>)\ncalled his servants before him he gave them several talents to improve on while he should\ntarry abroad for a little season, and when he returned he called for an accounting. So it is\nnow. Our Master is absent only for a little season, and at the end of it He will call each to\nrender an account; and where the five talents were bestowed, ten will be required; and he that\nhas made no improvement will be cast out as an unprofitable servant, while the faithful will\nenjoy everlasting honors. Therefore we earnestly implore the grace of our Father to rest upon\nyou, through Jesus Christ His Son, that you may not faint in the hour of temptation, nor be\novercome in the time of persecution.\" (<i>DHC<\/i> 2, 23-24.)\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to quote a few remarks of divine truth from the lips of President David O.\nMcKay, taken from <i>Gospel Ideals<\/i>, p. 383.\n<\/p><p>\n\"No man can disobey the word of God and not suffer for so doing. No sin, however secret,\ncan escape retribution. True, you may lie and not be detected; you may violate virtue without\nit being known by any who would scandalize you; yet you cannot escape the judgment that\nfollows such transgression. The lie is lodged in the recesses of your mind, an impairment of\nyour character that will reflect sometime, somehow in your countenance or bearing. Your\nmoral turpitude, though only you, your accomplice, and God may ever know it, will canker\nyour soul.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI will close my remarks by reading a poem which I think is very appropriate, entitled \"The\nGuy in the Mirror.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhen you get what you want in your\n       struggle for self,<br \/>\n    And the world makes you king for a day,<br \/>\n    Then go to the mirror and look at\n       yourself<br \/>\n    And see what that guy has to say.\n<\/p><p>\nFor it isn't a man's father, or mother,\n       or wife,<br \/>\n    Whose judgment upon him must pass;<br \/>\n    The feller whose verdict counts most in\n      his life<br \/>\n    Is the guy staring back from the glass.\n<\/p><p>\nHe's the feller to please, never mind all\n       the rest<br \/>\n    For he's with you clear up to the end.<br \/>\n    And you've passed your most dangerous,\n       difficult test,<br \/>\n    If the guy in the glass is your friend.\n<\/p><p>\nYou may be like Jack Horner and\n       'chisel' a plum,<br \/>\n    And think you're a wonderful guy,<br \/>\n    But the man in the glass says you're only\n       a bum,<br \/>\n    If you can't look him straight in the eye.\n<\/p><p>\nYou can fool the whole world down the\n       pathway of years,<br \/>\n    And get pats on the back as you pass,<br \/>\n    But your final reward will be heartaches\n       or tears<br \/>\n    If you've cheated the guy in the glass.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless you, my good brethren and sisters, and all, in the name of Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
