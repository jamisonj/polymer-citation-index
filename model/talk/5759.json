Furthermore, the widow had been prepared by the Lord for this request. But in her own weakened and dispirited condition, the prophet\u2019s last entreaty was more than this faithful little woman could bear. In her hunger and fatigue and motherly anguish she cried out to the stranger, \u201cAs the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks [which tells us how small her fire needed to be], that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/a-handful-of-meal-and-a-little-oil.p9\" class=\"\">But Elijah was on the Lord\u2019s errand.

The record says simply, \u201cAnd she went and did according to the saying of Elijah.\u201d Perhaps uncertain what the cost of her faith would be not only to herself but to her son as well, she first took her small loaf to Elijah, obviously trusting that if there were not enough bread left over, at least she and her son would have died in an act of pure charity.
