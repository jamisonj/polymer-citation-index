His influence is insidious and persistent.

My situation is different. I plan to be a great lawyer, or doctor, or athlete, or some other great person. Surely neither you nor the Lord would expect me to leave my studies at such an important time. A mission would interfere with my future plans.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/sanctification-through-missionary-service.p28\" class=\"\">Others are thinking, \u201cYes, I know about missions, but if you had a girl friend like mine, you\u2019d never leave her.

I just got this job. I just purchased a car and a stereo. It\u2019s just the time of life when I\u2019m starting to get things together for myself. I can\u2019t drop all that now.

I have fallen into transgression and am not participating in the Church. I had always planned on being a missionary, but I slipped and now I don\u2019t live the standards required of a missionary.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/sanctification-through-missionary-service.p31\" class=\"\">If I could listen to you separately, each case would unfold with one thing in common.

They have made plans for your future, and those plans do not include missionary service. They say, \u201cMy son is going to be a great lawyer or doctor or star athlete. He can\u2019t interrupt his studies to go gallivanting out in the world for two years. Let someone else\u2019s sons do that.

What right do you have to match your wisdom with that of God, who through His prophets has issued a firm decree, a solemn mandate, that the restored gospel must be declared to all the world by the voice of His disciples?

Many of you say, \u201cWhat will I ever do if he leaves me?\u201d You hold him back. You allow your association with him to go beyond where it should.
