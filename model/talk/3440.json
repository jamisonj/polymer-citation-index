That was a signal honor for a grandfather, and I know Robbie couldn\u2019t have been more proud of it than I was. Since that time, I have considered very much what I would like to say to Robbie concerning this honor that has come into his life and how desirous I am as his grandfather that he live worthy of what was promised him in the blessing that his father gave him under the inspiration of the Lord. So tonight I would like to address my remarks to Robbie and to all this grand army of Aaronic Priesthood who sit here in front of me and are listening throughout the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/to-the-young-men-of-the-church.p4\" class=\"\">While serving as a mission president it was my great privilege and responsibility to interview every missionary as he began his mission. That was always a great experience, but it sometimes gave me insights into the backgrounds of my missionaries that shocked me. One elder told me of his growing up in a small farming community as the son of the town drunkard. When, as a newly called missionary, he boarded the bus to come to Salt Lake City to enter the mission home, his father was there to bid him farewell. He must have been drunk, for his last words to his son were, \u201cSon, you will never amount to a hill of beans.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/to-the-young-men-of-the-church.p5\" class=\"\">As I talked with my missionary, I could sense that he had heard that phrase over and over again throughout his young life: \u201cYou will never amount to a hill of beans.\u201d And that choice young man, called by the Lord to be his representative, believed it. I resolved to prove that father wrong by seeing that the missionary had a successful mission. I assigned him to a great first companion and watched his progress with keen interest and daily prayers. And progress he did.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/to-the-young-men-of-the-church.p6\" class=\"\">As my release date approached, I made a final tour of the mission to say good-bye to my beloved fellow workers. By this time the young man was a zone leader, a very important calling in the mission field. He conducted that zone conference like a veteran bishop. I saw the deep bond of love that had developed between him and his missionaries. I thought of the scores of converts who had joined the Church through his devoted service and the power of his testimony. At an appropriate moment in the conference I stood beside him with my arm around him and said, with a lump in my throat, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe this, but someone once said of this young man that he would never amount to a hill of beans.\u201d He turned and looked me in the eye and responded, \u201cWe sure showed him, didn\u2019t we, President?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/to-the-young-men-of-the-church.p7\" class=\"\">What had occurred to bring about such a dramatic change in that elder\u2019s life\u2014to change him from a frightened little farm boy to a man of God? He had made some interesting discoveries that had prepared him to face the challenge of life and to be armed to succeed\u2014the same discoveries every young Latter-day Saint must make as he matures if he is to achieve his potential here and hereafter. He had discovered that he really was a son of God\u2014with the capacity to become as God is, with all of his power, his might, and his majesty. He knew the truth of Christ\u2019s oath: \u201cAll that my Father hath shall be given unto him\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17462\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17462)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17462)\">D&amp;C 84:38<\/a><\/span>).

The future of his Church is in your hands.

As he prepared for his mission he asked his parents\u2019 permission to invite twenty-five of his nonmember friends to come to the home for a farewell party. During that party the young missionary showed his friends <span class=\"emphasis\">Man\u2019s Search for Happiness,<\/span> explained why he was going on a mission for his church, and bore his testimony to them.

One of them, who had recently fallen into inactivity, had been persuaded to attend the conference by some strong-arm tactics of his friends, who would not let him fall away from the Church. Touched by the spirit of that youth conference and the love of his buddies, that inactive boy joined his four friends in pledging to one another that they would live righteous lives. Today he is serving a mission for the Lord, thankful for those companions who cared so much about him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/to-the-young-men-of-the-church.p12\" class=\"\">It is an interesting phenomenon, my young friends, how, as we serve, our capacity to serve grows and our opportunities for service expand.

True, lasting happiness comes in service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/to-the-young-men-of-the-church.p13\" class=\"\">My missionary had learned something about the magnificent power of the holy priesthood, which lifted him beyond his own natural capacity.

In Africa, the natives have a unique, effective way to capture monkeys. They lop the top off a coconut, remove the meat, and leave a hole in the top of the coconut large enough for the monkey to put his paw in. Then they anchor the coconut to the ground with some peanuts in it. When the natives leave, the monkeys, smelling those delicious peanuts, approach the coconuts, see the peanuts in them, put their paws in to grasp the nuts, and attempt to remove the nuts\u2014but find that the hole is too small for their doubled-up fists. The natives return with gunny sacks and pick up the monkeys\u2014clawing, biting, screaming\u2014but they won\u2019t drop the peanuts to save their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/to-the-young-men-of-the-church.p20\" class=\"\">Do you know anyone who is caught in a monkey trap, where the things that matter the most are at the mercy of those things that matter the least?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/to-the-young-men-of-the-church.p21\" class=\"\">I\u2019d like you to ponder that, my young brethren; then make certain you are not caught in like fashion by the siren songs of our society, by the mocking, the daring of so-called friends, or those insidious evils Satan will place in your path in attractive packages which turn out to be empty and hollow.
