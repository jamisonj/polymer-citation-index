One such example is found in the life of Joseph and his brothers. We will recall that Joseph was especially loved by his father, Jacob, which occasioned bitterness and jealousy on the part of his brothers. There followed the plot to slay him, which eventually placed Joseph in a pit without food and without water to sustain life. Upon the arrival of a passing caravan of merchants, Joseph\u2019s brothers determined to sell him rather than to leave him to die. Twenty pieces of silver extricated Joseph from the pit and placed him eventually in the house of Potiphar in the land of Egypt.

In the midst of this latter period, when the brothers of Joseph came to Egypt to buy corn, they were blessed by this favored man in Egypt\u2014even their own brother. Joseph could have dealt harshly with his brethren for the callous and cruel treatment he had earlier received from them.

I loved the replica of the entry to the Fourth Ward\u2014one of the original wards in the valley. I noted with keen interest the lighted map which plotted the pioneer trek from Nauvoo. However, my heart was truly touched when I gazed at an actual handcart displayed in a place of honor. The handcart communicated to me a silent yet eloquent account of its long and momentous journey.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/my-brothers-keeper.p16\" class=\"\">Let us for a moment join Captain Edward Martin and the handcart company he led. While we will not feel the pangs of hunger which they felt or experience the bitter cold that penetrated their weary bodies, we will emerge from our visit with a better appreciation of hardship borne, courage demonstrated, and faith fulfilled.

The strain was so terrible, the exposure so great, that in later years all the boys died from the effects of it. When President Brigham Young heard of this heroic act, he wept like a child, and later declared publicly, \u201cThat act alone will ensure C. Allen Huntington, George W. Grant, and David P.

He declared that on a cold winter morning, the street cleaning-crew of which he was a member was removing large chunks of ice from the street gutters. The regular crew was assisted by temporary laborers who desperately needed the work. One such wore only a lightweight sweater and was suffering from the cold. A slender man with a well-groomed beard stopped by the crew and asked the worker, \u201cYou need more than that sweater on a morning like this. Where is your coat?\u201d The man replied that he had no coat to wear. The visitor then removed his own overcoat, handed it to the man and said, \u201cThis coat is yours. It is heavy wool and will keep you warm. I just work across the street.\u201d The street was South Temple. The Good Samaritan who walked into the Church Administration Building to his daily work and without his coat was President George Albert Smith of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. His selfless act of generosity revealed his tender heart.

The messages and music in the dedicatory sessions lifted each heart heavenward and prompted the listener to keep the commandments of God and to emulate the example of righteous living taught by Jesus of Nazareth. Thoughts of self yielded to consideration for others.

I raised up, crying and a bit shaken, and related my story and the predicament I was in then. They listened carefully and patiently to my nearly incoherent ramblings, and then they took charge. They must have been prominent citizens. They spoke with the restaurant manager, then told me I could have all I wanted to eat there for five days. They took me next door to the hotel desk and got me a room for five days. Then they drove me to a clinic and saw that I was provided with the medications I needed\u2014truly my basic lifeline to sanity and comfort.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/my-brothers-keeper.p35\" class=\"\">\u201cWhile I was recuperating and building my strength, I made it a point to attend the daily Tabernacle organ recitals.

He was serving as a newly called bishop when \u201cDouglas,\u201d a member of his ward, transgressed and was deprived of his Church membership. Father was saddened; Mother was totally devastated. Douglas soon thereafter moved from the state.

He concluded with the question, \u201cWho has the responsibility to work with Douglas and bring him back to Church membership?\u201d Gil advised me later that my response to his question was direct and given without hesitation: \u201cIt is your responsibility, Gil, for you were his bishop, and he knew you cared.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/my-brothers-keeper.p44\" class=\"\">Unbeknownst to Gil Warner, Douglas\u2019s mother had, the previous week, fasted and prayed that a man would be raised up to help save her son.
