By so doing they were no longer in a state of innocence. They began to experience principles of opposition. They began to encounter sickness that weakened their health. They began to feel sadness as well as joy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/make-the-exercise-of-faith-your-first-priority.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">Through Adam and Eve\u2019s partaking of the forbidden fruit, knowledge of good and evil was introduced into the world.

When these tools become fundamental habits, they provide the easiest way to find peace in the challenges of mortality. Today I have chosen to discuss four of these tools. As I speak, consider evaluating your personal use of each tool; then seek the guidance of the Lord to determine how you could make better use of each one of them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"topic\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Prayer<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/make-the-exercise-of-faith-your-first-priority.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">The first tool is prayer. Choose to converse with your Father in Heaven often. Make time every day to share your thoughts and feelings with Him. Tell Him everything that concerns you. He is interested in the most important as well as the most mundane facets of your life. Share with Him your full range of feelings and experiences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/make-the-exercise-of-faith-your-first-priority.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">Because He respects your agency, Father in Heaven will never force you to pray to Him. But as you exercise that agency and include Him in every aspect of your daily life, your heart will begin to fill with peace, buoyant peace. That peace will focus an eternal light on your struggles. It will help you to manage those challenges from an eternal perspective.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/make-the-exercise-of-faith-your-first-priority.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">Parents, help safeguard your children by arming them morning and night with the power of family prayer. Children are bombarded every day with the evils of lust, greed, pride, and a host of other sinful behaviors. Protect your children from daily worldly influences by fortifying them with the powerful blessings that result from family prayer. Family prayer should be a nonnegotiable priority in your daily life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"topic\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Scripture Study<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/make-the-exercise-of-faith-your-first-priority.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">The second tool is to study the word of God in the scriptures and the words of the living prophets. We talk to God through prayer. He most often communicates back to us through His written word. To know what the voice of the Divine sounds and feels like, read His words, study the scriptures, and ponder them.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-10911_000_036\">5<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130389\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130389)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130389)\">Doctrine and Covenants 18:36<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130390\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130390)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130390)\">verses 34\u201335<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Make them an integral part of everyday life.

Choose to take time to study them. Feasting on the word of God each day is more important than sleep, school, work, television shows, video games, or social media. You may need to reorganize your priorities to provide time for the study of the word of God. If so, do it!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/make-the-exercise-of-faith-your-first-priority.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">There are many prophetic promises of the blessings of daily studying the scriptures.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-10911_000_036\">6<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Some examples include: President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson said: \u201cAs we read and ponder the scriptures, we will experience the sweet whisperings of the Spirit to our souls. We can find answers to our questions. We learn of the blessings which come through keeping God\u2019s commandments. We gain a sure testimony of our Heavenly Father and our Savior, Jesus Christ, and of Their love for us. When scripture study is combined with our prayers, we can of a certainty know that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. \u2026 As we remember prayer and take time to turn to the scriptures, our lives will be infinitely more blessed and our burdens will be made lighter\u201d (\u201cWe Never Walk Alone,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> or <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Nov. 2013, 122). President Gordon\u00a0B. Hinckley said: \u201cWithout reservation I promise you that if each of you will observe this simple program, regardless of how many times you previously may have read the Book of Mormon, there will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God\u201d (\u201cA Testimony Vibrant and True,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> or <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Aug. 2005, 6). President Howard\u00a0W. Hunter said: \u201cFamilies are greatly blessed when wise fathers and mothers bring their children about them, read from the pages of the scriptural library together, and then discuss freely the beautiful stories and thoughts according to the understanding of all. Often youth and little ones have amazing insight into and appreciation for the basic literature of religion\u201d (\u201cReading the Scriptures,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1979, 64). President Ezra Taft Benson said: \u201cOften we spend great effort in trying to increase the activity levels in our stakes. We work diligently to raise the percentages of those attending sacrament meetings. We labor to get a higher percentage of our young men on missions. We strive to improve the numbers of those marrying in the temple. All of these are commendable efforts and important to the growth of the kingdom. But when individual members and families immerse themselves in the scriptures regularly and consistently, these other areas of activity will automatically come. Testimonies will increase. Commitment will be strengthened. Families will be fortified. Personal revelation will flow\u201d (\u201cThe Power of the Word,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1986, 81). President Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball declared: \u201cI find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns. I find myself loving more intensely those whom I must love with all my heart and mind and strength, and loving them more, I find it easier to abide their counsel\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball<\/span> [2006], 67). President Marion\u00a0G. Romney said: \u201cI feel certain that if, in our homes, parents will read from the Book of Mormon prayerfully and regularly, both by themselves and with their children, the spirit of that great book will come to permeate our homes and all who dwell therein. The spirit of reverence will increase; mutual respect and consideration for each other will grow. The spirit of contention will depart. Parents will counsel their children in greater love and wisdom. Children will be more responsive and submissive to the counsel of their parents. Righteousness will increase. Faith, hope, and charity\u2014the pure love of Christ\u2014will abound in our homes and lives, bringing in their wake peace, joy, and happiness\u201d (\u201cThe Book of Mormon,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1980, 67). President Boyd\u00a0K. Packer said: \u201cTrue doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior.

Elder David\u00a0A. Bednar said: \u201cEach family prayer, each episode of family scripture study, and each family home evening is a brushstroke on the canvas of our souls.

Be cautious not to make your family home evening just an afterthought of a busy day. Decide that on Monday night your family will be together at home for the evening. Do not let employment demands, sports, extracurricular activities, homework, or anything else become more important than that time you spend together at home with your family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/make-the-exercise-of-faith-your-first-priority.p24\" class=\"\" id=\"p24\">The structure of your evening is not as important as the time invested. The gospel should be taught both formally and informally. Make it a meaningful experience for each member of the family.

The things that we must do and not do to be worthy of a temple recommend are the very things that ensure we will be happy as individuals and as families. Let us be a temple-attending people.

Monson said: \u201cAs we read and ponder the scriptures, we will experience the sweet whisperings of the Spirit to our souls. We can find answers to our questions. We learn of the blessings which come through keeping God\u2019s commandments. We gain a sure testimony of our Heavenly Father and our Savior, Jesus Christ, and of Their love for us. When scripture study is combined with our prayers, we can of a certainty know that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. \u2026 As we remember prayer and take time to turn to the scriptures, our lives will be infinitely more blessed and our burdens will be made lighter\u201d (\u201cWe Never Walk Alone,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> or <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Nov. 2013, 122).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>President Gordon\u00a0B. Hinckley said: \u201cWithout reservation I promise you that if each of you will observe this simple program, regardless of how many times you previously may have read the Book of Mormon, there will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God\u201d (\u201cA Testimony Vibrant and True,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> or <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Aug. 2005, 6).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>President Howard\u00a0W. Hunter said: \u201cFamilies are greatly blessed when wise fathers and mothers bring their children about them, read from the pages of the scriptural library together, and then discuss freely the beautiful stories and thoughts according to the understanding of all. Often youth and little ones have amazing insight into and appreciation for the basic literature of religion\u201d (\u201cReading the Scriptures,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1979, 64).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>President Ezra Taft Benson said: \u201cOften we spend great effort in trying to increase the activity levels in our stakes. We work diligently to raise the percentages of those attending sacrament meetings. We labor to get a higher percentage of our young men on missions. We strive to improve the numbers of those marrying in the temple. All of these are commendable efforts and important to the growth of the kingdom. But when individual members and families immerse themselves in the scriptures regularly and consistently, these other areas of activity will automatically come. Testimonies will increase. Commitment will be strengthened. Families will be fortified. Personal revelation will flow\u201d (\u201cThe Power of the Word,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1986, 81).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>President Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball declared: \u201cI find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns. I find myself loving more intensely those whom I must love with all my heart and mind and strength, and loving them more, I find it easier to abide their counsel\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball<\/span> [2006], 67).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>President Marion\u00a0G. Romney said: \u201cI feel certain that if, in our homes, parents will read from the Book of Mormon prayerfully and regularly, both by themselves and with their children, the spirit of that great book will come to permeate our homes and all who dwell therein. The spirit of reverence will increase; mutual respect and consideration for each other will grow. The spirit of contention will depart. Parents will counsel their children in greater love and wisdom. Children will be more responsive and submissive to the counsel of their parents. Righteousness will increase. Faith, hope, and charity\u2014the pure love of Christ\u2014will abound in our homes and lives, bringing in their wake peace, joy, and happiness\u201d (\u201cThe Book of Mormon,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1980, 67).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>President Boyd\u00a0K.
