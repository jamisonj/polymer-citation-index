What began a few years ago as a few crude picture magazines that startled sensitive people has grown to hundreds of publications, each seeking to outdo the others with increasingly shocking content.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p8\" class=\"\">So-called \u201cadult\u201d bookstores, selling materials that appeal to the prurient mind, are now open in nearly every city. Obscene materials once available only by mail and in a plain brown wrapper now are prominently displayed on the magazine racks of many local convenience stores and other business establishments where they are readily accessible to the young and the old alike.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p9\" class=\"\">Theaters showing X-rated films and worse have become established in most cities. It is reported that one particularly offensive movie, filmed at a cost of forty thousand dollars, has earned revenues of over six hundred million dollars.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p10\" class=\"\">It should come as no surprise that grand juries have found that 90 percent of all pornography is dominated by organized crime. Large profits from one project become a source of funds for still larger and more sophisticated enterprises as a growing tidal wave of smut dashes against the weakening bulwarks of morality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p11\" class=\"\">New technologies that can bless our lives in so many positive ways are also being used to spread pornographic corruption. Video recorders now can bring to homes great classics of music, history, art, and drama. But they also bring into some of these same homes lurid portrayals of debauchery that contaminate those who view them and extend their corrupting influence to our communities and society.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p12\" class=\"\">Cable television and satellite transmissions, with their powerful capacity for good, are not only being used, but are also being abused. State and national laws necessary to govern their proper use are not yet established, and they are almost totally unregulated. Greedy men have been ready to exploit this vacuum in legal regulation without regard for the consequence to its victims.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p13\" class=\"\">Some may ask \u201cWhat is pornography?\u201d It was United States Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart who said that while he could not exactly define pornography, \u201cI know it when I see it,\u201d he said. (Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378-U.S. 184, 1964.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p14\" class=\"\">Pornography is not a victimless crime. Who are its victims? First, those who either intentionally, or sometimes involuntarily, are exposed to it. Pornography is addictive. (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> March 1984, pp. 32\u201339.) What may begin as a curious exploration can become a controlling habit. Studies show that those who allow themselves to become drawn to pornography soon begin to crave even coarser content. Continued exposure desensitizes the spirit and can erode the conscience of unwary people. A victim becomes a slave to carnal thoughts and actions. As the thought is father to the deed, exposure can lead to acting out what is nurtured in the mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p15\" class=\"\">But there are other victims. Crimes of violence have increased in the United States at up to five times the rate of population growth. A 1983 University of New Hampshire study found that states having the highest readership of pornographic magazines also have the highest number of reported rapes. Pornography degrades and exploits men, and women, and children in a most ugly and corrupt fashion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p16\" class=\"\">Perhaps the greatest tragedy of all is in the lives of children who become its victims. The saddest trend of our day is the alarming, large increase in child abuse. Much of it occurs within families and involves corrupting the divine innocence that children have from birth. We sing, as we did this morning, \u201cI am a child of God, and he has sent me here. \u2026 Lead me, guide me, walk beside me, help me find the way [that I might] live with him some day\u201d are part of those words (\u201cI Am a Child of God,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Sing With Me,<\/span> B-76.) The Savior reserved His harshest condemnation for those who would offend little children. He said: \u201cTake heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for \u2026 it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37018\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37018)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37018)\">Matt. 18:10, 14<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p17\" class=\"\">The Lord further commanded: \u201cNeither commit adultery \u2026 nor do anything like unto it.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18124\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18124)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18124)\">D&amp;C 59:6<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cThe early apostles and prophets [warned against] sins that are reprehensible \u2026 \u2014adultery \u2026 infidelity \u2026 impurity, inordinate affection \u2026 sexual relations outside of marriage \u2026 sex perversion \u2026 preoccupation with sex in one\u2019s thoughts. \u2026 And one of the worst of these [sins] is incest \u2026 [or] sexual [relations] between persons so closely related that they are forbidden by law to marry.\u201d (Spencer W. Kimball, <span class=\"emphasis\">President Kimball Speaks Out,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1981, p. 6.) Incest is an ugly sin, and this sin particularly may irreparably damage its innocent victims.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p19\" class=\"\">Yet, what impels these offenders to such terrible deeds? Police report that some 80 percent of those who molest young boys and girls admitted modeling their attacks on pornography they had viewed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p20\" class=\"\">How has this evil gained such a foothold in our society? Have we ignored the warnings of our Church leaders? President Kimball declared: \u201cSo long as men are corrupt and revel in sewer filth, entertainers will sell them what they want. Laws may be passed, arrests may be made, lawyers may argue, courts may sentence \u2026 men of corrupt minds, but pornography and \u2026 insults to decency will never cease until men have cleansed their minds.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p21\" class=\"\">Continuing, President Kimball said, \u201cWhen \u2026 [man] is sick and tired of being drowned in filth, \u2026 he will not pay for that filth and its source will dry up.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cHence it is obvious,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat to remain clean and worthy, one must stay positively and conclusively away from the devil\u2019s territory, avoiding the least approach toward evil. Satan leaves his fingerprints.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Miracle of Forgiveness,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969, pp. 229, 232.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p23\" class=\"\">This growing presence of obscenity has been aided by the lowering of media standards for advertising, by relaxed movie ratings, by television soap operas and situation comedies that use their powerful voices to justify, glamorize, and encourage sexual relations outside of marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p24\" class=\"\">Perhaps we have been intimidated by those who claim that producing, distributing, and using obscene materials is a basic right to be defended. This is not true. Even under the divinely inspired constitutional principles of this land, obscenity is not condoned nor protected. The United States Supreme Court has clearly held that criminal prosecution of those who produce and distribute obscene materials does not violate their First Amendment rights. (Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 1973.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p25\" class=\"\">This spreading evil has been aided by a failure to enforce laws designed to prohibit or regulate it. Although some additional legislation may be helpful, those who have been fighting the discouraging battle against pornography in recent years are in agreement that nearly 90 percent of all obscene materials could be eliminated from our communities if existing obscenity laws were strictly enforced. A few courageous cities have performed outstanding service by ridding themselves of X-rated theaters and so-called \u201cadult\u201d bookstores, and by limiting access to hard-core pornographic books and magazines. The citizens of Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, formed a citizen action group and determined that they were not going to allow such degrading material in their community. They closed an adult bookshop and a large distribution warehouse, and, as a result of their determined citizens\u2019 organization and involvement, they have had enacted a city public nuisance ordinance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p26\" class=\"\">Lawmaking bodies will listen to effectively organized citizens. However, too often the trend is tragically toward citizen apathy and a sense of futility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p27\" class=\"\">And who is to blame? We could conveniently point the accusing finger at public prosecutors who are not vigorously enforcing the law. But we need men and women of courage and conviction in these offices of public trust if the awful tide is to be stemmed. But as one accusing finger is pointing toward those who make or enforce the law, another may point to ourselves, who may be equally to blame.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p28\" class=\"\">Fortunately, what is deemed legally obscene is partially determined by local community standards. We as citizens, by our own standards, are the ones who can help establish what offensive materials are\u2014which ones are legally obscene\u2014and cannot claim protection from the law.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p29\" class=\"\">Unfortunately, many people assume that even hard-core pornography is legal because it is so prevalent. But that is not true. Some public prosecutors may excuse themselves from seeking enforcement of obscenity laws by explaining that community standards determine what is obscene. They therefore conclude that because the community tolerates such material, its presence must reflect the accepted community standard. Concerned citizens\u2014you and I\u2014can change this misunderstanding.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p30\" class=\"\">What, then, is needed to reverse this ominous insult to ourselves, our families, and our communities? Only when men and women concerned for their families and communities let their voices and their influence be felt in thoughtful, rational ways will we alter the destructive course on which we are traveling. Silent indignation may be misinterpreted as approval. Irrational action may be ineffective because it is regarded as prudish rather than thoughtful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p31\" class=\"\">Albert Camus wrote: \u201cBy your actions or your silence, you, too, enter the fray.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p32\" class=\"\">May I suggest a few things we could do to halt this deadly evil.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/personal-morality.p33\" class=\"\">First, let each of us resolve this day to keep our minds, our bodies, and our spirits free from the corrupting influence of pornography, including everything that is obscene and indecent. Let it have no place in our homes, our minds, or our hearts. The psalmist David wrote, \u201cWho shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?
