One is the great, great gratitude we have for those who are operating and administering the welfare program. A second thing is to say that, as President Romney has indicated, there is still much to do: greater efficiency and more application to our basic problems. And third, I would like to say I wish our enemies could have seen this program this morning and seen the wide variety of help and assistance and succor that could be given to the people of this world. And then I wish they could have listened to what President Romney has said, and all the other speakers. We are doing a great service; and it would please us if they would go and do likewise rather than criticize our efforts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/there-is-still-much-to-do.p5\" class=\"\">God bless all of you who are deeply engaged in this program. And if it isn\u2019t quite up to par, bring it there, will you?\u2014in every ward and branch and stake and mission. And let us come nearer to the accomplishment of what the Lord has given us to do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/there-is-still-much-to-do.p6\" class=\"\">I leave my blessings, the blessings of the Lord, upon you as you go back to your areas and carry forward this great work, in the name of Jesus Christ.
