To pass the sacrament was a privilege, and to gather fast offerings a sacred trust. I was set apart as the secretary of the deacons quorum and, at that moment, felt that boyhood had passed and young manhood had begun.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-trust.p5\" class=\"\">Can you young men realize the shock I felt, while attending an officers\u2019 meeting of our ward conference, when a member of the stake presidency, after calling upon the priesthood and auxiliary leaders to speak, without warning read my name and office, inviting me to give an account of my stewardship and to express my feelings regarding my calling as secretary of the deacons quorum and thus a ward officer. I don\u2019t recall what I said, but a sense of responsibility engulfed me, never to depart thereafter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-trust.p6\" class=\"\">I sincerely hope that each deacon, teacher, and priest is aware of the significance of his priesthood ordination and the privilege which is his to fulfill a vital role in the life of every member through his participation in administration and passing of the sacrament each Sunday.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-trust.p7\" class=\"\">At the time I held the Aaronic Priesthood, it seemed we always sang the same hymns during the opening exercises of priesthood meeting.

Sister Heaton called Brother Smith one Sunday morning and mentioned that her husband was ill and unable to attend priesthood meeting. Brother Smith reported this to the brethren assembled that morning and asked the brother who was to offer the invocation to remember Bishop Israel Heaton in the prayer. Then he announced that the opening hymn would be \u201cIsrael, Israel, God Is Calling.\u201d I suppose the smiles outnumbered any frowns.

He mentioned that he and his counselors met to discuss what the stake members most needed and which principles of the gospel the stake presidency should stress. Their opinions varied from sacrament meeting attendance to observance of the Sabbath day, with a lot of territory in between. At length they agreed that the principle most needed was spirituality. They appreciated the truth found in the observation: <span class=\"emphasis\">When one deals in generalities, he will rarely have a success; but when he deals in specifics, he will rarely have a failure.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-trust.p17\" class=\"\">The four-year plan of President Christiansen and his counselors was refined in a splendid fashion. <span class=\"emphasis\">Year one:<\/span> We shall increase the spirituality of the membership of the East Cache Stake by every family having family prayer. <span class=\"emphasis\">Year two:<\/span> We shall increase the spirituality of the membership of the East Cache Stake by every member attending sacrament meeting weekly. <span class=\"emphasis\">Year three:<\/span> We shall increase the spirituality of the membership of the East Cache Stake by each member paying an honest tithing. <span class=\"emphasis\">Year four:<\/span> We shall increase the spirituality of the membership of the East Cache Stake by each member honoring the Sabbath day and keeping it holy.

Eighty-seven men had been reactivated and, with their wives and children, went to the Manti Temple in the space of one year.

Then I continued, \u201cNow will all of you who have been ordained or set apart by Francis Winters please stand and remain standing.\u201d Another large number swelled the ranks of those standing. \u201cFinally, will all of you who have received a blessing under the hands of Francis Winters please stand and remain standing.\u201d All the remainder stood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-trust.p39\" class=\"\">I turned to President Winters and, with tears coursing down my cheeks, said to him, \u201cPresident Winters, you see before you the result of your ministry as stake president.
