[{"Verse":"0","Text":"<i>To Whom It May Concern:<\/i><br \/><br \/>\n<i>On September 30, 1978, at the 148th Semiannual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the following was presented by President N. Eldon Tanner, First Counselor in the First Presidency of the Church:<\/i><br \/><br \/>\nIn early June of this year, the First Presidency announced that a revelation had been received by President Spencer W. Kimball extending priesthood and temple blessings to all worthy male members of the Church. President Kimball has asked that I advise the conference that after he had received this revelation, which came to him after extended meditation and prayer in the sacred rooms of the holy temple, he presented it to his counselors, who accepted it and approved it. It was then presented to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who unanimously approved it, and was subsequently presented to all other General Authorities, who likewise approved it unanimously.<br \/><br \/>\nPresident Kimball has asked that I now read this letter:<br \/><br \/>\nJune 8, 1978<br \/>\nTo all general and local priesthood officers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints throughout the world:<br \/><br \/>\nDear Brethren:<br \/><br \/>\nAs we have witnessed the expansion of the work of the Lord over the earth, we have been grateful that people of many nations have responded to the message of the restored gospel, and have joined the Church in ever-increasing numbers. This, in turn, has inspired us with a desire to extend to every worthy member of the Church all of the privileges and blessings which the gospel affords.<br \/><br \/>\nAware of the promises made by the prophets and presidents of the Church who have preceded us that at some time, in God\u2019s eternal plan, all of our brethren who are worthy may receive the priesthood, and witnessing the faithfulness of those from whom the priesthood has been withheld, we have pleaded long and earnestly in behalf of these, our faithful brethren, spending many hours in the Upper Room of the Temple supplicating the Lord for divine guidance.<br \/><br \/>\nHe has heard our prayers, and by revelation has confirmed that the long-promised day has come when every faithful, worthy man in the Church may receive the holy priesthood, with power to exercise its divine authority, and enjoy with his loved ones every blessing that flows therefrom, including the blessings of the temple. Accordingly, all worthy male members of the Church may be ordained to the priesthood without regard for race or color. Priesthood leaders are instructed to follow the policy of carefully interviewing all candidates for ordination to either the Aaronic or the Melchizedek Priesthood to insure that they meet the established standards for worthiness.<br \/><br \/>\nWe declare with soberness that the Lord has now made known his will for the blessing of all his children throughout the earth who will hearken to the voice of his authorized servants, and prepare themselves to receive every blessing of the gospel.<br \/><br \/>\nSincerely yours,<br \/><br \/>\nS<small>PENCER<\/small> W. K<small>IMBALL<\/small><br \/>\nN. E<small>LDON<\/small> T<small>ANNER<\/small><br \/>\nM<small>ARION<\/small> G. R<small>OMNEY<\/small><br \/><br \/>\nThe First Presidency<br \/><br \/>\nRecognizing Spencer W. Kimball as the prophet, seer, and revelator, and president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it is proposed that we as a constituent assembly accept this revelation as the word and will of the Lord. All in favor please signify by raising your right hand. Any opposed by the same sign.<br \/><br \/>\n<i>The vote to sustain the foregoing motion was unanimous in the affirmative.<\/i><br \/><br \/>\nSalt Lake City, Utah, September 30, 1978."}]
