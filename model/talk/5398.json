On that occasion I asked earnestly for your faith and your prayers. And today as my opportunity to speak to you has come, I renew that request, that I may have your faith and prayers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p4\" class=\"\">Just a month ago, while celebrating a national holiday, Elder Russell M. Nelson and I found ourselves with our children and grandchildren in a swimming pool filled with warm water and with a breathtaking view of an azure blue sky overhead. Mostly we were keeping a watchful eye on the little ones, much like a mother hen tracks the movement of her chicks. I said to Elder Nelson, \u201cIsn\u2019t it interesting that even though parents are watching their children, we assume the need to give overall supervision of our respective flock of grandchildren.\u201d We had a wonderful time watching children at play and listening to their expressions of delight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p5\" class=\"\">Then I noticed among those in the pool a father holding his severely handicapped son, moving the boy\u2019s shrunken, tiny body back and forth in the pool. Other family members helped, and the lad obviously enjoyed the fun. He, however, was totally dependent. No sound of exuberant joy came forth from his lips, no splash of playful movement emanated from his almost lifeless limbs. Stricken as an infant with severe illness, he was left speechless, brain-damaged, and potentially a burden to loved ones. The boy\u2019s grandfather said to me, \u201cHe is my grandson. All in our family love him. We enjoy his company; we respond to his needs. He is a blessing in our lives.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p6\" class=\"\">Soon the crowd began to leave the pool. Laughter and play ceased. A silence shrouded the scene as the afternoon sun began its descent and the chill air reminded me it was time to go. But this tender view of love and devotion remained with me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p7\" class=\"\">My thoughts turned to a place far distant and to a time long ago\u2014even to another pool called Bethesda.  The book of John describes what occurred there:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cNow there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cIn these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cFor an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cThe impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cJesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-93911_000_028\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29603\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29603)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29603)\">John 5:2\u20139<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p16\" class=\"\">Another scene of suffering and sorrow is found in the famous Tate Gallery in London, England. There adorns the wall of a much-traveled corridor a masterpiece entitled <span class=\"emphasis\">Sickness and Health.<\/span> The painting portrays an organ-grinder with his monkey and a group of happy, healthy children frolicking and showing their amusement at the monkey\u2019s antics. In the background is a small, pale-faced boy confined to a wheelchair, unable to play, unable to join in the fun of the other children. Feelings of empathy and silent tears of sadness overcome those who gaze upon the scene and sense the unspoken feelings of the sick boy\u2019s heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p17\" class=\"\">Who can count the boys and girls, the men and women, where sickness has left its mark, rendering strong limbs lifeless and causing loved ones to shed tears of sorrow and offer prayers of faith for them?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p18\" class=\"\">Illness is not the only culprit that intrudes and alters our lives. In our hectic and fast-moving world, accidents can in an instant inflict pain, destroy happiness, and curtail our future. Such was the experience of young Robert Hendricks. Healthy and carefree three years ago, a sudden, three-car accident left him with brain damage, limited use of his limbs, and impaired speech. Summoned to his side by his mother, who pleaded her despair, I gazed at his almost-lifeless form as he lay on the white hospital bed in the critical care unit. Life supports functioning, his head swathed in bandages, his future was not only in doubt, but death appeared certain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p19\" class=\"\">The hoped-for miracle, however, did occur. Heavenly help was forthcoming. Robert lived. His recovery has been labored and slow\u2014but steady. A devoted friend, who was bishop at the time of the accident, has cared for Robert each week, getting him ready and driving him to his Sunday Church meetings\u2014always patient, ever faithful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p20\" class=\"\">One day Robert\u2019s former bishop brought him to my office, since Robert wanted to meet with me, not having remembered that I saw him that night of crisis in the hospital. He and the dedicated bishop sat down, and Robert \u201ctalked\u201d with me through a small electronic machine on which he spelled out his thoughts and they were then printed on strips of paper. He spelled out on the machine the love he has for his mother, his thanks for helping hands and willing hearts which have aided him, and his gratitude to a kind and caring Heavenly Father who has sustained him through his prayers. Here are some of his less private and personal messages: \u201cI\u2019m coming along pretty good, considering what I\u2019ve been through.\u201d Another: \u201cI know that I will be able to help people and make some difference in people\u2019s lives, and that\u2019s great.\u201d Another: \u201cI don\u2019t really know just how fortunate I am, but in my prayers I am told to just keep pushing on.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p21\" class=\"\">At the conclusion of our visit, the bishop said, \u201cRobert would like to surprise you.\u201d Robert stood and, with considerable effort, said aloud, \u201cThank you.\u201d A broad smile crossed his face. He was on the way back. \u201cThanks be to God\u201d were the only words I could utter. Later I prayed aloud, \u201cThanks be also for loving bishops, kind teachers, and skilled specialists.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p22\" class=\"\">Today, Robert, through the help of his former bishop, his current bishop, and others, has been to the temple. He has learned the computer. He is enrolled in computer study at college. He was also aided along the way by Deseret Industries helpers who provided encouragement and taught him essential skills. Now, with the support of a cane, Robert walks. He has learned to talk, though in halting phrases and with great effort. His progress has been phenomenal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p23\" class=\"\">At times illness and accident take the lives of those whom they strike. Place and station, age and whereabouts make no difference. Death comes to the aged as they walk on faltering feet. Its summons is heard by those who have scarcely reached midway in life\u2019s journey, and often it hushes the laughter of little children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p24\" class=\"\">Throughout the world there is enacted daily the sorrowful scene of loved ones mourning as they bid farewell to a son, a daughter, a brother, a sister, a mother, a father, or a cherished friend.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p25\" class=\"\">Let us look in on one such scene which took place just last month in the Sunset Gardens Cemetery. Gathered were friends and family of Roger S. Olson, whose casket, bedecked with flowers, contained his earthly body. Claudia, his wife, six precious children, and family, friends, and associates stood in silence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p26\" class=\"\">Just a few days earlier, Roger had left for his work, where he was a talented and recognized authority in his field of specialized photography. An accident resulted in the helicopter crash which took his life\u2014all in the twinkling of an eye and without advance warning. Filled with grief but comforted by faith, those who had loved and lived together had bid but a temporary farewell to husband and father. They are sustained by the knowledge the skeptic rejects. They treasure the account recorded in Luke which describes that most significant event following the crucifixion and burial of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cNow upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, [Mary Magdalene and the other Mary] came unto the sepulchre.\u201d To their astonishment, the body of their Lord was gone. Luke records that two men in shining garments stood by them and said, \u201cWhy seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-93911_000_028\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32483\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32483)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32483)\">Luke 24:1\u20136<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p28\" class=\"\">Against the philosophy rampant in today\u2019s world\u2014a doubting of the authenticity of the Sermon on the Mount, an abandonment of Christ\u2019s teaching, a denial of God, and a rejection of His laws\u2014the Olsons and true believers everywhere treasure the testimonies of eyewitnesses to His resurrection.

It illustrates how it is possible to meet life\u2019s challenges\u2014headon. It exemplifies the ability to suffer physical impairment, endure pain and suffering, and yet never complain. Such are Wendy Bennion of Sandy, Utah, and Jami Palmer of Park Valley, Utah. Both are teenagers; both have borne similar afflictions. Their situations run almost parallel. Since Wendy\u2019s battle has been of a longer duration, I shall speak today of her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p37\" class=\"\">Stricken with cancer at a tender age, subjected to long periods of chemotherapy, Wendy persevered valiantly. Teachers cooperated, parents and family helped\u2014but the mainstay in her affliction has been her indomitable spirit. Wendy has brought cheer to others similarly afflicted. She has prayed for them; she has sustained them with her own example and faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p38\" class=\"\">After completion of eighteen months of chemotherapy, a balloon-launching party was held in Wendy\u2019s honor. The public media covered the event. One of the many balloons launched that day was found miles away by Jayne Johnson. It had landed in her backyard, and she discovered it just as she was starting her own chemotherapy treatments. She wrote to Wendy, indicating she had been feeling sad and frightened but that finding the balloon and the note inside\u2014which told about Wendy, her cancer, and the completion of her treatments\u2014had given her the strength and that Wendy was a real inspiration to her. Wendy said, \u201cI think she was supposed to find that balloon so that she would know that it\u2019s not the end of the world and that people do get better.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/meeting-lifes-challenges.p39\" class=\"\">Though Wendy\u2019s cancer recurred, and a second round of therapy was needed, this choice young lady has not wavered, nor has she shrunk from her course.
