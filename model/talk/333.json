Lawrence Lowell of Harvard University.\n<\/p><p>\nFAILURE TO SEE ARIGHT\n<\/p><p>\nTemptations beset every one of us in every walk of life. By temptations I mean failures to see\naright. Jonah's was the case of a man who in success lost sight of the real object of his work.\nHe failed to see the right path. He did no harm because God disposed otherwise; but if he\ncould have had his way, he would have destroyed all the people of Nineveh\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30001\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30001)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30001)\">Jonah 4:1<\/a><\/span>), and thought he\nwas doing right. Yet, had he stopped to ask himself seriously <i>what was the right of his mission<\/i>,\nhis own answer would certainly have been that it was to bring the people of\nNineveh to repentance. His neglect to ask himself that question was the cause of his error. He\nlost sight of his object, not because he could not see it, but because he did not try to.\n<\/p><p>\nMen have good intentions; they mean well: but they do not act well. They do not continually\nask themselves, \"In what does my best consist?\" They pursue lesser aims, not because they\nprefer them, but because in the press and strain of events, in the cares of life, they become\nabsorbed in immediate objects and forget the higher ones. Then, too, many of our young men\ndo not realize the importance of long, hard work. They have not disciplined their minds to\npersevere in diligence and steadfastness. They have not learned how to endure strenuous,\nconscientious work; how to wrestle and work through delays, through disappointments, and\nfailures, through the darkness till the breaking of the day. Let us be sure we never become\nbusy calling attention to our own virtues. Never let us thirst for praise but do <i>right for right's sake.<\/i>\nAbove all, avoid that indifference, that apathy, that is glad to wrap itself under the\ncloak of piety, and be self-satisfied, self-righteous. The knowledge that is really the crown of\nlife, is that we may exercise choice, for we have our free agency. Let us never forget that the\ndivine spark is in every man, in him alone, and that he is free to disregard it or to heed it,\nand to come closer to God by showing his eagerness to work with him and for him.\n<\/p><p>\nCONFORMITY TO IDEALS\n<\/p><p>\nThe spectacle offered by humanity today is a deeply sad one. The gestures of faith, constant\nattendance at Church, outward piety, signify nothing if man does not conform his acts and his\nlife to the ideals of the teachings of Christ. Men must be made to understand that the\nimportant thing is to develop what is within them, to purify themselves, to better themselves,\nto come closer to the perfect ideal which Jesus taught. He has shown us the way. The path is\nstraight before us. We must love God; we must love our neighbor; we must do unto others as\nwe would have them do unto us. We must pray that the kingdom of God may come to the\nearth as it is in heaven. The sincere desire of men to progress morally and spiritually leads to\nthe erection of an inside temple, without which the outward manifestation of faith becomes\nuseless. In I Corinthians, we read:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"164\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 164)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(164)\">1 Cor. 3:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd we read in II Corinthians:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3014\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3014)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3014)\">2 Cor. 3:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHUMAN DESTINY\n<\/p><p>\nSays Le Comte du Nuoy in his <i>Human Destiny:<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nThere is only one way to attain peace. First, to reestablish the cult of historic peace, by\nteaching the youth of the entire world with the same substance, thus establishing a basis for\nmutual understanding. This is a preliminary step and it can be taken immediately. Next, to try\nto establish the cult of individual human destiny, and to improve man by stifling wrong\ninstincts. This will be the work of centuries to come. It is only by direct action on youth that\na better society can be successfully molded. All so-called philosophical and political principles\nmust be replaced by Christian principles, the only ones based on liberty and the respect of\nhuman destiny.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then Le Comte du Nuoy goes on to say that God gave men liberty and conscience, and\nthe whole nobility of man is derived from the proper exercise of this liberty. The time has\ncome for nations as well as individuals to know what they want. If civilized nations want \npeace, they must understand the basic elements of the problems Peace must be established by\ncreating within man a spiritual consciousness and not by erecting external structures. The\nsource of all wars lies in us;* the source of peace will come when we begin to teach the\nyouth of the world that peace depends on the individual development of man from within, on\nthe deep penetration of the virtues of the Holy Scriptures, on the comprehension of human\ndignity.\n<\/p><p>\nWORLD SUFFERS FROM DISTRUST\n<\/p><p>\nAll nations of the world believe in the Golden Rule, and all Christians are agreed to the Ten\nCommandments, the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord's Prayer, the birth and resurrection of\nJesus Christ. These are the fundamental doctrines to be taught to the children of the world, for\nnothing permanent is built that is not the consequence of a deep previous transformation in\nthe individual soul. We must have greater faith in mankind, and the divinity of man should be\nmade known to children from the time they can walk on up to manhood or womanhood. It is\nfrom distrust that the world is suffering. We must be more determined than ever before to\nfulfil the great task expected of us; to make ourselves better; to make others better; to make\nthis a better world to live in and to bring mankind nearer to God&mdash;to have peace in our hearts\nand love for all men.\n<\/p><p>\nSALVATION FOUND IN RELIGION\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe that the only salvation for mankind will be found in religion, in the true and\neverlasting gospel. Never in its two thousand years has Christianity had a more urgent call\nand a nobler opportunity to fulfil its obligations as the comforter and guide of humanity.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe that faith and works must be taught and developed in our children. By works, I\nmean that there is a meaning to intellectual effort and that it plays an important part in our\nspiritual stature. Else why should the activity of divine intelligence, the power to think and\nreason, have been created? Intellectual effort is not condemned in the search for spiritual\ntruth, for our spiritual growth, our religion have their roots in the deepest aspirations of man.\n<\/p><p>\nHow deeply divine are the words of Joseph Smith when he said:\n<\/p><p>\nThe glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12503\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12503)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12503)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the\nresurrection (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12556\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12556)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12556)\">D&amp;C 130:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThese words inspired the Prophet Joseph to establish in his day schools of learning, and even\na university. He advocated the study of the ancient classics, of all the learning of the world.\nNo other American ever advocated as he did, for his wisdom and understanding came from\nthe works of God.\n<\/p><p>\nBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34192\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34192)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34192)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe may further express this idea by saying that all the intellectual acquisitions, all the\nfacilities which society puts at the disposal of man-schools, universities, libraries, laboratories,\nall things offered by religion, all the occasions given him to develop his own aptitude, his\nwork, his leisure, all must be considered by him as tools destined to improve his personality,\nhis moral self, and to make him feel the divine purpose of God. If the moral law and true\nreligion dominate the world today, mankind will be on the right road to the winning of peace\nand happiness for humanity.\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the\nputting on of my hands.\n<\/p><p>\nFor God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5100\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5100)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5100)\">2 Tim. 1:6-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBlessed is the nation whose God is the Lord\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41747\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41747)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41747)\">Ps. 33:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
