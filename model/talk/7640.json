Among them have been hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, and a devastating tsunami.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/this-is-your-phone-call.p6\" class=\"\">The Church has responded to these and many other disasters in marvelous ways.

They ask, \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d The response to this question can be simply stated as \u201cWe are prepared, we have organization, we have empathy, and we have charity.\u201d It usually just takes a few phone calls from presiding authorities to local leaders to mobilize hundreds and sometimes thousands of individuals to go to the rescue of their fellow brothers and sisters in distress.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/this-is-your-phone-call.p8\" class=\"\">Tonight I wish to speak of another challenge to which we have opportunities to respond, and brethren, <span class=\"emphasis\">this is your phone call.<\/span> This challenge is not one of natural causes; however, its effects are real and are being felt globally.

Among our quorum members, you will likely find those who know of job openings and others who are skilled at writing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or assisting in interview preparation. Regardless of titles or skills, you will find a brotherhood committed to bear one another\u2019s burdens.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/this-is-your-phone-call.p12\" class=\"\">President Monson tells the story of a retired executive named Ed who lived the example of a quorum member. On one occasion President Monson was speaking with Ed and asked him, \u201c\u2018Ed, what are you doing in the Church?\u2019 He replied, \u2018I have the best assignment in the ward. My responsibility is to help men who are unemployed find permanent employment. This year I have helped 12 of my brethren who were out of work to obtain good jobs. I have never been happier in my entire life.\u2019\u201d President Monson continues, \u201cShort in stature, \u2018Little Ed,\u2019 as we affectionately called him, stood tall that evening as his eyes glistened and his voice quavered.

Phil\u2019s Auto of Centerville, Utah, is a testament of what priesthood leadership and a quorum can accomplish. Phil was a member of an elders quorum and worked as a mechanic at a local automobile repair shop. Unfortunately, the repair shop where Phil worked experienced economic trouble and had to let Phil go from his job. He was devastated by this turn of events.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/this-is-your-phone-call.p14\" class=\"\">On hearing about Phil\u2019s job loss, his bishop, Leon Olson, and his elders quorum presidency prayerfully considered ways they could help Phil get back on his feet. After all, he was a fellow quorum member, a brother, and he needed help. They concluded that Phil had the skills to run his own business. One of the quorum members offered that he had an old barn that perhaps could be used as a repair shop. Other quorum members could help gather needed tools and supplies to equip the new shop. Almost everyone in the quorum could at least help clean the old barn.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/this-is-your-phone-call.p15\" class=\"\">They shared their ideas with Phil; then they shared their plan with the members of their quorum. The barn was cleaned and renovated, the tools gathered, and all was put in order. Phil\u2019s Auto was a success and eventually moved to better and more permanent quarters\u2014all because his quorum brothers offered help in a time of crisis. Priesthood quorums can and must make a difference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/this-is-your-phone-call.p16\" class=\"\">Many wards and stakes have called employment specialists to provide bishops and quorum leaders with additional support. Do not hesitate to call upon them for help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/this-is-your-phone-call.p17\" class=\"\">In many areas of the Church, we have established employment resource centers. The staff in these centers have been trained to assist you with your quorum, ward, and stake employment needs. Their close relationships with employers will be an asset with career development and employment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/this-is-your-phone-call.p18\" class=\"\">The Church\u2019s Deseret Industries thrift stores offer employment and education opportunities to people of all backgrounds. Those with special needs are given the opportunity for rehabilitation, training, and job placement. Where available, Deseret Industries can be a valuable resource.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/this-is-your-phone-call.p19\" class=\"\">Bishops, the sisters have a role in this effort. Because of the economy, many mothers are finding it necessary to make budget and other living adjustments. Some are even finding it necessary to leave the home to find work. The Relief Society sisters, with their specially endowed, compassionate hearts, can help. They can help identify the needy. They can teach. They can babysit, console, comfort, and encourage. They can make a difference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/this-is-your-phone-call.p20\" class=\"\">Now, let me say a few words to those of you who are currently unemployed. The responsibility for finding employment or improving your employment rests with you. Continued guidance comes from the Lord through regular fasting and prayer. Your quorum leaders, bishops, specialists, and employment resource center staff will help in your efforts. We fear, however, that often priesthood leaders are unaware of your situation. <span class=\"emphasis\">Speak up!<\/span> Let them know you are looking for work. And bishops and priesthood leaders, <span class=\"emphasis\">rise up<\/span> and let the brotherhood of the priesthood engage themselves in the wonderful opportunity to truly be a quorum, a brotherhood, a brother\u2019s keeper.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/this-is-your-phone-call.p21\" class=\"\">President Gordon\u00a0B.
