The valley to the west, was flooded by the rays of the sun, and inspirational music was flowing from the radio. A feeling of well-being prevailed within me. My thoughts dwelt on the goodness of being alive. The music ended in the usual way. It was time for the news. During the next several minutes the announcer commented, as I remember, on a burglary, a shooting, an accident, a hijacking, people being held hostage, and worry over the economic conditions. The news brought to my attention that the world could be full of peace, but that it was not.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/truth-will-emerge-victorious.p4\" class=\"\">Naturally, one fond of peace wonders why this is so, recognizing that if there were no people on earth, all would be quiet and peaceful. But then there would be no purpose in the earth. We know that its purpose is to receive God\u2019s children where they may dwell in mortality and prove themselves in the test against the forces of good and evil. In this process there will be strife as well as peace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/truth-will-emerge-victorious.p5\" class=\"\">There is concern among society for the mounting trouble, the violation, and the turning away from the long-established moral codes. As one has said, \u201cThe living faith of the dead has become the dead faith of the living.\u201d (John Thompson, \u201cIs There a Prophet in the Land?\u201d as quoted in <span class=\"emphasis\">Quote, The Weekly Digest,<\/span> 24 July 1966, p. 6.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/truth-will-emerge-victorious.p6\" class=\"\">Fortunately, there are many who know the value of faith in God and testify to its power to direct their lives, although it is recognized that \u201ctruth is forever on the scaffold and wrong is on the throne.\u201d (James Russell Lowell, \u201cThe Present Crisis.\u201d) We join in that knowledge, and it is our purpose to constantly labor for the cause of truth with the assurance and promise that it will emerge victorious in the end.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/truth-will-emerge-victorious.p7\" class=\"\">God has revealed to his prophets his laws and commandments as they are now spread on the pages of religious history.

It is not a leap in the dark. God does not ask any man to believe without giving him something to believe in. You might as well ask a man to see without eyes, as bid him believe without giving him something to believe.\u201d (D. L.

Our Father in heaven has brought down through the ages the Holy Bible, and in this dispensation of the fulness of times, he has caused other scriptures to be brought forth. One such scripture is the volume known as the Book of Mormon. Its origin begins with the establishment of a new nation spun off from Israel 600 years before Christ, just before the impending destruction of Jerusalem. In the introductory pages of that scripture, the importance of the exercise of faith is highlighted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/truth-will-emerge-victorious.p11\" class=\"\">Lehi, a religious leader, being warned in a dream of the coming destruction of Jerusalem because of the wickedness of the people, was directed to take his family into the wilderness. This he did, and while there, received further instruction from the Lord to direct his four sons to return to Jerusalem to obtain a record from one known as Laban. Two attempts to obtain the record were thwarted. Then Nephi, the more spiritual and faithful of the sons, under the power and conviction of his commitment to his Heavenly Father, which was, \u201cI will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1692\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1692)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1692)\">1 Ne. 3:7<\/a><\/span>), proceeded to venture again, alone, into the night to obtain the record.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/truth-will-emerge-victorious.p12\" class=\"\">The scriptures state, \u201cI, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban.
