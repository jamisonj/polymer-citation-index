I recall a particular young mother, one of many among the women of the Church in Mexico whose faith in God graces their lives so naturally that they seem scarcely aware of it. This lovely woman radiated a moral authority, born of goodness, that influenced all around her for good. With her husband, she sacrificed a number of pleasures and possessions for their higher priorities, seemingly without a second thought. Her ability to perform feats of lifting, bending, and balancing with her children was near superhuman. The demands on her were many and her tasks often repetitive and mundane, yet underneath it all was a beautiful serenity, a sense of being about God\u2019s work. As with the Savior, she was ennobled by blessing others through service and sacrifice. She was love personified.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/the-moral-force-of-women.p8\" class=\"\">I have been remarkably blessed by the moral influence of women, in particular my mother and my wife. Among other women that I look to in gratitude is Anna Daines. Anna and her husband, Henry, and their four children were among the pioneers of the Church in New Jersey, in the United States. Beginning in the 1930s, when Henry was a doctoral student at Rutgers University, he and Anna worked tirelessly with school and civic organizations in Metuchen, where they lived, to overcome deeply rooted prejudice against Mormons and to make the community a better place for all parents to raise their children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/the-moral-force-of-women.p9\" class=\"\">Anna, for example, volunteered at the Metuchen YMCA and made herself indispensable.

Grandma Swenson never learned how to drive a car, but she knew how to help boys become priesthood men.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/the-moral-force-of-women.p12\" class=\"\">A woman\u2019s moral influence is nowhere more powerfully felt or more beneficially employed than in the home. There is no better setting for rearing the rising generation than the traditional family, where a father and a mother work in harmony to provide for, teach, and nurture their children. Where this ideal does not exist, people strive to duplicate its benefits as best they can in their particular circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/the-moral-force-of-women.p13\" class=\"\">In all events, a mother can exert an influence unequaled by any other person in any other relationship. By the power of her example and teaching, her sons learn to respect womanhood and to incorporate discipline and high moral standards in their own lives. Her daughters learn to cultivate their own virtue and to stand up for what is right, again and again, however unpopular. A mother\u2019s love and high expectations lead her children to act responsibly without excuses, to be serious about education and personal development, and to make ongoing contributions to the well-being of all around them.

A more sensible view is that husbands and wives are <span class=\"emphasis\">interdependent<\/span> with each other. \u2026 The critics who moved mothers from dependence to independence skipped the fertile middle ground of interdependence. Those who moved mothers from selflessness to selfishness skipped the fertile middle ground of self-chosen service that contributes toward a woman\u2019s personal growth.

There is no superior career, and no amount of money, authority, or public acclaim can exceed the ultimate rewards of family.

Abortion for personal or social convenience strikes at the heart of a woman\u2019s most sacred powers and destroys her moral authority.

Where once women\u2019s higher standards demanded commitment and responsibility from men, we now have sexual relations without conscience, fatherless families, and growing poverty.

Through the \u2018patient eye of love,\u2019 mothers develop a special knowledge of their children\u2014a knowledge that gives them unique insight into what the truly \u2018best practices\u2019 for each child should be\u201d (Jenet Jacob Erickson, \u201cLove, Not Perfection, Root of Good Mothering,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News,<\/span> May\u00a012, 2013, G3).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"8-10711_000_014\"><a name=\"8-10711_000_014\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote8-10711_000_014\">8.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>It is true that many women over many generations have been exploited or saddled with unfair burdens both in family and employment, but selflessness and sacrifice need not and should not become abusive or exploitative. Elder Bruce\u00a0C. Hafen observed: \u201cIf being \u2018selfless\u2019 means a woman must give up her own inner identity and personal growth, that understanding of selflessness is wrong. \u2026 But today\u2019s liberationist model goes too far the other way, stereotyping women as excessively <span class=\"emphasis\">independent<\/span> of their families. A more sensible view is that husbands and wives are <span class=\"emphasis\">interdependent<\/span> with each other. \u2026 The critics who moved mothers from dependence to independence skipped the fertile middle ground of interdependence. Those who moved mothers from selflessness to selfishness skipped the fertile middle ground of self-chosen service that contributes toward a woman\u2019s personal growth. Because of these excesses, debates about the value of motherhood have, ironically, caused the general society to discount not only mothers but women in general\u201d (\u201cMotherhood and the Moral Influence of Women\u201d [remarks to the World Congress of Families II, Geneva, Plenary Session IV, Nov.\u00a016, 1999], http:\/\/worldcongress.org\/wcf2_spkrs\/wcf2_hafen.htm).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"9-10711_000_014\"><a name=\"9-10711_000_014\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote9-10711_000_014\">9.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>One mother in a <span class=\"emphasis\">Wall Street Journal<\/span> editorial observed: \u201cWith the exception of some Mormons, evangelicals and Orthodox Jews, scads of us don\u2019t know how to teach our own sons and daughters not to give away their bodies so readily. \u2026 Still, in my own circle of girlfriends, the desire to push back is strong.
