It is a miracle that the Bible\u2019s 4,000 years of sacred and secular history were recorded and preserved by the prophets, apostles, and inspired churchmen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p6\" class=\"\">It is a miracle that we have the Bible\u2019s powerful doctrine, principles, poetry, and stories. But most of all, it is a wonderful miracle that we have the account of the life, ministry, and words of Jesus, which was protected through the Dark Ages and through the conflicts of countless generations so that we may have it today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p7\" class=\"\">It is a miracle that the Bible literally contains within its pages the converting, healing Spirit of Christ, which has turned men\u2019s hearts for centuries, leading them to pray, to choose right paths, and to search to find their Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p8\" class=\"\">The Holy Bible is well named. It is holy because it teaches truth, holy because it warms us with its spirit, holy because it teaches us to know God and understand His dealings with men, and holy because it testifies throughout its pages of the Lord Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p9\" class=\"\">Abraham Lincoln said of the Bible: \u201cThis Great Book \u2026 is the best gift God has given to man. All the good the Saviour gave to the world was communicated through this book. But for it we could not know right from wrong\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Speeches and Writings, 1859\u20131865<\/span> [1989], 628).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p10\" class=\"\">It is not by chance or coincidence that we have the Bible today. Righteous individuals were prompted by the Spirit to record both the sacred things they saw and the inspired words they heard and spoke. Other devoted people were prompted to protect and preserve these records. Men like John Wycliffe, the courageous William Tyndale, and Johannes Gutenberg were prompted against much opposition to translate the Bible into language people could understand and to publish it in books people could read. I believe even the scholars of King James had spiritual promptings in their translation work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p11\" class=\"\">The Dark Ages were dark because the light of the gospel was hidden from the people. They did not have the apostles or prophets, nor did they have access to the Bible. The clergy kept the scriptures secret and unavailable to the people. We owe much to the many brave martyrs and reformers like Martin Luther, John Calvin, and John Huss who demanded freedom to worship and common access to the holy books.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p12\" class=\"\">William Tyndale gave his life because he believed so deeply in the power of the Bible. He said, \u201cThe nature of God\u2019s word is, that whosoever read it, or hear it reasoned and disputed before him, it will begin immediately to make him every day better and better, till he be grown into a perfect man\u201d (in S. Michael Wilcox, <span class=\"emphasis\">Fire in the Bones: William Tyndale\u2014Martyr, Father of the English Bible<\/span> [2004], xv).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p13\" class=\"\">Honest, diligent study of the Bible does make us better and better, and we must ever remember the countless martyrs who knew of its power and who gave their lives that we may be able to find within its words the path to the eternal happiness and the peace of our Heavenly Father\u2019s kingdom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p14\" class=\"\">Although these early Christian reformers agreed on many things, they ultimately disagreed on many points of doctrine. This resulted in the organization of numerous Christian denominations. Roger Williams, an early champion of religious liberty, concluded that there was \u201cno regularly-constituted Church on earth, nor any person authorized to administer any Church ordinance; nor could there be, until new apostles were sent by the great Head of the Church, for whose coming he was seeking\u201d (see William Cullen Bryant, ed., <span class=\"emphasis\">Picturesque America; or, the Land We Live In,<\/span> 2 vols. [1872\u201374], 1:502).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p15\" class=\"\">Tens of millions of individuals have come to a faith in God and in Jesus Christ through seeking truth in the Holy Bible. Countless numbers of them had nothing <span class=\"emphasis\">but<\/span> the Bible to feed and guide their faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p16\" class=\"\">Because of the efforts of the reformers, \u201cthe Bible became a household possession. The word of God was read around the family fireside of the lowly as well as the parlors of the great\u201d (John A. Widtsoe, in Conference Report, Apr. 1939, 20).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p17\" class=\"\">Millions of families have come together seeking to find the Church of Jesus Christ through their study of the Bible. One of those families, in the early 1800s in upstate New York, was the family of Joseph Smith Sr. One of his sons was Joseph Smith Jr., who searched the Bible, seeking to know which of the many denominations was the same as the Church that Jesus Christ organized. He was prompted by the words of the Bible to pray for further spiritual light and knowledge from God.

In it we learn not only of the life and teachings and doctrines of Christ, we learn of His Church and of His priesthood and of the organization which He established and named the Church of Jesus Christ in those former days. We believe in that Church, and we believe that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that same Church, restored to earth, complete, with the same organization and the same priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p19\" class=\"\">Without the Bible, we would not know of His Church then, nor would we have the fulness of His gospel now.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p20\" class=\"\">I love the Bible, its teachings, its lessons, and its spirit. I love the Old Testament\u2019s compelling, profound stories and its great prophets testifying of the coming of Christ. I love the New Testament\u2019s apostolic travels and miracles and the letters of Paul. Most of all, I love its eyewitness accounts of the words and the example and the Atonement of our Savior Jesus Christ. I love the perspective and peace that come from reading the Bible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p21\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, I am sure many of you have had the experience of hearing people say that \u201cMormons are not Christians because they have their own Bible, the Book of Mormon.\u201d To anyone harboring this misconception, we say that we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior and the author of our salvation and that we believe, revere, and love the Holy Bible. We do have additional sacred scripture, including the Book of Mormon, but it supports the Bible, never substituting for it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p22\" class=\"\">Jesus taught that we should \u201csearch the scriptures; for \u2026 they are they which testify of me\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50182\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50182)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50182)\">John 5:39<\/a><\/span>). These words provide insight and inspiration to all who sincerely seek to know and understand the truth about Jesus Christ.

The more we read and study the Bible and its teachings, the more clearly we see the doctrinal underpinnings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. We tend to love the scriptures that we spend time with. We may need to balance our study in order to love and understand all scripture.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p24\" class=\"\">You young people especially, do not discount or devalue the Holy Bible. It is the sacred, holy record of the Lord\u2019s life. The Bible contains hundreds of pages more than all of our other scripture combined. It is the bedrock of all Christianity.
