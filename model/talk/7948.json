We recognize that when God the Eternal Father presented His plan to us at the beginning of time, Satan wanted to alter the plan. He said he would redeem all mankind. Not one soul would be lost, and Satan was confident he could deliver on his proposal. But there was an unacceptable cost\u2014the destruction of man\u2019s agency, which was and is a gift given by God (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"124187\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124187)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124187)\">Moses 4:1\u20133<\/a><\/span>).

His backup plan\u2014the plan he has been executing since the time of Adam and Eve\u2014was to tempt men and women, essentially to prove we are undeserving of the God-given gift of agency. Satan has many reasons for doing what he does. Perhaps the most powerful is the motive of revenge, but he also wants to make men and women miserable like he is miserable. None of us should ever underestimate how driven Satan is to succeed.
