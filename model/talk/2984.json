Brigham Young recorded: \u201cIn company with several of the Twelve I was sent to England in 1839. We started from home without purse or scrip, and most of the Twelve were sick; and those who were not sick when they started were sick on the way to Ohio; Brother Taylor was left to die by the roadside, by old Father Coltrin, though he did not die. I was not able to walk to the river, not so far as across this block, no, not more than half as far; I had to be helped to the river in order to get into a boat to cross it. This was about our situation. I had not even an overcoat; I took a small quilt from the trundle bed, and that served for my overcoat, while I was traveling to the State of New York, where I had a coarse satinette overcoat given to me. Thus we went to England, to a strange land to sojourn among strangers.\u201d (Preston Nibley, <span class=\"emphasis\">Missionary Experiences,<\/span> Bookcraft, 1975, p. 90.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/sacrifice-missionary-style.p13\" class=\"\">Today, missionary work is somewhat different and the sacrifices are different, but the Church still admonishes us to be missionaries and to give many more friends, neighbors, and people of the world the opportunity to enjoy all the blessings of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/sacrifice-missionary-style.p14\" class=\"\">It is a privilege to work with the full-time missionaries and their mission presidents in the field, to hear their testimonies, to feel of their wonderful spirits, and to view their dedication to the work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/sacrifice-missionary-style.p15\" class=\"\">The Lord has not limited the opportunity for missionary service to only a few, but it is available to everyone that would follow in his footsteps. Jesus said to his disciples, \u201cIf any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/sacrifice-missionary-style.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cFor whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36526\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36526)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36526)\">Matt. 16:24\u201325<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/sacrifice-missionary-style.p17\" class=\"\">The word <span class=\"emphasis\">deny<\/span> implies sacrifice or giving up one\u2019s personal desires for the happiness of others. We often hear it said that a missionary sacrifices two years of his life to serve the Lord. In the beginning he may think it a sacrifice, especially when the work becomes difficult and the disappointments are numerous; but the sooner the missionary learns to keep the commandments of the Lord, deny himself, as the Savior admonished his disciples, sacrifice his own desires for those of others for the building up of the kingdom of God, and lose himself in the work, then will he find true happiness in his missionary labors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/sacrifice-missionary-style.p18\" class=\"\">With each sacrifice his testimony is strengthened, for to sacrifice is to obey and to love his fellowman.

After visiting with him for a time, we discussed the principle taught by King Benjamin, the great Book of Mormon prophet, who said, \u201cFor the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his Father.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40439\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40439)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40439)\">Mosiah 3:19<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/sacrifice-missionary-style.p20\" class=\"\">I assured this young missionary that if he would adhere to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and submit to all things which the Lord saw fit to inflict upon him and serve Him with humility, patience, and love unto the end\u2014not only of his mission but of his life\u2014surely the Lord would bless him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/sacrifice-missionary-style.p21\" class=\"\">The young missionary rededicated himself to the Lord and today enjoys seeking the happiness of others through his missionary labors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/sacrifice-missionary-style.p22\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, I know without a doubt in my heart that as we seek the Lord and his Spirit, we will be guided and directed in all that we do in this church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/sacrifice-missionary-style.p23\" class=\"\">May I share with you the words of a song written by a missionary while serving in Japan some time ago:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">To be missionary, there\u2019s no finer thing I know.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Though you may toil and work and worry all the day,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Just to hear one person tell you that he knows the gospel\u2019s true,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">There\u2019s no finer thing that anyone can say.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">When first I came I thought it indeed a sacrifice<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">To leave behind the home I love so dear,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">But now I see it was no sacrifice at all,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">It\u2019s a great and marvelous privilege to be here.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">The language isn\u2019t easy, that I\u2019m sure you know by now,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">There\u2019s quite a large adjustment to be made,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">But through the trials and sorrow, I\u2019ve grown closer to my God,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And for that there\u2019s not a thing that I would trade.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I\u2019ve seen a man stop smoking,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I\u2019ve seen his happy smile,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">In prayer I\u2019ve seen a family kneeling down.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I\u2019ve seen the Saints grow stronger, how happy is the day<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">When they\u2019ll have a holy temple of their own.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/sacrifice-missionary-style.p41\" class=\"\">Missionaries are wonderful and carry with them a great spirit of enthusiasm because they are willing to obey the commandments of the Lord and sacrifice with love in their hearts.

Home is the best place to practice this principle and to express love and appreciation for each other. There are many ways we can sacrifice at home and show love for our family members by helping each other with household duties and family activities. Each member must practice self-denial if we are to build eternal homes.
