His presence will be missed greatly, and we repeat our love and condolence extended to his family at the time of his passing. We present for the vote of the conference, as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to replace Elder Stapley, Elder James Esdras Faust. All of you who are in favor of this proposition, please make it manifest by the show of the right hand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/hold-fast-to-the-iron-rod.p5\" class=\"\">We also present for the vote of the conference Elders Fred Burton Howard, Teddy Eugene Brewerton, Jack H Goaslind, Jr., to serve as members of the First Quorum of the Seventy, and Elder William Grant Bangerter to serve as a president of the First Quorum of the Seventy in place of Brother Faust.

Since our last conference six months ago, we have added ten new missions, for a total of 166 throughout the world.

We urge parents not only to engage in this activity, but to let their boys and girls share in helping with the garden. They will not only learn the value and joy of work, but it will help them develop a sense of responsibility as they participate in such family projects.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/hold-fast-to-the-iron-rod.p12\" class=\"\">We should make not only our fields and dooryards attractive, but our homes, barns, outbuildings, and fences should be kept in good repair and painted.

Any Latter-day Saint family that has searched genealogical and historical records has fervently wished their ancestors had kept better and more complete records. On the other hand, some families possess some spiritual treasures because ancestors have recorded the events surrounding their conversion to the gospel and other happenings of interest, including many miraculous blessings and spiritual experiences. People often use the excuse that their lives are uneventful and nobody would be interested in what they have done. But I promise you that if you will keep your journals and records they will indeed be a source of great inspiration to your families, to your children, your grandchildren, and others, on through the generations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/hold-fast-to-the-iron-rod.p14\" class=\"\">Family home evenings are a most appropriate time and place to engage in such activities and especially to train young children in the art of writing about their lives. If you haven\u2019t already done so, make up your minds that today you will start your journals.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/hold-fast-to-the-iron-rod.p15\" class=\"\">There is an urgency to engage more fully in the redeeming of our kindred dead through more frequent temple attendance. All those who possess temple recommends should use them as often as possible to engage in baptisms, endowments, and sealings for the dead. Other members of the Church should concern themselves seriously with preparations to qualify for temple recommends that they, too, might enjoy these eternal blessings and also act as saviors on Mount Zion. There is an ever-increasing burden of temple work to be done by the Saints, and we should rise to meet this challenge.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/hold-fast-to-the-iron-rod.p16\" class=\"\">I again would urge upon all Saints everywhere a more strict observance of the Sabbath day. The Lord\u2019s holy day is fast losing its sacred significance throughout the world, at least our world. More and more, man destroys the Sabbath\u2019s sacred purposes in pursuit of wealth, pleasure, recreation, and the worship of false and material gods. We continue to urge all Saints and God-fearing people everywhere to observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy. Businesses will not be open on the Sabbath if they are not patronized on that holy day. The same is true of resorts, sporting events, and recreation areas of all kinds. Pursuit of the almighty dollar is winning, it seems, over the Lord\u2019s commandment, \u201cKeep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30926\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30926)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30926)\">Lev. 19:30<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/hold-fast-to-the-iron-rod.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cWhy call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> the things which I say?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32008\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32008)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32008)\">Luke 6:46<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/hold-fast-to-the-iron-rod.p18\" class=\"\">Violating the purpose of the Sabbath is not the only matter in these days which calls forth our cry of protest. We are greatly concerned about the world in which we live. The mass media of communications daily presents us with so much that is evil, that is ugly and sordid, and so much that is destructive of righteousness. Godlessness seems to reign everywhere. Satan is unfettered apparently. We have previously said that the growing permissiveness in modern society gravely concerns us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/hold-fast-to-the-iron-rod.p19\" class=\"\">We see about us constant change. Even the pace of life itself has speeded up. Sometimes it seems that the world is undergoing such throes of change that people are disoriented, not knowing what is of value. Right and wrong, however, are as they always were. The principles of the gospel are unaltered. All of men\u2019s evil speaking and all of men\u2019s evil acting cannot alter one jot or tittle of the commandments of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/hold-fast-to-the-iron-rod.p20\" class=\"\">The forces of good are clearly and continually under attack.

Homes had been overturned and shredded, crushed into splinters like toothpicks; fences and gardens were obliterated; bridges and roads were washed away. Bathtubs, refrigerators, mangled autos lay strewn all about the streets. Where one of our little chapels had stood, nothing remained but the foundation. More than a hundred people lost their lives; as many more were injured; thousands were left homeless. I heard many stories while there of suffering, of heroism, of salvation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/hold-fast-to-the-iron-rod.p22\" class=\"\">One woman told how she received a telephone message from friends to get out and to leave\u2014that a tidal wave was coming. She looked out to sea and saw the monstrous wave approaching, like a mountain. She and her husband picked up the baby and ran for their lives up the hill. However, two of their little girls were away from home playing near a clump of lauhala trees. They saw the wave coming, ran into the trees, and held tightly with their arms around the tree trunks. The first gigantic wave washed entirely over them, but they held their breath and clung with all their might until the water receded and their heads were again above the water. When the wave receded, they quickly ran up the hill before the succeeding waves came. Together, the family watched from the safety of the hill as their home below disappeared under the pounding of the waves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/hold-fast-to-the-iron-rod.p23\" class=\"\">We, too, are faced with powerful, destructive forces unleashed by the adversary.

It behooves us to be alert and to listen and flee from the evil for our eternal lives. Without help we cannot stand against it. We must flee to high ground or cling fast to that which can keep us from being swept away. That to which we must cling for safety is the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is our protection from whatever force the evil one can muster. An inspired Book of Mormon prophet counseled his people: \u201cRemember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24725\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24725)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24725)\">Hel. 5:12<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/hold-fast-to-the-iron-rod.p25\" class=\"\">I would emphasize that the teachings of Christ that we should become perfect were not mere rhetoric.
