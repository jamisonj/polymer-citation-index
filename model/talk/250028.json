It is an assemblage of the authorities of the Church from the Stakes of Zion. They have come together to rejoice, to give God thanks, to praise and to magnify His name because another great and peculiar blessing is bestowed upon His people&#x2014;that of erecting, completing and furnishing another house unto the Lord, and of dedicating it unto Him. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n741\"> The Temples, the houses of our God, when acceptably dedicated, become to us the gates of heaven. They are esteemed most holy unto the Lord of all places upon the earth; therein the faithful approach nearest unto God, and obtain the greatest fellowship and inspiration of His Holy Spirit. There the righteous perform ordinances that reach into the heavens and take effect upon their dead whom they love, whom they have loved, and who have gone before&#x2014;to whom they owe a debt of gratitude, for their parentage&#x2014;the authors of their being and education in the flesh; who have gone unto that other state of spiritual existence. It is fitting on such occasions that the Presidents and Bishops, with their Counselors, should come from the four quarters of the earth, if the knowledge of the Gospel and the organization of the Stakes of Zion had extended so far. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n742\"> The dedication of the Temple this morning awakens anew in our souls a heavenly, family feeling. It arouses in us an interest that reaches not only over the extent of the work here upon the earth, but into the regions of eternal life in the spirit world. It inspires a feeling that we are part of them and that they are part of us, knowing that we cannot be made perfect without them, nor they without us.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"77152\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 77152)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(77152)\">Heb. 11:40<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"91209\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 91209)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(91209)\">D&amp;C 128:15,18<\/a><\/span> And it <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"231b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0231.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;231b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8913\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> becomes like the opening up of the gate of heaven unto us, that we may view by the eye of faith, and by the light of the Holy Spirit, that portion of the family of God with whom we have before associated, and with whom we expect to be hereafter associated in greater and more glorious labors in His eternal kingdom here upon the earth; when sickness, sorrow, sin and death shall be cleansed from the face of it,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"80733\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 80733)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(80733)\">Rev. 21:4<\/a><\/span> and when life, salvation, peace and faith shall, as the fruits of the Spirit,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"74653\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 74653)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(74653)\">Gal. 5:22<\/a><\/span> be poured out upon all flesh. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n743\"> While in the Temple with the chief authorities of the Church and Kingdom of God&#x2014;which has now extended its operations and its labors to every continent, almost every mainland, and many islands of the sea&#x2014;the reflection came forcibly to my mind that there are represented in our midst this day people from either Indies, from the Antipodes, and from the various nations of the earth; not less than twenty-five or thirty nationalities, languages, tongues and peoples are represented among us. The impression was irresistible that the fellowship of the heavens was near us, that our Savior the Lord Jesus Christ was near, and that His Spirit was largely in the midst of the congregation; that the spirit of our ancient fathers, Adam, Noah and Abraham, the father of the faithful,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"92197\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 92197)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(92197)\">D&amp;C 138:41<\/a><\/span> who the Revelations inform us has entered into his exaltation and sits upon his throne,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"91696\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 91696)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(91696)\">D&amp;C 132:29<\/a><\/span> were all earnestly interested in our offering and dedication of this Temple to the Most High God. The impression was constantly with me that we were in the presence of the Prophet Joseph, his brother Hyrum, and others who had gone before, such as Brother David W. Patten, as well as Brigham, Heber, Willard, and others of the Apostles and  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"232a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0232.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;232a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8912\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>worthies&#x2014;that their spirits must have been present with us hallowing our reflections, imparting their peaceful influence and truthful inspiration to our souls. Our spirits were awakened to a profound sense of thankfulness that we had been enabled to take another so important a step of advancement in the triumphant progress of the great Latter-day work. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n745\"> We are sensible that the heavenly powers are moved on these occasions, and we know that the Saints on earth are. Indeed there is no theme that engages the human mind, and that reaches into the innermost recesses thereof as does Temple building, and the ideas associated with that work and the purposes for which they are used. It is this that animates the bosoms of the righteous and brings forth sentiments and emotions from the fountains of their souls, inspiring them with fresh resolutions to faith and good works. I thank the living God and praise His holy name that I have lived to see His work progress thus far upon the earth. I am thankful for the privilege of meeting with so many of my brethren in the Priesthood. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n746\"> It is a pleasing thought, a glorious truth, that while we are here together in our persons, we are also united in spirit, we are firmly united, so far as we know, in our belief in the principles of the Gospel, and in all the labors assigned to us severally to perform. I do not recollect to have ever read in the Bible history of God's people on the earth, when His servants and His people wrought together, with greater unanimity of faith or with a more generous use of their means than now in all the labors and duties that devolve upon them. The favorable conditions attending us as a people, the peace and plenty there is in the land&#x2014;the <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"232b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0232.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;232b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8912\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> sweet fellowship of the Spirit, the glorious promises and prospects for the future, all draw from the fountain of our souls our best emotions, our strongest faith, our brightest hopes, our most glorious anticipations. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n747\"> I have reflected upon the days of ancient Israel, and wondered at their decadence, when they had arrived at the height of glory and eminence. Solomon, their king, stood vastly above all the kings of the surrounding nations; he sat safely on his throne, for God sustained him there, until he departed from His counsels and commandments. Oh, what a terrible thing to happen to God's people, or to any of His servants! What was it that turned the scale and started the decay of that nation? It was simply because their ruler put forth his hand and took to himself wives of other nations, that God had commanded him not to.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"54571\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 54571)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(54571)\">Ex. 34:16<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"54992\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 54992)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(54992)\">Deut. 7:3-4<\/a><\/span> This was the beginning of the great mischief that came upon Israel, and one mischief led to another; they persuaded him to attend the sacrifices and worship of their idolatrous gods, as the Lord told him they would do,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"55060\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55060)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55060)\">Deut. 17:17<\/a><\/span> until the family of Israel had come to follow the example of their king&#x2014;marrying strange women and worshipping strange gods,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"55646\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55646)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55646)\">1 Kgs. 11:1-8<\/a><\/span> which brought them down to that terrible degradation that their temple, which was built in wisdom, strength and beauty most glorious, and which was acknowledged at its dedication by the presence and glory of God,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"55625\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55625)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55625)\">1 Kgs. 8:10-11<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"55908\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55908)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55908)\">2 Chr. 5:13-14<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"55914\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55914)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55914)\">2 Chr. 7:1-3<\/a><\/span> had become polluted and degraded to a den of thieves.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"65320\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 65320)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(65320)\">Matt. 21:13<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"66632\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 66632)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(66632)\">Mark 11:17<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"67915\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 67915)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(67915)\">Luke 19:46<\/a><\/span> The Lord told them that their doom was sealed, and that in regard to the Temple, there should not be left one stone upon another to tell where it stood.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"65648\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 65648)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(65648)\">Matt. 24:2<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"66660\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 66660)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(66660)\">Mark 13:2<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"67913\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 67913)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(67913)\">Luke 19:44<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"67952\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 67952)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(67952)\">Luke 21:6<\/a><\/span> O, what terrible consequences have followed through the ages until today!

The Lord has given us intimations in regard to all these things, and He will continue to reveal all things necessary to be made known by which His great purposes shall be brought about. Great and glorious is His work! The work of the resurrection is not far off. I am fully persuaded of this, and have reflected sometimes concerning it, with an earnest desire. Never in all my ministry have I talked much about the resurrection; but the Lord has manifested some things concerning it, and I would like to allude to them. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v25n751\"> It is a popular sentiment among professing Christians generally, and it is believed also by many of the Saints&#x2014;because of a certain saying the Savior made use of to the Sadducees on a particular occasion&#x2014;that, in neither of the resurrections is there to be any marrying or giving in marriage.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"65424\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 65424)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(65424)\">Matt. 22:30<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"65961\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 65961)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(65961)\">Matt. 24:38<\/a><\/span> This is a mistaken idea.
