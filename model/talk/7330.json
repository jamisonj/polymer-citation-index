Mormon, after pointing out that if a man \u201chave not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity,\u201d goes on to name the 13 elements of charity, or the pure love of Christ. I find it most interesting that 4 of the 13 elements of this must-have virtue relate to patience (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"45647\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45647)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45647)\">Moroni 7:44\u201345<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-power-of-patience.p7\" class=\"\">First, \u201ccharity suffereth long.\u201d That is what patience is all about.

Recently I attended the funeral of a lifelong friend. His son told a beautiful story of parental patience. When the son was in his youth, his dad owned a motorcycle dealership. One day they received a shipment of shiny new motorcycles, and they lined them all up in the store. The boy did what every boy would like to do, and he climbed up on the closest one. He even started it up. Then, when he figured he had pushed his luck far enough, he jumped off. To his dismay, his dismount knocked the first bike down. Then, like a string of dominoes, they all went down, one after another. His dad heard the commotion and looked out from behind the partition where he was working. Slowly, smiling, he said, \u201cWell, son, we had better fix one up and sell it, so we can pay for the rest of them.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-power-of-patience.p22\" class=\"\">I think my friend\u2019s response personifies parental patience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-power-of-patience.p23\" class=\"\">Patience may well be thought of as a gateway virtue, contributing to the growth and strength of its fellow virtues of forgiveness, tolerance, and faith.
