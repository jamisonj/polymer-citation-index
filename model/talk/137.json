Only a small portion of this state\nand the other states around us is well cultivated and really productive. There is a writer whom\nI read frequently who has made the statement that there are more uncultivated souls than\nlands. I wonder if that is true.\n<\/p><p>\nCertain it is that there are many souls in the world today who have been improperly\ncultivated, else we would not have the conditions prevalent that we are struggling with now.\n<\/p><p>\nI like to look upon this body of men as the tillers of the soul of the Church, and it is our\nproblem to see that the soul of the Church is well cultivated, so that it can yield itself to the\npurposes of God. The soul of the Church is a composite of the souls of its members, and so\nwe become the tillers of the souls of the members of the Church, and it becomes our duty as\nwe face this problem, each and every one of us, to till our own garden spots first, and if they\nturn out to be productive, then there is no question that the greater fields will, likewise, be\nproductive.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we think of the soul of the Church, and the souls of the members of the Church, we\nnaturally wonder what constitutes a well-developed, well-cultivated soul.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have already been told that the first and great commandment of the Gospel of Jesus Christ\nis that we should love God with all our hearts, and that we should love our neighbors as\nourselves (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33922\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33922)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33922)\">Matt. 22:37-39<\/a><\/span>).\nThat is the great fundamental principle of the Gospel, and since the purpose of the\nGospel is to develop men in their souls and give them joy and happiness and better life, then\nthe first requisite of a well-cultivated soul is that he must love God and love his neighbor, be\nwilling to serve God and serve his neighbor.\n<\/p><p>\nThen we, who are the custodians of the people, so to speak, the tillers of the soul, must see\nthat we love God and love our neighbors, so that we can help others to arrive at that state.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many other virtues that enter into this picture. Right along as second to love come\ncharity and mercy. Can we feel that our souls are well cultivated if we have not charity? If\nyou read the scripture you will find that all these other things seem to fail in the absence of\ncharity and mercy (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"118\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 118)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(118)\">1 Cor. 13:1-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen comes forgiveness. We must be ready to forgive when persons who have sinned against\nus, prompted by sincere repentance, attempt to make restitution. If we are going to forgive,\nwe are going to forget likewise, for forgiveness falls flat if it is of the mouth only and not of\nthe heart, and if, after saying we forgive, we still carry in our minds the offense and hold it as\nan obstacle to the progress of the one whom we have forgiven.\n<\/p><p>\nWe must be honest, too. We must be honest with ourselves, we must be honest with our\nneighbors, we must be honest with the state, we must be honest with the Church. There is too\ngreat a lack of honesty in the world today; too many do not think seriously enough of those\nproblems and feel that so long as we can act within the technicalities of the law, we are\nsufficiently honest for the day. I question that very much, brethren. I think we all ought\nrepeatedly to examine our hearts and our attitude, to make sure that we are honest.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd we should be industrious. If there is anything that the Church has been noted for in the\npast, among those things comes the fact that we have been an industrious people. We would\nlike to continue to be such, industrious, frugal and careful. If we are, there is little question\nbut that God will bless us and help us to meet the exigencies of our lives.\n<\/p><p>\nWe should be sympathetic with our neighbors in their trials and troubles. We should be\nwilling to help them over their difficulties. We should be trustworthy, so that when we make\na promise, everybody will know that we keep that promise to the very letter, that our word\nwill be as our written bond, and nobody will question us. We should live clean, honorable,\nand upright lives. No other thing will give us greater happiness, or will develop our souls to a\ngreater degree than to live the law of chastity which is prescribed by our Church as by no\nother organization on the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nAll of these things tend to develop the spirit and the soul of man. The Prophet Joseph Smith\nhas told us that the soul consists not only of the spirit of man but of the spirit and body\ninseparably connected (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12026\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12026)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12026)\">D&amp;C 93:33<\/a><\/span>).\nThen, in the development of the soul, we have next, after the spiritual\ndevelopment, that of the body. I believe what the scripture says that the body is the temple of\nthe spirit, the temple of God, and that his spirit will not dwell in an unclean body\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"111\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 111)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(111)\">1 Cor. 3:16-17<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40198\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40198)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40198)\">Mosiah 3:27<\/a><\/span>). Our\npurpose, then, as well as to develop the other phase, is to develop our bodies, to attempt\nperfection in them, so that the spirit which God grants the privilege of dwelling in this body\nof clay shall, in its development, be unhampered by physical imperfections.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we can do these things, we shall not have it said of us that there are more uncultivated\nsouls than land where we abide and we, the priesthood presidents of the Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints have this as our great purpose and our great field of activity: to\ndevelop the souls of the people and the soul of the Church. This is a complex problem but it\nis wholly within our power, if we can only gain the assistance that comes from the\ncompanionship of the Spirit of God. If we are humble&mdash;and humility is one of the highest\nvirtues that we should cultivate in this spiritual development&mdash;if we are only humble, and if\nwe apply the spirit of prayer as Brother Romney has just said, we can gain that power that\ncomes from the Spirit of God.\n<\/p><p>\nThat Spirit will give us the interest which will impel us to greater activity than we have ever\nundertaken before.\n<\/p><p>\nThat, brethren, is my prayer today, that we the servants of God and the servants of his people,\nfor he has told us that inasmuch as we serve the least among us we are serving him; that we\ncan get his Spirit to give us a true vision of our responsibility and the power to meet it fully\nand completely. All of us should examine ourselves and our problem, and then make a high\nresolve before our Heavenly Father that we will, to the best of our ability magnify our calling.\nIf we can but do that, there is no question about the power of the priesthood of God. That he\nmay grant it to us, I pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
