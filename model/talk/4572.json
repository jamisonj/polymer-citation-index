I am most grateful for that privilege, as well as for the simultaneous privilege of discovering the principles of truth revealed directly from the Lord to his chosen prophets, as recorded in the scriptures. To the many young people of the Church who have the privilege of discovering truth through the scientific method, let me add my testimony to those of Elders James E. Talmage and John A. Widtsoe (author of a choice book, <span class=\"emphasis\">In Search of Truth<\/span>) that there is no conflict between the facts and truths of science and those given to us by direct revelation. Rather than conflicting, the facts and truths in each area complement each other, each supplying answers to basic questions which we must know, eventually, if we are to fulfill our destiny as sons and daughters and copartners with our Father in his eternal plan.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/solutions-from-the-scriptures.p5\" class=\"\">Apparent conflicts arise when the theories of science\u2014which serve as a scaffolding erected to try to understand relationships among observed facts\u2014are mistaken for the experimentally verified facts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/solutions-from-the-scriptures.p6\" class=\"\">Occasionally also, some people subject the scriptures to personal interpretation. This can give rise to differences in perception as well. I have learned to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d when confronted with choices which seem to be in conflict. No true scientist will say that we have final, exact answers through scientific research; it is an ongoing, learning process. The Articles of Faith teach us that the Lord \u201cwill yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7002\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7002)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7002)\">A of F 1:9<\/a><\/span>).

Then, as now, there was a need for intense instruction in the Lord\u2019s way of doing things. The Lord\u2019s direction then was to institute the \u201cschool of the prophets, established for their instruction in all things that are expedient for them, even for all the officers of the church, \u2026 even down to the deacons\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18867\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18867)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18867)\">D&amp;C 88:127<\/a><\/span>). The stake priesthood leadership meeting provides a forum for the pretraining of potential leaders, to supplement the learning-by-observing method followed in established areas of the Church.
