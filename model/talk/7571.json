I was 48 years old. I had thick, dark brown hair. I thought I understood what it meant to feel inadequate. At the end of my five-minute remarks, my shirt was dripping with perspiration. The whole thing was something of an ordeal. However, today, in retrospect, it seems a comparatively pleasant experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/born-again.p6\" class=\"\">When President Dieter\u00a0F. Uchtdorf and Elder David\u00a0A. Bednar were first sustained as members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a witness of the divine origin of their calls came to me during the session. I was also given in that moment an understanding of the surpassing sacredness of the call and service of an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. I do not have the words to express that understanding because it was communicated Spirit to spirit without words. To think of it now reduces me to a depth of humility I have never before experienced, and I plead with my Heavenly Father to sustain me as He ever has that I might measure up to something that is far beyond my native capacity and be able to focus outwardly, losing myself in your service. I trust in Him, and I know that His grace is sufficient, and so I here unreservedly commit all that I have and am to God and His Beloved Son. I also commit myself, my loyalty, my service, and my love to the First Presidency and to my Brethren of the Twelve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/born-again.p7\" class=\"\">My patriarchal blessing, received at age 13 from a beloved grandfather, includes this statement: \u201c[Your Heavenly Father] sent you forth in this last and glorious dispensation that you might be born under the new and everlasting covenant by goodly, righteous parents.\u201d With deepest appreciation I acknowledge that this has been the great foundational blessing of my life. I pay tribute to my parents and with love acknowledge my debt to them and to their parents and generations beyond. Not long after my call to the Seventy, I had occasion to be standing at the grave of one of those ancestors who had died years before I was born. As I contemplated the sacrifices entailed upon him and his family by their acceptance of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, a sense of gratitude flooded my heart and a resolve welled up in me to honor his sacrifice and that of those who came after by being faithful to God and the gospel covenants, as they were.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/born-again.p8\" class=\"\">In acknowledging blessings, I include my dear brothers and their spouses who, as it happens, are present today. My wife and I have four sons and a daughter, each married to a wonderful spouse or, in the case of our youngest son, soon to be married to a lovely young woman. We love them and our grandchildren and appreciate how they bless our lives by their loyalty to the Savior and His gospel. At the pinnacle is my wife, Kathy, the maker of our home, the light of my life, a steady and wise companion, filled with spiritual intuition, good humor, goodwill, and charity. I love her beyond expression and hope to show it more convincingly in the days and years ahead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/born-again.p9\" class=\"\">It was my blessing to serve a full-time mission as a young man in Argentina under the tutelage of two exceptional mission presidents, Ronald\u00a0V. Stone and Richard\u00a0G. Scott, and their respective wives, Patricia and Jeanene. I thank God for their lasting influence in me. Following my graduation from law school, Kathy and I and our children made our homes successively in the states of Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and now Utah. Three precious years were spent in Mexico. In all of these places, we have been blessed with dear friends in and out of the Church who have loved and taught and befriended us and our children and who continue to do so. I take this opportunity to publicly express gratitude to all of them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/born-again.p10\" class=\"\">My love and regard for my Brethren of the Seventy and the Presiding Bishopric is boundless. I rejoice that my continuing service will keep me close to them and that there will be frequent opportunities to serve together. The unfolding revelations of our time that have set the Seventy in place in the Church constitute one of the most profound and perhaps underappreciated miracles in the history of the Lord\u2019s latter-day work. The Seventy are key to the success of the work now and in the years ahead, and I feel honored beyond measure that my name was ever included among theirs. God bless you, my Brethren.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/born-again.p11\" class=\"\">I wish to bear you my witness of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and the power of His infinite, atoning sacrifice. In doing so, I will call upon an experience from my years in Tennessee. One evening there I received a call at home from a gentleman I did not know. He introduced himself as a recently retired minister of another faith and asked to meet with me privately the following Sunday. When we met, my guest stated frankly he had come out of concern for the welfare of my soul. He pulled out of his portfolio a fairly long list of scripture citations from the New Testament and said he wanted to review these verses with me and see if he could help me be saved. I was a bit surprised at his directness, but I could tell that he was sincere, and I was touched by his genuine interest in me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/born-again.p12\" class=\"\">We conversed for more than an hour, and he was open to hear me explain something of my faith as well as to read with me some teachings from the Book of Mormon with which he was not familiar. We found there was much we believed in common and some things we did not. We felt a bond of friendship and prayed together before he left. What remains with me is our discussion about being born again. It is spiritual rebirth through Jesus Christ that is the context of my witness of Him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/born-again.p13\" class=\"\">It was Jesus who stated that entry into the kingdom of God requires that one be born again\u2014born of water and of the Spirit (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51641\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51641)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51641)\">John 3:3\u20135<\/a><\/span>).

In other words, the baptism of repentance by water leads to the baptism of the Spirit. The Spirit brings the atoning grace of Christ, symbolized by His blood, both to justify (or pardon) our sins and to sanctify (or cleanse) us from the effects of sin, making us spotless and holy before God. The scriptural record reports that \u201cAdam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid under the water, and was brought forth out of the water.

Monson as prophet and President of the Church of Jesus Christ in this time and pledge my loyalty to him and his counselors in their sacred roles. I pray God\u2019s blessings upon us all. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-02205_000_027\"><a name=\"-02205_000_027\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-02205_000_027\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>God taught these things to Adam at the very beginning. He told Adam: \u201cInasmuch as ye were born into the world by water, and blood, and the spirit, which I have made, and so became of dust a living soul, even so ye must be born again into the kingdom of heaven, of water, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood, even the blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye might be sanctified from all sin\u00a0\u2026\u00a0; for by the water ye keep the commandment; by the Spirit ye are justified, and by the blood ye are sanctified\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52000\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52000)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52000)\">Moses 6:59\u201360<\/a><\/span>). In other words, the baptism of repentance by water leads to the baptism of the Spirit. The Spirit brings the atoning grace of Christ, symbolized by His blood, both to justify (or pardon) our sins and to sanctify (or cleanse) us from the effects of sin, making us spotless and holy before God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The scriptural record reports that \u201cAdam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid under the water, and was brought forth out of the water. And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was born of the Spirit, and became quickened in the inner man. And he heard a voice out of heaven, saying: Thou art baptized with fire, and with the Holy Ghost. \u2026 Behold, thou art one in me, a son of God; and thus may all become my sons [and daughters]\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52002\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52002)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52002)\">Moses 6:64\u201366, 68<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-02205_000_027\"><a name=\"-02205_000_027\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-02205_000_027\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>See Ezra Taft Benson, \u201cA Mighty Change of Heart,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Tambuli,<\/span> Mar. 1990, 2\u20137; <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Oct. 1989, 2\u20135.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
