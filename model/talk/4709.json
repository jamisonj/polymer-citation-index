The change was so gradual, almost imperceptible, that the frogs accommodated themselves to their new environment\u2014until it was too late. The point that Mr. Muggeridge was making was not about frogs but about us and how we tend to accept evil as long as it is not a shock that is thrust on us abruptly.
