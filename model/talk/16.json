They are good men, and if only we\ncan just get them to become active in their work we would be doing a fine and good service.\nThose men are in our midst and many are fine characters and are at work in some position or\nanother. Many hold positions of trust that are worth while, so far as our civic and business\nlife are concerned. If we could just get these men to participate with us I think it would be a\nmarvelous thing.\n<\/p><p>\nI am happy to bear my testimony that I know, without a doubt, that this is the work of God;\nthat we are engaged in the building up of the Church and kingdom of God on earth; that the\npeople in this Church are the ones who hold the confirmed gift and power of the Holy Ghost,\nand that you men, as leaders, all of us here, have the rights and gifts of the Holy Priesthood\nwhich cannot be found elsewhere in this world, only in the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints. I am happy and thankful to be numbered among you.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray the Lord to bless us, in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
