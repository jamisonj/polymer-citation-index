We watched with anticipation and excitement as he prepared for that great adventure. We saw a transformation take place as he experienced his farewell, his temple endowment, and his entrance into the Missionary Training Center. It was a literal miracle to see a typical selfish teenage boy become a selfless servant of God. He became a man overnight. We thrilled at his letters from the Training Center in which he told his friends to get with it\u2014that \u201cthis\u201d is where it\u2019s at. We saw a new boldness as he became immersed in his mission. That boldness and spirit have been increased now that he is in the mission field teaching what he believes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/called-to-serve.p4\" class=\"\">Let me share a portion of a letter he wrote to a nonmember friend who is investigating the Church:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/called-to-serve.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s great to hear you\u2019ve taken the discussions. They are really cool. Let me tell you something about commitment. You have just got to make it. Get committed! Read the Book of Mormon. I did it in nine days, and I only read for one and a half hours a day. Get committed to attend church every week. It is a commandment of God, and it\u2019s necessary for baptism. Get committed to pray. If you would read the Book of Mormon and pray about it, you would know that it is true. Finally, get committed to baptism. Christ did it, and you have to, too. I suspect that you know the gospel is true, or you wouldn\u2019t put up with it. Remember, God knows you know it; and if you don\u2019t make the commitment, he will still hold you accountable because you know the truth. Being lukewarm in the gospel doesn\u2019t do anyone any good\u2014especially you!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/called-to-serve.p6\" class=\"\">As a grandfather, I exult when I see my own flesh and blood entering the Lord\u2019s service so well prepared and pray that my other grandchildren will respond as readily to the call as he has done.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/called-to-serve.p7\" class=\"\">In pondering what they could do to prepare to serve missions, I believe the best formula I could give them, and all the youth of the Church, is found in a single verse in the second chapter of Luke: \u201cAnd Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32289\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32289)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32289)\">Luke 2:52<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/called-to-serve.p8\" class=\"\">That one verse gives us an insight into what our Savior did to prepare for his ministry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/called-to-serve.p9\" class=\"\">It tells us that Jesus Christ grew physically, mentally, socially, and spiritually!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/called-to-serve.p10\" class=\"\">As his disciples, can we do less?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/called-to-serve.p11\" class=\"\">Let us consider how we can prepare in the same manner so we can truly represent him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Physical Preparation<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/called-to-serve.p13\" class=\"\">Missionary work is demanding.

That required many years of study and education. And yet some of us seem to feel that we can understand the gospel of Jesus Christ, which embraces all truth, simply by attending church, making little effort to learn and practice its vital teachings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/called-to-serve.p23\" class=\"\">As you prepare for your mission, remember the counsel of the old sage: \u201cYou can\u2019t teach what you don\u2019t know any more than you can come back from a place you ain\u2019t been.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/called-to-serve.p24\" class=\"\">How is your educational preparation?

Finally, I asked one of my finest missionaries to become his companion, urging him to do all he could to help his fellow missionary love his work. As I approached a conference in the city where they were laboring, I feared he, like his predecessors, would ask for a transfer. To my surprise, when I asked how he was getting along with his companion, he responded: \u201cWe are doing great! We discovered we had something in common.
