At that time there were no stakes, with the largest cities in the mission having only two branches. There were limited opportunities for education and much poverty. With two or three exceptions, all the missionaries were from the United States.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p5\" class=\"\">I remember the people of the Nealtican Branch. All buildings in the town were made of adobe, except the Catholic cathedral and the LDS chapel. I remember standing in the small adobe house of the branch president. It had a dirt floor, windows with no glass, and a rug hanging over the entryway. There was no furniture in the house. His family had no shoes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p6\" class=\"\">But they were a happy people.

The Mexico of today is much different from that of 36 years ago. Nealtican is the center of a thriving stake of Zion. Mexico has 200 stakes and a million members of the Church. Many stake and ward leaders are highly educated and financially secure. Thousands of young men and women from Mexico are serving full-time missions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p8\" class=\"\">Truly the vision seen by Lehi and interpreted by Nephi is coming to pass. \u201cAnd at that day shall the remnant of <span class=\"emphasis\">our seed<\/span> know that they are of the <span class=\"emphasis\">house of Israel,<\/span> and that <span class=\"emphasis\">they<\/span> are the <span class=\"emphasis\">covenant<\/span> people of the Lord; and then shall they <span class=\"emphasis\">know<\/span> and come to the knowledge of their <span class=\"emphasis\">forefathers,<\/span> and also to the knowledge of the <span class=\"emphasis\">gospel<\/span> of their Redeemer, which was ministered unto their <span class=\"emphasis\">fathers by him;<\/span> wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their <span class=\"emphasis\">Redeemer.<\/span>\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-25911_000_013\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44592\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44592)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44592)\">1 Ne. 15:14<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p9\" class=\"\">Truly the people of Mexico and other Latin American countries are among the descendants of prophets.
