He referred\nto the comprehensiveness of Mormonism, how this gospel of the kingdom must be preached\nto every creature&mdash;all of God's children&mdash;whether they be living or whether they be dead. A\nfew years ago I was over in Norway and visited the little town of Trondheim where a car took\nus up to an elevated place just back of the Viking Monument in that city. As the car stopped I\nsaid to the driver, \"Do you know where Brother John A. Widtsoe and his mother lived when\ntheir home was in this city?\" He said, \"Of course. Everyone knows that. Would you like to\nsee it?\" Of course, I would.\n<\/p><p>\nHe drove us down through the city and we finally stopped in front of a little white dwelling.\nEverything about that place was immaculate. Even the stones around the walks were painted\nwhite. I knocked at the door, and I said to the woman who opened it \"May I go around to the\nback and see the premises in the rear?\" She said \"Of course!\" I walked around to the back and\nas I stood there I saw some lettering on the fence. I walked nearer so I could better see the\nlettering, and I deciphered the name, Karl Vidtsoe. I wrote the name in my book, and when I\ncame back to Salt Lake City I immediately went up to see Brother Widtsoe. I said to him,\n\"Brother Widtsoe, who is Karl Vidtsoe?\" He said \"Oh, that is Uncle Karl. Uncle Karl was a\ngood man, but he never could see the beauty and the strength of the restored gospel. But\nSister Widtsoe and I have been over there,\" he pointed to the temple, \"and we have done the\nwork for Karl&mdash;all we can do for him in this life, but when we get over on the other side I\nwill surely find Karl, and I will preach the gospel to him until he is ready to receive it.\"\n<\/p><p>\nDo you see the beauty of the restored gospel? Do you see the anxiety of Brother Widtsoe to\nproclaim the gospel truths to his relative? It occurs to me as I stand here that our work is\nprobably never done. We will commence on the morrow, or whenever we pass on, just where\nwe left off today. We will search for our relatives and our friends until we will find them,\nand we will preach to them the self-same gospel which we are teaching the world today, both\nat home and abroad. It is glorious, brethren and sisters, to contemplate this phase of the\nrestored gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nI jotted down here in just a moment, two or three passages of scripture. One reads like this:\n\"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all [else] shall be added\nunto you\" (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"34946\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34946)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34946)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>).\nHere is another one which has come to us through modern\nrevelation. \". . . Many are called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors\nof men\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13796\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13796)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13796)\">D&amp;C 121:34-35<\/a><\/span>).\nHave you seen men depart from the faith because their hearts\nare centered in the things of this world? And because they aspire to the honors of men?\n<\/p><p>\nAnother statement made by the Savior: \"How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the\nkingdom of God?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33111\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33111)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33111)\">Mark 10:23<\/a><\/span>).\nI do not know exactly what the Lord meant when he said\nthat, but I do believe that we have no right as members of the Church to put our first\nthoughts to the accumulation of worldly things, and I believe he expects us, as stated in that\nverse I first read, to seek first his kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nHe said to the rich young ruler: \"If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all thou hast, and give to the\npoor, and take up thy cross and follow me\" (see\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34972\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34972)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34972)\">Matt. 19:21<\/a><\/span>).\nThe rich young ruler could not\ncomply because he had many possessions, and as a result he went away sorrowing.\n<\/p><p>\nJudas Iscariot thought he could get nowhere without money, so he betrayed\nhis Lord for thirty pieces of silver\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34982\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34982)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34982)\">Matt. 26:15<\/a><\/span>).\nThe sequence to that is that Judas hanged himself\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34987\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34987)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34987)\">Matt. 27:5<\/a><\/span>). I know\na man who gave up his responsibilities in the Church in order to make money. As a result he\nis wealthy, and has become a power in the business world, but I now observe that he has lost\nhis family and destroyed his chances and his opportunities for a place in God's kingdom. That\nis tragic, my brethren and sisters.\n<\/p><p>\nI know another man who gave up his position in a large business concern rather than give up\nhis calling as a bishop. I loved that man. He died a year ago, but he left his widow enough\nfor her care while she lives, and I have observed that his sons are recognized leaders in the\nbusiness world. The Lord blesses devotion and faithful performance.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been reading just recently the life of Dr. Karl G. Maeser. Brother Maeser was a\nremarkable man. Somewhere in the book it tells about a group of missionaries who had met\ntogether in Meissen, Germany, the birthplace of Dr. Maeser. One of the missionaries made\nthis remark: \"Think what Dr. Maeser has done for the Church.\" Another responded promptly:\n\"Think what the Church has done for Dr. Maeser.\" That remark offers a real suggestion. Have\nyou ever stopped to think what the Church has done for you individually? How it has\nenriched your life? How it has given you courage and strength to go forward in your daily\npursuits, and how it has brought you comfort in times of sorrow and distress? It is wonderful\nto belong to the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nMany of our leaders, past and present have made great contributions to the Church. I know\nmen who have laid upon the altar every worldly possession they had for the gospel's sake.\n<\/p><p>\nThey have gone into strange lands, sometimes far away from home and friends, to teach the\ngospel of the kingdom, and to explain God's revealed plan of salvation to others. Dr. Maeser,\nas I have read, was reared in an environment of culture and refinement. He associated with\nthe elite in Germany. He had access to libraries. He was familiar with the best books of his\nday. His education was broad and varied and included the study of music and art and several\nlanguages. God in his own way had prepared Dr. Maeser for his mission in the Church among\nthe Latter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nI can well imagine that it was difficult for Dr. Maeser to make the adjustment, yet I am sure\nthat this good and great man did not complain nor compromise. He did not permit difficulties\nto obscure his vision of the truth. Brother Maeser had heard the voice of the Shepherd. That\nvoice brought conviction to his soul. That conviction transformed his entire life but whatever\nhappened, confusion and uncertainty disappeared, and he stood for the first time on the solid\nfoundation of faith in the True and Living God.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren and sisters, may we appreciate our membership in this great Church. May we have\nthe courage and the strength to devote ourselves unselfishly for the promotion of God's work\namong his children. That is our responsibility. It is our obligation, and may we not fail\ntherein, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
