It had to do with the call of the First Presidency for me to come to their office on a day that I shall never forget\u2014April 20, 1935. I was city commissioner in Salt Lake City. I was a stake president.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p5\" class=\"\">We had been wrestling with this question of welfare. There were few government work programs; the finances of the Church were low; we were told that there wasn\u2019t much that could be done so far as the finances of the Church were concerned. And here we were with 4,800 of our 7,300 people who were wholly or partially dependent. We had only one place to go, and that was to apply the Lord\u2019s program as set forth in the revelations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p6\" class=\"\">It was from our humble efforts that the First Presidency, knowing that we had had some experience, called me one morning asking if I would come to their office. It was Saturday morning; there were no calls on their calendar, and for hours in that forenoon they talked with me and told me that they wanted me to resign from the city commission, and they would release me from being stake president; that they wished me now to head up the welfare movement to turn the tide from government relief, direct relief, and help to put the Church in a position where it could take care of its own needy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p7\" class=\"\">After that morning I rode in my car (spring was just breaking) up to the head of City Creek Canyon into what was then called Rotary Park; and there, all by myself, I offered one of the most humble prayers of my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p8\" class=\"\">There I was, just a young man in my thirties. My experience had been limited. I was born in a little country town in Idaho. I had hardly been outside the boundaries of the states of Utah and Idaho.

It was as though something were saying to me, \u201cThere is no new organization necessary to take care of the needs of this people. All that is necessary is to put the priesthood of God to work.

The first is the spread of rumor and gossip (we have mentioned this before) which, when once started, gains momentum as each telling becomes more fanciful, until unwittingly those who wish to dwell on the sensational repeat them in firesides, in classes, in Relief Society gatherings and priesthood quorum classes without first verifying the source before becoming a party to causing speculation and discussions that steal time away from the things that would be profitable and beneficial and enlightening to their souls.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p28\" class=\"\">Just an example: I understand that there is a widely circulated story that I was alleged to have had a patriarchal blessing (I don\u2019t know whether any of you have heard about that) that had to do with the coming of the Savior and the ten tribes of Israel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p29\" class=\"\">In the first place, a patriarchal blessing is a sacred document to the person who has received it and is never given for publication and, as all patriarchal blessings, should be kept as a private possession to the one who has received it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p30\" class=\"\">And second, with reference to that which I was alleged to have had, suffice it to say that such a quotation is incorrect and without foundation in fact.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p31\" class=\"\">There is one thing that shocks me: I have learned, in some instances, that those who have heard of these rumors are disappointed when I tell them they are not so.

Sometimes these have come to men and women who because of transgression became easy prey to the Arch-Deceiver. At other times people who pride themselves on their strict observance of the rules and ordinances and ceremonies of the Church are led astray by false spirits, who exercise an influence so imitative of that which proceeds from at Divine source that even these persons, who think they are \u2018the very elect,\u2019 find it difficult to discern the essential difference. Satan himself has transformed himself to be apparently \u2018an angel of light.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p35\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen visions, dreams, tongues, prophecy, impressions or an extraordinary gift or inspiration convey something out of harmony with the accepted revelations of the Church or contrary to the decisions of its constituted authorities, Latter-day Saints may know that it is not of God, no matter how plausible it may appear. Also, they should understand that directions for the guidance of the Church will come, by revelation, through the head. All faithful members are entitled to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit for themselves, their families, and for those over whom they are appointed and ordained to preside. But anything at discord with that which comes from God through the head of the Church is not to be received as authoritative or reliable. In secular as well as spiritual affairs, Saints may receive Divine guidance and revelation affecting themselves, but this does not convey authority to direct others, and is not to be accepted when contrary to Church covenants, doctrine or discipline, or to known facts, demonstrated truths, or good common sense. No person has the right to induce his fellow members of the Church to engage in speculations or take stock in ventures of any kind on the specious claim of Divine revelation or vision or dream, especially when it is in opposition to the voice of recognized authority, local or general. The Lord\u2019s Church \u2018is a house of order.\u2019 It is not governed by individual gifts or manifestations, but by the order and power of the Holy Priesthood as sustained by the voice and vote of the Church in its appointed conferences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p36\" class=\"\">\u201cThe history of the Church records many pretended revelations claimed by impostors or zealots who believed in the manifestations they sought to lead other persons to accept, and in every instance, disappointment, sorrow and disaster have resulted therefrom.

And he warns us if we are not one, we are not his, as he has declared in the Doctrine and Covenants [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"15877\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15877)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15877)\">D&amp;C 38:27<\/a><\/span>].<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p66\" class=\"\">There are one or two things I should like to say about myself and this present responsibility. Never had I thought of myself as one day becoming the President of the Church. As a boy in my rural community, I used to hear the brethren talk about a \u201cpillar\u201d in the Church. I wondered what in the world it meant. It must be something great to be a pillar in the Church. Well, now, maybe I am beginning to realize something about what that means, but I know this: those who try to guess ahead of time as to who is going to be the next President of the Church are just gambling as they might be on a horse race, because only the Lord has the time table.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p67\" class=\"\">I remember one time Elder Charles A. Callis in a Council of the Twelve meeting. There was a rather spirited discussion on some questions. One of the Brethren said, \u201cYou had better listen to Brother George Albert Smith, the President of the Twelve, because he may be the next President of the Church.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p68\" class=\"\">Brother Callis smiled and said, \u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t be too sure. Three times in my life I have chosen the next President of the Church, and all three of them died before they came to the presidency.\u201d The Lord only knows, and for us to speculate or to presume is not pleasing in the sight of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p69\" class=\"\">I have one other thought I should like to express. Brigham Young was a great defender of the Prophet Joseph Smith. There were Judases in the ranks in that day, just as there were in the Savior\u2019s day, and just as we have today, some who are members of the Church who are undercutting us, who are betraying their trusts. We are shocked when we see the places from which some of these things come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p70\" class=\"\">Brigham Young was invited by some of these men who were trying to depose the Prophet Joseph from his position as President of the Church; but they made a mistake by inviting President Brigham Young into their circle. And after he had listened to what their motives were, he said something to this effect: \u201cI want to say something to you men. You cannot destroy the appointment of a prophet of God, but you can cut the thread that binds you to the prophet of God, and sink yourselves to hell.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p71\" class=\"\">There was a pugilist there by the name of Jacob Bump, so the story goes, who doubled up his fists and started toward President Young, who replied to this man\u2019s threats: \u201cI would like to lay hands on a man like you in defense of the Prophet Joseph Smith.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p72\" class=\"\">Remember that, brethren. You cannot destroy the appointments of the prophets of God. The Lord knows whom he wants to preside in his church, and sometimes it takes a lot of practicing, guiding, testing, before he may know whether or not one of us is prepared for the present assignment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p73\" class=\"\">Now I think it is folly for one to compare one President of the Church with another. No one takes the place of another President of the Church. Each President has his own place. I had a lesson taught me some years ago when, in company with one of the brethren, I had reorganized the presidency of the Ensign Stake. We had named the bishop of one of the wards as stake president. It was near the end of the year, and he elected to remain as bishop, along with his first counselor, who was a bishop, until they had closed the books at the end of the year.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p74\" class=\"\">Six weeks after they were sustained, the stake president suddenly passed away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p75\" class=\"\">Then I began to receive a barrage of letters. Where in the world was the inspiration for you to call a man whom the Lord was going to let die in six weeks? They invited me to talk at his services, and some seemed to be expecting me to try to explain why I had appointed a man that the Lord was going to take home in six weeks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p76\" class=\"\">President Joseph Fielding Smith sat on the stand and heard my attempt to satisfy these people, and he said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t you let that bother you. If you have called a man to a position in this church and he dies the next day, that position would have a bearing on what he will be called to do when he leaves this earth.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p77\" class=\"\">I believe that. I believe that every President of this church, every apostle of this church, every bishop, every stake president, every presiding position will have a bearing on what one is called to do when he leaves this earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p78\" class=\"\">And so, when you think of one President taking the place of another, he doesn\u2019t. That President maintains his own place. We shouldn\u2019t try to compare one as being greater than this one or greater than the other, because each one is, in the eyes of the Lord, in his own time the one most needed for that particular time. You may be sure of that.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p79\" class=\"\">Now, just one final thought. I sat in a class in Sunday School in my own ward one day, and the teacher was the son of a patriarch. He said he used to take down the blessings of his father, and he noticed that his father gave what he called \u201ciffy\u201d blessings. He would give a blessing, but it was predicated on \u201cif you will not do this\u201d or \u201cif you will cease doing that.\u201d And he said, \u201cI watched these men to whom my father gave the \u2018iffy\u2019 blessings, and I saw that many of them did not heed the warning that my father as a patriarch had given, and the blessings were never received because they did not comply.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p80\" class=\"\">You know, this started me thinking. I went back into the Doctrine and Covenants and began to read the \u201ciffy\u201d revelations that have been given to the various brethren in the Church. If you want to have an exercise in something that will startle you, read some of the warnings that were given through the Prophet Joseph Smith to Thomas B. Marsh, Martin Harris, some of the Whitmer brothers, William E. McLellin\u2014warnings which, had they heeded, some would not have fallen by the wayside. But because they did not heed, and they didn\u2019t clear up their lives, they fell by the wayside, and some had to be dropped from membership in the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p81\" class=\"\">Now, there is one thing that I think we should all be mindful of. I was with a group of missionaries in the temple one day. A question was asked by one of the sisters about the Word of Wisdom, concerning the promise made that if one would keep the Word of Wisdom he should run and not be weary and should walk and not faint [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"117760\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117760)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117760)\">D&amp;C 89:20<\/a><\/span>]. And she said, \u201cHow could that promise be realized if a person were crippled? How could he receive the blessing that he could run and not be weary, and walk and not faint, if he were crippled?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p82\" class=\"\">I answered her, \u201cDid you ever doubt the Lord? The Lord said that.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p83\" class=\"\">The trouble with us today, there are too many of us who put question marks instead of periods after what the Lord says. I want you to think about that. We shouldn\u2019t be concerned about why he said something, or whether or not it can be made so. Just trust the Lord. We don\u2019t try to find the answers or explanations. We shouldn\u2019t try to spend time explaining what the Lord didn\u2019t see fit to explain. We spend useless time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p84\" class=\"\">If you would teach our people to put periods and not question marks after what the Lord has declared, we would say, \u201cIt is enough for me to know that is what the Lord said.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p85\" class=\"\">Elder Gordon B.
