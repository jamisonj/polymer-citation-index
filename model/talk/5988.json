If not, seek other ways to serve that meet your present circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/why-every-member-a-missionary.p15\" class=\"\">As you ponder how to serve, consider where you can best participate in the steps that must unfold for a family or an individual to receive enduring conversion and full gospel blessings. First, the family or individual needs to be identified and prepared to receive the gospel. There follows a <span class=\"emphasis\">doctrinal conversion.<\/span> That is, an understanding of new doctrines and prayer for confirmation of their truthfulness. As the teachings are practiced and the commandments lived, a testimony is gained, and conversion and baptism result. This effort is best performed by full-time missionaries working with stake missionaries supported by caring members. They systematically present doctrinal principles and are carefully trained to teach and testify of these truths.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/why-every-member-a-missionary.p16\" class=\"\">Simultaneously with doctrinal conversion there must be a <span class=\"emphasis\">social transition.<\/span> Friends, habits, customs, and traditions not in harmony with the life of a Latter-day Saint are abandoned, replaced by new friends and activities that support a new life. Of the two important changes that must occur in a convert\u2019s life\u2014the gaining of a testimony, or doctrinal conversion, and learning how to live as a Latter-day Saint, or the social transition\u2014the latter is the most difficult to achieve. It is best accomplished with the love and support of members. Your worthy example and caring support can lead them through each step required to learn to live as a Latter-day Saint.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/why-every-member-a-missionary.p17\" class=\"\">This social transition requires careful nurturing and help to teach new patterns of life, to introduce new friends, and to assist the new converts to be obedient and begin to serve in the Church. In his last conference message, as the representative of the Lord, President Hinckley stressed this vital role of members and leaders to help each new convert feel comfortable and be sustained in living the requirements of a new life. He said, \u201cWith the ever-increasing number of converts, we must make an increasingly substantial effort to assist them as they find their way.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-97911_000_017\">6<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cConverts and Young Men,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1997, 47.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/why-every-member-a-missionary.p18\" class=\"\">As you ponder and pray about how you can serve as a member missionary, consider three categories of service available to you and determine which best meets your current circumstances.

They include helping to find, convert, and retain new members. The stake or full-time missionaries can teach you how to do that.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/why-every-member-a-missionary.p21\" class=\"\">You can help the full-time and stake missionaries bring new investigators to church and make them feel comfortable. Let them know that they have a new friend. Strengthen that friendship by inviting them to your home or to Church activities with you. You can support them in obeying the commandments. Such valuable missionary service is not difficult because it can be carried out in the normal routine of your daily life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/why-every-member-a-missionary.p22\" class=\"\">There are other ways you may not think of as missionary service. For example, a young mother can teach each growing son to prepare to be a missionary to preach the gospel and to share his testimony of truth. As mother and father cultivate that thought throughout his growing years, he will be a missionary. That is excellent missionary service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/why-every-member-a-missionary.p23\" class=\"\">You may choose to identify your ancestors and arrange for the ordinance work for them to be done in the temples, or if near a temple, have the blessing of performing those ordinances vicariously yourself.

Invite those who have heard these messages to a family home evening, a Church activity or meeting.

They include traditional service such as a stake missionary or a ward mission leader. There are also a wide variety of other part-time service opportunities in almost every branch of Church activity, such as the temple, family history, welfare, education, and public affairs. If you have a particular talent to share, contact your bishop. There will almost certainly be a need for your skills.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Serving a Full-Time Mission<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/why-every-member-a-missionary.p30\" class=\"\">President Hinckley extends the call for missions of 40 hours or more a week at home or elsewhere in the world. If you are a physically able, emotionally stable young man, pray about the opportunity and responsibility you have to the Lord to prepare yourself to be a full-time missionary. That includes understanding the scriptures, being obedient, keeping yourself clean, pure, and worthy to be endowed in the temple. When of age, accept a call by the President of the Church to serve for two years as an emissary of the Lord. I encourage you with every capacity that I have to pray about a full-time mission for the fulfillment it will bring to your life as you bless others to find the truth and receive the ordinances of salvation. Everything that I cherish in life today began to mature from my sacred experience as a full-time missionary.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/why-every-member-a-missionary.p31\" class=\"\">There is an urgent need in the Church today for missionary couples, not to go first-contacting or teaching the discussions, unless you want to do so, but for meaningful missionary service in all of the activities of the Church throughout the world. There is far greater flexibility in the service opportunities of couples than for single elders or sisters. In consultation with your bishop, you can indicate your own preferences for missionary service. We must train a growing number of fathers and mothers and priesthood and auxiliary leaders throughout the world who want very much to serve the Lord but simply do not know how to do it. You can help them as a leadership missionary couple. You can serve in temples, family history, educational and medical activities, welfare service projects, public affairs, and visitors\u2019 centers. There is a need for almost every discipline of life. There is undoubtedly a need somewhere in the world for your unique capacities and talents. Often special health considerations can be accommodated. The feelings you express to the bishop are communicated in a recommendation for a call. The President of the Church has made it possible for those calls to be inspired of the Lord, taking into consideration your special needs and desires as a couple. Stake presidents and bishops are kept aware of current full-time missionary needs. If you cannot find anyone locally to identify potential missionary opportunities, write to the Missionary Department at headquarters. We will send you a list of the current needs. I encourage each couple with available time to prayerfully consider a full-time mission. You will be greatly blessed for the courage to accept a call. Your children and grandchildren will be positively influenced for good as witnessed by many couples who have honorably served, some on their third, fourth, or fifth mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/why-every-member-a-missionary.p32\" class=\"\">Don\u2019t wait to be asked.

While some will approach you, a greater number can be identified and encouraged to submit papers for a call through your prayerful efforts. Church service has always been based on an inspired call rather than volunteerism.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/why-every-member-a-missionary.p34\" class=\"\">Why every member a missionary? Because that is what the Lord has asked us to do. Prayerfully consider it. There are those who would forever call you the angel of understanding and compassion that led them to the truth, fortified them in their faith, or helped them learn to serve the Lord. Do it. Talk to your bishop. Let him help you see the possibilities for joy unbounded in some aspect of \u201cevery member a missionary.\u201d You will find a renewal of life, excitement, and a deep feeling of personal fulfillment from having the courage to accept a call as a missionary.
