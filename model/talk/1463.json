We are constantly amazed at modern development, yet we have\nlearned to expect the ever-expanding progress stemming from the mind of man and as the\nresult of his genius.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"A little lower than the angels\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?\n<\/p><p>\n\"For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and\nhonour\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41856\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41856)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41856)\">Ps. 8:4-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe evidence of man's accomplishments has firmly planted in the modern mind the conviction\nof man's greatness&mdash;just a little lower than the angels and crowned with glory and honor.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Men are free moral agents<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSince the beginning, men have been born free moral agents with the freedom to choose\nbetween good or evil.\n<\/p><p>\nEven in the preexistence the spirit children of the father had their choice.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . for, behold, the devil was before Adam, for he rebelled against me, saying, Give me\nthine honor, which is my power; and also a third part of the hosts of heaven turned he away\nfrom me because of their agency\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14749\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14749)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14749)\">D&amp;C 29:36<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis same choice was given to the first man placed upon the earth, for after he was formed\nand placed amid the abundance that had been created the Lord said: \"Of every tree of the\ngarden thou mayest freely eat, But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt\nnot eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39260\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39260)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39260)\">Moses 3:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the children of Israel stood on the threshold of the Promised Land, they faced the choice\nthat was given to them. Israel was clearly told of the consequences of its decision. There was\nno neutral ground in the statement of the Lord to them: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; \n<\/p><p>\n<b>A blessing and a curse<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you this\nday: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21259\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21259)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21259)\">Deut. 11:26-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the writings of Nephi we read of the instructions given by Lehi to his sons regarding this\nsame inherent agency: \"Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are\ngiven them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal\nlife, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the\ncaptivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all man might be miserable like unto\nhimself\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3748\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3748)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3748)\">2 Ne. 2:27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Without compulsion<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThere has never been a time when man has been forced to do good or forced to obey the\ncommandments of God. He has always been given his free choice&mdash;his free moral agency. If\none looks back through the events of history, there come into view the results of the greatness\nof men who kept the commandments of the Lord and made the choice on his side. One also\nsees strewn along the wayside the ruins that stand as silent reminders of those who chose\notherwise. Both had their free moral agency.\n<\/p><p>\nIn spite of the greatness of man and his accomplishments in the modern world, we observe\nthe lack of faith in God and the absence of repentance, which has also been characteristic of\nthose in the past who would not heed the commandments of God or the warnings of a\nprophet. Peace does not exist among men today. World leaders appear helpless to formulate a\nsolution, and many of them have no regard for the principles of righteousness that would bring\npeace. The Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount have been set aside by those\nwho formerly professed belief in them.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Offenses against morality<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMorality appears to have been lost in the maze of human philosophies. We see it in the lives\nof individuals, people in high places in government, and even leaders of industry and labor.\nMany churches in the world are announcing compromises of their tenets so as not to offend\nthe modern thinking of their membership. The cry has gone up from some pulpits that God is\ndead. When God ceases to live in the minds and hearts of men and women, moral concepts collapse\nand only disaster can result.\n<\/p><p>\nIn this community crime is increasing. It is on the increase in all states of the union and all\nover the world. There is a growing disregard for law and order, a turn toward riot and mob\nrule, and in some cases total defiance of man's basic rights of life, liberty, and pursuit of\nhappiness. The crimes of our generation are not excelled by any of the past, although we may\nread history and cringe at the atrocities.\n<\/p><p>\nThe loss of morality extends up to the great commanders of the earth as well as down to the\nsingle individual man. The stability of the family has been affected, as demonstrated by the\nupsurge of the divorce rate. Juvenile delinquency is accepted. It is not a matter of how it can\nbe reduced, but how the acceleration can be held in moderation, as one authority has stated.\nThe use of liquor and addiction to tobacco are on the increase; sexual morality is being\nscoffed at in many modern circles; free love is tolerated and even advocated; venereal diseases\namong teenagers as well as others have taken a sharp upturn. In short, the will to resist evil\nseems to be vanishing. I have asked myself, and I ask you this question: What is the reason\nfor these appalling circumstances in a world in which man has made such outstanding\nachievements in learning?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Sin alienates man from God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAs I read the Old and New Testaments and also the Book of Mormon, I find that man has\ntwo theological concerns involving himself: his sins and his salvation. When man sins he\nsuffers its painful effects. There are few chapters in these books that do not contain some\nreference to what sin is or does. The predominant conception of the nature of sin in these\nbooks is that of a personal alienation from God. We must conclude, therefore, that the\nvanishing resistance to evil in the world is caused by this personal alienation from our\nHeavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Follow the course of righteousness<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nLet us ask this question: What causes some men in a declining morality to shun evil and\nwrongdoing and to follow the course of righteousness in their temporal, moral, and spiritual\nlives? In my mind, there are three reasons for this phenomenon, and it is to these three points\nI would like to address my remarks.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first is fear. It is said that man fears God, but such an emotion is ambiguous, for it may\nboth repel and attract. I am mindful of the conclusion reached by the writer of the book of\nEcclesiastes in the admonition: Fear God, and keep his commandments (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21417\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21417)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21417)\">Eccl. 12:13<\/a><\/span>). The\nword fear and its synonyms occur several hundred times in the Bible, and I believe we would\nagree that a summary of scripture would indicate that the law is to love the Lord absolutely\nand exclusively. Many people, however, are compelled to do good because of fear&mdash;fear of\nthe law, fear of the unknown, fear of the Almighty. In the book of Revelation, John\ncatalogues fear with expressions of other evil doings in these words: \n<\/p><p>\n\"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers and\nsorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire\nand brimstone\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42405\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42405)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42405)\">Rev. 21:7-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Love of God will drive out fear<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTo the restored Church the Lord has stated time and time again that fear is not of God and\nwill not enter the hearts of those who love the Lord and live righteously: \"Wherefore, be of\ngood cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14810\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14810)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14810)\">D&amp;C 68:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many people who live the so-called good life because of fear, but as Christians we\nmust not serve for this reason. Fear must be banished from our hearts. In one of the epistles\nof John he wrote: \"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear\nhath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1082\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1082)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1082)\">1 Jn. 4:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe second reason for men to shun evil, pursue righteousness, and serve their fellowmen is\nduty. Often we hear men say they do certain things because it is their duty. One great writer\nhas penned: \"The duty of man . . . is plain and simple, and consists but of two points&mdash;his\nduty to God, which every man must feel; and, with respect to his neighbor, to do as he would\nbe done by.\" (Thomas Paine) Do we have a responsibility beyond that which it is our duty to\nperform? The parable Jesus gave of the farmer and his servant is a direct answer to this\nquestion: \n<\/p><p>\n\"But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by,\nwhen he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?\n<\/p><p>\n\"And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and\nserve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.\n<\/p><p>\n\"So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We\nare unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31679\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31679)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31679)\">Luke 17:7-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nEven though the servant had come in from the field tired and weary, it was his duty to gird\nhimself and serve his master's meal. It was never supposed that the master would wait on the\nservant. The servant is expected to wait on the master. He does not expect a word of\nappreciation, because under his agreement he is only doing that which was his duty to do.\nMen who only carry out that which is within their duty and go no further have no claim to\nany reward beyond the scope of that duty and are unprofitable servants.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Love of God makes obedience easy and natural<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord requires obedience not because it is our duty nor because we fear him. Let me read\nfrom the 58th section of the Doctrine and Covenants: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all\nthings, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their\nown free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; \n<\/p><p>\n\"For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do\ngood they shall in nowise lose their reward.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But he that doeth not anything until he is\ncommanded, and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with\nslothfulness, the same is damned.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Who am I that made man, saith the Lord, that will hold him guiltless that obeys not my\ncommandments?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14792\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14792)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14792)\">D&amp;C 58:26-30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow I come to the third reason, which in my opinion ought to be the objective of all men\neverywhere. The greatest motivating influence for righteousness and for service to one's\nfellowmen is the divine principle of love. The answer Jesus gave to the scribe is a summary\nof the law: \n<\/p><p>\n<b>Love of God and of man<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all\nthy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none\nother commandment greater than these\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33188\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33188)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33188)\">Mark 12:30-31<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJesus revealed the meaning of love by his life, and the perfect example of love was given to\nus by the Father in the offering of his divine Son: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in\nhim should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28232\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28232)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28232)\">John 3:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his\nbrother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?\n<\/p><p>\n\"And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1084\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1084)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1084)\">1 Jn. 4:20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe logic of this is simple, clear, and unequivocal: the proof of love of God is love of one's\nbrother. This becomes the fundamental commandment of Christianity. This was the religion\ntaught by the Master. How happy would society be were these two plain, rational precepts\nproperly observed: Love me, and love thy fellows.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The way to peace and goodwill among men<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe living of this commandment by all men would restore peace to the earth. It would cause\nthem to love the Lord and thereby keep his commandments; thus the troubles of our age\nwould vanish, and man's happiness in a moral world would result. The motivating influences\ngenerated within man through fear, his obligation to duty, or deep sense of love can turn the\ntide of the declining morality of our generation. The greatest of these is love. We must strive\nto obtain this virtue if we are to serve the Lord without faltering or growing weary in our\npursuit of eternal life. We will do this not because of fear, nor merely because it is our duty,\nbut because we have sought for and obtained the greatest of all virtues, love.\n<\/p><p>\nI know that God lives, that he is our Father, that he has given to each of his sons and\ndaughters free moral agency, that his Son, the Redeemer of the world, through love, gave his\nlife that each of us may have eternal life. I pray that we shall exercise that agency which we\nhave been given by loving the Lord and our neighbor (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35620\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35620)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35620)\">Matt. 22:37,39<\/a><\/span>),\nin the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
