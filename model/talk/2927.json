In times of urgent need, after meditation and prayer to receive confirmation of a selected course of action, those promptings have given the comforted feeling that it was right. Other times, without beckoning, counsel and instruction and assurance have come through the power of the Holy Ghost; and then, at times, there have flooded into my mind and heart warnings of impending danger that would have otherwise overtaken me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/gratitude.p13\" class=\"\">Yes, I know that Spencer W.
