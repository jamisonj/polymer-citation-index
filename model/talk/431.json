Then I thought of another scripture:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . I lay down my life for the sheep. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down\nmyself (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27372\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27372)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27372)\">John 10:15,18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27380\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27380)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27380)\">John 15:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTaking these two quotations together, we see the gift of the Father and of the Son to the\nworld, of all that the atonement meant of mental and physical suffering in life, and in his\ndeath upon the cross, of which it can be said in truth, that as a gift to mankind it was the\ngreatest ever given; a sacrifice, the greatest ever made; a service, the greatest ever rendered; a\ndemonstration of love such as is possessed only by the Gods.\n<\/p><p>\nWORK OF CHRIST TRACED\n<\/p><p>\nI would like, if possible, for us to become better acquainted with our Lord and Savior, Jesus\nChrist, and his life's work, that knowing him better, we might love\nhim more, and loving him more, serve him better, and thereby obtain eternal life, God's\ngreatest gift to man.\n<\/p><p>\nQuoting from Isaiah, 53rd Chapter:\n<\/p><p>\nHe is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief:\nand we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him\nnot.\n<\/p><p>\nSurely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him\nstricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.\n<\/p><p>\nBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the\nchastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\nand the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25101\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25101)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25101)\">Isa. 53:3-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nUnder the direction of the Father, he created the heavens and the earth and all things existing\nthereon, as attested by scriptures.\n<\/p><p>\nAll things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was\nmade (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27350\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27350)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27350)\">John 1:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd worlds without number have I created; . . . and by the Son I created them,\nwhich is mine Only Begotten\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38962\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38962)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38962)\">Moses 1:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBehold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, who created the heavens and\nthe earth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12599\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12599)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12599)\">D&amp;C 14:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJesus Christ ministered as the God of this world from the beginning until he came to earth in\nthe meridian of time.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord; And I appeared\nunto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by\nmy name Jehovah was I not known to them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22595\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22595)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22595)\">Ex. 6:2-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand and on\nthis night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5480\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5480)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5480)\">3 Ne. 1:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPHYSICAL APPEARANCE OF CHRIST\n<\/p><p>\nThe following is taken from \"Conscript Fathers.\" I quote:\n<\/p><p>\nIn these our days appeared a man named Jesus Christ, who is yet living among us,\nand of the Gentiles is accepted as a Prophet of great truth; but his own disciples\ncall him the Son of God. He hath raised the dead and cured all manner of\ndiseases. He is a man of stature somewhat tall and comely, with a ruddy\ncountenance, such as the beholder may both love and fear. His hair is the color of\na filbert when fully ripe, plain to his ear, whence downward it is more of orient\ncolor, curling and waving on his shoulders; in the middle of his head is a seam of\nlong hair, after the manner of the Nazarites. His forehead is plain and delicate, the\nface without spot or wrinkle, beautiful with a comely red; his nose and mouth are\nexactly formed; his beard is the color of his hair and thick, not of any length, but\nforked. In reproving he is terrible; in admonishing, courteous; in speaking, very\nmodest and wise; in proportion of body, well-shaped. None has seen him laugh,\nmany have seen him weep. A man, for his surpassing beauty, excelling the\nchildren of men. (<i>Heart Throbs<\/i>, Vol. 1, page 425.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe following pen picture of the Savior was written by J. A. Francis of Los Angeles\nand is just as true as if it had been spoken by one of the prophets:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Here is a man who was born in an obscure village, the child of a peasant woman. He grew\nup in another obscure village. He worked in a carpenter shop until he was thirty, and then for\nthree years he was an itinerant preacher. He never wrote a book. He never held an office. He\nnever went to college. He never put his foot inside a big city. He never traveled two hundred\nmiles from the place where he was born. He never did one of the things that usually\naccompanies greatness. He had no credentials <i>but himself<\/i>. He had nothing to do with, in this\nworld, except <i>the naked power of his divine manhood.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\n\"While still a young man, the tide of popular opinion turned against him. His friends ran\naway. One of them denied him; another betrayed him. He was turned over to his enemies. He\nwent through the mockery of a trial. He was nailed on the cross between two thieves. His\nexecutioners gambled for the only piece of property he had on earth while he was yet dying,\nand that was his cloak. When he was dead, he was taken down and laid in a borrowed grave\nthrough the pity of a friend.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Nineteen wide centuries have come and gone, and today he is the center of the human race\nand the leader of the column of progress. I am far within the mark when I say that all the\narmies that ever marched, and all the navies that were ever built, and all the parliaments that\never sat, and all the kings that ever reigned put together have not affected the life of man\nupon this earth as profitably as has <i>that one solitary man.<\/i>\"\n<\/p><p>\nPARALLEL IN LIVES OF SAVIOR AND JOSEPH SMITH\n<\/p><p>\nIn the life and accomplishments of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, we see a strong resemblance to\nthat of the Savior. When the Savior chose his twelve disciples, he chose them from the\nhumble walks of life. It is the Lord's way.\n<\/p><p>\nFor ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not\nmany mighty, not many noble, are called;\n<\/p><p>\nBut God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath\nchosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;\n<\/p><p>\nAnd base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen,\nyea, the things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:\n<\/p><p>\nThat no flesh should glory in his presence\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3015\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3015)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3015)\">2 Cor. 1:26-29<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nVerily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph Smith, I am well pleased\nwith your offering and acknowledgements, which you have made; for unto this\nend have I raised you up, that I might show forth my wisdom through the weak\nthings of the earth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12731\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12731)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12731)\">D&amp;C 124:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph Smith was\nborn of humble parentage in an obscure village. He never went to college nor\nattended high school, but he accomplished in the short period of his life of\nthirty-eight and one-half years more than any other mortal man of his time, if not\nof all time. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were martyrs to the truth. They\nwere murdered in cold blood by a disguised and ruthless mob.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the short life of the Prophet Joseph Smith he was instrumental in the hands of the\nLord in the establishment of the Church and kingdom of God on earth as seen in vision by\nthe Prophet Daniel (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10604\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10604)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10604)\">Dan. 2:35-45<\/a><\/span>).\nThrough him the everlasting gospel in its fulness was restored, with all its\ngifts, blessings, principles, and ordinances, and the power and authority of the priesthood to\nadminister the ordinances of the gospel to the children of men, who, by repentance and\nobedience, are prepared to receive them.\n<\/p><p>\nThe works of Joseph Smith and the spirit that prompted them live on in the hearts and lives\nof his followers who are numbered by the hundreds of thousands now living and have\ninfluenced the lives of other hundreds of thousands who have gone to their reward.\n<\/p><p>\nMore than a century has passed since the martyrdom of the Prophet, but his works and the\nspirit which actuated them are increasing in the earth. Many have died for the religion\nestablished by the Prophet Joseph Smith, and there are many thousands today who would do\nlikewise if necessary. He gave his life for the cause and, like the Savior, sealed his testimony\nwith his blood.\n<\/p><p>\nPERSONAL TESTIMONY\n<\/p><p>\nAs a witness for the Lord Jesus Christ, I bear you my testimony that God the Eternal Father\nlives, a glorified and exalted being, having a body of flesh, bones, and spirit as tangible as\nman's (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12737\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12737)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12737)\">D&amp;C 130:22<\/a><\/span>),\nand that he has revealed himself anew to the world through the instrumentality of the\nProphet Joseph Smith (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50055\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50055)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50055)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>),\nwhom he raised up to be the mighty Prophet of the last days; that\nJesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior and Redeemer of the world; that Joseph Smith was\na Prophet of the Living God; and that the work in which we, as Latter-day Saints, are\nengaged is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, which all men must receive if they would be\nsaved in the kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear this testimony to you and to all the world, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
