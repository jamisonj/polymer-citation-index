The Prophet Joseph Smith explained that \u201cbaptism is a holy ordinance preparatory to the reception of the Holy Ghost; it is the channel and key by which the Holy Ghost will be administered. The Gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, cannot be received through the medium of any other principle than the principle of righteousness\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings: Joseph Smith,<\/span> 95\u201396).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/receive-the-holy-ghost.p20\" class=\"\">The ordinance of confirming a new member of the Church and bestowing the gift of the Holy Ghost is both simple and profound. Worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holders place their hands upon the head of an individual and call him or her by name. Then, by the authority of the holy priesthood and in the name of the Savior, the individual is confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and this important phrase is uttered: \u201cReceive the Holy Ghost.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/receive-the-holy-ghost.p21\" class=\"\">The simplicity of this ordinance may cause us to overlook its significance. These four words\u2014\u201cReceive the Holy Ghost\u201d\u2014are not a passive pronouncement; rather, they constitute a priesthood injunction\u2014an authoritative admonition to act and not simply to be acted upon (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120962\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120962)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120962)\">2\u00a0Nephi 2:26<\/a><\/span>). The Holy Ghost does not become operative in our lives merely because hands are placed upon our heads and those four important words are spoken. As we receive this ordinance, each of us accepts a sacred and ongoing responsibility to desire, to seek, to work, and to so live that we indeed \u201creceive the Holy Ghost\u201d and its attendant spiritual gifts. \u201cFor what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift?

Conversely, casualness about or the breaking of covenants and commitments, failing to pray and study the scriptures, and inappropriate thoughts, actions, and language cause the Spirit to withdraw from or to avoid us altogether.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/receive-the-holy-ghost.p31\" class=\"\">As King Benjamin taught his people, \u201cAnd now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have known and have been taught all these things, if ye should transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom\u2019s paths that ye may be blessed, prospered, and preserved\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120966\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120966)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120966)\">Mosiah 2:36<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Faithfully Obey<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/receive-the-holy-ghost.p33\" class=\"\">Faithfully obeying God\u2019s commandments is essential to receiving the Holy Ghost.
