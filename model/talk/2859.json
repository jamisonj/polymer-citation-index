I have never understood how to love a spirit that I don\u2019t know. When I was baptized, I accepted Christ because I have always been told that if I wasn\u2019t saved, I would go to hell. Being \u2018saved\u2019 has always been thrown at me. I haven\u2019t gone to church in a very long time because I was always being pushed into something I didn\u2019t, and still don\u2019t, quite understand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/everything-to-gain-nothing-to-lose.p8\" class=\"\">\u201c[Someone] showed me a pamphlet, \u2018Man\u2019s Search for Happiness,\u2019 and explained what it said.

If that is a problem, there is a story from the Old Testament I should like to give you:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/everything-to-gain-nothing-to-lose.p42\" class=\"\">Naaman was captain of the host of the king of Syria, a great man, \u201ca mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.\u201d And Naaman\u2019s wife had a little maid, a daughter of Israel, who said to her mistress: \u201cWould God my lord [Naaman] were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/everything-to-gain-nothing-to-lose.p43\" class=\"\">When Naaman heard this he prepared rich gifts and a letter to the king of Israel. But the king, learning of the reason for Naaman\u2019s coming, was frightened, for he had not the power to cleanse the leper. Then Elisha the prophet sent word to the king that he would deal with the captain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/everything-to-gain-nothing-to-lose.p44\" class=\"\">\u201cSo Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/everything-to-gain-nothing-to-lose.p45\" class=\"\">But Elisha did not even so much as go out to greet the captain. He sent a messenger to Naaman saying, \u201cGo and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/everything-to-gain-nothing-to-lose.p46\" class=\"\">Naaman was insulted that he should be told to wash in Jordan when there were cleaner streams in his own land, and \u201che turned and went away in a rage.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/everything-to-gain-nothing-to-lose.p47\" class=\"\">But his servants pleaded with him to do as Elisha had suggested. The proud captain finally relented, and the scripture records, \u201cThen went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.\u201d (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"3196\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3196)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3196)\">2 Kgs. 5:1\u201314<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/everything-to-gain-nothing-to-lose.p48\" class=\"\">And so I repeat, do not let pride stand in your way.

More than forty years ago we were in the mission field together. In the years that followed he went off to war. In his loneliness he picked up with careless companions. He married out of the Church.

He dwelt upon them as a man speaks of nightmares. When he had described those wasted years, we talked of his returning.
