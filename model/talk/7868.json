What took place in this regard was related by a correspondent\u2014not a member of the Church\u2014who worked for a newspaper in Hawaii. In the 1944 newspaper article he wrote following the experience, he explained that he and other correspondents were in the second wave behind the marines at Kwajalein Atoll. As they advanced, they noticed a young marine floating facedown in the water, obviously badly wounded. The shallow water around him was red with his blood. And then they noticed another marine moving toward his wounded comrade. The second marine was also wounded, with his left arm hanging helplessly by his side. He lifted up the head of the one who was floating in the water in order to keep him from drowning. In a panicky voice he called for help. The correspondents looked again at the boy he was supporting and called back, \u201cSon, there is nothing we can do for this boy.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/willing-and-worthy-to-serve.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cThen,\u201d wrote the correspondent, \u201cI saw something that I had never seen before.\u201d This boy, badly wounded himself, made his way to the shore with the seemingly lifeless body of his fellow marine.

My responsibilities as a bishop were many and varied, and I tried to the best of my ability to do all that was required of me. The United States was engaged in a different war by then. Because many of our members were serving in the armed services, an assignment came from Church headquarters for all bishops to provide each serviceman a subscription to the <span class=\"emphasis\">Church News<\/span> and the <span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era,<\/span> the Church\u2019s magazine at that time. In addition, each bishop was asked to write a personal, monthly letter to each serviceman from his ward. Our ward had 23 men in uniform. The priesthood quorums, with effort, supplied the funds for the subscriptions to the publications. I undertook the task, even the duty, to write 23 personal letters each month. After all these years I still have copies of many of my letters and the responses received. Tears come easily when these letters are reread. It is a joy to learn again of a soldier\u2019s pledge to live the gospel, a sailor\u2019s decision to keep faith with his family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/willing-and-worthy-to-serve.p31\" class=\"\">One evening I handed to a sister in the ward the stack of 23 letters for the current month.

He wrote, \u201cDear Bishop, I ain\u2019t much at writin\u2019 letters.\u201d (I could have told him <span class=\"emphasis\">that<\/span> several months earlier.) His letter continued, \u201cThank you for the <span class=\"emphasis\">Church News<\/span> and magazines, but most of all thank you for the personal letters. I have turned over a new leaf.
