One summer night when I was a boy, my cousins, some friends, and I were looking for ways to create some excitement. Someone suggested we play a harmless prank on a neighbor. My conscience whispered it was wrong, but I didn\u2019t have the courage to resist the enthusiastic response of the group.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/overcoming-the-stench-of-sin.p6\" class=\"\">After performing our mischievous act, we sprinted down the dark country road to make our escape, laughing and congratulating ourselves as we ran. Suddenly, one of the group stumbled, crying out, \u201cOh no, I kicked a cat!\u201d Almost instantly we felt a very fine mist settle over us. It carried a horrible odor. What my friend thought was a cat was actually a skunk. It had sprayed us in self-defense. Very few odors are as nauseating as skunk spray, and we smelled terrible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/overcoming-the-stench-of-sin.p7\" class=\"\">Dejectedly, we went home in search of a little parental comfort for our pitiful plight. As we stepped inside the kitchen door, Mom took one sniff and shooed us out into the yard. We were cast out of our home. Then she launched the cleansing process. She burned our clothes. Then, it seemed that every home remedy or concoction in the community was volunteered in our behalf. Among them, we endured a variety of baths: first tomato juice, then cow\u2019s milk, and even harsh homemade lye soap. But the stench remained. Even my dad\u2019s powerful aftershave lotion could not overpower the stench. For days we were condemned to eat outside under a tree, sleep outdoors in a tent, and ride in the back of the pickup truck.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/overcoming-the-stench-of-sin.p8\" class=\"\">After a while, naively thinking the smell was gone, we tried to approach some normal-smelling girls. They would not allow us within yards, shattering our fragile teenage egos!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/overcoming-the-stench-of-sin.p9\" class=\"\">Now, I must admit that being sprayed by a skunk is not a common consequence of sin. Most consequences are not as immediate or dramatic. But sooner or later, for all sin, a consequence will be paid.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/overcoming-the-stench-of-sin.p10\" class=\"\">At times, consequences of sin may appear to be very subtle to the sinner. We may even convince ourselves, as we did before approaching the girls, that no one will be able to detect our sins and that they are well concealed. But always to our Heavenly Father and often to spiritually sensitive leaders, parents, and friends, our sins are glaringly apparent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/overcoming-the-stench-of-sin.p11\" class=\"\">While attending a youth fireside with Elder Richard G. Scott, I noticed five youths scattered among the congregation whose countenances or body language almost screamed that something was spiritually amiss in their lives. After the meeting, when I mentioned the five youths to Elder Scott, he simply replied, \u201cThere were eight.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/overcoming-the-stench-of-sin.p12\" class=\"\">Isaiah prophesied, \u201cTheir countenance doth witness against them, and doth declare their sin to be even as Sodom, and they cannot hide it\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3414\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3414)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3414)\">2 Ne. 13:9<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24977\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24977)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24977)\">Isa. 3:9<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/overcoming-the-stench-of-sin.p13\" class=\"\">God has declared, \u201cHe that sinneth and repenteth not shall be cast out\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11527\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11527)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11527)\">D&amp;C 42:28<\/a><\/span>).

It constantly prompts us to choose good. Good choices yield good consequences. On the other hand, delaying repentance and continuing to commit sin is like continuing to kick the skunk.
