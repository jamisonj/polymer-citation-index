Theodore Tuttle, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1958, pp. 47-48<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nPresident McKay, my beloved brothers and sisters: This has been a glorious six\nmonths&mdash;glorious not in the fact that I have been able to meet the challenges which almost\ndaily pertain to this call, but glorious in the opportunity of teaching the gospel and of meeting\nwith the Saints.  May I take this occasion to express my gratitude to those who have been so\nkind and hospitable to me.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to extend my personal welcome to President Critchlow and Elder Dyer.  I know\nthe reception they are going to receive from these Brethren. This has been a glorious six\nmonths in association with these men. They have been kind, considerate, and helpful. When\nyou consider the varied talents they bring and the many walks of life that this group of men\nrepresent, when you know the individual strength and power that they bring, it is a marvelous\nthing to me to see the harmonious, intelligent unity that exists among these brethren.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd as I understand it, it is the mission of the Church to develop and extend this unity and\nbrotherhood throughout the world.\n<\/p><p>\nHow can peace come without brotherhood?  What is peace?  Is peace the cessation of\nhostilities? Is peace a cold, rather than a hot war?  Is peace coexistence? Is peace to live and\nlet live? Is peace a relationship based on force? Is peace servitude and slavery based on\npower?  What is it that brings peace: arms, bombs, pacts, arbitration, and compromise?  What\nperpetuates peace: armies and navies, planes and missiles, and anti-missile missiles? What is\nthe basis of peace? Is it based on a balance of power?  I think that each one of us would have\nto answer that it is none of these, and that at best they are but temporary measures.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat is peace based on?  May I try to illustrate it with a story with which I think\nmany of you are acquainted.  It is entitled \"Abram and Zimri\" by Clarence Cook.  Two\nbrothers farmed together.  Abram had a wife and seven sons.  Zimri lived alone.  At harvest\ntime the crop was divided equally. Zimri lay in bed and thought: \"Here am I, just one mouth\nto feed, while my brother Abram has a wife and many sons.  I must go to the field and share\nmy half with my brother, Abram.\" So he girded himself and went down and gave a generous\nthird of his portion to his brother.\n<\/p><p>\nAbram, on the other hand, thought that same night: \"Here am I with a wife and seven\nsons&mdash;someone to share my load and to work with me. Here is my brother, Zimri, he works alone\nand has no one to help. I shall gird myself and go down to the field and share my portion\nwith him.\" And he took a generous third and put it with Zimri's sheaves.\nThe next morning the sheaves were the same.\n<\/p><p>\nThe next night, determined to change it, Zimri went again to the field and carried another\nthird from his pile to his brother, Abram's, and then lay in the field to watch.  Soon Abram\ncame and took his sheaves and put them with his brother's share.  Then Clarence Cook closes\nwith these words: \"And Zimri arose and caught him in his arms, and wept upon his neck, and\nkissed his cheek; and Abram saw the whole, and could not speak; neither could Zimri, for\ntheir hearts were full.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow, as I read the record of history, there is but one force strong enough to motivate a\nuniversal acceptance of brotherhood. That is, the acceptance of the Fatherhood of God and the\ndivine Sonship of his Son, Jesus Christ, and thence all men as brothers.  This has been the\npower that has united men in the past.  This has been the plan of our Heavenly Father from\nthe beginning, and it is no illusion. It has worked.  We all know the story of Enoch who\ntaught this gospel plan to his brethren, and when it was accepted they lived happily&mdash;so much\nso that the Lord walked and talked with them, and took them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39112\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39112)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39112)\">Moses 7:69<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA similar unity of brotherhood occurred on this continent after the Lord had been here and\ntaught his gospel to the Nephites.  I quote the account of the condition that existed for two\nhundred years afterward: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God\nwhich did dwell in the hearts of the people.<br \/>\n\"And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor\nmurders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people\namong all the people who had been created by the hand of God.<br \/>\n\"There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of\n-ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6516\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6516)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6516)\">4 Ne. 1:15-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, this blessed condition is attainable today, but it is attainable only upon the basis of\naccepting God as Father and all men as brothers and living the plan of salvation. My\ntestimony is that this plan, which the Lord introduced in the beginning with Adam, and that\nhas successfully brought about true brotherhood in the past, has been restored; that the\npriesthood that activates it and operates it is in our midst, and that the leaders thereof in this\nChurch are servants of our Heavenly Father.  This plan is bringing about a true brotherhood\nin this day and it is up to you and me to make it function even more perfectly.  To show our\nappreciation for the privilege we have of belonging to this great brotherhood, may we be ever\nwilling to share it with all of our brothers and sisters, I humbly ask in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
