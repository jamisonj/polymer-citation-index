Listening to the report of the\nChurch made by President McKay at the opening of the Conference, and the various other\nitems which have been mentioned, I believe that we should feel optimistic about the progress\nof our work. I do. I think that we are going forward, and I have confidence and faith that we\nwill meet all the problems and situations which arise.\n<\/p><p>\nI thank the Lord always for the principle of continuous revelation. I thank him that he has\nmade provision for his Spirit to attend all of those who are called to preside in his work, and\nI speak not only of the General Authorities, but those who are charged with the responsibility\nof presidency in the stakes and the wards, in the quorums in the missions, in the temple, and\nin all of our organizations.\n<\/p><p>\nI am a firm believer in improvement. I think improvement is the law of life, and I am grateful\nthat we are not so controlled by practices and conditions of the past that we are not open to\nthe consideration of ways and means to advance the Kingdom of our Father.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember hearing a president of one of our stakes illustrate the point. One of the sister\nworkers in an organization of the stake said to him, because he was a pretty hard-driving\npresident, \"President, it seems that you are never satisfied.\" \"O, yes I am,\" he said, \"I am\nalways satisfied that you can do better.\" And so I am persuaded that such new methods as\npresent themselves and come regularly through the proper channels will be conducive to the\nupbuilding of our Father's work. We have evidences of it. I might submit some of the figures\nto attest this, but time will not permit tonight. The whole picture looks to me to be one of\nencouragement, one to give us cause for great gratitude in the assurance that the blessings of\nthe Lord have been upon us.\n<\/p><p>\nNow there are opportunities for further perfecting our work, and those opportunities rest in\nlarge measure with our presiding brethren. I would like to say just a word to the presidencies\nof quorums. These quorums of priesthood, as you are all aware, are designated of the Lord.\nThey are substantially the only organizations among us, other than that of the general\norganization of the Church, which have been specifically mentioned in the revelations. The\nLord must have set great store by these marvelous institutions which he created. He knew in\nthe beginning that his priesthood would be the basic foundation of his work. I was thinking\ntonight if Joseph and those associated with him in the beginning of the work could witness\nwhat we see tonight, this great demonstration of power, resident within God's Holy\nPriesthood, and perhaps they do see it, how gratified they would be.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd here is a great reservoir of power to be utilized for the advancement of our Father's\nKingdom. Upon the quorums rests the largest measure of that responsibility. I am persuaded\nthat no other organization can or ought to take their place, because they constitute the Lord's\ngrouping of the manpower of his Church. Upon the presidencies of quorums rests the\nresponsibility of seeing that their quorums function properly.\n<\/p><p>\nWe used to have years and years ago, when the Priesthood Committee of the Church was first\norganized; many may remember it; President-McKay will, a very concise and comprehensive\ndefinition of a quorum. We used to say it is three things: A class, a fraternity, and a service\nunit. And so we sought to group around these headings the responsibilities of the men of the\nquorum. And while there has grown out of the original concept a more\nelaborate organization, I am persuaded that if we could make our quorums serve the functions\nindicated by those three things we should accomplish much for the members and for the\nChurch.\n<\/p><p>\nI am thoroughly persuaded that we can learn the Gospel in our quorums, and thus comply\nwith the revelation that men are \"to learn their duties\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13170\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13170)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13170)\">D&amp;C 107:99<\/a><\/span>).\nWhen men profess that some of the\ncourses of study are a little intricate and difficult, I think of the days in Kirtland when a few\nmen of meager learning and education had what seems to be the effrontery and boldness to\nset about to learn Hebrew, and you will recall how in the School of the Prophets, they\nengaged a Professor Seixas to teach them Hebrew in order that they might the better interpret\nGod's word. We can learn. We can learn by study. We can learn the fundamental things that\nwe need to know as members of God's Holy Priesthood. And we can learn about the\napostasy, which is essential for us to understand in order that we comprehend in its fulness\nthe restoration and be fortified to defend the restoration in the latter days.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I take the liberty of urging you men, through your quorum presidencies, to see to it that\nyour teachers study, that they receive the instruction which is provided for them, and the\nfacilities which have been maintained in order to give them a concept of these great truths and\nto teach them intelligently to those who come to the classes. The more we make our classes\nworthwhile to the members, the more readily will they come, and the greater the value they\nwill receive from them.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I don't know that it is possible for any organization to succeed in the Church under the\npriesthood without adopting the genius of our Church government. What is that? As I\nconceive it, the genius of our Church government is government through councils. The\nCouncil of the Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, the Council of the Stake Presidency, or\nquorum, if you choose to use that word, the Council of the Bishopric, and the quorum of\nCouncil of the Quorum Presidency. I have had enough experience to know the value of\ncouncils. Hardly a day passes but that I see the wisdom, God's wisdom, in creating councils:\nto govern his Kingdom. In the spirit under which we labor, men can get together with\nseemingly divergent views and far different backgrounds, and under the operation of that\nspirit, by counseling together, they can arrive at an accord, and that accord, (the occasions are\nso negligible as not to be mentioned) and therefore I say that accord is always right. That\naccord represents the wisdom of the council, acting under the Spirit.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren of priesthood quorum presidencies: You need those councils, and I have no\nhesitancy in giving you the assurance, if you will confer in council as you are expected to do,\nGod will give you solutions to the problems that confront you with reference to your\nquorums. And he will enable you to find ways and means of approaching the men whom you\nwould like to reach to bring them into accord with your quorum, and have them enjoy its\nspirit. I am sure we can go out and get many of these men. My heart is always troubled for\nthe unusually large number of our elders who do not ally themselves with the quorum and\nsecure the spirit and the benefit to be had therefrom. I am not at all persuaded that these are\nbad men, but I am persuaded that they are negligent often and forgetful and neglectful, and\nthey need your care. And the quorum presidency, no matter how many committees you\nappoint, the quorum presidency is responsible for every man in the quorum; and I am sure\nyou cannot be relieved of that responsibility, although you will want the help of all those who\nmay come to your assistance.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I am persuaded too that if you approach many of these men in frankness and true\nfriendship, you will touch their hearts. I have long been persuaded that it is\nsomething of a waste of time to go to a man's home who has been neglectful and spend the\ntime in talking about the weather or the crops or politics or something else.\n<\/p><p>\nI always admired my dear brother, the President of the Church, George Albert Smith. I have\nbeen with him on many occasions. I have seen him meet many old friends, and I frequently\nhave seen him take their hand, and ask the first question, not how are you getting along,\nwhich usually means how much money are you making, but \"How are you feeling in the\nChurch?\" I have seen him ask that of business men. I have been with him on the streets of\nthis city and had him meet a business man and say, \"Well, how are you feeling in the\nChurch?\" It was a direct approach, and one usually that brought a response that probably\nmade the man search his conscience, and that is what we need to do with these men, to get\nthem to search their own conscience, and make their own decisions to avail themselves of\nthese glorious opportunities that we bring to them.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, my brethren, I recognize that I can't deal with many problems tonight. There is one\nproblem that President McKay suggested that I mention to you about the missionaries, and I\nfully endorse all that has been said about that great work, and that is, brethren, that we still\nthink it wise to use some caution in the general advertising of missionary farewells. I don't\nneed to take the time to tell you the rather strenuous period we have been through in trying to\narrange for our missionary program. It has not been easy. Thank the Lord it is now operating\nin good measure and producing results, but it has not been easy; and for the time being, it is\nsuggested that you follow the directions that were issued sometime ago to avoid newspaper\nadvertising of our missionary farewells. Times may change, and this instruction may change.\n<\/p><p>\nI just want to bear my testimony to the divinity of this great power that you and I hold. I\nknow that it is genuine. I know that it is authentic. I have no more question about its\nauthenticity and its derivation than I have of any other fact established by the most concrete\nevidence we could ask. Sometimes there are those who when I have laid my hands upon their\nhead in ordination have asked me for the derivation of my priesthood. I repeat four steps: I\nwas ordained by President Joseph F. Smith. He was ordained by President Brigham Young.\nBrigham Young was ordained by the three witnesses, one of whom was Oliver Cowdery, and\nthat ordination was subsequently confirmed by the Prophet. Oliver Cowdery and Joseph Smith\nwere ordained by angelic ministers from the Lord Jesus Christ himself. We don't have to go\ninto antiquity to establish the authenticity and the genuineness of this power that we hold, and\nyou and I know, that aside from the evidences of its authentic derivation, we know that there\nis an essence within it which makes it more than a mere name. I have felt it and you have. I\nknow that our Father has given it to his men and boys to establish his work. God help us to\nuse it effectively in the creation of a better world, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
