Concerning his Son Jesus Christ\nour Lord\"; that of this \"gospel of Christ\" he was \"not ashamed . . . for,\" said he, \"it is the\npower of God unto salvation to every one that believeth\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42809\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42809)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42809)\">Rom. 1:1,3,16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat is, God himself, the Father of us all, created the gospel; it is his plan of salvation\nthrough which all his spirit children, Christ included, have power to progress and become like\nhim; it is the plan announced by the Father in the councils of eternity when he asked whom\nhe should send to be the Redeemer, to put into full force the terms and conditions of his\ngospel; it is the plan of which Christ became the chief advocate, first in preexistence and then\nagain in mortality, thereby gaining the distinction of having the very \"gospel of God\" itself\nnamed after him, named \"the gospel of Christ.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis gospel is thus the plan and system of the Gods whereby believing men may be saved,\nand its chief characteristic is power: power to do all things necessary for the benefit and\nblessing of God's children in this life, power to save them in eternal glory in the life to come.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Only one gospel<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThat there is and can be only one gospel, one plan of salvation, is as self-evident as any truth\nknown to man. There may be imitations, many systems or plans purporting to lead men to\nGod, many claims that the gospel is here or there; there may be voices crying, \"Lo, here is\nChrist,\" or \"Lo, there\" \n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35865\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35865)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35865)\">Matt. 24:23<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31745\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31745)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31745)\">Luke 17:21<\/a><\/span>); but truth, pure diamond truth, that truth which is the gospel of God\nconcerning his Son, is and can be only one thing; and our interest and concern should center\nin the truth; in the Father's plan, and in his plan only; in keeping his statutes and judgments,\nand his statutes and judgments only; in doing his will, and his will only. Jesus said: \"Not\nevery one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that\ndoeth the will of my Father which is in heaven\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35816\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35816)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35816)\">Matt. 7:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhen some of his converts departed from the perfect system he had taught them, Paul said, \"I\nmarvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto\nanother gospel.\" Then lest other plans be dignified by even so much as the use of the term\n\"gospel,\" he hastened to add, \"Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and\nwould pervert the gospel of Christ.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHaving thus shown that there is only one gospel with saving power, the ancient apostle issued\nthis inspired decree: \"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto\nyou than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23280\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23280)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23280)\">Gal. 1:6-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The word of God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow let us reason together in the light of these scriptural truths. There are obviously two\nessential identifying characteristics of the true gospel. It must contain the word of God, the\ntruths of heaven, the doctrines of salvation; and it must also possess power, the power of God,\nthe power to benefit men in this life and to exalt them in the next.\n<\/p><p>\nIn a purely intellectual sense any church can claim to have the word of the gospel. They can\nsay: \"We believe the Bible; we accept Christ as our personal Savior; we believe in his grace\nand goodness and rely on his promises.\" They can even say: \"We believe the Book of\nMormon, which contains the fullness of the everlasting gospel; we accept Joseph Smith as a\nprophet of God; we are numbered with the Saints of latter-days.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBut the issue is not belief only; it is not acceptance of the word alone. Rather it is a matter of\nhaving the power of the priesthood and of enjoying the gift of the Holy Ghost. Of course the\nBook of Mormon contains the fullness of the everlasting gospel (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15113\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15113)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15113)\">D&amp;C 27:5<\/a><\/span>), meaning it is a record of\nGod's dealings with a people who had the fullness of saving truth. In the same sense the\nBible contains the fullness of the gospel, meaning that it also recounts Deity's dealings with a\nrighteous people who worked out their salvation.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The power of God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe issue is not what men purport to believe; it is whether, having believed the truth, they\nalso get the power of God into their lives. Salvation does not come by reading about religion,\nby learning that holy men in former days had spiritual experiences. It is not found through\nresearch in musty archives; it does not spring forth as the result of intellectual dialogues about\nreligious matters. Salvation is horn of obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel;\nsalvation comes to those who obey the statutes and judgments of that God who created it and\nordained the laws whereby it might be gained.\n<\/p><p>\nSalvation comes by getting Christ into our hearts today, by being born again, by becoming\nnew creatures of the Holy Ghost, by receiving personal revelation, by exercising the gifts of\nthe Spirit, by having the power of God manifest in our lives.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Signs follow believers<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJesus sent his apostles forth to preach the same gospel he had taught them, with this promise:\n\"Signs shall follow them that believe\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33216\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33216)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33216)\">Mark 16:17<\/a><\/span>). In other words, when men believe the\ntrue word of the gospel, then God begins to manifest his power in their lives. They begin to\nenjoy the gifts of the Spirit, to work miracles, and to have those spiritual experiences which\nalways and everlastingly attend true believers.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd, we might well ask, if a gospel does not have power to heal the sick, raise the dead, and\nwork miracles in this life, why would anyone suppose it had power to cleanse a sin-laden soul\nor to raise a man to an inheritance of eternal life in the presence of God?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>God has spoken today<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow we are bold to proclaim that that God who is no respecter of persons (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8048\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8048)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8048)\">Acts 10:34<\/a><\/span>), who is the same\nyesterday, today, and forever (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24377\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24377)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24377)\">Heb. 13:8<\/a><\/span>), has spoken again in our day&mdash;paying his respects to those\nsystems of religion which have \"a form of godliness,\" but \"deny the power thereof\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30510\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30510)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30510)\">JS&mdash;H 1:19<\/a><\/span>),\nand restoring again both the word and the power of his gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nWe announce that God, according to the promises, has sent his angel to restore the fullness of\nthe ancient gospel, which gospel is now found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints. The word of that gospel is now written in the new revelations which have come from\nheaven; and as rapidly as the true believers conform their lives to the new and everlasting\ntruths involved, the power of the gospel is manifest in their lives.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Gospel written in lives<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn the final analysis, the gospel of God is written, not in the dead letters of scriptural records,\nbut in the lives of the Saints. It is not written with pen and ink on paper of man's making, but\nwith acts and deeds in the book of life of each believing and obedient person. It is engraved\nin the flesh and bones and sinews of those who live a celestial law, which is the law of the\ngospel. It is there to be read by others, first, by those who, seeing the good works of the\nSaints, shall respond by glorifying our Father in heaven (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35781\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35781)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35781)\">Matt. 5:16<\/a><\/span>), and finally by the Great Judge to\nwhom every man's life is an open book.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, paraphrasing Paul, I say with perfect conviction, and knowing whereof I speak, that\nthe gospel of God concerning his Son, the very gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord, has come to\nthe Latter-day Saints, not in word only but also in power (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2747\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2747)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2747)\">1 Thes. 1:15<\/a><\/span>), and in the Holy Ghost, and in much testimony.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
