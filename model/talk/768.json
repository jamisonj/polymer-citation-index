To enter the\nstraight gate implies obedience to gospel requirements, and the narrow way that leads to life\nconnotes additional requirements, rites, and ordinances for all who desire salvation and\nexaltation.  Like so many teachings of our Lord, the interpretation, explanation, and\nprocedures were left for his chosen prophets by inspiration and revelation, when the time was\nready, to unfold to man's knowledge. It is true of this scripture.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to ask, \"What is the straight gate spoken of by the Savior by which we should\nenter?\" Nephi, in the closing days of his ministry, gave a great discourse to his people\nembodying much in the way of prophesying, and in it furnishes the most direct and\ncomprehensive answer to this question by saying: \n<\/p><p>\nFor the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then\ncometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3582\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3582)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3582)\">2 Ne. 31:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNephi also said to his people: \"Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen\nthat your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have they been shown unto\nme, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3583\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3583)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3583)\">2 Ne. 31:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNephi, in vision, almost six centuries before the coming of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,\nin the flesh, witnessed his baptism at the hands of John the Baptist, even as we have it\nrecorded in the third chapter of Matthew, when our worthy Lord came to John and asked to\nbe baptized of him.  But John, humble as he was, realizing that this was his Lord, objected by\nsaying,\n<\/p><p>\nI have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to\nfulfil all righteousness.  Then he suffered him.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the\nheavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove,\nand lighting upon him: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well\npleased (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34679\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34679)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34679)\">Matt. 3:14-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn this scripture we see the plan and the way to enter this straight gate, even baptism by water\nand receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost; the Savior saying to John by way of emphasis, \"for\nthus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow what did the Savior mean by making this statement?  Again we turn to the writings of\nNephi and read: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by\nwater, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy,\nto be baptized, yea, even by water!\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did\nfulfil all righteousness in being baptized by water?\n<\/p><p>\nKnow ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto\nthe children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father,\nand witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his\ncommandments.\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost descended upon him in\nthe form of a dove.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again, it showeth unto the children of men the straightness of the path, and the\nnarrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before\nthem.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3581\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3581)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3581)\">2 Ne. 31:5-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHere we see the straightness of the gate by which the Son of God entered our Heavenly\nFather's kingdom and the reason for his doing so, which sets the example and pattern for all\nmankind to follow, for said he, \"Follow thou me\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27670\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27670)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27670)\">John 21:22<\/a><\/span>)\nand do the things which ye have seen me do.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow, my brothers and sisters, let us consider what the narrowness of the way signifies.  After\nexplaining what is required to enter the straight gate, Nephi continues by saying: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd then are ye in this straight and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye\nhave entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the\nFather and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the\nFather and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye\nentered in by the way ye should receive.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this straight and narrow path,\nI would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far\nsave it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the\nmerits of him who is mighty to save.\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect\nbrightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.  Wherefore, if ye shall press\nforward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith\nthe Father: Ye shall have eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way\nnor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. \nAnd now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only true doctrine of the\nFather, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3585\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3585)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3585)\">2 Ne. 31:18-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMy brothers and sisters, we see from this that the function of the Holy Ghost to those who\nhave received its bestowal is to guide in the narrow way to an understanding of what is\nrequired for eternal life and glory.  Men, through faithfulness, must become worthy for\nordination to the Holy Melchizedek Priesthood, that priesthood after the order of the Son of\nGod, which ordination and priesthood makes possible receiving the spiritual blessings of\nGod's kingdom, for it is in the gospel ordinances officiated in by the authority of the Holy\nPriesthood that the powers of godliness are manifest unto men in the flesh.  In this\ndispensation God has restored the keys, powers, and authorities to officiate in all the sacred\nordinances with the right to seal and bind for time and all eternity both the living and the\ndead.\n<\/p><p>\nFor the sacred purpose of obtaining the higher gospel ordinances and blessings, God has\ncommanded that temples should be built wherein his people can receive their endowments and\nsealings, to prepare them for celestial glory. Worthy women, as worthy men, enjoy the\nprivileges of temple ordinances and blessings, receiving them by the authority of the Holy\nMelchizedek Priesthood.  Both make covenants with God, and both accept obligations and\nresponsibility; also pledge faithfulness and obedience to God.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the cornerstone of the great Salt Lake Temple was laid, Brigham Young in a discourse\nto the people assembled for that important occasion, said that very few of the elders in Israel\nunderstood the endowment, and for them to understand they must experience, and for them to\nexperience, a temple must be built.  Then he summarized the endowment in these words: \n<\/p><p>\nYour endowment is to receive all those ordinances in the House of the Lord which are\nnecessary for you after this life, to enable you to walk back to the presence of the\nFather, passing the angels who stand as sentinels, being enabled to give them the key\nword, the signs and the tokens pertaining to the Holy Priesthood, and gain you eternal\nexaltation in spite of earth or hell.\n<\/p><p>\nHow sublime, comprehensive, significant, and important the endowment becomes when we\nunderstand it.  When one has been endowed according to the order of temple rights and\nordinances, then he or she is prepared for eternal sealing of husband to wife, wife to husband,\nand children to both, by men authorized and possessing the keys of this sealing power. \nFamilies thus united may go on to perfection, exaltation, and eternal happiness together.\n<\/p><p>\nWe learn this from the writings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, found in both the 131st and\n132nd sections of the Doctrine and Covenants. The Lord, speaking to the Prophet, said,\n<\/p><p>\nIn the celestial glory there are three heavens, or degrees; \n<\/p><p>\nAnd in order to obtain the highest a man must enter into this order of the priesthood,\n[meaning the new and the everlasting covenant of marriage]; \n<\/p><p>\nAnd if he does not he cannot obtain it.\n<\/p><p>\nHe may enter into the others, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an\nincrease (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13423\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13423)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13423)\">D&amp;C 131:1-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThose who do not enter this order of the priesthood, that is, the eternal covenant of marriage,\nbecome angels of God in a separate and single state forever and ever, and thus are without\nincrease of posterity in the eternal world; therefore without posterity they have no need of a\nkingdom.  That is verified in the writings of the Prophet Joseph in the 132nd section of the\nDoctrine and Covenants which I quote: \n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my\nword, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant\nand marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world;\ntherefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but\nare appointed angels in heaven; which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those\nwho are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory.\n<\/p><p>\nFor these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain\nseparately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity; and from\nhenceforth are not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13428\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13428)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13428)\">D&amp;C 132:15-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, important as it might be to be appointed a ministering angel of God, certainly far more\nhappiness would come to an individual to have at his side a loving companion, children,\nposterity&mdash;throughout the eternity, and unless we enter into this holy covenant of marriage\nand have it sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, these blessings cannot be obtained by us.\n<\/p><p>\nReferring again to this same section, the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my\nlaw, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy\nSpirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power\nand the keys of this priesthood; [and then certain conditions are enumerated]; ... it\nshall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in\ntime, and through all eternity; and shall be of full force when they are out of the\nworld; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their\nexaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory\nshall be a fullness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.\n<\/p><p>\nThen shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from\neverlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because\nall things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because they have all power,\nand the angels are subject unto them.\n<\/p><p>\nVerily, verily, I say unto you, except ye abide my law ye cannot attain to this glory.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now mark you,\n<\/p><p>\nFor strait is the gate, and narrow the way that leadeth unto the exaltation and\ncontinuation of the lives, and few there be that find it, because ye receive me not in\nthe world neither do ye know me.\n<\/p><p>\nBut if ye receive me in the world, then shall ye know me, and shall receive your\nexaltation; that where I am ye shall be also.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is eternal lives&mdash;to know the only wise and true God, and Jesus Christ, whom he\nhath sent (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13430\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13430)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13430)\">D&amp;C 132:19-24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, my brothers and sisters, these conditions then meet the requirements for the\nnarrowness of the way. It involves receiving the temple ordinances and sealings, keeping all\nthe commandments of God, remaining faithful and devoted to the end of mortal life, which\nthen earns the great gift of eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nNephi, Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, true servants and prophets of God, by inspiration and\nrevelation have interpreted and explained the significance of this important statement of the\nSavior.  All who have repented and then been baptized and received the Holy Ghost by\nauthorized servants of God have entered in by the straight gate.  The narrow way can only\nbe followed by obedience and faithfulness to all the sacred ordinances and requirements of the\nhigher gospel plan, obtained in the holy temples of God.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the true doctrine of Christ. This is the order and law of the Holy Priesthood.  There is\nno other plan nor way to obtain eternal lives, and a continuation of posterity.  God again said\nto the Prophet: \n<\/p><p>\nFor all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was appointed\nfor that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted from before the\nfoundation of the world (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13426\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13426)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13426)\">D&amp;C 132:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLet us understand these things, my brothers and sisters, and if we have not taken care of the\nconditions that lead into the narrow way and that take us to eternal life, let us submit to the\nrequirements of these great principles and ordinances and teach all others to do likewise, I\nhumbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
