However, the scriptures refer to the flesh as the physical or carnal nature of the natural man, which allows people to be influenced by passion, desires, appetites, and drives of the flesh instead of looking for inspiration from the Holy Ghost. If we are not careful, those influences together with the pressure of the evil in the world may conduct us to adopt vulgar and reckless behavior which may become part of our character. In order to avoid those bad influences, we have to follow what the Lord instructed the Prophet Joseph Smith about continuously sowing in the Spirit: \u201cWherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work.

Even in adverse circumstances in life, those who accept the invitation to come unto Christ become a light to the world. A few weeks ago while visiting one of the wards in South Africa, I had the privilege to accompany two young priests, their bishop, and their stake president in a visit to less-active young men of their quorum. I was greatly impressed by the courage and humility that those two priests showed as they invited the less-active young men to return to church. While they talked to those less-active young men, I noticed that their countenances reflected the Savior\u2019s light and at the same time filled with light all those around them. They were fulfilling their duty to \u201csuccor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122888\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122888)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122888)\">D&amp;C 81:5<\/a><\/span>).

Our disposition to fulfill these covenants prepares us to live in God\u2019s presence as exalted beings. The remembrance of these covenants must guide our behavior in relation to our family, in our social interaction with other people, and especially in our relationship with the Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/abide-in-the-lords-territory!.p21\" class=\"\">Jesus Christ established the perfect behavior pattern by which we can build upon our attitudes to be able to fulfill these sacred covenants. The Savior banished from His life any influence that might take His focus away from His divine mission, especially when He was tempted by the enemy or by his followers while He ministered here on earth. Although He never sinned, He had a broken heart and a contrite spirit, full of love for our Heavenly Father and for all men. He humbled Himself before our Father in Heaven, denying His own will to fulfill what the Father had asked of Him in all things until the end. Even at that moment of extreme physical and spiritual pain, carrying the burden of the sins of all mankind on His shoulders and shedding blood through His pores, He told the Father, \u201cNevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122890\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122890)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122890)\">Mark 14:36<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/abide-in-the-lords-territory!.p22\" class=\"\">My prayer, brothers and sisters, as we think about our covenants is that we may keep ourselves strong against \u201cthe fiery darts of the adversary\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122891\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122891)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122891)\">1\u00a0Nephi 15:24<\/a><\/span>), following the Savior\u2019s example so that we may sow in the Spirit and abide in the Lord\u2019s territory.
