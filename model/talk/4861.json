Her home teachers repaired her appliances and other household items. Her visiting teachers kept very close and made sure she never had to go alone to a Church activity. At Christmastime, she found money left anonymously on her porch or had it given to her in a handshake. She received hundreds of dollars toward the purchase of a wheelchair-lift for her van. After being out of town briefly, she returned home and found that ward members had renovated her kitchen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/personal-integrity.p42\" class=\"\">Her parents, brother, and sisters provided financial and emotional support. They helped take care of her children, accompanied her to the emergency room with a daughter who was very ill, built a ramp to the front door for the wheelchair, built shelves for food storage, and helped with yard work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/personal-integrity.p43\" class=\"\">All of this kindness lifted her spirits and gave her courage to meet the trials and hardships of each day. Those who looked after this young mother practiced \u201cpure religion\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26364\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26364)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26364)\">James 1:27<\/a><\/span>) because of their integrity. Let us \u201cgo, and do \u2026 likewise\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32393\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32393)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32393)\">Luke 10:37<\/a><\/span>), as the Savior taught in the parable of the good Samaritan.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/personal-integrity.p44\" class=\"\">The rewards of integrity are immeasurable. One is the indescribable inner peace and serenity that come from knowing we are doing what is right; another is an absence of the guilt and anxiety that accompany sin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/personal-integrity.p45\" class=\"\">Another reward of integrity is the confidence it can give us in approaching God. When virtue garnishes our thoughts unceasingly, our confidence is strong in the presence of God. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"19338\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19338)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19338)\">D&amp;C 121:45<\/a><\/span>.) When we are doing what is right, we will not feel timid and hesitant about seeking divine direction. We will know the Lord will answer our prayers and help us in our need.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/personal-integrity.p46\" class=\"\">The consummate reward of integrity is the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"19339\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19339)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19339)\">D&amp;C 121:46<\/a><\/span>.) The Holy Ghost does not attend us when we do evil. But when we do what is right, he can dwell with us and guide us in all we do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/personal-integrity.p47\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, let us live true to the trust the Lord has placed in us. Let us strive for personal, practical integrity in every endeavor, regardless of how mundane or inconsequential it may seem. The small matters accumulate to shape the direction of our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/personal-integrity.p48\" class=\"\">I bear my witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and is our Lord and Savior. This is his church. Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God, as is President Ezra Taft Benson. I bear this testimony humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
