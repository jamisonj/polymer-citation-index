Stapley, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1953, pp. 117-120<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brothers and sisters, I should like to pay tribute to our late beloved departed\nassociate, Elder John A. Widtsoe, a man who has contributed much to this Church and its\npeople. He left many books, manuscripts, and leaflets that we can all use and profit by. I, too,\nwant to welcome Elder Adam S. Bennion into the Quorum of the Twelve and assure him that\nhe has my love, my prayers, my blessing, my help. I know he will contribute a great deal to\nthe work. He is filling the shoes of a very important individual, but I know he will rise to the\ngreat responsibilities of this call.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like for you to keep in mind, my brothers and sisters, as I speak to you, the talks of\nPresident David O. McKay on the home, of Bishop Thorpe B. Isaacson on security in the\ngospel of Jesus Christ, and the talk of President Bruce R. McConkie on the Holy Ghost, its\npowers and functions.\n<\/p><p>\nToward the close of his ministry, Christ taught his disciples that he must suffer many things\nand be crucified and would rise again the third day. Peter rebuked the Savior saying, \"Be it\nfar from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.\" Jesus turned to Peter and said \"Get thee\nbehind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of\nGod, but those that be of men\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34577\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34577)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34577)\">Matt. 16:22-23<\/a><\/span>).\nIf the Lord walked among us today, would\nwe be an offense unto him and subject to chastisement for savoring the things of men more\nthan the things of God?\n<\/p><p>\nOur modern scientific material world with its great achievements, conveniences, comforts, and\ntempting prosperity has diverted many a good man from his avowed plan to serve God\nfaithfully. Opportunities for riches, and the power that goes with them, often impels men to\npursue increased possessions, money, and the honors of men more than the\nlove and favor of God. The faith of many such men often is destroyed and their spiritual\nopportunities and blessings sacrificed. They become cold and indifferent to religion and pierce\nthemselves and families through with many sorrows.\n<\/p><p>\n. . . it is the will of God that man should repent and serve Him in health, and in the strength\nand power of his mind, in order to secure his blessing, and not wait until he is called to die\n(<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>, p. 197).\n<\/p><p>\nWe have the responsibility as parents of providing for our own, and in our best endeavors to\ndo so there are normally accumulations of material possessions. There is nothing against a\nperson earning and enjoying material possessions provided he is not spiritually hurt in the\nprocess and fulfills completely his heavenly covenants and sacred obligations to his God. \"For\na man's life,\" says the Savior, \"does not consist in the abundance of the things which he\npossesses\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31334\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31334)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31334)\">Luke 12:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has given us the good things of the earth that we might better serve him. Somehow\npeople get mixed up in values and fail to recognize the important purposes of earth life that a\nkind and loving Heavenly Father has so graciously provided for them.\n<\/p><p>\nOur most important possession is the gospel. It has no counterpart. It encompasses all truth. It\nis the only plan for life and salvation that is eternal and applies to all mankind. Obedience to\nits principles, doctrines and ordinances is our only hope for protection and peace in a\ndisturbed world. The Lord has counseled us \"to seek first the kingdom of heaven and its\nrighteousness, and all else will be added\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34555\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34555)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34555)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Nephites, following Christ's ministry among\nthem, for two hundred years realized the full benefits of following this counsel. There was an\nunprecedented era of righteousness and faith among these people. They had all things\ncommon among them. There were not rich and poor, bond and free\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6511\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6511)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6511)\">4 Ne. 1:3<\/a><\/span>), and there were no\ncontentions or disputations among them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50047\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50047)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50047)\">4 Ne. 1:2<\/a><\/span>). They dealt justly with each other; the Lord prospered\nthem exceedingly; and they builded large cities. In Fourth Nephi we read,\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God\nwhich did dwell in the hearts of the people.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor\nmurders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people\namong all the people who had been created by the hand of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6512\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6512)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6512)\">4 Ne. 1:15-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod did bless them in all their doings, but later, however, wealth, pride, and the desire for\ninfluence and power led to their complete destruction as a people and a nation. Moral decay\nhas ever been the downfall of peoples and nations.\n<\/p><p>\nFaith in God and in his son Jesus Christ must find lodgment and full and continued\nexpression in every heart or man will be destroyed by his own ignorance and materialism.\nToday, man's world with the Christ and his teachings is on the brink of disaster. As I think\nabout it, I wonder what condition the world would be in if it did not have a Christ and did\nnot have his teachings with the great plan of salvation as we know and understand it. No\ndoubt the people of the world would have been destroyed long ago.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has gained influence and prestige among\nmen. Its opportunities to do good are unlimited. If the Church is to be as a light upon a hill\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34539\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34539)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34539)\">Matt. 5:14<\/a><\/span>)\nand a beacon to all people, I am firmly convinced that our most important duty is to be true,\nfaithful, and devoted disciples of Christ, and not as people of the world, for the Lord has\ncalled us out of the world, a people peculiar unto him. In 1 John we read,\n<\/p><p>\nLove not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love\nthe world, the love of the Father is not in him; \n<\/p><p>\nFor all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,\nis not of the Father, but is of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth\nfor ever (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1037\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1037)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1037)\">1 Jn. 2:15-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis does not mean the Lord will deny to his people the good things that modern science and\ninvention have provided for the better enjoyment of life, but we are counseled to forego\nworldly pursuits and pleasures in favor of heavenly and spiritual things.\n<\/p><p>\n<\/p><p>\nIn this great land of ours we have enjoyed twelve prosperous years. No previous time begins\nto compare with it either for volume or duration. It would now seem prudent, wise, and\ntimely to stabilize our financial positions, making safe our holdings and possessions to assure\nsecurity, proper living standards, cultural and economic advantages for ourselves and families,\nand also make possible our most sacred duty in building up the Lord's kingdom in the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has counseled his people to pray over their flocks and herds\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8934\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8934)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8934)\">Alma 34:20<\/a><\/span>), which applies to every\nman's interests. If we faithfully live the gospel and honor the Holy Priesthood of God, we\nhave a right and claim upon him for his blessings and the inspiration to guide us in making\nproper decisions for the conduct of our businesses in this period of economic uncertainty.\nThere are serious rough spots ahead, flashing warning lights of caution that Latter-day Saints\ncannot ignore. This past week the stock market ran for shelter on indication of possible peace\nin Korea. Business and markets are sensitive to any change in world conditions. We must\nrecognize the signs of the times as indicated by prophecy and have vision and wise\nunderstanding of national and world trends to safeguard our interests and thus strengthen the\ncause of Zion, even as Joseph of old so wisely planned and prepared against the days of\nfamine and adversity, and thus became a great benefactor to the Egyptians and his father's\nfamily. We need all the help that faith, prayer, and inspiration can give.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Latter-day Saints by getting out of debt and thus securing their holdings could set a good\nexample for all people. We were advised recently from this pulpit by President Stephen L\nRichards to get out of debt, and that counsel now under present economic conditions, and\nparticularly in the light of the past week's happenings, is most timely and wise. With such\nadmonition there should be no cause for us to err in our judgments as to the\ncourse we should follow.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are acquainted with recent government economy moves which, I hope, we all approve and\ncommend our national leaders for, but it does indicate a cautious trend in our national life and\nis bound to spread to other fields. We have also witnessed an adjustment in farm commodity\nand livestock prices. In spite of heavy government military orders, consumer merchandise is\nbecoming more plentiful and shortages progressively fewer in number. Prices in some lines\nare softening, and the cost of living index is lowering. The long sustained inflationary boom\nperiod made possible by war scare, high taxes, a staggering government debt, also increasing\nserious world problems with peace in the balance, are danger signals that call for caution and\nwise decisions. The economic adjustments now taking place should over the long pull be\nhelpful to our national economy, but some segments of our economic life cannot help being\nhurt by lower prices caused by such adjustments. Some of our people have already\nexperienced serious and costly losses.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is generally conceded that 1953 will be a good business year, the first half favorable, the\nlast half perhaps doubtful, and 1954 rather clouded. The Latter-day Saints should take\nadvantage of whatever remaining good times that are ahead to get out of debt, make secure\npresent holdings, and not take chances with odds against them for a high rate of prosperity\ncontinuing. No one can ever be criticized for consolidating his position and holdings to assure\nsecurity and opportunities for himself and family. We must remember that we pay obligations\nand meet our commitments out of what is left after taxes. Taxation is a heavy taskmaster and\na hard teacher. I wonder whether heavier tax burdens leaving us less to show for our labors\nand thrifty habits are necessary before we realize what the true values of life are.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith has issued this warning,\n<\/p><p>\nI will prophesy that the signs of the coming of the Son of Man are already commenced. One\npestilence will desolate after another... Some may have cried peace, but the Saints in the\nworld will have little peace from henceforth... Wars are at hand... We ought to have the\nbuilding up of Zion as our greatest object (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>, p. 160).\n<\/p><p>\nI call your attention to the statement by President Joseph Fielding Smith in last Saturday's\nconference session when he said peace would not come to the earth until the Savior brings it\nat his second coming.\n<\/p><p>\nNow in this talk, my brothers and sisters, I am not intending to cause panic or fear in the\nhearts of the Latter-day Saint people. Again, 1953 is conceded a fair year, however, an\norderly and planned program of debt liquidation with protection of interests, eliminating all\nrisk hazards should be very helpful and not harmful to the national economy, and as I\ninterpret present conditions, it appears to me the wise course to follow. I know it will bring\npeace and comfort of mind and a glorious sense of security and well-being for those we love\nand who depend upon us with full trust and confidence for life's necessities and opportunities.\n<\/p><p>\nMy soul is full with the spirit of this latter-day work. It is most important. It must not fail.\nGod has called us to holy callings and depends on us to keep free of entanglements and\nfinancial involvements to serve him freely and effectively and to promote his glorious\nkingdom on earth. May we ever keep in mind these suggestions and be faithful and true in\nour Church obligations I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
