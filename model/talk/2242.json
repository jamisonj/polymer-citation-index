What would the Lord Jesus Christ have us do?

While many men have admirable qualities, there is only one man who ever walked the earth who was without sin, whose father of his physical body was God the Father, and who had the power to resurrect his own body. This Jesus is our exemplar and has commanded us to follow in his steps.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p8\" class=\"\">God the Father has given Jesus Christ a name above all others, so that eventually every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ. He is the way, the truth, and the light, and no one can come back into the presence of our Father in heaven except through him. Christ is God the Son and possesses every virtue in its perfection. Therefore, the only measure of true greatness is how close a man can become like Jesus. That man is greatest who is most like Christ, and those who love him most will be most like him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p9\" class=\"\">How, then, does a man imitate God, follow his steps, and walk as he walked, which we are commanded to do? We must study the life of Christ, learn his commandments, and do them. God has promised that to follow this course will lead a man to an abundant life and a fullness of joy and the peace and rest which those who are heavy-burdened long for. To learn of Christ necessitates the study of the scriptures and the testimonies of those who know him. We come to know him through prayer and the inspiration and revelation that God has promised to those who keep his commandments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p10\" class=\"\">And how do you learn the commandments? You learn the commandments through the words of the Lord in the scriptures, through the revelations received by his authorized servants, the Light of Christ, like a conscience that comes to every man, and through personal revelation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p11\" class=\"\">It is significant that when Paul asked the question, \u201cLord, what wilt thou have me to do?\u201d Christ directed Paul to one of the Lord\u2019s authorized servants. So it was with Cornelius, who after prayer was instructed to send men to contact Peter. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"8141\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8141)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8141)\">Acts 10:1\u20138<\/a><\/span>.) It has always been so\u2014that whenever God has had his prophets upon the earth, men could go to them to learn of Christ and his commandments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p12\" class=\"\">The inspired words of these prophets, when written down, became scripture, and whenever God has his representatives on the earth, there is always new revelation and new scripture. Only when men became so corrupt that the prophets were taken out of their midst did scriptures cease. And God stated that only through his authorized representatives could men receive the ordinances essential for salvation and the commandments necessary for the perfecting of his children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p13\" class=\"\">Speaking to his prophets, the Lord said: \u201cHe that receiveth you receiveth me. \u2026\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36144\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36144)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36144)\">Matt. 10:40<\/a><\/span>.) Always the words of the living prophet took precedence, for it was God\u2019s message to the people at that particular time. Had any man accepted the ancient scripture in the days of Noah but refused to follow the revelation that Noah received and failed to board the ark, he would have been drowned. Always the words of the living prophets are of the most vital concern to the people; and always, if a man would know of Christ and learn his commandments so that he can obey them, he must seek to find his authorized representatives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p14\" class=\"\">For centuries, because of the wickedness of men, prophets of God no longer walked the earth, so scripture ended with the last words in the New Testament. Confusion and contention reigned in so-called Christendom, for all they had was the ancient scripture, but they were without the prophets of God to explain it to them and to receive new revelation, new scripture, and to be authorized to direct the work of the ministry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p15\" class=\"\">But in 1820, the greatest single event since the resurrection of the Christ occurred. God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, personally visited a young boy by the name of Joseph Smith, who had been praying to know which church to join. God, our Father, spoke to the lad and said, \u201c\u2026 <span class=\"emphasis\">This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!<\/span>\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30556\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30556)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30556)\">JS\u2014H 1:17<\/a><\/span>.) God the Son told Joseph Smith not to join any of the churches. Joseph was to learn that the Lord\u2019s true church was not on the earth; that living prophets of God, who were the foundation of the church, had not walked the earth for centuries; and that with their deaths, the rock of revelation on which the church was built ceased; and so there was no new scripture.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p16\" class=\"\">Eventually, to Joseph Smith appeared the men who were the last authorized servants to direct the church of Jesus Christ\u2014Peter, James, and John. These glorified beings ordained Joseph Smith with the same authority they had received from Jesus, so that once again there was a prophet of God on the earth who could say, \u201c\u2026 thus saith the Lord.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15886\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15886)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15886)\">D&amp;C 44:1<\/a><\/span>.) Joseph Smith ordained others with the authority that he had received, and so the church of Jesus Christ was restored in these latter days\u2014The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p17\" class=\"\">In due time, another heavenly messenger came to Joseph Smith to tell him that God was about to give to the earth a scriptural account of the early inhabitants of America, as the Bible is a scriptural account that covers the other side of the world. This American scripture that was translated by Joseph Smith, through the inspiration of heaven, is called the Book of Mormon. It tells, among other things, of Christ\u2019s personal appearance to God\u2019s children here in America after his resurrection in Jerusalem and of his instructions to them. The mission of the Book of Mormon is to be a companion volume with the Bible, to serve as a second witness that Jesus is the Christ, to show that God loves one nation as another, and to reduce contention by making clear many of the doctrines that have confused Christendom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p18\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith received many revelations from Jesus Christ, as have the prophets who have succeeded him, which means that new scripture has been given. The Lord\u2019s mouthpiece and his prophet on the face of the earth today is President Harold B. Lee, who received his authority through a line of prophets going back to Joseph Smith, who was ordained by Peter, James, and John, who were ordained by Christ, who was and is the head of the Church, the Creator of this earth, and the God before whom all men must stand accountable.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p19\" class=\"\">Now this marvelous message\u2014that God has spoken to prophets in our day and reestablished his church\u2014is for all the world. When Nathanael questioned Philip, telling him that he had found Jesus, Philip responded by saying, \u201cCome and see.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28655\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28655)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28655)\">John 1:46<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p20\" class=\"\">So do we respond, \u201cCome and see.\u201d Men can deceive you, but God will not.
