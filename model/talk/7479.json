We were a family of five: my father and four siblings. My mother had passed away when I was five years old. My father\u2019s meager income was used to buy our food; the purchase of clothing was put off as long as possible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/why-are-we-members-of-the-only-true-church.p9\" class=\"\">One day, somewhat bothered, I came up to my father and said, \u201cDaddy, why don\u2019t you buy me some shoes?

We were baptized, and when my father began his calling as district president, his first objective was to journey to the temple and receive the blessings which would come because of that sacrifice. It was a 15-day journey covering 4,800 miles (7,725 km)\u2014a journey filled with difficulties and setbacks, highways in poor condition, uncomfortable buses, not even knowing the route, but with great hope in the ordinances we would participate in.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/why-are-we-members-of-the-only-true-church.p14\" class=\"\">Upon arriving in the city of Mesa, Arizona, we headed down an avenue at the end of which we could see the house of the Lord, gleaming and beautiful.
