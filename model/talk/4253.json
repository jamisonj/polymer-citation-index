Pratt visited South America in 1851. The work was attempted again in 1925. On Christmas Day of 1925, in the park of Tres de Febrero in Buenos Aires, Argentina, my grandfather, Elder Melvin J. Ballard, dedicated South America for the preaching of the gospel. I quote from the dedicatory prayer:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-kingdom-rolls-forth-in-south-america.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cBless the presidents, governors, and the leading officials of these South American countries, that they may kindly receive us and give us permission to open the doors of salvation to the people of these lands. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-kingdom-rolls-forth-in-south-america.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now, oh, Father, by authority of the blessing and appointment by the President of the Church, and <span class=\"emphasis\">by the authority of the holy apostleship<\/span> which I have, I turn the key, unlock, and open the door for the preaching of the Gospel in all these South American nations, and do rebuke and command to be stayed every power that would oppose the preaching of the Gospel in these lands; and we do bless and dedicate these nations of this land for the preaching of thy Gospel. And we do all this that salvation may come to all men, and that thy name may be honored and glorified in this part of the land of Zion.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Melvin J.

I read with great interest of the extreme difficulties that they encountered. The trip from Salt Lake City to Buenos Aires for Elders Melvin J. Ballard, Rey L. Pratt, and Rulon S. Wells was by land and sea, taking thirty-four days. In comparison, my recent trip covering the same distance took twenty-one hours.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-kingdom-rolls-forth-in-south-america.p15\" class=\"\">There were only four members of the Church in South America in 1925; they greeted the missionaries upon their arrival. To conserve resources, the missionaries rented one hotel room to house all three of them. They moved several times until they finally located a low-cost apartment in which the three of them could live.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-kingdom-rolls-forth-in-south-america.p16\" class=\"\">Efforts to advertise the first public meetings in the Buenos Aires newspapers were fruitless. The newspapers refused to print an ad. Elder Pratt prepared a handbill in Spanish. Elder Ballard, who spoke only English, distributed these handbills each day. Elder Pratt spent most of his time translating doctrine and hymns into Spanish. Elder Wells, who spoke German, became ill and returned to Church headquarters shortly after his arrival in Argentina.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-kingdom-rolls-forth-in-south-america.p17\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, it is difficult to express my feelings as I read of the early beginnings of missionary work in South America. I am deeply touched to realize that for nearly eight months my grandfather walked the streets of Buenos Aires giving out two hundred to five hundred handbills every day but Sunday, inviting the people to learn the message of the Restoration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-kingdom-rolls-forth-in-south-america.p18\" class=\"\">The work among the native Argentines was very difficult. Only one was baptized during the first eight months. On 4 July 1926, Grandfather said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-kingdom-rolls-forth-in-south-america.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cThe work of the Lord will grow slowly for a time here just as an oak grows slowly from an acorn. It will not shoot up in a day as does the sunflower that grows quickly and then dies. But thousands will join the Church here. It will be divided into more than one mission and will be one of the strongest in the Church. The work here is the smallest that it will ever be. The day will come when the Lamanites in this land will be given a chance. The South American Mission will be a power in the Church.\u201d (Vernon Sharp diary, in <span class=\"emphasis\">Melvin J.

One hundred eighty-six stakes cover the land, with 2,148 wards and branches dotting the countryside. Approximately 776,000 members of the Church are an evidence of the fulfillment of the dedicatory prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-kingdom-rolls-forth-in-south-america.p21\" class=\"\">At the regional conference last month in Montevideo, President and Sister J. Thomas Fyans and I met with 3,350 Saints. President and Sister Helio R. Camargo and I met with more than 3,100 Saints in Bogota, Colombia, the following Sunday. The work is prospering in this part of the Lord\u2019s vineyard.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-kingdom-rolls-forth-in-south-america.p22\" class=\"\">The effective work of the General Authorities of the past and of those of today is evidenced in the faithful lives of the Saints. Thousands of missionaries have served with distinction. Dedicated men and women are leading the Church in their own countries in a magnificent way. It is a joy to see second- and third-generation members living worthy to be leaders in South America.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-kingdom-rolls-forth-in-south-america.p23\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, as I visited with the Saints in South America, the words of Nephi came to mind:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-kingdom-rolls-forth-in-south-america.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cHe doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him.

They express faith and commitment and love for the Lord. They are seeking to be worthy of the full blessings of the gospel. Several Aaronic Priesthood boys dressed in their Scout uniforms greeted me in Bogota. Without hesitation they all told me they will serve as missionaries as soon as they are old enough. With such a spirit, the future of the Church in South America will be in good hands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-kingdom-rolls-forth-in-south-america.p26\" class=\"\">I visited the temple in Buenos Aires.

Nearly five billion of our Heavenly Father\u2019s children live on it. The responsibility of taking the gospel to them rests upon our shoulders. I am impressed, as I now start to see the larger picture, that the stake presidents must take more of the responsibility for preparing their people to receive all the blessings of the gospel. Bishops and branch presidents must do likewise. Our work is not complete until our Father\u2019s children enter the temple to receive all of the necessary ordinances to prepare them for celestial living in the presence of our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-kingdom-rolls-forth-in-south-america.p29\" class=\"\">Teaching and preparing the members of the Church to be worthy of the temple blessings rests upon the shoulders of the priesthood. There is no substitute, in my opinion, for inspired local leaders. I was most impressed with the conversion stories told by the stake presidencies in Bogota. One stake president, who has served for more than eight years, reported that he was called after only two and one-half years of membership in the Church. The Lord does bless his leaders when they put their trust in him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-kingdom-rolls-forth-in-south-america.p30\" class=\"\">The Church is organized properly.
