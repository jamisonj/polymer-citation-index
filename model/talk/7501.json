I have visited sacrament meetings in some of the poorest places on the earth where mothers have dressed with great care in their Sunday best despite walking for miles on dusty streets and using worn-out public transportation. They bring daughters in clean and ironed dresses with hair brushed to perfection; their sons wear white shirts and ties and have missionary haircuts. These mothers know they are going to sacrament meeting, where covenants are renewed. These mothers have made and honor temple covenants. They know that if they are not pointing their children to the temple, they are not pointing them toward desired eternal goals.

Therefore, mothers who know create a climate for spiritual and temporal growth in their homes. Another word for <span class=\"emphasis\">nurturing <\/span>is <span class=\"emphasis\">homemaking.<\/span> Homemaking includes cooking, washing clothes and dishes, and keeping an orderly home. Home is where women have the most power and influence; therefore, Latter-day Saint women should be the best homemakers in the world. Working beside children in homemaking tasks creates opportunities to teach and model qualities children should emulate. Nurturing mothers are knowledgeable, but all the education women attain will avail them nothing if they do not have the skill to make a home that creates a climate for spiritual growth. Growth happens best in a \u201chouse of order,\u201d and women should pattern their homes after the Lord\u2019s house (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51513\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51513)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51513)\">D&amp;C 109:8<\/a><\/span>).

In equal partnership with their husbands, they lead a great and eternal organization. These mothers plan for the future of their organization. They plan for missions, temple marriages, and education. They plan for prayer, scripture study, and family home evening. Mothers who know build children into future leaders and are the primary examples of what leaders look like. They do not abandon their plan by succumbing to social pressure and worldly models of parenting. These wise mothers who know are selective about their own activities and involvement to conserve their limited strength in order to maximize their influence where it matters most.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Mothers Who Know Are Teachers<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/mothers-who-know.p17\" class=\"\">Mothers who know are always teachers. Since they are not babysitters, they are never off duty. A well-taught friend told me that he did not learn anything at church that he had not already learned at home. His parents used family scripture study, prayer, family home evening, mealtimes, and other gatherings to teach. Think of the power of our future missionary force if mothers considered their homes as a pre\u2013missionary training center. Then the doctrines of the gospel taught in the MTC would be a review and not a revelation.

These mothers choose carefully and do not try to choose it all. Their goal is to prepare a rising generation of children who will take the gospel of Jesus Christ into the entire world. Their goal is to prepare future fathers and mothers who will be builders of the Lord\u2019s kingdom for the next 50 years.
