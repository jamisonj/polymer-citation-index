Hunter, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1963, pp. 14-18<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear Son Michael: \n<\/p><p>\nWith the hope that I might say something, my son, that will help you to live a more complete\nand joyful life and that someday you will receive a blessed exaltation in the presence of our\nLord, I am writing you this letter.\n<\/p><p>\nDeep in the heart of every human being is a strong desire to experience joy day by day. In\nfact, Father Lehi claimed that the achievement of a life of joy was the principal purpose of\nour existence. He said: \"Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have\njoy\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3691\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3691)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3691)\">2 Ne. 2:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn order that you might live a life filled with joy, that you might be happy now, in the future,\nand forever, it is necessary that you understand who you are and the course that you must\nfollow in order to attain a fulness of joy in this life and in the world to come.\n<\/p><p>\nYou are a son of God, literally and actually a child of an Eternal Father in heaven. You are\nendowed with the spiritual attributes of godliness that if properly cultivated will result\neventually in your returning to the presence of that Divine Being and receiving eternal life.\nRegarding this important truth, the First Presidency, President Joseph F. Smith and his\nCounselors, Presidents John R. Winder and Anthon H. Lund, wrote: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Man is a child of God, formed in the divine image and endowed with divine attributes, and\neven as the infant son of an earthly father and mother is capable in due time of becoming a\nman, so the undeveloped offspring of celestial parentage is capable, by experience through\nages of aeons, of evolving into a God.\" (<i>The Improvement Era<\/i> 13:81.)\n<\/p><p>\nMy son, in the spring of 1820, the greatest event that ever occurred in the United States took\nplace in the Sacred Grove in New York. God our Eternal Father and his Only Begotten Son\nappeared to a boy just your age&mdash;the Prophet Joseph Smith&mdash;in response to his prayer\nregarding which church to join. This marvelous vision was the prelude to the restoration of\nthe gospel of Jesus Christ. Soon thereafter, numerous heavenly beings appeared to the\nProphet, revealing the gospel of Jesus Christ for the salvation of as many of the human family\nas will believe and obey. The true church was established; namely, The Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nIn accordance with the predictions of the ancient prophets, this is the Dispensation of the\nFulness of Times, \". . . the times of the restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by\nthe mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7917\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7917)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7917)\">Acts 3:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYou have the tremendous blessing, my son, of being a member of the true Church of Jesus\nChrist. This is an inheritance more valuable than all of the wealth of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nSeek day by day throughout your life to have sufficient inspiration and wisdom to know what\nthe Lord our Savior desires you to do; and then work under that divine inspiration to do it at\nall times to the best of your ability. Jesus put it this way: \"But seek ye first the kingdom of\nGod, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35236\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35236)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35236)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAlways select good company with whom to associate. Your companions greatly influence the\nlife that you live. Stay away from places of temptation. If any young man frequents places of\nevil, eventually he will be ensnared in sin.\n<\/p><p>\nIn modern revelation, the Lord has commanded: \"Wherefore, stand ye in holy places\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14307\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14307)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14307)\">D&amp;C 87:8<\/a><\/span>).\nGoing to church and doing temple work places one in holy places. The Lord thy\nGod commanded: \"And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world,\nthou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14275\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14275)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14275)\">D&amp;C 59:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nKeep your mind and heart clean and pure at all times. The scriptures truthfully declared: \"For\nas . . . [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41457\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41457)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41457)\">Prov. 23:7<\/a><\/span>). Our thoughts are like seeds\nplanted in a fertile garden. They take root, grow, and eventually mature in full bloom. Thus\nthe very center of our character-growth is our inner thoughts. Our thoughts precede our\nactions. They are the underlying forces that shape our destiny. My son, if one could look into\nyour heart when you have nothing in particular to do but to live with your thoughts, one\ncould predict your future happiness and successes or your future heartaches and failures.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is definitely true that each person is the product of his own individual thinking. Mr. James\nAllen aptly declared: \"Whatever your present environment may be, you will fall, remain, or\nrise with your thoughts, your Vision, or your Ideals. You will become as small as your\ncontrolling desire, as great as your dominating aspiration\" (<i>As A Man Thinketh<\/i>, p. 42).\n<\/p><p>\nThus let me advise: my son, guard your mind and your thinking continuously. Do not listen to\nimpure or indecent stories. Never repeat a thought or a story that you would not be proud to\ntell your mother. Immoral stories are insidious and degrading to one's spiritual growth and\nsweetness of personality; therefore, remember never to let anything come from your lips that\nis indecent, suggestive, degrading, or of an immoral nature in any respect. The Savior\ndeclared: \"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35223\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35223)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35223)\">Matt. 5:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nKnowing that we are children of God, the Apostle Paul pointed out that our\nbodies are very sacred. He said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?\n<\/p><p>\n\"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy,\nwhich temple ye are\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"363\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 363)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(363)\">1 Cor. 3:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOn another occasion, the Apostle Paul made it very clear that each of us will have to answer\nfor his own mistakes, and, on the other hand, each of us will be rewarded for his own good\nactions. To quote: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the\nSpirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23267\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23267)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23267)\">Gal. 6:7-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nRemember this, my son, God is no respecter of persons. He will hold you accountable for\nyour sins and reward you for your righteous acts. The writer of Ecclesiastes truthfully\ndeclared: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for\nthis is the whole duty of man.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good,\nor whether it be evil\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21413\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21413)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21413)\">Eccl. 12:13-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe justice and mercy of God in blessing his children is given plainly in the Doctrine and\nCovenants as follows: \n<\/p><p>\n\"There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon\nwhich all blessings are predicated&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\n\"And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to the law upon which it is\npredicated\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14347\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14347)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14347)\">D&amp;C 130:20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMy son, there was a divine and eternal truth declared by Alma, that great Nephite prophet and\nteacher, which I wish would rise in front of your eyes in your mind as a great placard in\nglowing letters every time temptation comes your way throughout life. I would that every\nLatter-day Saint boy, girl, man, and woman would memorize Alma's divine declaration and\nthat it would flash strongly in their minds on each and every occasion that they are tempted to\ndo wrong. Alma declared: \"Behold I say unto you, <i>wickedness never was happiness<\/i>\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9038\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9038)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9038)\">Alma 41:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPerhaps a scripture of equal vital importance to have ringing in your ears is Paul's firm\ndeclaration that \". . . the wages of sin is death\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42767\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42767)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42767)\">Rom. 6:23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYour Heavenly Father has\nblessed you, my son, with a healthy body and a keen mind. Certainly he expects you to keep\nthem that way. To help accomplish this, he revealed the Word of Wisdom. It stands to reason\nthat wise boys and wise men will at no time take substances into their bodies which are not\ngood for them. I plead with you to refrain from taking the first smoke, and then tobacco will\nnever be a severe temptation to you. The same truth holds for any other harmful substance\nthat you might be tempted to take into your body. Set your standards high. Be determined that\nyou will never break God's law of health. The achievement of this resolution will bring you\njoy, peace, and comfort. It will result in your maintaining health in your body and mind; and\nyou will receive \". . . wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14315\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14315)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14315)\">D&amp;C 89:19<\/a><\/span>),\none of which treasures is a firm conviction that Jesus is the Christ and the Savior of\nthe world. Also, obedience to the Word of Wisdom will help you to maintain your body as a\npure temple in which the Spirit of God can dwell.\n<\/p><p>\nMy son, be prayerful. Pray to your Heavenly Father every night before you retire to bed. Pray\nto him every morning before you leave your bedroom. Pray for the sick and afflicted, the\npoor and needy, the widows and orphans and all workers of righteousness throughout the\nworld. Pour out your heart in thanksgiving to him for the numerous blessings that he gives\nyou. Pray to him for his divine guidance in your schoolwork. He will answer your prayers by\nenhancing your memory and by giving you strength and wisdom to complete your\nassignments. He will help you to succeed in your numerous undertakings.\n<\/p><p>\nThroughout life continue to call upon your Heavenly Father for divine\nguidance in all things that you do. Great men such as George Washington and Abraham\nLincoln found their supreme strength in times of distress in humble prayer to their Divine\nCreator. So will your burdens, my son, be made lighter and your heart be filled with serenity\nand peace as you travel the highway of life if you continue to keep your Eternal Father as\nyour companion, your friend, and your guide. Surely he will take you by the hand and will\ngive you answers to your prayers.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the most vital things in your life, if you are to have joy, is for you to learn to work\nand to love to work. My son, work and work and work, for herein lies perhaps your greatest\njoy. I know of nothing that gives more satisfaction to one's hearts than to have a job he likes,\nand to do that job efficiently to the best of his ability. An indescribable peace and satisfaction\ncome into one's heart through work well done. When you stand before the judgment seat of\nthe Lord after leaving this mortal life, be able to report honestly that you always did a full\nday's work. As you know, one of the two first laws given to Adam and Eve was the\ncommandment to earn their bread by the sweat of their faces\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23690\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23690)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23690)\">Gen. 3:19<\/a><\/span>). This law we must all obey if\nour lives are pleasing to our Heavenly Father. The following important advice appeared in the\nSalt Lake <i>Tribune<\/i>: \n<\/p><p>\n\"A police chief's advice to teenagers&mdash;Always we hear the plaintive cry of the teenagers&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\n\"'What can we do? Where can we go?'\n<\/p><p>\n\"The answer is . . . go home! Hang the storm windows, paint the woodwork, rake the leaves,\nmow the lawn, shovel the walk, wash the car; learn to cook, scrub the floors, repair the sink,\nbuild a boat, get a job, help the minister, priest, or rabbi, the Red Cross, the Salvation Army,\nvisit the sick, assist the poor, study your lessons, and then when you are through and not tired\n. . . read a good book.\"\n<\/p><p>\nMy son, if you are to live a life filled with joy and happiness, learn now while in your youth\nthat such results come about only to the proportion that you render service to your fellow\nmen. We serve our God by serving his children. There is nothing sweeter in all the world\nthan the spiritual blessings which come to us as a result of service&mdash;with the result of losing\nour lives for the Master's sake (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35255\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35255)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35255)\">Matt. 10:39<\/a><\/span>),\nwith the assurance that someday we shall receive eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nWith these thoughts and purpose in mind, live in such a way that you are preparing to go on\na mission when the call comes from the Lord. Save your money now in your own private\nmissionary fund. Study the scriptures. Learn the gospel doctrines and then you will be\nprepared to serve your fellow men&mdash;God's children&mdash;when the call comes.\n<\/p><p>\nMy son, be honest in all of your dealings. Never tell a lie. Build a character of high integrity.\nBe just and righteous in all of your actions as you go through life. Joy and success will be\nyour reward.\n<\/p><p>\nIn due time you will desire to obey the greatest law that God has given to man&mdash;the law of\ncelestial marriage. My son, while in your youth you are preparing by clean living for this\ngreat event. During your courtship days, court on a spiritual plane; and then when you\nestablish a home it will be built upon a rock foundation which will weather all storms.\n<\/p><p>\nTo live and achieve in this world of complex problems, my son, you must have courage. Do\naway with any fear that may enter your heart. Fear is a destroyer of success and happiness. It\nconfuses the mind. It undermines one's abilities. Peace of mind comes from a clear\nconscience and the conquest of fear. Therefore, remember and do at all times as the Lord\ncommanded Joshua: \". . . Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou\ndismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30059\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30059)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30059)\">Josh. 1:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, my son, I shall close this letter by making only one more important suggestion. As\nyou travel through life, have faith in yourself. Have faith that you can accomplish\nthe things which you righteously take into your heart to accomplish.\nDisappointments do come in life; but also great shall be your joy with the numerous\naccomplishments you will make through tenaciously retaining faith in your ability to achieve.\n<\/p><p>\nAffectionately,\n<\/p><p>\nYour Father\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
