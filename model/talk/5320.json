Indeed, Easter, along with perhaps Christmas, may be the only time in the whole year that some of our brothers and sisters in Christ\u2019s flock find their way to church. That is admirable, but we wonder if thoughts of Jesus, which \u201cwith sweetness [fill our] breast,\u201d ought not to be far more frequent and much more constant in all times and seasons of our lives. How often do we think of the Savior? How deeply and how gratefully and how adoringly do we reflect on his life? How central to our lives do we know him to be?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/jesus-the-very-thought-of-thee.p14\" class=\"\">For example, how much of a normal day, a working week, or a fleeting month is devoted to \u201cJesus, the very thought of thee\u201d?
