The work of the Church depends upon basics such as paying tithes; taking care of family and priesthood duties; caring for the poor and the needy; having daily prayer, scripture study, and family home evening; home teaching; participation in quorum activity; and attending the temple. If called upon by the President of the Church, we would be ready, able, and willing to do \u201csome great thing,\u201d such as working on the Nauvoo temple, but many are not quite so anxious to do some of these basics.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/some-great-thing.p5\" class=\"\">We are all familiar with the Old Testament story of Naaman, the captain of the Syrian hosts, who was a leper.

He served under the direction of his younger brother, the Prophet Joseph. He was ever a source of strength and comfort to his brother, whether in Church service or in the Liberty Jail. As persecutions came and Joseph fled the mob at Nauvoo in 1844, Hyrum went with him. As they stood on the bank of the river, contemplating whether to return, Joseph turned to Hyrum and said, \u201cYou are the oldest, what shall we do?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/some-great-thing.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cLet us go back and give ourselves up and see the thing out,\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote13-21911_000_021\">13<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"emphasis\">Hyrum Smith\u2014Patriarch,<\/span> as quoted in <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Feb. 2000, 36.]<\/span><\/sup> Hyrum replied.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/some-great-thing.p19\" class=\"\">They returned to Nauvoo and were taken to Carthage, where they died as martyrs within minutes of one another. Hyrum had been faithful to his trust even to the laying down of his life. In all respects he was a disciple of the Savior. But his day-to-day striving made him truly great. In contrast, Oliver Cowdery was great when handling the plates and being attended to by angels, but when called upon to faithfully endure day-to-day trials and challenges, Oliver faltered and fell away from the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/some-great-thing.p20\" class=\"\">We do not prove our love for the Savior only by doing \u201csome great thing.\u201d If the prophet personally asked you to go on a mission to some strange and exotic place, would you go? You would probably make every effort to go. But what about paying tithing? What about doing your home teaching? We show our love for the Savior by doing the many small acts of faith, devotion, and kindness to others that define our character. This was well demonstrated by the life of Dr. George R. Hill III, former General Authority, who died a few months ago.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/some-great-thing.p21\" class=\"\">Elder Hill was a world authority on coal and a renowned scientist. He received multiple awards and honors for his scientific achievements. He was dean of the College of Mines and Mineral Resources and Envirotech professor of engineering at the University of Utah. But as a person, Elder Hill was humble, self-effacing, and totally dedicated. He served as the bishop of three different wards and as a regional representative before being called as a General Authority. After his release as a General Authority, he became a counselor in a ward bishopric. His last callings, at a time when he was in failing health, were as stake cannery director and member of a ward choir. He filled these last callings with the same commitment as he had all the others.

He assigned himself to do weeding even though the pain was so great that he pulled himself along on his stomach with his elbows. The pain was too great for him to kneel.
