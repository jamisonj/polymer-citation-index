I am\nthankful beyond my power to express for my faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ. I am happy\nthat I was born a member of this Church and that I have a testimony of its divinity and its\ntruthfulness. The Lord has been good to me; He has heard my prayers, and He has come to\nmy rescue.\n<\/p><p>\nMen and women need a vindication against the tyranny of death and time, and that\nvindication is supplied best of all in the restoration of the everlasting gospel in these the last\ndays.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we be true to our covenants.\n<\/p><p>\nMay our testimonies grow. May our knowledge of the truth increase, so that when calamities\nand disturbances come we may say in the words of the scriptures: \"The judgments of the\nAlmighty are righteous altogether\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41716\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41716)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41716)\">Ps. 19:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI know God's work is upon the earth, and I know that He has established His Church among\nmen.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we be true to our responsibilities; may we carry forward in our duties, that when our\nwork is done we may receive the plaudit, \"Well and faithfully done; enter into the joys of thy\nLord\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33817\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33817)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33817)\">Matt. 25:21<\/a><\/span>),\nI pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
