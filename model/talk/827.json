By virtue of this law, if a man walks, acts, and lives in\nthis life in such a manner that his conduct is justified by the Spirit, he eventually will attain\nan inheritance in the celestial world.\n<\/p><p>\nOn the day the Church was organized, April 6, 1830, the Prophet, writing by way of prophecy\nand revelation, summarized the basic doctrines of the Church.  Among other\nthings he wrote this: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd we know that justification through the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is\njust and true (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13445\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13445)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13445)\">D&amp;C 20:30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the summary of the gospel law given in the days of Father Adam, we find this sentence: \n<\/p><p>\nFor by the water ye keep the commandment; by the Spirit ye are justified, and by the\nblood ye are sanctified (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39089\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39089)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39089)\">Moses 6:60<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the early 1830's, when the Lord was talking to the Prophet about what is called the new\nand everlasting covenant&mdash;that is, about the fulness of the gospel&mdash;he revealed this further\ntruth relative to this great law of justification, and I think these following words are a perfect\none sentence summary of the whole law of the whole gospel.  The Lord said: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances,\nconnections, associations, or expectations, that are not made and entered into and\nsealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed, both as well for time\nand for all eternity, and that too most holy, by revelation and commandment through\nthe medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this power\n. . . are of no efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13535\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13535)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13535)\">D&amp;C 132:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOne more expression in the revelations has bearing on this. The Lord said: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . the Holy Spirit of promise, which the Father sheds forth upon all those who are\njust and true (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13482\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13482)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13482)\">D&amp;C 76:53<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, to justify is to seal, or to ratify, or to approve; and it is very evident from these\nrevelations that every act that we do, if it is to have binding and sealing virtue in eternity,\nmust be justified by the Spirit.  In other words, it must be ratified by the Holy Ghost; or in\nother words, it must be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise.\n<\/p><p>\nAll of us know that we can deceive men.  We can deceive our bishops or the other Church\nagents, unless at the moment their minds are lighted by the spirit of revelation; but we cannot\ndeceive the Lord.  We cannot get from him an unearned blessing.  There will be an eventual\nday when all men will get exactly and precisely what they have merited and earned, neither\nadding to nor subtracting from.  You cannot with success lie to the Holy Ghost.\n<\/p><p>\nNow let us take a simple illustration. If an individual is to gain an inheritance in the celestial\nworld, he has to enter in at the gate of baptism, that ordinance being performed under the\nhands of a legal administrator.  If he comes forward prepared by worthiness, that is, if he is\njust and true, and gains baptism under the hands of a legal administrator, he is justified by the\nSpirit in the act which has been performed; that is, it is ratified by the Holy Ghost, or it is\nsealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise. As a result it is of full force and validity in this life and\nin the life to come.\n<\/p><p>\nIf an individual thereafter turns from righteousness and goes off and wallows in the mire of\niniquity, then the seal is removed, and so we have this principle which keeps the unworthy\nfrom gaining unearned blessings.  The Lord has placed a bar which stops the progress of the\nunrighteous; he has placed a requirement which we must meet.  We must gain the approval\nand receive the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost if eventually and in eternity we are to\nreap the blessings that we hope to reap.\n<\/p><p>\nThe same thing that is true of baptism is true of marriage.  If a couple comes forward\nworthily, a couple who is just and true, and they enter into that ordinance under the hands of\na legal administrator, a seal of approval is recorded in heaven.  Then assuming they do not\nthereafter break that seal, assuming they keep the covenant and press forward in steadfastness\nand in righteousness, they go on in the next world as husband and wife; and in and after the\nresurrection, that ordinance performed in such a binding manner here has full force, efficacy,\nand validity.\n<\/p><p>\nI think perhaps this doctrine, as almost all other doctrines that we teach in the Church, leads\nus back to the same central conclusion, which is that it is obligatory upon us to keep the\ncommandments of God if we ever expect to inherit the blessings that he has promised the\nSaints.  We should remind ourselves again and again of these words which\nhe has spoken: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in\nthis world, and eternal life in the world to come\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13472\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13472)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13472)\">D&amp;C 59:23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
