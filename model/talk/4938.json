It has to do with the privilege and responsibility of being good parents. On this subject there are about as many opinions as there are parents, yet there are few who claim to have all of the answers. I am certainly not one of them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p4\" class=\"\">I feel that there are more outstanding young men and women among our people at present than at any other moment in my lifetime. This presupposes that most of these fine young people have come from good homes and have committed, caring parents. Even so, the most conscientious parents feel that they may have made some mistakes. One time, when I did a thoughtless thing, I remember my own mother exclaiming, \u201cWhere did I fail?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p5\" class=\"\">The Lord has directed, \u201cBring up your children in light and truth.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19294\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19294)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19294)\">D&amp;C 93:40<\/a><\/span>.) To me, there is no more important human effort.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p6\" class=\"\">Being a father or a mother is not only a great challenge, it is a divine calling. It is an effort requiring consecration. President David O. McKay stated that being parents is \u201cthe greatest trust that has been given to human beings.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Responsibility of Parents to Their Children,<\/span> pamphlet, Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, n.d., p. 1.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p7\" class=\"\">While few human challenges are greater than that of being good parents, few opportunities offer greater potential for joy. Surely no more important work is to be done in this world than preparing our children to be God-fearing, happy, honorable, and productive. Parents will find no more fulfilling happiness than to have their children honor them and their teachings. It is the glory of parenthood. John testified, \u201cI have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5328\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5328)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5328)\">3 Jn. 1:4<\/a><\/span>.) In my opinion, the teaching, rearing, and training of children requires more intelligence, intuitive understanding, humility, strength, wisdom, spirituality, perseverance, and hard work than any other challenge we might have in life. This is especially so when moral foundations of honor and decency are eroding around us. To have successful homes, values must be taught, and there must be rules, there must be standards, and there must be absolutes. Many societies give parents very little support in teaching and honoring moral values. A number of cultures are becoming essentially valueless, and many of the younger people in those societies are becoming moral cynics.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p8\" class=\"\">As societies as a whole have decayed and lost their moral identity and so many homes are broken, the best hope is to turn greater attention and effort to the teaching of the next generation\u2014our children. In order to do this, we must first reinforce the primary teachers of children. Chief among these are the parents and other family members, and the best environment should be in the home. Somehow, some way, we must try harder to make our homes stronger so that they will stand as sanctuaries against the unwholesome, pervasive moral dry rot around us. Harmony, happiness, peace, and love in the home can help give children the required inner strength to cope with life\u2019s challenges. Barbara Bush, wife of President George Bush, a few months ago said to the graduates of Wellesley College:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cBut whatever the era, whatever the times, one thing will never change: Fathers and mothers, if you have children, they must come first. You must read to your children and you must hug your children and you must love your children. Your success as a family, our success as a society, depends not on what happens in the White House but on what happens inside your house.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Washington Post,<\/span> 2 June 1990, p. 2.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p10\" class=\"\">To be a good father and mother requires that the parents defer many of their own needs and desires in favor of the needs of their children. As a consequence of this sacrifice, conscientious parents develop a nobility of character and learn to put into practice the selfless truths taught by the Savior Himself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p11\" class=\"\">I have the greatest respect for single parents who struggle and sacrifice, trying against almost superhuman odds to hold the family together. They should be honored and helped in their heroic efforts. But any mother\u2019s or father\u2019s task is much easier where there are two functioning parents in the home. Children often challenge and tax the strength and wisdom of both parents.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p12\" class=\"\">A few years ago, Bishop Stanley Smoot was interviewed by President Spencer W. Kimball. President Kimball asked, \u201cHow often do you have family prayer?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p13\" class=\"\">Bishop Smoot answered, \u201cWe try to have family prayer twice a day, but we average about once.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p14\" class=\"\">President Kimball answered, \u201cIn the past, having family prayer once a day may have been all right. But in the future it will not be enough if we are going to save our families.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p15\" class=\"\">I wonder if having casual and infrequent family home evening will be enough in the future to fortify our children with sufficient moral strength. In the future, infrequent family scripture study may be inadequate to arm our children with the virtue necessary to withstand the moral decay of the environment in which they will live. Where in the world will the children learn chastity, integrity, honesty, and basic human decency if not at home? These values will, of course, be reinforced at church, but parental teaching is more constant.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p16\" class=\"\">When parents try to teach their children to avoid danger, it is no answer for parents to say to their children, \u201cWe are experienced and wise in the ways of the world, and we can get closer to the edge of the cliff than you.\u201d Parental hypocrisy can make children cynical and unbelieving of what they are taught in the home. For instance, when parents attend movies they forbid their children to see, parental credibility is diminished. If children are expected to be honest, parents must be honest. If children are expected to be virtuous, parents must be virtuous. If you expect your children to be honorable, you must be honorable.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p17\" class=\"\">Among the other values children should be taught are respect for others, beginning with the child\u2019s own parents and family; respect for the symbols of faith and patriotic beliefs of others; respect for law and order; respect for the property of others; respect for authority. Paul reminds us that children should \u201clearn first to shew piety at home.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2890\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2890)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2890)\">1 Tim. 5:4<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p18\" class=\"\">One of the most difficult parental challenges is to appropriately discipline children. Child rearing is so individualistic. Every child is different and unique. What works with one may not work with another. I do not know who is wise enough to say what discipline is too harsh or what is too lenient except the parents of the children themselves, who love them most. It is a matter of prayerful discernment for the parents. Certainly the overarching and undergirding principle is that the discipline of children must be motivated more by love than by punishment. Brigham Young counseled, \u201cIf you are ever called upon to chasten a person, never chasten beyond the balm you have within you to bind up.\u201d (In <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 9:124\u201325.) Direction and discipline are, however, certainly an indispensable part of child rearing. If parents do not discipline their children, then the public will discipline them in a way the parents do not like. Without discipline, children will not respect either the rules of the home or of society.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p19\" class=\"\">A principal purpose for discipline is to teach obedience. President David O. McKay stated, \u201cParents who fail to teach obedience to their children, if [their] homes do not develop obedience society will demand it and get it. It is therefore better for the home, with its kindliness, sympathy and understanding to train the child in obedience rather than callously to leave him to the brutal and unsympathetic discipline that society will impose if the home has not already fulfilled its obligation.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Responsibility of Parents to Their Children,<\/span> p. 3.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p20\" class=\"\">An essential part of teaching children to be disciplined and responsible is to have them learn to work. As we grow up, many of us are like the man who said, \u201cI like work; it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.\u201d (Jerome Klapka Jerome, in <span class=\"emphasis\">The International Dictionary of Thoughts,<\/span> comp. John P. Bradley, Leo F. Daniels, and Thomas C. Jones Chicago: J. G. Ferguson Publishing Co., 1969, p. 782.) Again, the best teachers of the principle of work are the parents themselves. For me, work became a joy when I first worked alongside my father, grandfather, uncles, and brothers. I am sure that I was often more of an aggravation than a help, but the memories are sweet and the lessons learned are valuable. Children need to learn responsibility and independence. Are the parents personally taking the time to show and demonstrate and explain so that children can, as Lehi taught, \u201cact for themselves and not \u2026 be acted upon\u201d?

That agency also permits children to pursue the alternate choice of selfishness, wastefulness, self-indulgence, and self-destruction. Children often express this agency when very young.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p23\" class=\"\">Let parents who have been conscientious, loving, and concerned and who have lived the principles of righteousness as best they could be comforted in knowing that they are good parents despite the actions of some of their children. The children themselves have a responsibility to listen, obey, and, having been taught, to learn. Parents cannot always answer for all their children\u2019s misconduct because they cannot ensure the children\u2019s good behavior. Some few children could tax even Solomon\u2019s wisdom and Job\u2019s patience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p24\" class=\"\">There is often a special challenge for those parents who are affluent or overly indulgent. In a sense, some children in those circumstances hold their parents hostage by withholding their support of parental rules unless the parents acquiesce to the children\u2019s demands. Elder Neal A. Maxwell has said, \u201cThose who do too much <span class=\"emphasis\">for<\/span> their children will soon find they can do nothing <span class=\"emphasis\">with<\/span> their children.

In times of difficult decisions they are most likely to follow the teachings of their parents rather than the example of their peers or the sophistries of the media which glamorize alcohol consumption, illicit sex, infidelity, dishonesty, and other vices. They are like Helaman\u2019s two thousand young men who \u201chad been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them\u201d from death. \u201cAnd they rehearsed \u2026 the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9818\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9818)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9818)\">Alma 56:47\u201348<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p27\" class=\"\">What seems to help cement parental teachings and values in place in children\u2019s lives is a firm belief in Deity. When this belief becomes part of their very souls, they have inner strength. So, of all that is important to be taught, what should parents teach? The scriptures tell us that parents are to teach their children \u201cfaith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost,\u201d and \u201cthe doctrine of repentance.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19248\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19248)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19248)\">D&amp;C 68:25<\/a><\/span>.) These truths must be taught in the home. They cannot be taught in the public schools, nor will they be fostered by the government or by society. Of course, Church programs can help, but the most effective teaching takes place in the home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p28\" class=\"\">Parental teaching moments need not be big or dramatic or powerful.
