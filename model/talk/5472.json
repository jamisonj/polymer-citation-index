Hanks introduced us to Jay nearly twenty years ago at general conference. Elder Hanks described a twelve-year-old deacon whose body suffered from muscular atrophy.

Because of his disease, Jay was unable to attend high school but rather had home study. He loved seminary and attended regularly. He was one of the speakers at his seminary graduation, addressing his classmates from his wheelchair. Jay\u2019s positive approach to life and his cheery, radiant disposition were uplifting. Jay loved to attend dances. He made his wheelchair dance. He enjoyed music and often sang the hymns of the Restoration in beautiful, clear, melodic tones.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/courage-to-hearken.p24\" class=\"\">More than anything, Jay loved the Lord. When he turned nineteen, he wanted to <span class=\"emphasis\">hearken<\/span> to the prophet\u2019s request that every young man serve a mission. By this time, Jay spent much of his time on a soft mat on the living room floor of his home. Much of the muscle tissue of his body had wasted away. He desperately wanted to serve a mission. He found a way to serve in spite of his handicap. While lying on his back on the floor, he painstakingly prepared, with the help of some friends, over 150 copies of the Book of Mormon with his picture and testimony. They were sent to friends serving missions around the world for distribution. Jay received a letter from President Kimball expressing gratitude for his service and <span class=\"emphasis\">courage<\/span> in <span class=\"emphasis\">hearkening<\/span> to the call to missionary service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/courage-to-hearken.p25\" class=\"\">Thanks to \u201cangel\u201d parents, Jay attended college. He was pushed by his dad from class to class. At times it was necessary for him to lie on a table at the rear of the classroom. He was an excellent student, receiving distinguished grades in difficult courses. Jay passed away three years ago, but his splendid example of one who <span class=\"emphasis\">courageously hearkened<\/span> lives on.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/courage-to-hearken.p26\" class=\"\">Someone once said that the <span class=\"emphasis\">courageous<\/span> man finds a way, and the ordinary man finds an excuse.
