These restorations and renewals are a gift from the Lord Jesus Christ, the ultimate \u201cman for all seasons.\u201d I wish to speak briefly of some of those divine moments in our lives when the Savior reaches out to redeem and make whole and strengthen us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-god-that-doest-wonders.p6\" class=\"\">The Psalmist has written:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-god-that-doest-wonders.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cI cried unto God with my voice, \u2026 and he gave ear unto me. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-god-that-doest-wonders.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-god-that-doest-wonders.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cThou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42029\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42029)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42029)\">Ps. 77:1, 10, 14<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-god-that-doest-wonders.p10\" class=\"\">Among the signs of the true church, and included in the evidences of God\u2019s work in the world, are the manifestations of his power which we are helpless to explain or to fully understand. In the scriptures these divine acts and special blessings are variously referred to as miracles or signs or wonders or marvels.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-god-that-doest-wonders.p11\" class=\"\">Not surprisingly, these signs and marvels were most evident in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, the very Son of God himself. But startling and wonder-filled as they were, Christ\u2019s many miracles were only reflections of those greater marvels which his Father had performed before him and continues to perform all around us. Indeed, the Savior\u2019s humble performance of such obviously divine acts may be just one very special application of the declarations he made:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-god-that-doest-wonders.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cThe Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29414\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29414)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29414)\">John 5:19<\/a><\/span>) and \u201cI do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29417\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29417)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29417)\">John 8:28<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-god-that-doest-wonders.p13\" class=\"\">For example, the first miracle by Jesus recorded in the New Testament was the turning of water into wine at the marriage at Cana. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"29409\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29409)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29409)\">John 2:1\u201311<\/a><\/span>.) But poor, indeed, was the making of the wine in the pots of stone, compared with its original making in the beauty of the vine and the abundance of the swelling grapes. No one could explain the onetime miracle at the wedding feast, but then neither could they explain the everyday miracle of the splendor of the vineyard itself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-god-that-doest-wonders.p14\" class=\"\">It is most remarkable to witness one who is deaf made to hear again. But surely that great blessing is no more startling than the wondrous combination of bones and skin and nerves that lets our ears receive the beautiful world of sound. Should we not stand in awe of the blessing of hearing and give glory to God for that miracle, even as we do when hearing is restored after it has been lost?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-god-that-doest-wonders.p15\" class=\"\">Is it not the same for the return of one\u2019s sight or the utterance of our speech, or even that greatest miracle of all\u2014the restoration of life? The original creations of the Father constitute a truly wonder-filled world. Are not the <span class=\"emphasis\">greatest<\/span> miracles the fact that we have life and limb and sight and speech in the first place? Yes, there will always be plenty of miracles if we have eyes to see and ears to hear.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-god-that-doest-wonders.p16\" class=\"\">Just one other reminder. Once we start to recognize the many miraculous and blessed manifestations of God and Christ in our lives\u2014the everyday variety as well as restored sight to the blind and restored hearing to the deaf\u2014we may be truly bewildered at the unexplainable principles and processes that bring about such wonders.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-god-that-doest-wonders.p17\" class=\"\">In the contemplation of miracles \u201cwe must of necessity recognize the operation of a power transcending our present human understanding,\u201d wrote Dr. James E. Talmage, who, as both a scientist and an Apostle of the Lord, had uniquely strong qualifications for examining such phenomena. (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Jesus the Christ,<\/span> 3d ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1916, p. 149.) Science and the unaided human mind, he said, have not advanced far enough to analyze and explain these wonders. But, he cautioned, to deny the reality of miracles on the ground that the results and manifestations <span class=\"emphasis\">must<\/span> be fictitious simply because we cannot comprehend the means by which they have happened is arrogant on the face of it. (Ibid.) Indeed, those who have been the beneficiaries of such miracles are the most compelling witnesses of all. It is hard to argue with results.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-god-that-doest-wonders.p18\" class=\"\">Consider this simple but telling account from the Savior\u2019s ministry to make manifest the works of God in men\u2019s lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-god-that-doest-wonders.p19\" class=\"\">One Sabbath day Jesus anointed the eyes of a man blind from birth, and the man\u2019s eyesight was restored.
