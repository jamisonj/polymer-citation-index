Surely there is no more powerful missionary message we can send to this world than the example of a loving and happy Latter-day Saint life. The manner and bearing, the smile and kindness of a faithful member of the Church brings a warmth and an outreach which no missionary tract or videotape can convey. People do not join the Church because of what they know. They join because of what they feel, what they see and want spiritually. Our spirit of testimony and happiness in that regard will come through to others if we let it. As the Lord said to Alma and the sons of Mosiah, \u201cGo forth \u2026 that ye may show forth good examples unto them in me, and I will make an instrument of thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-21905_000_007\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8628\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8628)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8628)\">Alma 17:11<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/witnesses-unto-me.p16\" class=\"\">A young returned missionary sister from Hong Kong told me recently that when she and her companion asked an investigator if she believed in God, the woman replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t until I met a member of your church and observed how she lived.\u201d What exemplary missionary work!

These people are not lifeless objects disguised as a baptismal statistic. They are children of God, our brothers and sisters, and they need what we have. Be genuine. Reach out sincerely. Ask these friends what matters most to <span class=\"emphasis\">them.<\/span> What do <span class=\"emphasis\">they<\/span> cherish, and what do <span class=\"emphasis\">they<\/span> hold dear? And then listen. If the setting is right you might ask what their fears are, what they yearn for, or what they feel is missing in their lives. I promise you that <span class=\"emphasis\">something<\/span> in what they say will <span class=\"emphasis\">always<\/span> highlight a truth of the gospel about which you can bear testimony and about which you can then offer more. Elder Russell Nelson told me once that one of the first rules of medical inquiry is \u201cAsk the patient where it hurts. The patient,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be your best guide to a correct diagnosis and eventual remedy.\u201d If we listen with love, we won\u2019t need to wonder what to say.

For example, this is the easiest way I personally have yet found to offer people a copy of the Book of Mormon without my needing to carry a knapsack full of books as I travel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/witnesses-unto-me.p22\" class=\"\">Now let me increase the tempo of this message just a little. Many more of us can prepare for senior missionary service when that time in our life comes. As the senior couples at the MTC in Provo have said on a poster, \u201cLet\u2019s lengthen our shuffle!\u201d I just returned from a long trip which took me to half a dozen missions. Everywhere I went during those weeks, I found senior couples giving the most remarkable and rewarding leadership imaginable, providing stability, maturity, and experience that no 19-year-old or 21-year-old could possibly be expected to provide. I found all kinds of couples, including a few former mission and temple presidents and their wives, who had come to parts of the world totally unknown to them to quietly, selflessly serve a second or a third or a fourth mission. I was deeply moved by every one of those people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/witnesses-unto-me.p23\" class=\"\">I had lunch recently with Elder and Sister John Hess of Ashton, Idaho. \u201cWe\u2019re just old potato farmers,\u201d John told me, but that is precisely what the nation of Belarus in the Russia Moscow Mission needed. For years the very best potato yields on government plots of ground there had been 50 sacks of potatoes a hectare. Considering it takes 22 sacks of seed to plant a hectare, the return was poor indeed. They needed help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/witnesses-unto-me.p24\" class=\"\">Brother Hess asked for ground just three feet away from the government plots, rolled up his sleeves, and went to work with the same seed, tools, and fertilizer available in Belarus. Come harvest time they began to dig, then called on others to dig, then called on everyone to dig. With the same rainfall and soil, but with an extra measure of Idaho industry, experience, and prayer, the plots planted by the Hesses produced a whopping 550 sacks per hectare\u201411 times better than any prior yield on that land. At first no one would believe the difference. They wondered if secret teams had come in the night or if some wonder drug had been used. But it was none of that. Brother Hess said, \u201cWe needed a miracle, so we asked for one.\u201d Now just little more than a year later, in that community young proselyting missionaries are finding much more success just because an \u201cold potato farmer\u201d from Idaho answered the call of his church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/witnesses-unto-me.p25\" class=\"\">Most missionary couples serve much more routinely than that, employing their leadership experience in wards and branches, but the point is that there are all kinds of needs in this work, and there is a resolute missionary tradition of responding to the call to serve at <span class=\"emphasis\">every<\/span> age and in every circumstance. I learned from a mission president recently that one of his young sister missionaries, nearing the end of her very faithful and successful mission, said through her tears that she must return home immediately. When he inquired as to the problem, she told him money had become so difficult for her family that to continue her support, the family had rented their home and were using the rental proceeds to pay her mission expenses. For living accommodations, they had moved into a storage locker. For water, they used a neighbor\u2019s outdoor tap and hose; and for a bathroom they went to a nearby gasoline station. This family, in which the father had recently passed away, was so proud of their missionary and so independent in spirit that they had managed to keep this recent turn of events from most of their friends and virtually all of their Church leaders.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/witnesses-unto-me.p26\" class=\"\">When this situation was discovered, the family was restored to their home immediately. Long-term solutions to their economic circumstances were put in place, and the complete amount of remaining missionary support for their missionary daughter was secured overnight. With her tears dried and fears allayed, this faithful, hardworking young sister finished her mission triumphantly and was recently married in the temple to a wonderful young man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/witnesses-unto-me.p27\" class=\"\">In our blessed day we do not ask the kind of severe sacrifice this missionary family offered, but our generation has been the beneficiary of earlier generations who <span class=\"emphasis\">did<\/span> sacrifice so very much in serving the missionary cause we declare.
