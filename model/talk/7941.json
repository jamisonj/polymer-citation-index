God understands that we get there not in an instant but by taking one step at a time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/four-titles.p14\" class=\"\">I do not believe in a God who would set up rules and commandments only to wait for us to fail so He could punish us. I believe in a Heavenly Father who is loving and caring and who rejoices in our every effort to stand tall and walk toward Him. Even when we stumble, He urges us not to be discouraged\u2014never to give up or flee our allotted field of service\u2014but to take courage, find our faith, and keep trying.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/four-titles.p15\" class=\"\">Our Father in Heaven mentors His children and often sends unseen heavenly help to those who desire to follow the Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Disciple of Jesus Christ<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/four-titles.p17\" class=\"\">And that leads us to the next title we all have in common: all who strive earnestly to follow the Christ are called His <span class=\"emphasis\">disciples.<\/span> Although we recognize that none of us are perfect, we do not use that fact as an excuse to lower our expectations, to live beneath our privileges, to delay the day of our repentance, or to refuse to grow into better, more perfect, more refined followers of our Master and King.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/four-titles.p18\" class=\"\">Remember that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is built not for men and women who are perfect or unaffected by mortal temptations, but rather it is built for people exactly like you and me.

Sometimes we confuse differences in personality with sin. We can even make the mistake of thinking that because someone is different from us, it must mean they are not pleasing to God. This line of thinking leads some to believe that the Church wants to create every member from a single mold\u2014that each one should look, feel, think, and behave like every other. This would contradict the genius of God, who created every man different from his brother, every son different from his father. Even identical twins are not identical in their personalities and spiritual identities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/four-titles.p21\" class=\"\">It also contradicts the intent and purpose of the Church of Jesus Christ, which acknowledges and protects the moral agency\u2014with all its far-reaching consequences\u2014of each and every one of God\u2019s children. As disciples of Jesus Christ, we are united in our testimony of the restored gospel and our commitment to keep God\u2019s commandments.

Along our metaphorical path from Bethlehem to Golgotha, we will have many opportunities to abandon our journey. At times it will seem that the path requires more than we had wished for.
