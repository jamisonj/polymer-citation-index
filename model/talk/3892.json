I think every one of you young men wishes to be successful in life. The fact that you have made an effort to attend this meeting indicates that you are interested in worthwhile things. I recently read the results of a study of high school students in the United States: \u201cReligion plays a prominent role in the lives of high school students who earn top grades and participate in extracurricular activities, a recent poll reports. The poll \u2026 surveyed 55,000 juniors and seniors from 22,000 public, private, and parochial high schools across the nation. \u2026 The survey shows that 85 percent of high achievers are reared in homes in which both natural parents live and formal religion is practiced. Nearly 45 percent live in rural communities. By an 84 percent margin, high achievers favor traditional marriages and reject the use of cigarettes and illegal drugs. Only 4 percent have used marijuana, and 89 percent have never smoked cigarettes.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Christianity Today,<\/span> 18 Feb. 1983, p. 35.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p5\" class=\"\">You see, you who are members of the Church are not alone. Those who indulge in cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs would try to make you believe that you are \u201csquare\u201d because you do not. But the fact is that there are tens of thousands just like you. Most of the youth of the Church refrain from these substances. And beyond these are the thousands of students who earn top grades and participate in extracurricular activities in their high schools, 85 percent of whom come from good homes where formal religion is practiced, and 89 percent of whom have never smoked cigarettes. It is a fact that you are with the majority of the achievers when you leave these things alone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p6\" class=\"\">To you young men who are here tonight in such large numbers\u2014you deacons, teachers, and priests\u2014I congratulate you most warmly on the goodness of your lives. I congratulate you on your strength, your courage to stand by your convictions. I congratulate you on your ambitions to educate your minds and hands, to serve the Lord as missionaries, to live lives that will be a credit to yourselves, to your families, and to the Church of which you are members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p7\" class=\"\">And while I congratulate you on your strength to refrain from the use of alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs, none of which will do you any good and all of which will do you harm, I warn you of another insidious and growing evil. This is the seductive lure of immorality. I am going to speak plainly. We hear much these days of teenage sexual misbehavior. There is too much of it among our own youth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p8\" class=\"\">Any boy who indulges in illegitimate sexual activity, as we define that in the doctrines and standards of this Church\u2014and I think no one misunderstands what I mean when I say that\u2014does himself irreparable damage and robs her with whom he is involved of that which can never be restored. There is nothing clever about this kind of so-called conquest. It carries with it no laurels, no victories, no enduring satisfaction. It brings only shame, sorrow, and regret. He who so indulges cheats himself and robs her. In robbing her, he affronts her Father in Heaven, for she is a daughter of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p9\" class=\"\">I know that this is strong language, plainly spoken. But I feel the trends of our times call for strong language and plain words. Jehovah did not speak ambiguously when he said, \u201cThou shalt not commit adultery.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22925\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22925)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22925)\">Ex. 20:14<\/a><\/span>.) Nor did the Lord when He said in modern revelation, \u201cThou shalt not steal; neither commit adultery, nor kill, nor do anything like unto it.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17982\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17982)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17982)\">D&amp;C 59:6<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p10\" class=\"\">Before leaving this matter I should like to add that if there be any here who have so sinned, there is repentance and there is forgiveness, provided there is \u201cgodly sorrow.\u201d (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"3102\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3102)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3102)\">2 Cor. 7:10<\/a><\/span>.) All is not lost. Each of you has a bishop, who has been ordained and set apart under the authority of the holy priesthood and who, in the exercise of his office, is entitled to the inspiration of the Lord. He is a man of experience, he is a man of understanding, he is a man who carries in his heart a love for the youth of his ward. He is a servant of God who understands his obligation of confidentiality and who will help you with your problem. Do not be afraid to talk with him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p11\" class=\"\">Now, while I am speaking of youth, I wish to say parenthetically just a word about education. I have great respect and appreciation for teachers. I am pleased to note that there is a public awakening to the need to prioritize our educational resources and programs. We live in a competitive world, and those who are now being trained will need the very best of schooling if they are to be qualified for the society into which they will move within a very short time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p12\" class=\"\">We have in the Church a strong tradition regarding quality education. Over the years we have allocated a substantial part of the Church budget to education, both secular and religious. As a people we have supported public education. Where there is a well-demonstrated need, we should be supportive. Such can become an investment in the lives of our children, our communities, and our nation. However, let it not be supposed that all of the remedies may be found only with increased funding. There is need for a searching analysis of priorities and a careful weighing of costs. Let us be supportive; let us also be prudent concerning the resources of the people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p13\" class=\"\">Now to you older brethren, may I touch upon a subject that may be pertinent to some of you, and to which President Benson has so eloquently referred. It is the responsibility to keep ourselves free from what one writer called \u201cthe world\u2019s slow stain.\u201d I speak of those influences of which I spoke to the boys, the beguiling and seductive lures that pull us in the direction of immorality and nullify our effectiveness as priesthood leaders.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p14\" class=\"\">Declared the Lord in 1831: \u201cGo ye out from among the wicked.

The producers and purveyors of smut are assiduously working a mine that yields them many millions in profit. Some of their products are artfully beguiling. They are designed to titillate and stimulate the baser instincts. Many a man who has partaken of forbidden fruit and then discovered that he has destroyed his marriage, lost his self-respect, and broken his companion\u2019s heart, has come to realize that the booby-trapped jungle trail he has followed began with the reading or viewing of pornographic material. Some who would not think of taking a sip of liquor or of smoking a cigarette, have rationalized indulgence in pornography. Such have warped values totally unbecoming one who has been ordained to the priesthood of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p16\" class=\"\">Portrayals of sexual perversion, violence, and bestiality become increasingly available for those who succumb to their lures. As this happens, religious activities are likely to become less attractive because the two do not mix any more than oil and water mix.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p17\" class=\"\">A thought-provoking study was recently published in <span class=\"emphasis\">Public Opinion<\/span> magazine. It has been commented upon by many writers. John Dart, religion editor for the <span class=\"emphasis\">Los Angeles Times,<\/span> wrote a column last February in which he said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cA survey of influential television writers and executives in Hollywood has shown that they are far less religious than the general public and \u2018diverge sharply from traditional values\u2019 on such issues as abortion, homosexual rights and extramarital sex. \u2026 While nearly all of the 104 Hollywood professionals interviewed had a religious background, 45 percent now say they have no religion, and of the other 55 percent only 7 percent say they attend a religious service as much as once a month.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p19\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018This group has had a major role in shaping the shows whose themes and stars have become staples in our popular culture.\u2019 \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cEighty percent of the respondents said they did not regard homosexual relations as wrong, and 51 percent did not deem adultery as wrong. Of the 49 percent who called extramarital affairs wrong, only 17 percent felt that way strongly, the study said. Nearly all\u201497 percent\u2014favored the right of a woman to choose an abortion, 91 percent holding that view strongly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cBy contrast, other surveys have indicated that 85 percent of Americans consider adultery wrong, 71 percent regard homosexual activity wrong and nearly three-fourths of the public wants abortion limited to certain hard cases or banned altogether.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Los Angeles Times,<\/span> 19 Feb. 1983, part 2, page 5.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p22\" class=\"\">These are the people who, through the medium of entertainment, are educating us in the direction of their own standards, which in many cases are diametrically opposed to the standards of the gospel.

They have lost sight of the spark that was kindled in Palmyra which is now lighting fires of faith across the earth, in many lands and in many languages. Wearing the spectacles of humanism, they fail to realize that spiritual promptings, with recognition of the influence of the Holy Ghost, had as much to do with the actions of our forebears as did the processes of the mind. They have failed to realize that religion is as much concerned with the heart as it is with the intellect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p33\" class=\"\">We have those critics who appear to wish to cull out of a vast panorama of information those items which demean and belittle some of the men and women of the past who worked so hard in laying the foundation of this great cause. They find readers of their works who seem to delight in picking up these tidbits, and in chewing them over and relishing them. In so doing they are savoring a pickle, rather than eating a delicious and satisfying dinner of several courses.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p34\" class=\"\">We recognize that our forebears were human. They doubtless made mistakes. \u2026 But the mistakes were minor, when compared with the marvelous work which they accomplished. To highlight the mistakes and gloss over the greater good is to draw a caricature. Caricatures are amusing, but they are often ugly and dishonest. A man may have a blemish on his cheek and still have a face of beauty and strength, but if the blemish is emphasized unduly in relation to his other features, the portrait is lacking in integrity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-not-deceived.p35\" class=\"\">There was only one perfect man who ever walked the earth.
