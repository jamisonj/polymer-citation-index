They stand at the waters of baptism but do not enter. They wait at the threshold of testimony but cannot bring themselves to acknowledge the truth. Instead of taking small steps of faith on the path of discipleship, they want some dramatic event to compel them to believe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/waiting-on-the-road-to-damascus.p11\" class=\"\">They spend their days waiting on the road to Damascus.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Belief Comes One Step at a Time<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/waiting-on-the-road-to-damascus.p13\" class=\"\">One dear sister had been a faithful member of the Church all her life. But she carried a personal sorrow. Years before, her daughter had died after a short illness, and the wounds from this tragedy still haunted her. She agonized over the profound questions that accompany an event such as this. She frankly admitted that her testimony wasn\u2019t what it used to be. She felt that unless the heavens parted for her, she would never be able to believe again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/waiting-on-the-road-to-damascus.p14\" class=\"\">So she found herself waiting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/waiting-on-the-road-to-damascus.p15\" class=\"\">There are many others who, for different reasons, find themselves waiting on the road to Damascus. They delay becoming fully engaged as disciples. They hope to receive the priesthood but hesitate to live worthy of that privilege. They desire to enter the temple but delay the final act of faith to qualify. They remain waiting for the Christ to be given to them like a magnificent Carl Bloch painting\u2014to remove once and for all their doubts and fears.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/waiting-on-the-road-to-damascus.p16\" class=\"\">The truth is, those who diligently seek to learn of Christ eventually will come to know Him. They will personally receive a divine portrait of the Master, although it most often comes in the form of a puzzle\u2014one piece at a time. Each individual piece may not be easily recognizable by itself; it may not be clear how it relates to the whole. Each piece helps us to see the big picture a little more clearly. Eventually, after enough pieces have been put together, we recognize the grand beauty of it all. Then, looking back on our experience, we see that the Savior had indeed come to be with us\u2014not all at once but quietly, gently, almost unnoticed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/waiting-on-the-road-to-damascus.p17\" class=\"\">This can be our experience if we move forward with faith and do not wait too long on the road to Damascus.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Hearken and Heed<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/waiting-on-the-road-to-damascus.p19\" class=\"\">I testify to you that our Father in Heaven loves His children. He loves us. He loves you. When necessary the Lord will even carry you over obstacles as you seek His peace with a broken heart and a contrite spirit. Often He speaks to us in ways that we can hear only with our heart. To better hear His voice, it would be wise to turn down the volume control of the worldly noise in our lives. If we ignore or block out the promptings of the Spirit for whatever reason, they become less noticeable until we cannot hear them at all. Let us learn to hearken to the promptings of the Spirit and then be eager to heed them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/waiting-on-the-road-to-damascus.p20\" class=\"\">Our beloved prophet, Thomas\u00a0S.

Christal\u2019s family had been praying that President Monson would come. But their home was far away, and the schedule was so tight that there wasn\u2019t time. So instead, President Monson asked that those who offered prayers during the stake conference include Christal in their prayers. Surely the Lord and the family would understand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/waiting-on-the-road-to-damascus.p22\" class=\"\">During the Saturday session of the conference, as President Monson stood to speak, the Spirit whispered, \u201cSuffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-09605_000_029\">3<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122094\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122094)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122094)\">Mark 10:14<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/waiting-on-the-road-to-damascus.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cHis notes became a blur.
