That includes the counsel and the teaching that we should give today.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is rather interesting how the theme of this session follows in line with many of the thoughts\nthat I have to give.  There will be some repetition of scriptures.  They are good and they bear repetition.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>In the image of God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the most valuable passages of scripture is found in the very first chapter of the Old\nTestament: \"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness . . . So God\ncreated man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created\nhe them\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23742\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23742)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23742)\">Gen. 1:26-27<\/a><\/span>). This scripture is well-known by many, but not comprehended by many, when you take the world as a whole.\n<\/p><p>\nTo know that we were created in the image and likeness of God is important knowledge and a\ngreat blessing, and it is a challenge to know and to do the will of the Creator.  I find that\nmany of the Lord's children never learn the important truth that they are created in the image\nand likeness of God.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen God created man, he created a holy temple, his masterpiece.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The temple of God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe apostle Paul said, \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God\ndwelleth in you?  If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple\nof God is holy, which temple ye are\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"461\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 461)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(461)\">1 Cor. 3:16-17<\/a><\/span>). The holy body is sacred.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus said of man, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is\nperfect\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35690\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35690)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35690)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is also a challenge to master one's self, to choose right over wrong, to choose first the\nkingdom of God and his righteousness over evil (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35699\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35699)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35699)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>).  When we choose right over wrong, we have\nmade the perfect choice.  Choosing God's righteousness is a commandment that is possible to\nlive.  But sometimes we knowingly choose wrong over right.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"This is life eternal\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJesus said relative to the purpose of this life: \". . . this is life eternal, that they might know\nthee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28369\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28369)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28369)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>). This is a great\ngoal given by the Master himself: to know the Creator and to know God.\n<\/p><p>\nKnowing this passage of divine truth does not eliminate the dedication and effort required to\nobtain the knowledge to know the Father and the Son.  The Savior was sent to this earth to\nteach his plan and to set an example for all others to follow, as has been mentioned.  He said,\n\". . . I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28349\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28349)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28349)\">John 14:6<\/a><\/span>).\nThere is no other way.  Only through our mediator Jesus Christ and his gospel plan can\nanyone know God and return to the kingdom of heaven.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Beware false doctrine<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe have been warned to avoid false doctrines and man-made philosophy. The apostle Paul\nsaid, \"Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of\nmen, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10511\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10511)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10511)\">Col. 2:8<\/a><\/span>). Our lives should be\npatterned after the Messiah's.\n<\/p><p>\nBecause we are in the image and likeness of God, we can sometimes become self-sufficient\nand foolishly follow our own ways or the ways of men and the ways of this world.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord said, and I quote from the great prophet Isaiah, \"For my thoughts\nare not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than tour ways, and my\nthoughts than your thoughts\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25342\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25342)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25342)\">Isa. 55:8-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod did not receive his ways and his thoughts, his gospel plan of salvation and eternal life\nfrom man.  The gospel plan was created before the foundations of this world were laid. But\nman may by obedience receive from God his thoughts and his ways and his plan of life.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Seek ye first the Kingdom of God\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJesus gave another key to perfection when he said, \". . . seek ye first the kingdom of God,\nand his righteousness\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35700\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35700)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35700)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is another type of righteousness on this earth, and the Lord spoke of it when he spoke\nto the Pharisees, \". . . except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes\nand Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35682\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35682)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35682)\">Matt. 5:20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe have been counseled by Jesus Christ and his apostles not to accept false doctrines of men\nand false ways of men that have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5171\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5171)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5171)\">2 Tim. 3:5<\/a><\/span>).  False\ndoctrines create darkness in the human mind and in this life, but the Lord's doctrines and\nways create light and eternal hope and eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nThe apostle John said, \". . . God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.\n<\/p><p>\n\"If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the\ntruth: \n<\/p><p>\n\"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and\nthe blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28317\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28317)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28317)\">1 Jn. 1:5-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Walk in light and truth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThere is no greater blessing that can come to man than to walk in the way and in the light\nand truth of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nIn contrast, when anyone creates his own light for this life, he stumbles and finds voids of\ndespair and darkness and depression.\n<\/p><p>\nThe following statement by Jesus has great purpose and meaning: \"I am the light of the\nworld: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28332\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28332)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28332)\">John 8:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis is a promise from the Lord himself that if we follow him, we shall not walk in darkness\nbut shall have the light of life.  This light is more profound and of greater power on the\nhuman soul than the brilliant rays of the noonday sun.  One can feel this light in the mind and\nin the divine nature, the very essence of life.  One can also see this light in the character and\ncountenance of all those who walk and act and serve in the light of the Savior.\n<\/p><p>\nAll that have the light and truth of Jesus Christ have been asked to \"let your light so shine\nbefore men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35680\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35680)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35680)\">Matt. 5:16<\/a><\/span>).\nThe light should be turned on with full glory, with full radiance, with happiness,\nand with a countenance of glory.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has promised us great blessings if we will be obedient to his laws and\ncommandments and radiate and teach to others the light of eternal life.  In the Lord's plan,\nthe gospel plan of salvation must be taught by his mortal children.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Obedience is evidence of love<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTo know the Lord is to love the Lord.  Jesus said, \"He that hath my commandments, and\nkeepeth them, he it is that loveth me:  and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and\nI will love him, and will manifest myself to him\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28355\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28355)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28355)\">John 14:21<\/a><\/span>). A great promise by the Lord\nhimself.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no\npromise\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14984\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14984)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14984)\">D&amp;C 82:10<\/a><\/span>). When we follow the counsel and doctrines of men, we are only\nentitled to the rewards and blessings of men.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has promised that if we will humble ourselves in his sight, he will\nlift us up. \". . . If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall\nknow the truth, and the truth shall make you free\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28334\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28334)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28334)\">John 8:31-32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe light and truth that come from obedience to the will of God bring eternal happiness and\neternal glory.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay said, \"Happiness is the end and design of life.  Happiness is a state of the\nspirit and an attitude of the mind . . . Man's success or failure, happiness or misery, depends\nupon what he seeks and what he chooses.\" (<i>Secrets of a Happy Life<\/i>, p. 171.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The abundant life<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe full and abundant life is built around true happiness.  True happiness comes from the\nlight of divine righteousness built into the character of those who follow Jesus Christ.  Joy\nand happiness come from God, and unhappiness comes from Satan. Satan and his legions are\nat work on this earth.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Causes of unhappiness<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe world today is full of unhappiness.  The apostle Paul gives a few of the causes of\nunhappiness and misery, and each is inspired by Satan.  We must avoid the evils and pitfalls\nof the flesh.  Paul mentioned several of the great evils of the flesh.  \"Now the works of the\nflesh are manifest, which are these;  Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,\n<\/p><p>\n\"Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,\n<\/p><p>\n\"Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings . . . they which do such things shall not inherit\nthe kingdom of God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23277\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23277)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23277)\">Gal. 5:19-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is no entrance into the kingdom of God for those who are accountable, unless they use\nthe principles of repentance.  Repentance is God's law to purify the human soul to greater\nself-control and to perfection.  Growth in God's righteousness comes from the principle of\nrepentance and must be used for eternal progression.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Repentance&mdash;escape from evil<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJesus started his ministry saying, \"Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35674\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35674)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35674)\">Matt. 3:2<\/a><\/span>).\nEvery living soul needs to master the use of the principle of repentance.\n<\/p><p>\nWe live in the dispensation of the fullness of times; we have been counseled and warned by\nall the prophets, apostles, and the Savior himself of the evils and the conspiring of men in the\nlast days (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15003\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15003)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15003)\">D&amp;C 89:4<\/a><\/span>) and that even Satan himself will be transformed to appear as an angel of light\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3062\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3062)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3062)\">2 Cor. 11:14<\/a><\/span>) to\ndeceive those who fail to follow Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nHere is a great warning by the apostle Paul: \"This know also, that in the last days perilous\ntimes shall come.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,\ndisobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,\n<\/p><p>\n\"Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those\nthat are good,\n<\/p><p>\n\"Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; \n<\/p><p>\n\"Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof; from such turn away.\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5170\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5170)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5170)\">2 Tim. 3:1-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Fulfillment of prophecy sign of the times<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe see today these prophecies and many others being fulfilled.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have been counseled and we must be careful in this life not to love pleasure and the\ncreations of this world more than God.  Because of the greed and interests in this great mortal\nlife and world, we have been given the greatest and most important of all laws and\ncommandments.  The first great commandment (and it has been mentioned here many times)\nwas given by the Savior himself. \". . . thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with\nall thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33202\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33202)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33202)\">Mark 12:30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt requires desire, effort, and genuine love and practice to live this first commandment.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen one keeps and lives this commandment, he finds little love left for Satan and for the\nuninspired philosophies of men.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen this commandment is built into one's life and character, he feels and finds eternal\npurpose and a desire to return after death and the resurrection to the kingdom of heaven and\nto be with God the Eternal Father and with our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren and sisters, may love for our Heavenly Father and our Savior be strengthened in our\nown hearts and in the minds and hearts of those whom we serve, and our neighbors, I pray in\nthe name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
