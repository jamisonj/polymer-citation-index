After crossing the Mississippi River I crawled to the side of a house and lay down upon a side of sole leather, while suffering from the chills and fever. While resting there the Prophet Joseph came along and saw me. He gave me some parting advice in answer to some remarks made, and then told me to get up and go on, and all would be well with me. That is the way I parted with him upon that occasion. From that day to this I have noticed the steady growth and increase of this people.

Those were the days of our poverty; and we never knew what it was to be comfortably well off until we came to these valleys of the mountains. We had a great many trials in those days or what we called trials. I want to get this principle into your minds, that God Almighty is guiding the course of this Church and Kingdom, and not we; and He has organized it for this day and generation and it never will be rooted out of the earth again. The Prophet Joseph knew what he was doing; in fact, he knew much more than he dared to tell on account of the prejudice, traditions, and unbelief of the people. I used to have peculiar feelings about his death and the way in which his life was taken. I felt that if, with the consent and good feelings of the brethren that waited on him after he crossed the river to leave Nauvoo, Joseph could have had his desire, he would have pioneered the way to the Rocky Mountains. But since then I have been fully reconciled to the fact that it was according to the program, that it was required of him, as the head of this dispensation, that he should seal his testimony with his blood,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"92012\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 92012)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(92012)\">D&amp;C 135:3<\/a><\/span> and go hence to the spirit world, holding the keys of this dispensation, to open up the mission that is now being performed by way of preaching the Gospel to the &#x201C;spirits in prison.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"78029\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 78029)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(78029)\">1 Pet. 3:19<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"87117\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 87117)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(87117)\">D&amp;C 76:73<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"92141\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 92141)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(92141)\">D&amp;C 138:28<\/a><\/span> But those who shed his blood, and <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"54b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD24\/JoD24_0054.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;54b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8706\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> the people and nation who sanctioned it in their hearts, have that to meet, and they can no more escape the penalty thereof than they can escape the death of the body. My views and feelings in regard to the Twelve and leading men of this Church have been this, that when they leave this stage of action they will be permitted to lie down in peace surrounded by their families and friends; and also, that God will never require them to stain their hands with the blood of their fellow men, in order to protect themselves from violence; but, that the Lord will fight our battles,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"89989\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 89989)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(89989)\">D&amp;C 105:14<\/a><\/span> and frustrate the measures that would lead to such an issue. And the wisdom of this is manifested in the fact that part of our duty is to build Temples, and officiate in the same; and this we could not do so acceptably to God if our hands were stained with the blood of our fellow men, even in our own defense. Hence I believe that God will cause the wicked to slay the wicked;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"86475\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 86475)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(86475)\">D&amp;C 63:33<\/a><\/span> and that He will cut off our enemies by judgment from time to time, as it shall be deemed prudent by Him.

Joseph and the Twelve went before God in prayer, Joseph kneeling before the Lord, offered up prayer, and asked God to deliver him from the power of that man. Among other things he told the Lord that he was innocent before Him, and that his heart was heavy under the persecutions he endured. In about forty-eight hours from that time word reached Joseph that Reynolds had blown his brains out. Before perpetrating the deed he left a note on his desk stating, that as his services were not appreciated by the people of the State, he took that course to end his days. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v24n142\"> There is another instance that occurs to my mind. A certain man took a stand against Joseph, and endeavored to bring persecution on him. He went to his God and laid the matter before Him, asking to be delivered out of the hands and power of that wicked man. Joseph was a Prophet, a Seer, a Revelator. He was acquainted with God; he knew the voice of the Spirit when it spoke to him. After offering up his prayer, the whispering of the still small voice came to him saying, &#x201C;Wait with patience.&#x201D; The next day that man was taken sick with cholera, and died in a few hours. See how quickly the Lord answered his prayer offered up while a prisoner in Liberty Jail. At that time, Presidents Young, Taylor and several of the Twelve were on their way through Clay County to lay the cornerstones of the Temple, in fulfillment of the revelation given in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 118.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"90708\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 90708)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(90708)\">D&amp;C 118:1-6<\/a><\/span> Joseph had no sooner called upon God than he was liberated; and his prayer answered to the very letter.
