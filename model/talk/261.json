I know that the importance\nof this occasion is far above personalities, but I never get up to address you in general\nconference but what something happens to my voice, and my spirit, and my body.\n<\/p><p>\nRESPONSIBILITY OF ADDRESSING A GENERAL CONFERENCE\n<\/p><p>\nI know the gospel is true. I doubt if I shall know it better, that is, with more certainty, when I\nstand before my Maker and give an account of the deeds done in the flesh. So I am not\nfrightened on that account. But somehow it seems that the enemy of all righteousness\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8849\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8849)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8849)\">Alma 34:23<\/a><\/span>) keeps\nsuggesting to me, \"You can't do it; you can't address this great congregation in conference\nassembled.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI suppose the reason why the responsibility seems so great is that I accept, without any\nreservation whatever, the truth that this is a general conference of the citizens of the literal\nkingdom of God. I know that the Redeemer is here in spirit today, and I know that the men\nthrough whom he speaks to all the rest of his brothers and sisters now on the earth, all of\nGod's children, are right behind me on my right. I know that if the Savior should come to\nearth today, he would come here. I know that you know that, and I know that you have come\nhere to get spiritual food and to be built up in your faith.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd since I am called to speak, I know that I have the responsibility of giving a message\nworthy of this occasion, and so I pray that while I stand here, you will support me with your\nprayers. I want to say something that will be worth your while and that will help to build up\nGod's kingdom in the earth. The thing I have had in mind to say has been referred to in\nalmost every sermon given in this great conference. President George Albert Smith mentioned\nit. He said, speaking of world conditions, that there is no way to improve them\nother than by obedience to the plan the Lord has outlined. Brother Widtsoe\ntalked about the way to peace, and as I understood him, he said there is no way to peace\nexcept through obedience to those principles upon which peace is founded.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF OBEDIENCE\n<\/p><p>\nI want to say a word about the principle of obedience, and I pray that the Lord will bring the\nthoughts to my mind in organized fashion. We who are here have great hopes for peace in\nthis world and exaltation in the presence of God in the world to come\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12262\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12262)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12262)\">D&amp;C 59:23<\/a><\/span>). That is our objective.\nWe hope for something more than the rest of the world hopes for in this respect. We are no\nbetter than the rest of the world, let me say, except to the degree to which we accept the\ncommandments of the Lord and obey them. But we have great hopes that we can gain an\nexaltation in the presence of our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my firm conviction, however, that the only saving hope we have in this matter, is that\nhope which is based upon a faith strong enough to impel obedience to the things which we\nknow are right. I don't have very much respect for a man who testifies that he has faith in the\nprinciple of tithing, unless he lives it. Neither do I think his faith will do him any good unless\nhe does pay his tithing. And I almost have contempt for the men who say they have faith in\nthe leadership of this Church, who do not follow in their living the things which the\nleadership of the Church teach them. I refer, of course, to the men whom we sustain as\nprophets, seers, and revelators.\n<\/p><p>\nThe principle of obedience to the laws of the gospel is fundamental. It lies at the base. The\nProphet Joseph Smith learned it very early in his ministry. He learned it when he went that\nfirst morning, after the visits of Moroni, to the Hill Cumorah. He had gone there under the\ndirection of the angel, who had told him that he should have no thought in mind other than to\nbring to pass the righteousness of God and the accomplishment of his purposes in the earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30251\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30251)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30251)\">JS&mdash;H 1:46<\/a><\/span>).\nJoseph's family was very poor, and as he walked toward the hill, he thought about the\nintrinsic value of the things that the angel had told him were buried there. He wondered if the\nplates, or something else to be found with them, could not be used to relieve the poverty of\nhis parents and their family. When he uncovered the box and saw the gold plates, he reached\nto take them out and received a shock that set him back. He reached again and received a\nmore severe shock. Then the third time, thinking all he needed was physical strength, he\nreached with all his might to take the plates and received still another shock which sapped his\nstrength (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30252\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30252)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30252)\">JS&mdash;H 1:53<\/a><\/span>),\nand he cried out, \"Why can I not obtain this book?\" And unexpectedly to him, the\nangel said, \"Because you have not kept the commandments of the Lord.\" And then Joseph\nreceived a great manifestation that I have not time here to tell you about, but it kept him\nreminded all the days of his life that he had to obey in order to receive the\npromised blessings. The angel told him that he could not get the plates then, and\nthat he would not be able to get them until he was not only willing to obey the laws of God\nbut also was able to do so.\n<\/p><p>\nOBEDIENCE BRINGS BLESSINGS\n<\/p><p>\nThat is a great lesson we all must learn. The Prophet, later, through the inspiration of the\nLord, stated the principle thus:\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon\nwhich all blessings are predicated&mdash;And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by\nobedience to that law upon which it is predicated\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12316\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12316)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12316)\">D&amp;C 130:20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOur obedience, brothers and sisters, must be self-impelled. We should not render obedience\nbecause we are forced to do it, or because the bishop is looking, or because the General\nAuthorities are present. We must render obedience because we love righteousness and have a\ntestimony of the truth in our hearts, and because we want to go back to our Father in heaven\nand help take all his children with us.\n<\/p><p>\nFurthermore, we ought to obey his commandments as they are given. We ought not to twist\nand turn and bend them to our will; we ought to obey them as they come from the mouths of\nthese men who sit here on this stand, because they speak for God. If we do not, our faith is\nvain.\n<\/p><p>\nSAUL AND THE AMALEKITES\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I want to take an example from the Old Testament scripture to illustrate what I have in\nmind and to help drive this principle home. There was a very wicked clan of people, a nation,\nwho lived in the days of Saul, known as the Amalekites\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23518\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23518)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23518)\">Gen. 14:7<\/a><\/span>). They had been wicked for a long\ntime (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22565\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22565)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22565)\">Ex. 17:8,14,16<\/a><\/span>;\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41090\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41090)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41090)\">Num. 14:43,45<\/a><\/span>). Even back in the days of Father Abraham, they had persecuted the people of God, and\nhe had said, through his prophets, on numerous occasions, that when they became ripened in\niniquity, they should be destroyed (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3475\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3475)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3475)\">2 Ne. 28:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat time came in the days of Saul. Through the Prophet Samuel, the Lord told Saul to go\nand destroy the Amalekites, every one of them and all their livestock. Saul went with his\narmy and destroyed all the people except their king, Agag, whom he spared in violation of the\ncommandment of the Lord. He likewise destroyed all the ordinary livestock, but when he\ncame to the choice sheep, and the cattle, and the fatlings, and the lambs, the pressure of the\npeople, who desired to possess them, was so great on Saul that he yielded and took them with\nhim as he returned (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2486\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2486)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2486)\">1 Sam. 15:2-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord told Samuel what had happened, and Samuel went out to meet Saul, who greeted\nhim with the salutation:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . Blessed be thou of the Lord: I have performed the commandment\nof the Lord. And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep\nin mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2487\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2487)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2487)\">1 Sam. 15:13-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen Saul began to justify himself. He argued that his partial performance was a complete\nperformance, and that he had done what the Lord had asked him to do. Samuel called to his\nattention that when he was humble, \"When thou wast little in thine own sight,\" he said, the\nLord took you out of obscurity, and raised you up, and magnified you, and made you king\nover Israel, and now you have chosen to disobey the commandment of the Lord (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2489\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2489)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2489)\">1 Sam. 15:17-19<\/a><\/span>).\nSaul hit on the best excuse he could find when he said that they had\nbrought the cattle and sheep and lambs and failings back to offer as sacrifices unto the Lord\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2488\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2488)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2488)\">1 Sam. 15:15,21<\/a><\/span>).\nHe thus claimed to be relying on the commandment to offer sacrifices\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in\nobeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than\nthe fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and\nidolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from\nbeing king (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2490\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2490)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2490)\">1 Sam. 15:22-23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat brought something home to Saul. He was being told by the prophet who had anointed\nhim king, that he had been rejected because he had not obeyed the Lord. He then showed\nsome regrets. But he did not exhibit that godly sorrow which worketh repentance, but rather\nthe sorrow of the world which worketh death\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3008\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3008)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3008)\">2 Cor. 7:10<\/a><\/span>).\nHe asked Samuel to pray with him that he\nmight again prevail with the Lord. Samuel said he could not do that, but at Saul's persistent\nurging he did so without success, for the Lord did not again accept Saul. You know the\nsequel. Saul lost his kingdom, and David was chosen to take his place.\n<\/p><p>\nFULL OBEDIENCE REQUIRED\n<\/p><p>\nNow, there are a number of things in this incident which can be applied in our lives today.\nFirst, Saul received his directions through the prophet living in his day. We come to\nconference to receive directions from the living prophets in our day. Second, Saul used his\nown judgment as to whether he would perform the commandment given to him, and decided\nthat he would not do it exactly as he was commanded. And third, when he was called to\naccount, he prevaricated about it. He said, \"I have done it.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThere is another very interesting thing about this incident. When Samuel confronted Saul with\nwhat he had done, Saul said, \"Because I feared the people, . . . [I] obeyed their voice\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2491\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2491)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2491)\">1 Sam. 15:24<\/a><\/span>). That\nreminded me of the statement of the Lord in the third section of the D&amp;C, where he told the\nProphet Joseph that he should not have yielded to the persuasions of men\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12220\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12220)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12220)\">D&amp;C 3:6<\/a><\/span>). This revelation was\ngiven, you will remember, after Martin Harris had lost the one hundred and sixteen\nmanuscript pages of the Book of Mormon translation. With Saul, it was the\nfear of the people, and with the Prophet it was the persuasions of men. The Prophet learned\nnever to yield again.\n<\/p><p>\nThat is where our temptations come from, my brothers and sisters. The people around us do\nnot believe what the prophets say, and we yield to their arguments. I know, of course, that\nthere is great faith in Israel, and I suppose you do not need this talk, but there are many\npeople who do need it.\n<\/p><p>\nThe other day I was at a conference not far from here, and a man stood up to talk, a humble\nmiddle-aged man who had a house full of children to rear with only a limited amount of\nmeans with which to do it. He said, \"I want to tell you about a letter I received from my\nmother.\" And this is about what she had written in that letter: \"My son, for many years I have\nbeen looking forward to the time when I would reach my present age, in order that I might\nreceive an old age pension so that I would not need to call upon you for support out of your\nlimited income. And now, just as I reach it, the Church says, don't take it. I don't know that I\nunderstand all the reasons why the Church says don't take it, but I do know that the Church\nhas always been right. Therefore, please continue to remit each month.\" And the man said, \"I\nam glad to remit.\"\n<\/p><p>\nADAM'S IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE\n<\/p><p>\nI liked that. I like that spirit and that action. It reminded me of the obedience evidenced by\nour great progenitor Adam, the first man. He was commanded by the Lord, you remember,\nafter he and Eve had left the Garden, that they were to build an altar and offer sacrifice, and\nhe did it. He built an altar and offered sacrifices, and after many days an angel of the Lord\nstood by Adam and said,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . Why dost thou offer sacrifice unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save\nthe Lord commanded me (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38931\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38931)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38931)\">Moses 5:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a lesson! Here was a man, a great man. In our understanding, he stands next to the\nRedeemer of the world. He built an altar and killed the offering and offered it on the altar\nwithout knowing why he did it. How men have changed! Had Adam been a modern, he\nwould not have offered that sacrifice until someone had presented to him a human argument\nwhich to his mind justified sacrificing the animal rather than putting it in his cold-storage\nlocker.\n<\/p><p>\nBut, thank goodness, Adam was not a modern. He had faith, a faith which impelled him to\nobey the commandment of the Lord, and after he had obeyed he learned why the\ncommandment was given. The angel told him that the sacrifice was in the similitude of the\nsacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, and he taught him the principles of the gospel,\nwhich Adam accepted and obeyed, thereby receiving all the blessings thereof which he never\ncould have received without that obedience\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38929\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38929)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38929)\">Moses 5:4-12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs Adam had to obey, so must we. God help us to listen to his living prophets and get their\nmessages and obey them as they are given, that we may gain the great rewards which the\nLord holds out to us, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
