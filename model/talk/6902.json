After several days of negotiations we reached an agreement and signed the closing documents. That evening one of the sellers invited us to a dinner to celebrate the closing. When I arrived, he offered me an alcoholic drink, which I declined. He then said, \u201cAre you a Saint?\u201d I didn\u2019t fully understand what he meant, and he repeated, \u201cAre you a Latter-day Saint?\u201d I responded, \u201cYes, I am,\u201d and he said he had been observing my personal habits during our negotiations and had concluded that I was either LDS or had a stomach problem. We both chuckled. He then informed me that he had only known one member of the Church on a personal basis, David B. Haight. They were both executives in Chicago with a large retail chain following World War II. He told me of the significant influence Elder Haight had been in his life and that he held him in the highest regard.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/are-you-a-saint.p5\" class=\"\">As I flew back home to San Francisco, I thought about what had occurred, especially in two respects: I was surprised at how it felt to be asked if I was a Saint, and I was impressed with the positive influence one outstanding example\u2014Elder Haight\u2014had on this good man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/are-you-a-saint.p6\" class=\"\">What does it mean to be a Saint?

When they were making their way across the plains under very adverse circumstances, William Clayton penned the great hymn \u201cCome, Come, Ye Saints.\u201d It was a hymn that stirred their souls and helped them remember their sacred mission.
