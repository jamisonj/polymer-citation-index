Vandenberg<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Presiding Bishop of the Church<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">John H. Vandenberg, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1965, pp. 48-51<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nA historian informs us that about 100 years B.C. a new milling apparatus had been invented by\na master craftsman in the hills of the Fertile Crescent. With this new contrivance the grain\nwas ground into flour by a swift moving stream turning a paddle wheel rather than by the\nlaborious method of rotating the millstone by hand. Thus the power of a stream of water was\nput to work. (Life Science Library [Machines], p. 12.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe poet Longfellow referred to a far greater power and a more significant milling process\nwhen he wrote: \"Though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceedingly small;\nthough with patience He stands waiting, with exactness grinds He all\" (Longfellow,\n<i>Poetic Aphorisms: Retribution<\/i>). By this we are reminded that humankind is the grain being milled,\nand the individual is a kernel of grain working between the opposing forces of life. It is\nthrough the mill or experiences of life that man is to learn and develop. Here he attains a\ncertain degree of knowledge or skill, but it is through discipline and self-control that he is\nrefined.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Power of Words and Acts<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nToday I want to talk particularly about the harnessing of power in connection with this mill of\nlife&mdash;the power of words and acts. It was the words of the Prophet Jonah that saved the great\ncity Nineveh from destruction. The power of words has changed the course of history many\ntimes for good and many times for bad. In words and acts men influence one another. It is\nsaid that we are individually responsible for our own actions and will receive the just reward\nfor our deeds. \"Every man will be judged according to his works\" (see \n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40341\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40341)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40341)\">Mosiah 3:24<\/a><\/span>) is the\nscriptural warning. Yet no man stands alone; one man's words and acts may influence another\nman's deeds.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Opposition in all things\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Lehi explains that there is an opposition in all things&mdash;light and darkness, good\nand evil, joy and misery (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"3733\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3733)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3733)\">2 Ne. 2:11<\/a><\/span>).\nEmerson said that a dualism bisects nature. It\ncan be seen in night and day, or in a magnet with north and south poles. One attracts; the\nother repels. Our society, therefore, may be considered dualistic also. At the top is the light of\nour age. At the bottom is a creeping, crawling, cancerous disease of crime, filth, and darkness.\nWith unlimited goods, seemingly our every want and need provided for, our continuing\nmastery over disease, our ever enlarging system of education and higher learning&mdash;with all\nthis and more we seem to be so independent that we are confident that all is right. Yet lurking\nbeside us, apparent to the one who will intelligently observe, is a monster as described by\nAlexander Pope: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,<br \/>\n     As to be hated needs but to be seen;<br \/>\n     Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,<br \/>\n     We first endure, then pity, then embrace.\"\n<\/p><p>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; (<i>Essay on Man<\/i>.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe ratio to which people are subjected to evil influences versus good influences is high in\nfavor of the evil. Satan will use his agents in every way that he can cunningly to lure\nindividuals into his web. His agents are represented by people. And people influence the lives\nof other people.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Risks of Disaster<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt is estimated that by 1967 over fifty percent of the population of the United States will be\nthose twenty-five years of age and younger. The worrisome thing is the exposure of this\nyoung group to the evil forces of illicit love, drunkenness, crime, violence, unwholesome\nmovies, dishonesty, risqu\u00e9 literature, and all means of vulgarity. One is faced with the\nquestion in the Old Testament: \"Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be\nburned?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41467\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41467)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41467)\">Prov. 6:27<\/a><\/span>).\nThere are many who cast all common sense to the wind and try to tell\nus that we can. There are those who may think they can sit apathetically by and not be a part\nof the \"era of advancement or the cellar of crime.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Offences of Vice<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to point to the Savior's warning: \". . . whoso shall offend one of these little ones\n<i>which believe in me<\/i>, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and\nthat he were drowned in the depth of the sea\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35487\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35487)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35487)\">Matt. 18:6<\/a><\/span>, italics added).\nThis doctrine states it is better to lose your life than wilfully to offend.\n<\/p><p>\nThe word \"offend\" as used by the Master means \"to cause to sin or fall.\" This definition is\nnow almost lost in our modern-day language, but the word was used with this meaning in the\ndays of Christ and even up until a century or two ago.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus also said: \"Woe unto the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses\ncome; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35488\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35488)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35488)\">Matt. 18:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWillful wrong teaching, wrong example, wrong utterance, wrong action by those of influence\nare offenses to any youth, and the retribution follows as night the day that \"no man ever did a\ndesigned injury to another, but at the same time he did a greater to himself\" (Henry Home,\n\"Injury,\" <i>The New Dictionary of Thoughts<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Truth of God vs. Philosophy of Men<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMany college students, as well as high school students, become confused when some of their\nprofessors, in their important positions of influence, try to indoctrinate them with philosophies\nof men with atheistic ideas. Such teachers may be described as wells without water. They are\nvery forceful in their distorted view and in their criticisms of those who possess faith in God.\nI would remind young people to remember that God is the author of all truth and to disregard\nany teaching that conflicts with the word of God.\n<\/p><p>\nUniversities and other centers of learning are set up by inspiration for the betterment of\nmankind. But the \"dualism\" spoken of by Emerson exists at all levels. When you have\nquestions as to religious matters, go to your parents or the bishop who have a knowledge of\nand authority from God. Ask them to help you consider such philosophies as you may hear in\nthe light of the true principles and help you to keep and develop your faith in God. Be alert\nand do not let men confuse you into thinking that they know more about man's existence than\nGod's authorized representatives.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord speaks through his prophets, and his commandments so revealed are taught by his\nauthorized agents. History will hear out that when evil principles are taught and faith in God\nis destroyed, the people go down to oblivion; but when faith in God is established in the\nhearts of men, the people flourish.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Means of Knowing Good from Evil<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMan himself must learn to reason and to discern good from evil. Recently, I heard a man in\nthe process of reasoning as he contemplated the movie advertising \"for adults only.\" He posed\nseveral questions to himself, some of which were: Why adults only? Should adults see things\nwhich are prohibited to children? If it is good for adults, why not for the children? If bad for\nthe children, why not bad for the adults? If unlawful for children to see, why not for adults?\nHe finally reasoned if it were not good for his children, it was not good for him as a parent.\nSuch advertisements are cunning lures of Satan as he attempts to influence and destroy ethical\nand moral values.\n<\/p><p>\nI read in the news recently of the wisdom a judge used in Iowa as he sentenced two juveniles\non auto theft charges. I was thrilled that this judge took the time to give the following advice.\nHis example may serve as a challenge to all civil judges or judges in Israel who are called to\ngive advice.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Penalties of a Prison Record<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"Now you have been convicted of a felony,\" he said. \"A felony is a crime for which you\nmight be sent to the penitentiary. In this case I do not have to send you to the penitentiary . .\n. I am permitted to give you a parole.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But if you never see the inside of a penitentiary or the jail you will not have escaped from\nthe penalties of your crime.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . The record of your conviction will be here as long as the courthouse stands . . . Next\nyear, or ten years from now, or when you are old men, if you are ever called to be witnesses\nin any court of law, some lawyer will point his finger at you and ask this question: 'Have you\never been convicted of a felony?'\n<\/p><p>\n\"And you will hang your head and admit that you have . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"It may be that some day . . . you will apply for a passport . . . No country will allow you to\nbecome a resident . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"Some day you may seek a position in the civil service of your state or of your nation. On the\napplication blank you will find this question: 'Have you ever been convicted of a felony?'\nYour truthful answer will bar you from examination; an untruthful answer will be detected\nbecause appointments are made only after investigation . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"Some day you may want to take a position of trust, where a surety bond is required. On the\napplication for the bond will appear this question: 'Have you ever been convicted of a\nfelony?'\n<\/p><p>\n\"And while you are going from one bonding company to another trying to find one willing to\ntake a chance on you, the position will be filled by some applicant who has not been\nconvicted of a felony.\n<\/p><p>\n\"In a few years you will be 21 and others of your age will have the right to vote, but you will\nnot . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"You will be a citizen of your state and country, but you will have no voice in public affairs . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"Your country is calling men to the colors . . . But the Army will never accept you, nor will\nthe Navy. Military men are proud of the service; they will not permit it to be debased by the\nenlistments of convicted felons.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I am granting you a parole. A parole is in no sense a pardon. You will report to the men\nwho have accepted your parole as often as they may ask. Your convenience is not a matter of\nimportance . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"Should the slightest complaint of your conduct reach this court your parole will be revoked\nimmediately, and you will begin serving your sentence. You will not be brought back here for\nquestioning or explanations. You will be picked up and taken to prison without notice to you\nand without delay.\" (<i>Deseret News<\/i>, February 23, 1965, p. A-15.)\n<\/p><p>\nA lesson well taught is a lesson well remembered. I wonder what the two boys might have\ndone had they had the influence of the judge's counsel before the theft, rather than the\ninfluence that promoted the felony.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Exemplify Righteousness<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nParents, church leaders, and all who aspire to positions of influence, teach the youth the\nproper way to live; help them to develop faith in God and a good, strong character; help them\nto follow the right influence, that they may retain faith in God. Guide them as Susanna\nWesley, the wise and devoted mother of John Wesley, counseled her son: \"Would you judge\nof the lawfulness or unlawfulness of a pleasure, take this rule: Whatever impairs in tenderness\nyour conscience, weakens your reason, obscures your sense of God, or takes off the relish of\nspiritual things; whatever increases the authority of your body over your mind&mdash;that thing to\nyou is sin.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Influences Elevate or Deteriorate<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nRemember that the mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly small. In every\nsegment of society, there are those influences which elevate and those which deteriorate the\nhuman soul.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior miraculously fed the four thousand (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35465\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35465)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35465)\">Matt. 15:38<\/a><\/span>).\nThen he crossed the Sea of Galilee and came\ninto the coasts of Magdala. There the materialistic, self-centered, and egotistical Pharisees and\nSadducees came, tempting him to show them a sign from heaven. He observed that they could\ndetermine the weather, but they could not discern the signs of the times. \"An evil and\nadulterous generation seeketh after a sign . . .\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35456\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35456)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35456)\">Matt. 12:39<\/a><\/span>)\nwarned Jesus. Today we have\nsome Pharisees and Sadducees in our society, cloaked in the disguise and the influence of\n\"professionalism,\" urging youth not to believe unless such can be measured in terms of\nmaterialistic values. In this mill of life we should heed the counsel that Jesus gave to his\ndisciples: \"Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35466\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35466)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35466)\">Matt. 16:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
