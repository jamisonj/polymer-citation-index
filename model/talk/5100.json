I actually favor this latter interpretation. Today we often hear such expressions as \u201cweak in the knees\u201d or \u201cknocking knees\u201d to denote fear.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/strengthen-the-feeble-knees.p9\" class=\"\">In <span class=\"citation\" id=\"19475\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19475)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19475)\">D&amp;C 81:5<\/a><\/span>, the verse might be interpreted as the Lord\u2019s urging Frederick G.

Is he likely to experience the fear that an unforeseen expense might upset his family\u2019s delicately balanced, already strained budget? Does he ever fear that he might not be able to adequately provide for his family\u2019s necessities?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/strengthen-the-feeble-knees.p15\" class=\"\">And what of the parents who find themselves rearing an unhappy and nonconforming child?

It is vital that we not face them alone. Always it is helpful and comforting to be able to confide in a loving and trusted friend or relative who empathetically listens to our uncertainties. We often find that our confidant has experienced similar fears, and we may even share in his wise counsel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/strengthen-the-feeble-knees.p19\" class=\"\">Life is never easy, and we cannot escape our own case of feeble knees from time to time.

None of these is going to cause apostasy by itself, but as the conduct continues, our knees may lose the strength we need to face the realities and fears of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/strengthen-the-feeble-knees.p22\" class=\"\">In <span class=\"citation\" id=\"19390\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19390)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19390)\">D&amp;C 11:22<\/a><\/span>, we read: \u201cStudy my word which hath gone forth among the children of men.\u201d Nowhere are we advised to dilute the doctrines of the gospel with personal amendments.

Those who would \u201cadd upon\u201d could well be guided by the anchor question: Do my writings, comments, or observations build faith and strengthen testimonies? Oftentimes we can cause confusion and misdirection in our lives and in the lives of others if we promote the startling and unorthodox. Feeble knees are strengthened by those who lead with purpose rather than with personal interpretations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/strengthen-the-feeble-knees.p24\" class=\"\">Some today are losing the reinforcement that comes from observing the Sabbath.

Sabbath days can be lost an outing at a time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/strengthen-the-feeble-knees.p26\" class=\"\">Controversy and contention are other weakening habits. If Satan can succeed in creating in us the pastime of arguing, quarreling, and contention, it is easier for him to bind us with heavier sins which can destroy our eternal lives.

His answer was simple. \u201cThey must know how to work.
