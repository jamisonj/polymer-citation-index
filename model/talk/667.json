I went to the dictionary to see just what Webster would say, and\nfound that lucre, itself, has a bad connotation, and filthy lucre is worse; and to be \"greedy of\nfilthy lucre\" is, of course, still worse.\n<\/p><p>\nThis instruction was given by John, the Revelator, to the Laodicean Saints: \n<\/p><p>\nI know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would thou wert cold or hot.\n<\/p><p>\nSo then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my\nmouth.\n<\/p><p>\nBecause thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and\nknowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:\n<\/p><p>\nI counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment,\nthat thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint\nthine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.\n<\/p><p>\nAs many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42233\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42233)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42233)\">Rev. 3:15-19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I began to think of many of our people whose minds are upon their wealth; who are\nincreased with goods; who though clothed elegantly are naked and not in white raiment; who\nwith eyes wide open see not; who are \"greedy for filthy lucre.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow, all money is not lucre&mdash;all money is not filthy. There is clean money&mdash;clean money\nwith which to buy food, clothes, shelter, and other necessities and with which to make\ncontributions toward the building of the kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nClean money is that compensation received for a full day's honest work. It is that reasonable\npay for faithful service. It is that fair profit from the sale of goods, commodities, or service. It\nis that income received from transactions where all parties profit.\n<\/p><p>\nFilthy lucre is blood money; that which is obtained through theft and robbery. It is that\nobtained through gambling or the operation of gambling establishments. Filthy lucre is that\nhad through sin or sinful operations and that which comes from the handling of liquor, beer,\nnarcotics and those other many things which are displeasing in the sight of the Lord. Filthy\nlucre is that money which comes from bribery, and from exploitation.\n<\/p><p>\nCompromise money is filthy, graft money is unclean, profits and commissions derived from\nthe sale of worthless stocks are contaminated as is the money derived from other deceptions,\nexcessive charges, oppression to the poor and compensation which is not fully earned. I feel\nstrongly that men who accept wages or salary and do not give commensurate time, energy,\ndevotion, and service are receiving money that is not clean. Certainly those who deal in the\nforbidden are recipients of filthy lucre.\n<\/p><p>\nThou shalt not bring the hire of a whore or the price of a dog, into the house of the Lord thy\nGod for any vow: for even both these are abomination unto the Lord thy God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21215\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21215)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21215)\">Deut. 23:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Micah lashed at this sin. He said: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of\nJudah? are they not Jerusalem?\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be\nburned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the\nhire of an harlot and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.\n<\/p><p>\nFor her wound is incurable...\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37880\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37880)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37880)\">Micah 1:5-7,9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure that money is unclean when it is obtained through oppression, fraud bribery, or\nthrough misrepresentations.

And we\nsometimes justify ourselves in underpaying and even boast about it: \n<\/p><p>\nWoe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light,\nthey practice it, because it is in the power of their hand.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they\noppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37881\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37881)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37881)\">Micah 2:1-2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then there are those of us who require excessive compensation for services and who fail\nto give \"value received\" and who give no loyalty with their insufficient and inefficient\nservice.\n<\/p><p>\nScripture writers admonish the employed to obey masters, to please their employers, to work\nwith singleness of heart, to be honest in time spent and service rendered and to avoid\npurloining.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord knows that we need food, clothes, shelter, and other things. He expects us to earn\nour living. He commands us to give the necessities to our families. He permits, perhaps, that\nwe may have reasonable luxuries, but not with unclean money.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior said,\n<\/p><p>\nNo man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he\nwill hold to the one, and despise the other.

The more we have, the more we want.\n<\/p><p>\nPaul seemed to understand human nature and fully endorsed the statement of the Master:\n\" . . . a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34587\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34587)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34587)\">Matt. 19:24<\/a><\/span>).

Why another hotel, another cafe, another store,\nanother shop? Why another plant, another office, another service, another business? Why\nanother of anything if one has that already which provides the necessities and reasonable\nluxuries? Why continue to expand and increase holdings, especially when those increased\nresponsibilities draw one's interests away from proper family and spiritual commitments, and\nfrom those things to which the Lord would have us give precedence in our lives? Why must\nwe always be expanding to the point where our interests are divided and our attentions and\nthoughts are upon the things of the world? Certainly when one's temporal possessions become\ngreat, it is very difficult for one to give proper attention to the spiritual things.\n<\/p><p>\nBetter is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though\nhe be rich (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41410\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41410)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41410)\">Prov. 28:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then this from Proverbs struck me: \n<\/p><p>\nA faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be\ninnocent (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41411\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41411)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41411)\">Prov. 28:20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I wonder if many of us are not hasting to be rich. Are we making compromises in order\nto accumulate? I wonder if money earned upon the Sabbath, when it is unnecessary Sabbath\nearning, might not also be unclean money. I realize that some people must\nwork on the Sabbath; and when they do, if they are compelled, that is, of course, a different\nsituation. But men and women who will deliberately use the Sabbath day to develop business\npropositions, to increase their holdings, to increase their income, I fear for them. I think the\nLord was speaking to them when he said: \"Woe unto them that call evil good . . . \"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25134\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25134)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25134)\">Isa. 5:20<\/a><\/span>).\nSometimes we salve our consciences by saying that the more we get the more we can\ngive to the worthy causes, but that, of course, is a subterfuge. There are people who work on\nthe Sabbath not through compulsion but because the income is attractive, and others who\nwork voluntarily to get the \"time and a half\" that Sabbath work gives them.\n<\/p><p>\nIn a stake recently I interviewed a man for an important position in the stake reorganization.\nAnd I said to him, \"What is your occupation?\" And he said, \"I operate a service station.\" And\nI asked, \"Do you operate on the Sabbath?\" His answer was, \"No, I do not.\" \"Well, how can\nyou get along? Most service station operators seem to think they must open on the Sabbath.\"\n\"I get along well,\" he said. \"The Lord is good to me.\" \"Do you not have stiff competition?\" I\nasked. \"Yes, indeed,\" he replied. \"Across the street is a man who keeps open all day Sunday.\"\n\"And you never open?\" I asked. \"No, sir,\" he said, \"and I am grateful, and the Lord is kind,\nand I have sufficient for my needs.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI was in another stake, also in a reorganization program and another brother was considered\nfor one of the highest positions; and when we asked him of his occupation, he said he was a\ngrocer by trade. \"Well, most of the stores keep open on the Sabbath. Do you?\" \"We lock our\nstore on Sunday,\" he said. \"But how can you compete with these people who are open seven\ndays a week?\" \"We compete. At least we get along very well,\" was his reply. \"But would not\nthe Sabbath be your biggest day?\" \"Yes,\" he answered, \"we would probably sell twice as\nmuch on the Sabbath as we would on an average day, but we get along without it, and the\nLord has been kind; he has been gracious; he has been good.\" \"What do you sell in this\nstore?\" I asked him. He said, \"Groceries and miscellaneous merchandise.\" \"Your competitors\nsell other things including forbidden things, do they not?\" I asked. \"Yes, but we have felt it\nwas not right,\" he said. \"We lose trade, of course. People leave our store and go to the other\nstore and buy many dollars' worth of groceries where they can get a few cans of beer or some\nwine, but we do not sell it.\" And I could not refrain from saying, \"God bless you, my faithful\nbrother. The Lord will not be unmindful of these seeming sacrifices. Your dollars are clean.\nThey will surely not hinder you in finding your way into the kingdom of God.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior knew that the ox gets in the mire on the Sabbath\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31336\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31336)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31336)\">Luke 14:5<\/a><\/span>), but he knew also that no ox\ndeliberately goes into the mire every week.\n<\/p><p>\nIn my extensive travels I find many faithful people who forego the Sabbath day profits and\nthose which come from the handling of the forbidden things. I have found cattle communities\nwhere the stockmen never carry on their roundup on the Sabbath; fruit stands along the\nroadside which are open night and day, but which close on Sunday even in the short fruit\nseason; drugstores and confectionery businesses which earn their money on the six weekdays;\neating houses and wayside stands, closed on the Lord's day. And there are many other people\nwho might rationalize and justify themselves in Sunday profit taking but who take satisfaction\nand joy in refraining. And every time I see good folk who are willing to forego these profits,\nI rejoice and feel within my heart to bless them for their steadfastness, their courage, and their\nfaith.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many other ways, of course in which money can be tainted. I pray that we will\nkeep our money clean. And I pray the Lord that he will bless his children that they will have\nthe faith to live his commandments, sacrifice though there may seem to be. I\nknow that God will make it up to them. I know that men will never suffer, ultimately, for any\nseeming financial sacrifices that might be made, for he has commanded us to live his laws\nand then has challenged us: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of\nheaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32745\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32745)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32745)\">Mal. 3:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd may God bless all of us that we will live close to his teachings and thereby merit the\nblessings which he has promised to us, I pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
