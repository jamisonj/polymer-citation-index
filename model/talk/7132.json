He said that after a sincere prayer, an angel appeared at Joseph\u2019s bedside.

He had a special calling from the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/a-work-for-me-to-do.p6\" class=\"\">What Joseph did was remarkable. He began life as a simple farm boy, but through him the Book of Mormon was brought forth and translated, the priesthood and its keys were restored to earth, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized, and holy temples began to be built. Through Joseph Smith all the ordinances the children of our Heavenly Father need for their salvation are now upon the earth. <span class=\"emphasis\">This<\/span> was the day of miracles spoken of in Moroni (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44400\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44400)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44400)\">Moro. 7:35\u201337<\/a><\/span>) and the marvelous work and wonder foretold to Nephi centuries ago (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44401\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44401)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44401)\">1 Ne. 14:7<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/a-work-for-me-to-do.p7\" class=\"\">The work Joseph started was carried on by early members of the Church who had faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and His restored gospel.

We have a work to do. We serve in simple ways, our testimonies grow, and we are part of this day of miracles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/a-work-for-me-to-do.p16\" class=\"\">In my own lifetime I have been a witness to the miracle of the restored gospel. When I was a young girl my family moved to S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, where my father had been called to preside over the Brazilian Mission. It was an exciting time for me and a great place to grow up. A favorite game for my brothers and me was to dress up and pretend to be missionaries. We spent hours scribbling our own missionary pamphlets and \u201cpreaching\u201d and \u201ctransferring\u201d all over the yard. For five years the nightly conversations around our dinner table centered on missionary work, and I listened intently to stories of faith told by missionaries. Even at that age I knew I was part of a great work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/a-work-for-me-to-do.p17\" class=\"\">There were only about 3,000 members of the Church in Brazil when we arrived there. I remember being in a very small Primary with a few other children, singing the same five songs every week, as those were the only ones translated into Portuguese. Two of my favorite songs were \u201cA Luz Divina,\u201d or \u201cThe Light Divine\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 305), and something about a bunny in the middle of the woods (see \u201cThe Little Rabbit,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Children\u2019s Friend,<\/span> June 1955, 257).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/a-work-for-me-to-do.p18\" class=\"\">In many ways our experience was similar to the early pioneers. We had no hymnbooks or pictures or lesson manuals sent from the headquarters of the Church. Everything that was needed to teach the gospel in Portuguese was written and printed in our mission home. All of us, even the children, were pressed into service to help assemble mission newsletters and lessons. No one shipped the Church to us. The prophet did not send us stake presidents or bishops. He did not send Relief Society presidents or youth programs. The Church in Brazil was made from the same material that the pioneers started with. The material to build the Church was in the people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/a-work-for-me-to-do.p19\" class=\"\">During our years in Brazil, we saw great growth come to the Church. Thousands became Latter-day Saints. Soon the mission was divided, districts and branches were organized, and new chapels were built. The new members were enthusiastic, and they grew in faith and became more experienced in the manner of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/a-work-for-me-to-do.p20\" class=\"\">A lot of years passed, and then last year I returned to Brazil to attend the rededication of the S\u00e3o Paulo temple. At that time I learned that there were 187 stakes in Brazil. There are now 26 missions, 4 temples, and almost 1 million members. Imagine my surprise when I walked into a stadium filled with over 60,000 members who had gathered to hear President Gordon B. Hinckley and celebrate the temple dedication. To me it was a miracle to see thousands of youth dancing and singing together. As I watched that joyful celebration, I kept saying to myself, \u201cThis is amazing! This is a miracle! How did this miracle happen?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/a-work-for-me-to-do.p21\" class=\"\">I marveled all that night at what I had seen. Then, the next morning at the temple dedication, I had a reunion with my Primary teacher, Sister Gloria Silveira. That was when I knew how the miracle had come about. As a new convert with no prior Church experience, Sister Silveira had come to Primary prepared to share her simple testimony and teach me the Articles of Faith in Portuguese. She and her husband, Humberto, are still faithful. They have served in many Church callings over the years, and they are still serving. When I saw Sister Silveira, I realized that the Church in Brazil had grown because of her and thousands like her. She and Brother Silveira represent people everywhere who have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and His gospel. They have grown in knowledge and skill, and they have served in the Church (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44403\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44403)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44403)\">D&amp;C 88:80<\/a><\/span>).

Of their 43 descendants, 15 have served full-time missions. Their grandchildren are now marrying in the temple, and their great-grandchildren are the fourth generation of Silveiras who are part of the marvelous work that was started by Joseph Smith. Because of them, faith has increased in the earth. They are an example of the miracle the Lord spoke about when He said that His gospel would be proclaimed by the weak and the simple (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44407\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44407)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44407)\">D&amp;C 1:23<\/a><\/span>) and that by small and simple means great things are brought to pass (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44408\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44408)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44408)\">1 Ne. 16:29<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/a-work-for-me-to-do.p22\" class=\"\">The Lord sent an angel to Joseph Smith to tell him that he had a work to do.
