For good or for evil, devices like the Internet and the compact disc have put at our fingertips an incredible inventory of information, insights, and images.

I like this story because it translates easily into different languages and cultures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/focus-and-priorities.p12\" class=\"\">Two men formed a partnership. They built a small shed beside a busy road. They obtained a truck and drove it to a farmer\u2019s field, where they purchased a truckload of melons for a dollar a melon. They drove the loaded truck to their shed by the road, where they sold their melons for a dollar a melon. They drove back to the farmer\u2019s field and bought another truckload of melons for a dollar a melon. Transporting them to the roadside, they again sold them for a dollar a melon. As they drove back toward the farmer\u2019s field to get another load, one partner said to the other, \u201cWe\u2019re not making much money on this business, are we?\u201d \u201cNo, we\u2019re not,\u201d his partner replied. \u201cDo you think we need a bigger truck?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/focus-and-priorities.p13\" class=\"\">We don\u2019t need a bigger truckload of information, either. Like the two partners in my story, our biggest need is a clearer focus on how we should value and use what we already have.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/focus-and-priorities.p14\" class=\"\">Because of modern technology, the contents of huge libraries and other data resources are at the fingertips of many of us. Some choose to spend countless hours in unfocused surfing the Internet, watching trivial television, or scanning other avalanches of information. But to what purpose? Those who engage in such activities are like the two partners in my story, hurrying to and fro, hauling more and more but failing to grasp the essential truth that we cannot make a profit from our efforts until we understand the true value of what is already within our grasp.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/focus-and-priorities.p15\" class=\"\">A poet described this delusion as an \u201cendless cycle\u201d that brings \u201cknowledge of words, and ignorance of the Word,\u201d in which \u201cwisdom\u201d is \u201clost in knowledge\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d is \u201clost in information\u201d (T. S.

Yet which of us would think ourselves a thousand times more educated or more serviceable to our fellowmen than they? The sublime quality of what these two men gave to us\u2014including the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address\u2014was not attributable to their great resources of information, for their libraries were comparatively small by our standards. Theirs was the wise and inspired use of a limited amount of information.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/focus-and-priorities.p17\" class=\"\">Available information wisely used is far more valuable than multiplied information allowed to lie fallow. I had to learn this obvious lesson as a law student.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/focus-and-priorities.p18\" class=\"\">Over 45 years ago, I was introduced to a law library with hundreds of thousands of law books. (Today such a library would include millions of additional pages available by electronic data retrieval.) When I began to prepare an assigned paper, I spent many days searching in hundreds of books for the needed material. I soon learned the obvious truth (already familiar to experienced researchers) that I could never complete my assigned task within the available time unless I focused my research in the beginning and stopped that research soon enough to have time to analyze my findings and compose my conclusions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/focus-and-priorities.p19\" class=\"\">Faced with an excess of information in the marvelous resources we have been given, we must begin with focus or we are likely to become like those in the well-known prophecy about people in the last days\u2014\u201cever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5071\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5071)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5071)\">2 Tim. 3:7<\/a><\/span>).

The abundant information and images accessible on the Internet call for sharp focus and control to avoid accessing the pornography that is an increasing scourge in our society. As the <span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News<\/span> noted in a recent editorial, \u201cImages that used to be hidden in out-of-the-way store counters now are as close as a mouse click\u201d (\u201cStaying ahead of Pornography,\u201d 21\u201322 Feb. 2001, A12). The Internet has made pornography accessible almost without effort and often without leaving the privacy of one\u2019s home or room. The Internet has also facilitated the predatory activities of adults who use its anonymity and accessibility to stalk children for evil purposes. Parents and youth, beware!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/focus-and-priorities.p21\" class=\"\">There are many gospel implications of this easily accessible flood of information. For example, our Church Web site now provides access to all of the general conference addresses and other contents of Church magazines for the past 30 years. Teachers can download bales of information on any subject. When highly focused, a handout can enrich. But a bale of handouts can detract from our attempt to teach gospel principles with clarity and testimony. Stacks of supplementary material can impoverish rather than enrich, because they can blur students\u2019 focus on the assigned principles and draw them away from prayerfully seeking to apply those principles in their own lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/focus-and-priorities.p22\" class=\"\">Nephi taught, \u201cFeast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3347\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3347)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3347)\">2 Ne. 32:3<\/a><\/span>).

Or compare the value to each of us of some other facts or advice from the distant past with what our stake president said at our last stake conference or what our bishop counseled us last Sunday.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/focus-and-priorities.p24\" class=\"\">Overarching all of this is the importance of what the Spirit whispered to us last night or this morning about our own specific needs.

Everything else is lower in priority. Think about that reality as we consider some teachings and some examples on priorities. As someone has said, if we do not choose the kingdom of God first, it will make little difference in the long run what we have chosen instead of it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/focus-and-priorities.p30\" class=\"\">As regards knowledge, the highest priority religious knowledge is what we receive in the temple.

Among the most visible such examples are the men and women who set aside their worldly pursuits and even say good-bye to their families to serve missions for the Lord. Tens of thousands of these are young missionaries. In addition, I pay particular tribute to those who serve missions in their mature years, some as mission leaders and some as what we call couple missionaries.
