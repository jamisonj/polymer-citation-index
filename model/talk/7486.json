After we finished eating, we asked them to leave a spiritual thought with us. They were well prepared and introduced a scripture reading and marking exercise to us. They had brought a fresh copy of the Book of Mormon and a set of colored pencils. We accepted the invitation of the missionaries. Since then, our daily Book of Mormon family scripture reading has changed. In every chapter, we mark with different colors the passages related to Jesus Christ as we discover them. Every time, this little exercise reminds us of our missionaries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/preach-my-gospel-the-unifying-tool-between-members-and-missionaries.p6\" class=\"\">When the missionaries presented this, we immediately recognized it as a scripture study exercise suggested in <span class=\"emphasis\">Preach My Gospel.<\/span> As a family, we are so thankful for this great and powerful missionary tool.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/preach-my-gospel-the-unifying-tool-between-members-and-missionaries.p7\" class=\"\">For the past three years missionaries have been using <span class=\"emphasis\">Preach My Gospel<\/span> all around the world. It has truly revolutionized missionary work. The great vision of President Hinckley is being fulfilled: Missionaries \u201cmaster the concepts of the lessons.\u201d They \u201cteach the concepts in their own words under the guiding influence of the Holy Spirit\u201d (see \u201cMissionary Service,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,<\/span> Jan. 11, 2003, 19).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/preach-my-gospel-the-unifying-tool-between-members-and-missionaries.p8\" class=\"\">As the missionaries become immersed in <span class=\"emphasis\">Preach My Gospel,<\/span> they learn and apply important doctrines and principles which make them more capable in their important service. Despite this, they still need all of our help and support. Only together can we fulfill the great charge given to the ancient and modern Apostles: \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"51145\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51145)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51145)\">Mark 16:15<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/preach-my-gospel-the-unifying-tool-between-members-and-missionaries.p9\" class=\"\">In order to be successful in these efforts, we must be one with the missionaries, and we must understand one another. Do you always understand the missionaries? I do not refer to language but rather to how they do missionary work. We see and observe them inviting people to listen to their message. They teach gospel principles and invite those who are interested to change their lives and be baptized and confirmed members of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/preach-my-gospel-the-unifying-tool-between-members-and-missionaries.p10\" class=\"\">If we want to understand and help our missionaries, we must have faith as missionaries have faith, we must think as missionaries think, and we must feel as missionaries feel.

But another way for us is to get acquainted with <span class=\"emphasis\">Preach My Gospel<\/span> and learn more about missionary work. Ever since President McKay said, \u201cEvery member a missionary\u201d (in Conference Report, Apr. 1959, 122), members have been striving to become more active in sharing the gospel. With <span class=\"emphasis\">Preach My Gospel,<\/span> we have a marvelous guide to better help us act upon this invitation.
