We are His seed and have the potential within us to become as He is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/how-do-you-know.p4\" class=\"\">For this to happen, our Heavenly Father prepared a plan. An earth would be created upon which our spirits could be born into physical bodies, a place where we could have experiences that would teach and test us, a place to develop the godly potential within us. Here we, the seed of God, can mature into the product of the harvest of the Father\u2019s work, which is \u201cto bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39622\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39622)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39622)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/how-do-you-know.p5\" class=\"\">The plan provides us with the needed resources and instruction to become as He is.

He gave us free agency to choose for ourselves whether or not we would accept the plan. The fact that we are here on the earth with physical bodies is prima facie evidence that we did accept it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/how-do-you-know.p7\" class=\"\">However, others of God\u2019s children chose not to accept the plan. Led by Lucifer, they rebelled against our Father and sought to gain power and glory through force. They were defeated in this attempt and were cast out of the Father\u2019s presence. They are here upon the earth without physical bodies. They are still led by Lucifer, who became Satan, the devil. They are not involved in developing godly potentials; rather, they are continually struggling to influence man to misuse the resources and to disobey the instructions of our Father. Even more insidious is their relentless influence to deceive man into doing nothing with the resources and remaining ignorant of the instructions. Through this influence have come sin and transgression: sins of commission and sins of omission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/how-do-you-know.p8\" class=\"\">We refer to the instructions the Father has given us as commandments.
