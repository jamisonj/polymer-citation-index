Often in our humble home there were not as many shingles as we had roof. The rest-room facility was connected by a long path that required some advance planning, and sometimes my worn shirt had more buttonholes than buttons. The Saturday night bath in front of a warm stove, where your body experienced both extremes in temperature, was a luxury.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/gratitude.p5\" class=\"\">Then something changed. I started school and began to notice possessions I had not known. Some had nice clothing, beautiful homes with all the modern conveniences, and drove newer automobiles. Many my age were not required to arise early and do chores before going to school, only to go home at night and do them all over again. While they were popular and confident, I became backward and shy. Regretfully, I began to forget how happy I had been with my basket of blessings as I indulged in comparing their seemingly endless bushels to mine. Thus, the blinders to humility began distorting reality, giving way to ingratitude. The expectation that more is deserved can cause our plate of plenty to appear empty. Gratitude has many faces and takes on many forms. Failure to recognize the Lord for all we have will soon result in selfish behavior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/gratitude.p6\" class=\"\">The Savior, though always the giver, was seldom the receiver of gratitude.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/gratitude.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd as he [Christ] entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/gratitude.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/gratitude.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests.

While to some every apple shines, to others the remaining blemishes after the polishing process are all that\u2019s visible. We must use caution not to be drawn into the growing populous of ungrateful people who have become calloused to blessings as they bicker in misery.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/gratitude.p16\" class=\"\">Joy and happiness are born of gratitude. Recently Sister Watts and I spent three years in another part of the world working with a very kind and gracious people. If worldly possessions equated to happiness, the majority of these Saints would be unhappy. Quite the contrary, gratitude abounds, resulting in a contagious display of rejoicing. It is evident that even though they live in a challenging environment with few advantages, they are a delightful people. A cheerfulness is generated by their gratitude for the gospel of Jesus Christ and the blessings derived from living the principles taught. One faithful district president expressed gratitude to have a bicycle for transportation to perform his calling. It seemed the more he pedaled, the happier he became. Perhaps there is a lesson here: if we are feeling ungrateful, we need to pedal a little faster. The depth and the willingness with which we serve is a direct reflection of our gratitude.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/gratitude.p17\" class=\"\">Elder James E.

His recent words of indefinable gratitude for the gospel, temple covenants, and eternal marriage are engraved on my mind. In the passing of his sweet wife, this knowledge brings a comfort unknown to them before joining the Church. His words of \u201cHow can I ever thank you for sharing with our family this great eternal gift?\u201d join with my own words of unspeakable gratitude to our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, for the \u201cprecious gifts and privileges\u201d offered to us all.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/gratitude.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-98911_000_034\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20945\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20945)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20945)\">D&amp;C 78:19<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> God is the gracious giver, and I testify of Him and of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ.
