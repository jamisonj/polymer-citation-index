The current cries we hear coming from the great and spacious building tempt us to compete for ownership in the things of this world [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2100\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2100)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2100)\">1 Ne. 11:36<\/a><\/span>]. We think we need a larger home, with a three-car garage, a recreational vehicle parked next to it. We long for designer clothes, extra TV sets, all with VCRs, the latest model computers, and the newest car. Often these items are purchased with borrowed money, without giving any thought to providing for our future needs. The result of all this instant gratification is overloaded bankruptcy courts and families that are far too preoccupied with their financial burdens.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p14\" class=\"\">We live in a most exciting and challenging period in human history. As technology sweeps through every facet of our lives, changes are occurring so rapidly that it can be difficult for us to keep our lives in balance. To maintain some semblance of stability in our lives, it is essential that we plan for our future. I believe it is time, and perhaps with some urgency, to review the counsel we have received in dealing with our personal and family preparedness. We want to be found with oil in our lamps sufficient to endure to the end. President Spencer W. Kimball admonished us:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cIn reviewing the Lord\u2019s counsel to us on the importance of preparedness, I am impressed with the plainness of the message. The Savior made it clear that we cannot place sufficient oil in our preparedness lamps by simply avoiding evil. We must also be anxiously engaged in a positive program of preparation.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p16\" class=\"\">He also said: \u201cThe Lord will not translate one\u2019s good hopes and desires and intentions into works. Each of us must do that for himself\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Miracle of Forgiveness,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969, p. 8).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p17\" class=\"\">On a daily basis we witness widely fluctuating inflation; wars; interpersonal conflicts; national disasters; variances in weather conditions; innumerable forces of immorality, crime, and violence; attacks and pressures on the family and individuals; technological advances that make occupations obsolete; and so on. The need for preparation is abundantly clear. The great blessing of being prepared gives us freedom from fear, as guaranteed to us by the Lord in the Doctrine and Covenants: \u201cIf ye are prepared ye shall not fear\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20292\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20292)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20292)\">D&amp;C 38:30<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p18\" class=\"\">Just as it is important to prepare ourselves spiritually, we must also prepare ourselves for our temporal needs. Each of us needs to take the time to ask ourselves, What preparation should I make to care for my needs and the needs of my family?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p19\" class=\"\">We have been instructed for years to follow at least four requirements in preparing for that which is to come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p20\" class=\"\">First, gain an adequate education. Learn a trade or a profession to enable you to obtain steady employment that will provide remuneration sufficient to care for yourself and your family. The rapidly changing world breeds obsolescence and requires us to be continually engaged in preparing ourselves for the future. We can become antiquated in our professions if we do not stay up-to-date. Imagine how many patients a dentist would have if he continued to use the same tools and techniques he used a decade ago. What about a businessman that tried to compete without the use of computers? Or a builder who had not stayed abreast of the latest materials and methods available? Education has, of necessity, become a lifelong pursuit. We must, in our scheduling of time, allot sufficient time to educate ourselves for now and for the future.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p21\" class=\"\">Second, live strictly within your income and save something for a rainy day. Incorporate in your lives the discipline of budgeting that which the Lord has blessed you with. As regularly as you pay your tithing, set aside an amount needed for future family requirements. Include your children while planning for the future. I am convinced that in many backyards, a crop of corn, raspberries, or tomatoes, planted and harvested by your children each year and sold to your neighbors, will in time yield enough to make a major contribution to a mission or a college education fund. Go out in your garages and look over the <span class=\"emphasis\">unused<\/span> bicycles, toy cars, athletic equipment, skis, roller blades, et cetera, and calculate what the return would have been had the cost of these items been invested in future needs. Remember, I emphasized <span class=\"emphasis\">unused<\/span> articles. How many of you have seen garages so full of things that there is no longer room for the car?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p22\" class=\"\">Third, avoid excessive debt. Necessary debt should be incurred only after careful, thoughtful prayer and after obtaining the best possible advice. We need the discipline to stay well within our ability to pay. Wisely we have been counseled to avoid debt as we would avoid the plague. President J. Reuben Clark fearlessly and repeatedly counseled members of the Church to take action.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cLive within your means. Get out of debt. Keep out of debt. Lay by for a rainy day which has always come and will come again. Practice and increase your habits of thrift, industry, economy, and frugality\u201d (in Conference Report, Oct. 1937, p. 107). We should have displayed in a prominent place President Clark\u2019s description of interest:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cInterest never sleeps nor sickens nor dies. \u2026 Once in debt, interest is your companion every minute of the day and night; you cannot shun it or slip away from it; you cannot dismiss it; it yields neither to entreaties, demands, or orders; and whenever you get in its way or cross its course or fail to meet its demands, it crushes you\u201d (in Conference Report, Apr. 1938, p. 103).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p25\" class=\"\">Incurrence of debt is such an enticement. Accompanying the ease with which we can obtain debt should be the great caution of avoidance. Take the opportunity to compute how much you would add to your personal net worth if your home mortgage was only for ten or fifteen years instead of thirty. Compute the value of sweat equity if your time and your talents are invested in adding to the size and comfort of your home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p26\" class=\"\">It is so easy to allow consumer debt to get out of hand. If you do not have the discipline to control the use of credit cards, it is better not to have them. A well-managed family does not pay interest\u2014it earns it. The definition I received from a wise boss at one time in my early business career was \u201cThems that understands interest receives it, thems that don\u2019t pays it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p27\" class=\"\">Fourth, acquire and store a reserve of food and supplies that will sustain life. Obtain clothing and build a savings account on a sensible, well-planned basis that can serve well in times of emergency. As long as I can remember, we have been taught to prepare for the future and to obtain a year\u2019s supply of necessities. I would guess that the years of plenty have almost universally caused us to set aside this counsel. I believe the time to disregard this counsel is over. With events in the world today, it must be considered with all seriousness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p28\" class=\"\">Careers are ever changing. They tell me that young people entering the work force today will have major career changes maybe three or four times during their work life. Job changes will occur even more frequently, even ten to twelve times during a life\u2019s work cycle. I know of no other way to prepare for these times of adjustment than to be certain that during times of employment, preparations are made for less prosperous times, should they occur. Start now to create a plan if you don\u2019t already have one, or update your present plan. Watch for best buys that will fit into your year\u2019s supply. We are not in a situation that requires panic buying, but we do need to be careful in purchasing and rotating the storage that we\u2019re putting away. The instability in the world today makes it imperative that we take heed of the counsel and prepare for the future.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p29\" class=\"\">President Lee, in commenting on Lehi\u2019s great vision, said this:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cIf there is any one thing most needed in this time of tumult and frustration, when men and women and youth and young adults are desperately seeking for answers to the problems which afflict mankind, it is an \u2018iron rod\u2019 as a safe guide along the straight path on the way to eternal life, amidst the strange and devious roadways that would eventually lead to destruction and to the ruin of all that is \u2018virtuous, lovely, or of good report\u2019 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7058\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7058)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7058)\">A of F 1:13<\/a><\/span>]\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> June 1971, p. 7).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear.p31\" class=\"\">Unfortunately there are too many of us that are like the scoffers in Lehi\u2019s vision.

My sincere counsel to you today is to remember the good basic principles we have been taught from the very beginning\u2014principles of thrift, industry, and integrity that have served mankind in every period of time.
