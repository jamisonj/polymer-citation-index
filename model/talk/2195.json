They have, in many cases, set simpler values and seen through the transitory worth of material things. They recognize that ambition that leads men to seek power and domination over others brings not peace, but frustration. Certainly history is replete with examples of the rise and fall of ambitious men, and during temporary relief from hostilities between nations the cry always rises, \u201cNow we will have peace.\u201d How many wars have been termed \u201ca war to end all wars\u201d?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/whence-cometh-our-peace.p27\" class=\"\">Yet an encyclopedia shows that during the period from 1496 <span class=\"small\">B.C.<\/span> to <span class=\"small\">A.D.<\/span> 1861 there were 227 years of peace compared with 3,130 years of war.
