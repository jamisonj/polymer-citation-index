Gratefully, we can turn to the formula Alma gives us in chapter 32, verse 41. He says: \u201cBut if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10145\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10145)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10145)\">Alma 32:41<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/being-leaders-who-foster-growth.p5\" class=\"\">Alma commends patience, great diligence, and faith to those who seek to nourish the word.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/being-leaders-who-foster-growth.p6\" class=\"\">Our patience must come from humility; we can\u2019t force this process. President Boyd K. Packer reminds us: \u201cYou can create a climate to foster growth, nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel: you must await the growth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/being-leaders-who-foster-growth.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cDo not be impatient to gain great spiritual knowledge. Let it grow, help it grow, but do not force it or you will open the way to be misled\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Jan. 1983, p. 53).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/being-leaders-who-foster-growth.p8\" class=\"\">As we involve the young women in planning firesides, group reading, and creative ways to share their insights, we are fostering the growth they will surely feel as they experiment upon the word. We can create opportunities to read together, to record individual experiences, and to share through music, art, and the words of testimony. We can testify and be nearby.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/being-leaders-who-foster-growth.p9\" class=\"\">One group of ward presidents lamented that they\u2019d gotten off to a great start, but now, after being a few weeks into experimenting on the word, they needed a \u201cshot in the arm.\u201d This is where the \u201cgreat diligence\u201d part comes into play. We must continue to plan with a purpose activities that center on the scriptures. And even stay involved with the scriptures ourselves! Among one group of ward leaders who had committed themselves to read, a Young Women leader commented, \u201cI hate to admit it, but you know, this really is hard for me.\u201d Others in the group obviously appreciated her honesty as they then expressed some of their own struggles and need to set realistic goals. Surely the young women in that ward will find empathy and very practical helps from leaders who have wrestled to find patience and diligence themselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/being-leaders-who-foster-growth.p10\" class=\"\">Finally, we must have faith that Jesus can and will touch young women\u2019s hearts as we work together toward the worldwide celebration.
