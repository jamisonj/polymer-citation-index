The men holding the priesthood were placed in groups, according to\ntheir offices in the priesthood. The women and those not holding the priesthood were placed\nin another group. Then, before the people assembled, were presented the Authorities of the\nChurch, the General Authorities. The President of the Church, his two Counselors, the\npresident of the Council of the Twelve, and the Patriarch to the Church were voted on\nsuccessively by these different groups, and the Council of the Twelve as a group was voted\non likewise.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was an impressive hour, such as seldom comes to the Church. It was only the second time\nthat I had been at such a gathering. This method of voting, this procedure, was known by our\nfathers in this dispensation. It was known by those of other dispensations, and undoubtedly is\npatterned after the order in the courts of heaven. It has profound meaning, much more than\nwe can begin to discuss this morning when there is much to be done.\n<\/p><p>\nAmong other things, at that meeting, we sustained George Albert Smith as prophet, seer, and\nrevelator, and President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. That word,\n\"revelator,\" has remained in my mind as I am sure it has in the minds of many who were here\non that occasion. It implies many things. It implies, as we know, we Latter-day Saints, that\nGod is still speaking to his children, and that revelation, continuous revelation, is a vitalizing,\nlife-giving element of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is the principle which distinguishes us\nfrom many other groups of believers; it is the principle that gives us the strength and power\nto accomplish the work which may be placed upon us from time to time. It means that God,\nour Father in heaven, is still watchful over his children placed here upon earth; that in this\nchanging day, he has not closed the Book of Revelation. His voice is still heard, and as new\nproblems arise, he speaks, as we may need his help.\n<\/p><p>\nREVELATION THE FOUNDATION OF THE CHURCH\n<\/p><p>\nThis Church was founded in revelation. It was born in revelation. Upon his knees, the Prophet\nJoseph Smith, just a lad, lay in the grove and prayed for light, and light came. In that light\nstood the Father and the Son who gave him information and commissioned him with respect\nto the work he was to do (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30232\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30232)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30232)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>).\nLater on, through the process of revelation, by the operation of that\nprinciple, the Book of Mormon came into existence, and revelation followed revelation until\nwe have a sound foundation on which to build throughout the ages to come. We believe in\nrevelation, in continuous revelation. That, as a people, we must never forget.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Church was organized, on April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith was chosen President, the\nfirst President of this Church. On that day, before the day was over, the Lord gave a\nrevelation that relates to what we did two days ago. I believe the words of God, then spoken,\nmay be applied from generation to generation for our good. If he has given us a man to stand\nas the mouthpiece of God, a revelator, there must be some obligation resting upon us as\nmembers of the Church of Christ. This is in part what the Lord said on that day:\n<\/p><p>\nBehold, there shall be a record kept among you; and in it thou shalt be called a seer, a\ntranslator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church through the will of\nGod the Father, and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12091\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12091)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12091)\">D&amp;C 21:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then comes the admonition to us, our own obligation:\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments\nwhich he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;\n<\/p><p>\nFor his word, [the word of the president of the Church], ye shall receive, as if from mine own\nmouth, in all patience and faith (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12092\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12092)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12092)\">D&amp;C 21:4-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, we covenanted two days ago to sustain George Albert Smith as President of the Church.\nLet us not forget the obligation placed upon us by the Lord with respect to him and our own\ncovenant.\n<\/p><p>\nNot only did the Lord say this, in this very interesting and important revelation, but he\npointed out the common cause for apostasy, the common cause for falling away from the\ntruth. He said:\n<\/p><p>\nFor by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord\nGod will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for\nyour good, and his name's glory\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12093\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12093)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12093)\">D&amp;C 21:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn other words, if we violate our covenant and fail to recognize the leadership of him who is\ncalled to be the President of the Church and God's prophet, the gates of hell may prevail\nagainst us. Too often, I am sorry to say, they have done so.\n<\/p><p>\nBut he will give us strength, if we seek it, for later on the Lord says:\n<\/p><p>\nFor, behold, I will bless all those who labor in my vineyard with a mighty blessing, and they\nshall believe on his words, which are given him through me by the Comforter, which\nmanifesteth that Jesus was crucified by sinful men for the sins of the world, yea, for the\nremission of sins unto the contrite heart\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12094\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12094)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12094)\">D&amp;C 21:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis is found in section twenty-one of the D&amp;C.\n<\/p><p>\nSome would say, reading these words, \"Why this is just plain autocracy.\" They would say that\nit takes away from us our free agency if by sustaining a man we accept his words as if they\nwere from God. That is not quite so, the gift of free agency is never taken from man.\nMoreover, the doctrine of this Church is that every man and woman, in his or her respective\nfield, may receive revelation from Almighty God. This is a Church of revelation and\nrevelation is not limited to one man alone. One man is called to speak for the Church. I have\nmy problems from day to day, and I have equal right with him to call upon God for help in\nthe problems of my day. By the spirit of revelation we accept the guidance of the revelator.\nThat is always understood. The principle of revelation, that God still speaks, that he has not\nforgotten us, gives full freedom to act intelligently. If that were understood by the world, the\npeace spoken of here this morning would soon come. But, men depend upon themselves.\nThey fail to call upon God. They fail to listen to his words, and floods of hate and discontent\nand evil stalk the world. We have had the experience of war the last few years; we know\nwhat it means when men try to depend upon themselves and their own power.\n<\/p><p>\nEvery person may receive inspiration or revelation. The stake presidents have the right, in\ntheir positions, to ask for revelations from God, the bishops, in their positions; the\nhousewives, in their daily tasks can claim real help from God, provided, of course, that they\nare sensitive to such help, provided that they are able to hear the voice of God.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen God speaks, some of us fail so to live as to understand the message that comes from\neternity. I know some people say, \"Well, how can I so conduct my life as to be responsive to\nthe messages from the unseen world?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThere is an old illustration, a high school illustration, that bears on this subject. We may take\na rod of soft iron, and place it with some iron filings, without apparently causing any change;\nthe rod is not magnetic; but if we wrap that rod of iron with a wire carrying an electric\ncurrent, it becomes a magnet. Though the rod has not changed, in shape and width and length,\nit has undergone a deep change. It has become changed so that it attracts iron filings or\nwhatever else is subject to magnetic action. Just so, if we, men and women, could wrap\nourselves in obedience to God's law, live as we should live, a wonderful change is effected in\nus, and we, too, can then hear the messages of the unseen world. The principle of revelation\nand fitness for revelation, should be remembered by all of our people, by you, by me, and by\nall of us.\n<\/p><p>\nA SURE GUIDE\n<\/p><p>\nThere is another thing to be remembered. How can I, a poor human being, distinguish\nbetween an impression from God and an impression from an evil source. The devil is always\nready to deceive us. You heard Brother Petersen's remarks yesterday recounting a dozen or so\nof the devices the devil uses in this day to mislead humanity. The test of truth, given us is\nvery simple, easily understood. When an impression comes, call it inspiration or revelation,\ncompare it with the words that issue from the mouth of the prophet who stands at the head of\nthe Church. Then, if your impression is in harmony with his expressed words, it is from God.\nIf it runs counter to the prophet's teachings, your impression is from an evil source.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord wants to speak to us; he wants to guide us. He wants us to hear. His Holy Spirit\npermeates the universe, touches every heart, and if it is permitted, will carry messages to us\nfrom the throne of God. The manner of our lives will help us to receive such messages and to\ndistinguish between those that may come from God and those that come from the evil one.\n<\/p><p>\nThis Church lives and moves and has its being in revelation&mdash;continuous revelation. May we\nremember our relationship to the living prophet, as we recall the great events of two days ago.\nGod bless us and be with us, and magnify us in our labors, that we may stand as a light\nbefore the nations, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
