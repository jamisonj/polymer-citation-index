You will\nfind it on page thirty of the <i>Message of the First Presidency<\/i>, delivered in this tabernacle on\nOctober 3, 1942. It follows a survey of Satan's present efforts to destroy the people of the\nearth, and reads:\n<\/p><p>\nSTRENGTH IN UNITY\n<\/p><p>\nIn the midst of this welter of lying and deception, of woe and misery, of death and\ndestruction, of violent disorder and threatening chaos, the only saving forces on earth are the\neternal principles of the everlasting Gospel of Christ and the rights and powers of the\nPriesthood of Almighty God. We of this Church stand as the sole possessors of these mighty\nforces which we have for our own blessing, salvation, and exaltation, not only, but also we\nhold them in trust for all mankind.\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems to me that standing thus as God's representatives in the earth, charged with the\nresponsibility of carrying the banner of righteousness in the mighty conflict now raging\nbetween truth and error, we are under great responsibility to be one\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11854\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11854)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11854)\">D&amp;C 38:27<\/a><\/span>), for we fight against\ntremendous odds, and we need all the strength we can get.\n<\/p><p>\nUnited we are strong. We have great strength as a unit. The programs we have undertaken as\na Church have been accomplished magnificently.\n<\/p><p>\nEVIDENCES OF UNITED EFFORT\n<\/p><p>\nI call to mind the building of the Nauvoo Temple. The Saints were poor. The securing of the\nmoney for the purchase of the materials they used required sacrifices beyond any that we have\nbeen asked to make in recent times. They knew that as soon as the building was completed\nand they had received their endowments therein, they would have to abandon it. Still they\nheld to their purpose, though they had to complete the construction with a sword in one hand\nand a trowel in the other. That building is gone, but the monument erected in the hearts of the\nbuilders shall live forever as a testimony to their faith and unity.\n<\/p><p>\nThe missionary work of the Church is another example of what can be done when the people\nare united. It is one of the marvels of the age to all who are acquainted with it. Today, one\nforeign mission is being manned by a single small stake.\n<\/p><p>\nThe erection of the grain elevator on Welfare Square in this city is a further evidence of what\ncan be done with united effort. When the erection of that structure was in contemplation, it\nwas stated by one of the consulting engineers that the building could not be erected without a\nskilled crew, and that it would take such a crew between fourteen and fifteen days to pour the\ncement for the bins. The cement was poured in eight and one-half days, almost wholly by an\nunskilled force of volunteer Welfare workers.\n<\/p><p>\nThe production of the annual Church Welfare budget is another demonstration of what this\nChurch can do.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my conviction that since we are engaged in the Lord's work, we can accomplish\neverything He wants us to do if we will but be united.\n<\/p><p>\nCan we not be so in all things? The answer is obvious and certain. We can, but there is only\none way, and that is for each one of us to find out what the Lord wants done, and then for all\nof us to proceed together with energy to do it.\n<\/p><p>\nUnity never comes while each man charts his own course and walks in his own way. The\nLord made this very clear in the first section of the D&amp;C, when He marked such a practice as\none of the reasons for the calamities which he saw coming upon the inhabitants of the earth.\nHe said:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the anger of the Lord is kindled, and his sword is bathed in heaven, and it shall fall upon\nthe inhabitants of the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they who will not hear\nthe voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the\nprophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people;\n<\/p><p>\nFor they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant;\n<\/p><p>\n<i>They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way,\nand after the image of his own God, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose\nsubstance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the\ngreat, which shall fall<\/i> (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11835\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11835)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11835)\">D&amp;C 1:13-16<\/a><\/span>, italics author's).\n<\/p><p>\nThis message was intended for all the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11833\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11833)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11833)\">D&amp;C 1:1-2<\/a><\/span>), as the Lord says, and now for nearly one\nhundred and twelve years the Lord's servants have been carrying it to the world, explaining\nthat the cause of all this strife, trouble, and wickedness is that men rely upon the counsel of\ntheir fellow men and trust in the arm of flesh and walk in their own ways after the image of\ntheir own gods, rather than seek the true and living God to establish His righteousness.\n<\/p><p>\nI repeat that the only path to unity is to find out the will of the Lord, and then follow it. The\nway to find it out is, first, to be humble. We must not be hard of heart. We must assume our\nproper relationship to our Father in heaven, recognizing that in His infinite wisdom He knows\nwhat ought to be done. Therefore, we should be willing to subject our\npersonal opinions and actions to His will.\n<\/p><p>\nUNDERSTANDING OF THE GOSPEL COMES THROUGH STUDY AND PRAYER\n<\/p><p>\nIn this attitude, we should learn what His will is by a study of His word, as given in the\nstandard works of the Church and through the living prophets. This study must be made in\nfaith, and prayerfully. We should ask the Lord to help us comprehend the Prophet's words\nand understand their application to us.\n<\/p><p>\nAs an illustration of this approach, I call your attention to some Book of Mormon history.\nYou will recall that Father Lehi had a dream, in which he saw the tree of life, the fountain of\nwater, the iron rod, and the large and spacious building, and that when he told his sons about\nit, they did not understand its meaning\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1445\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1445)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1445)\">1 Ne. 8:2-38<\/a><\/span>).\nNephi had such a desire to know what it meant, and\nsuch faith that the Lord could make it known unto him, that he was caught away into a high\nmountain and given its interpretation\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1447\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1447)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1447)\">1 Ne. 11:1-36<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1448\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1448)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1448)\">1 Ne. 12:1-23<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1449\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1449)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1449)\">1 Ne. 13:1-42<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1451\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1451)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1451)\">1 Ne. 14:1-30<\/a><\/span>).\nWhen he returned to the tent of his father, he found his\nbrothers disputing as to the meaning of the words of their father\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1452\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1452)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1452)\">1 Ne. 15:1-2<\/a><\/span>), and they were hard to\nunderstand in the wisdom of men, for Nephi says that his father spoke \"many great things\nunto them which were hard to be understood, save a man should inquire of the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1453\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1453)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1453)\">1 Ne. 15:3<\/a><\/span>). His\nbrothers, being hard in their hearts, had not inquired of the Lord, saying that the Lord\n\"maketh no such things known unto us\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1454\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1454)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1454)\">1 Ne. 15:9<\/a><\/span>). Then Nephi said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . How is it that ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord? How is it that ye will\nperish, because of the hardness of your hearts?\n<\/p><p>\nDo ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said? If ye will not harden your hearts,\nand ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my\ncommandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1455\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1455)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1455)\">1 Ne. 15:10-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nINDEPENDENCE THE AIM OF THE WELFARE PLAN\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the activities of the Church which is being given great emphasis at this time is the\nWelfare work. If I understand the counsel of the brethren correctly in connection with this\nprogram, we must become a self-sustaining, independent people. This means that the Church\nmembers, individually and as a body, must become independent of direct public relief of all\nkinds.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have done a magnificent work in our production program and in many other Welfare\nactivities. What we need to do now is to become united as one man in our determination to\naccomplish this great objective of independence. This we can do by understanding and\nfollowing the advice of the brethren and the instructions issued from the headquarters of the\nChurch.\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems to me that there is no greater threat today against our fundamental institutions than\nthat of losing our independence. It is a sad fact that in Utah in 1942, when industrial payrolls\nwere up 270% over 1936, the public welfare expenditures were up 282% over 1936. It is\npossible, in the Church Welfare way, to free every member of the Church of Christ\nfrom the necessity of accepting direct relief from any public agency and to\nmake all, except the permanently disabled, self-sustaining.\n<\/p><p>\nI accept this Church as the way of life, not only in the interpretation of theology, but in the\nsocial and economic phases of our lives, and I expect that through this Welfare program the\nChurch shall point the way to the solution of economic problems, so that in the future a\nfalling world can point to it as a light on the hill\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33826\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33826)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33826)\">Matt. 5:14<\/a><\/span>) which has solved its economic problems in\nthe midst of chaos.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to become united in our understanding and in our efforts to accomplish this great\nobjective, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
