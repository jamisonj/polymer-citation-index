Critchlow, Jr., <i>Conference Report<\/i> October 1960, pp. 26-29<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nPresident McKay, my brothers and sisters:\n<\/p><p>\nWhere could you find sweeter voices than these voices from Ogden and Northern Utah which\nhave sung for us this day? I have heard them before, I hope to hear them again. I am proud\nof them.\n<\/p><p>\n\"All the world's a stage,<br \/>\nAnd all the men and women merely players:<br \/>\nThey have their exits and their entrances;<br \/>\nAnd one man in his time plays many parts.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;          &mdash;Shakespeare,<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;          <i>As You Like It<\/i>, Act II, Scene 7, lines 139-142.\n<\/p><p>\nThrough the years thousands of our young men and women and many\noldsters, too, have been called to play heroic roles in the great Drama of Life. I have enjoyed\nthese past two years the privilege of setting apart many of them,&mdash;missionaries of the\nChurch&mdash;sending them forth to perform on the stage of life with a blessing.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Drama of Life has many acts. Few of them, however, are as thrilling as the act entitled\n\"A Mission.\" Let me sketchily review for you a few scenes in an act which I witnessed, just\nto show how exciting this \"Mission Act\" can really be.\n<\/p><p>\nThe opening scene was called \"Miles Zero.\" In the missionary's first letter to his folks he\nwrote: \"Dear Dad: I'm up at Miles Zero on the Alaskan highway in Dawson Creek where it is\ncosting me one hundred dollars a week for board and room.\n<\/p><p>\nHis dad replied immediately, \"Dear Son: Get off the Alaskan highway! Park Avenue, New\nYork, should be cheaper. Miles Zero is too rich for my blood.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe dad's letter and another letter from the son crossed in the mail. The son's letter began:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Dear Dad: The Lord has blessed me already. A man committed suicide in his room. It was\nso ghastly that no one would rent it. I offered the landlord forty dollars a month. He took me\nup&mdash;so I moved in with my companion who is sharing the forty dollars. All my problems\nare solved.\" Months passed.\n<\/p><p>\nThen, in one of his regular letters, the son said, \"I have twenty-two prospects about ready to\njoin up, but no place to baptize them. Peace River will be frozen over till June, and before\nthen I shall be due for a transfer. Wish I could use a bathtub. They have some large tin ones\nup here.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWeeks passed.\n<\/p><p>\nIn another letter the son wrote: \"Lucky me. The Lord has blessed me again. Two of my\nchoice prospects, the banker and the head of the Masonic Lodge, who is also the president of\nthe Power Board went six hundred miles down to Edmonton, and I baptized them. That's two\ndown, only twenty more to go. My president is pleased. He is transferring me to Bella Coula,\nwherever that is. Up here, there are two kinds of water&mdash;liquid and frozen, also two kinds of\nprospects&mdash;hot and cold. I'm terribly afraid that some of my twenty remaining prospects will\n'freeze up' before liquid water and a baptismal font become available. I shall regret losing\nthem, but I'll pick twenty up in Bella Coula. Wish me luck.\"\n<\/p><p>\nFive years after the curtain fell on this son's \"Mission Act,\" I was sent to a conference in\nCalgary, Canada, and in one of the sessions of the conference I listened to the stake president\npraise, as he released, his stake mission president who had baptized twenty converts \"right\nhere in Calgary.\" He called on him to speak. I copied these words from a tape of his talk.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Seven years ago one Sunday in a converted hut at Miles Zero on the Alaskan highway I met\na young man who was to be instrumental in changing the course of my life. He was big, six\nfeet. He had a big grin and hands that were always moving. You could tell he had the spirit\nof the gospel. I had met many men before, but never had I met a man who could teach the\ngospel the way this man did. He would both fast and pray, and I remember that one time he\nfasted three days and nights, going without food and water and praying on behalf of the\npeople he was teaching. He taught the gospel with an inspiration that only one who had the\nguidance of his Father in heaven could bring. He baptized me. I have a great love for that\nyoung man. Elder Critchlow, take back to your son a confirmation of the love we have for\nhim. In a way to pay the debt tell him that many here within the sound of my voice, whom I\nhave had the privilege of teaching have come into the kingdom of God&mdash;through your son.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThose words \"through your son\" were ringing pleasantly in my ears&mdash;still I heard the\npresident who leaned toward me to whisper: \"He (the mission president) baptized twenty\npeople here in Calgary.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSuddenly, my memory was flooded with a maze of words&mdash;words which my son had written\nyears before. Slowly, they assembled into fragments of broken sentences: \"That's two\ndown&mdash;twenty more to go&mdash;I'm afraid my twenty prospects will freeze up before liquid water\nis available .... I regret losing them ....\n<\/p><p>\nI'll pick them up in Bella Coula&mdash;Wish me luck.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWell, he didn't pick them up in Bella Coula.\n<\/p><p>\nThey were picked up in Calgary by one of the \"two down\" who picked up the \"twenty more\nto go\"&mdash;\"through your son.\"\n<\/p><p>\nFamilies that have never had a missionary in the field have missed one of the grandest\nblessings that could come into their homes. Ask the mother who impatiently awaits her\nmissionary son's letters, who gleefully reads lines in them over the back fence to neighbors\nand over the phone to relatives and friends.\n<\/p><p>\nAsk the proud father, the brother, or the sister about the sweet feeling they experience when\nthey kneel together each day in family prayers to ask a blessing for their missionary. Before\nBobby left for his mission the family skipped its prayers occasionally, but while he was in the\nfield&mdash;so far, far away from home, they skipped fewer prayers because Bobby might need the\nprotection and the help of a loving Heavenly Father. Never was the family knit more closely\ntogether.\n<\/p><p>\nRecently I told a stake president he needed six thousand stake missionaries. \"Be reasonable,\"\nhe said, \"I've only six thousand members in my stake.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Right, exactly right,\" I replied, \"and every one of those members is a missionary.\"\n<\/p><p>\nEvery member of our Church is a missionary. Without the formality of a setting-apart we\nshould be so set-apart from the ways of the world that we can teach the gospel, which is our\nFather's way of life, by the very lives we live. Without the oral word of mouth preaching, the\nexample of our living will always be effective teaching. A sermon seen is better than a\nsermon heard.\n<\/p><p>\nExample has more followers than reason and is more forcible than precept.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, the world's a stage;\n<\/p><p>\nSo is the Church a stage;\n<\/p><p>\nAnd all its members merely players...\n<\/p><p>\nThey have their exits and their entrances;\n<\/p><p>\nAnd each member in his time is expected to choose and play a noble part.\n<\/p><p>\nCome up here with me on this stage of life and, over the glare of the footlights in this World\nTheater let's take a peek at the audience watching us play our parts in the great Drama of\nLife.\n<\/p><p>\nDown there in the parquet whom do you see? Over the glare of the footlights I quite\ndistinctly see my wife, my children, my neighbors, my friends across the town and across the\ncountry, my vocational associates, my associates in the Church Offices. All who know me, be\nit ever so well or ever so slight, seem to be in this World Theater. And they're watching, oh,\nso critically. Yet if I play my role well&mdash;the role of a Latter-day Saint&mdash;I'm sure there will be\nsome applause. But if I slip out of character&mdash;even for a moment or so&mdash;some of them, like\npatrons of any theater, at times, might sneer, perhaps hiss. These translate into one of the\nugliest words in the English dictionary&mdash;\"hypocrite.\"\n<\/p><p>\nMay our merciful Heavenly Father help me, help you to play our chosen roles so well that we\nmay deserve the plaudits and the praise, at least the respect of those who watch.\n<\/p><p>\nNow look up to the balcony . . . the glare of the footlights, whom do you see there? On the\nvery first row I see my mother. My father is beside her, my brother beside him. Behind them,\nI believe, my grandparents. One man among them with sideburns and a lock of curly brown\nhair looks like a picture I've seen of Captain James Brown who led the sick detachment of\nthe Mormon Battalion into Salt Lake Valley. He's my great-grandfather. These obviously are\nthe dead. I can almost hear them say:\n<\/p><p>\n\"We are the dead,<br \/>\nShort years ago we lived, felt dawn, saw Sunshine glow . . .<br \/>\nTo you from failing hand the torch we throw<br \/>\nBe yours to hold it high.<br \/>\nIf ye break faith with us who die,<br \/>\nWe shall not sleep.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;          &mdash;adapted&mdash;\"In Flanders Fields\" McCrea.\n<\/p><p>\nI don't really believe, of course, that my father and mother and my grandparents are peeking\nthrough the veil, observing every scene in which I act, but sometimes I wonder. Just in case, I\nhad better act, I ought to act, yes, I want to act so that they with a feeling of pride will smile\nand applaud my scenes.\n<\/p><p>\nI love my parents and my grandparents. They are not dead. They live. Sometimes I think I\nalmost hear, or rather feel, their prayers for me! Surely they must be praying and pulling for\nme, otherwise I would not have been so blessed. Again, I ask a merciful Father in heaven to\nhelp me and to help you to play our scenes so well that we may fittingly deserve applause\nfrom the balcony of the dead.\n<\/p><p>\nLook again, this tinge to the gallery. Over the glow of the footlights I see faces very\nindistinctly. I recognize none of them. These, something tells me, are the spirits yet to come\nand be embodied on this earth; they who must come to take our places. I wonder if they do\nnot watch with interest the Drama of Earth Life, and if they are not earnestly praying that we\nwill play our roles well, for they must come to dwell in the environment we are creating for\nthem. Once upon a time our Heavenly Father's children on this earth became so wicked that\nhe washed them and their wickedness off the stage with a great flood so that these spirits\nmight inherit a decent environment. This gallery of spirits will certainly applaud if we play\nour parts well.\n<\/p><p>\nHigh up above the stage in this World Theater is a box. Look up. The glare of the overhead\nfloodlights obscures its occupant. This box is reserved for the Author\nof the play&mdash;the Drama of Life. He not only is the Author, he is also the Critic and the\nJudge. How glorious could be that day if in its morning&mdash;the morning after the curtain\nfalls&mdash;his press would announce: \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35075\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35075)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35075)\">Matt. 25:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYes, the world's a stage, so is the Church a stage, and you and I are merely players. We've\nchosen noble roles in the Drama of Life. Let's play them well.\n<\/p><p>\nWe can preach a better sermon with our lives than with our lips. We can do more good by\nbeing good than by preaching good. Let us so act that our principle of action shall become a\nlaw, not only for the Church, but also for the whole world. Eventually it will be. May that\ntime be soon, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
