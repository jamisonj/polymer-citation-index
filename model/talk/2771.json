All four of these objectives involve people, for his church is a people-oriented church. Just as people were the main concern of the Savior, so it should be with each of us, if we are to assist the Master in achieving his end result: to \u201cbring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39495\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39495)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39495)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/these-four-things.p11\" class=\"\">Eternal life for the individual requires priesthood. It requires priesthood action; it requires conformity to priesthood principles. The four people-oriented objectives in the life of those who profess to call themselves members of his church are these:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/these-four-things.p12\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">First,<\/span> the obligation to prepare one\u2019s self and one\u2019s immediate family for the presence of the Lord;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/these-four-things.p13\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Second,<\/span> the obligation to be our brother\u2019s keeper and to lift other Church members;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/these-four-things.p14\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Third,<\/span> the obligation to share the most precious gift we have, the gospel, with those who have not yet caught the vision; and<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/these-four-things.p15\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Fourth,<\/span> the obligation to provide an opportunity of eternal blessings for our kindred dead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/these-four-things.p16\" class=\"\">Please note that your own personal welfare was first on the list, because the last three great obligations can only be accomplished from a source of strength and confidence. The world has too many cases already of \u201cthe blind leading the blind.\u201d Our source of knowledge is light and truth. It is the word of God in the beautiful framework of continuing revelation. Truth and light must indeed be received before there can be a dissemination of it. The Savior provided living water to the spiritually deprived. We should strive for that capability also. Ours is not the role of the book vendor who merely carries out an exchange. As we convey properly, we must give of ourselves. Truth travels best on the wings of personal testimony and individual worthiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/these-four-things.p17\" class=\"\">The Lord said to Peter, \u201cWhen thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31974\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31974)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31974)\">Luke 22:32<\/a><\/span>.)

Right beside this tremendous priesthood process is Relief Society visiting teaching. Paul had the spirit of home teaching and visiting teaching when he wrote to Timothy: \u201cAnd the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5208\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5208)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5208)\">2 Tim. 2:2<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/these-four-things.p22\" class=\"\">And now, listen to this, directly from the Lord: \u201cAnd I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16741\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16741)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16741)\">D&amp;C 88:77<\/a><\/span>.) This is not a mere suggestion, but listen: \u201cI give unto you a <span class=\"emphasis\">commandment<\/span> that you shall teach one another.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/these-four-things.p23\" class=\"\">I like the analogy I once heard about home teaching. The speaker held up a piece of Scottish plaid and suggested that in our minds we think of each color in the plaid as a separate program of the Church. Then he asked the question: \u201cWhich color is home teaching?\u201d The answer: \u201cHome teaching is not a single color; it is the total fabric.\u201d Home teaching, properly carried out, could well involve every facet of the Church according to the varying needs of each family. I like that! Too often we think of home teaching as \u201cjust another program.\u201d It can, and should, be as long and as broad as the entire Church spectrum.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/these-four-things.p24\" class=\"\">Now, all four billion souls now living on the earth are very dear indeed to our Heavenly Father. They, also, need what you and I have. To see that they have an opportunity to hear, and hopefully accept, is another of our important responsibilities. Thus we help Heavenly Father to further accomplish his work and his glory\u2014to assist in bringing all of his children into the circle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/these-four-things.p25\" class=\"\">So, the third great objective and vow that we have taken upon ourselves involves these four billion souls. It means continually seeking out and teaching those who might be ready now. This teaching is best done in an appropriate, orderly, and sincere way that will lead to their unqualified acceptance of gospel truth. The Savior said: \u201cGo ye into all the world\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33278\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33278)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33278)\">Mark 16:15<\/a><\/span>), and we <span class=\"emphasis\">are<\/span> going, some 23,000 strong. We are now carrying the truth of the gospel to some fifty nations. But even today\u2019s effort is not enough, says the prophet. Every single person in the Church twenty-five years and younger should be considered as a prospective missionary and the rest of us should become involved in training them, in encouraging them, and in helping them to save funds that they may be self-financed as far as possible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/these-four-things.p26\" class=\"\">During the recent tour of area conferences in the South Pacific, President Kimball was obviously impressed as we met dozens of Indian converts in Fiji.

The talks were superb, and the choir sang beyond their natural abilities. It was a miracle that we were meeting in the Sydney Opera House, a dramatic story in itself. Just in a word, the Sydney Opera House is normally booked two to three years in advance. There is an impressive history of practically no cancellations. And less than two months prior to conference time, there was a cancellation that no one can really explain\u2014no one except the Lord, that is! You see, it just so happened to be on our weekend! The Lord moves in mysterious ways, his wonders to perform. The possibility of a national telecast was largely made possible by the acquisition of the Opera House as the conference location.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/these-four-things.p28\" class=\"\">Listen to a few typical nonmember responses sent in from all over Australia after viewing that telecast.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/these-four-things.p29\" class=\"\">The first one: \u201cWell, how real can you get?
