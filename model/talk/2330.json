This is the place where we come each six months to be instructed in our duties and built up in our faith. This is where some of the most important business of the Church is transacted. And then twice each year we have this thrilling, exciting experience of holding up our hands and making a personal covenant with the Lord that we will sustain and support those who are placed in authority over us in the Church and that we will also keep all of the Lord\u2019s commandments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/hold-up-your-hands.p4\" class=\"\">The other evening I reread Saint Paul\u2019s famous twelfth chapter of First Corinthians, in which he compared the various parts of the human body with the spiritual gifts and ecclesiastical offices which have been placed in the Church. He said that all were necessary and that the eye could not say to the hand, \u201cI have no need of thee.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"564\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 564)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(564)\">1 Cor. 12:21<\/a><\/span>] And each six months, as I see the thousands of raised hands in this assembly, I like to think of the great power and many important duties, both symbolic and otherwise, that we hold in our hands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/hold-up-your-hands.p5\" class=\"\">The Lord has placed in our hands the responsibility for working out our eternal exaltation in fear and trembling before him. When we are sick we have hands placed upon our heads and we are given a blessing for the restoration of our health. By the laying on of hands we confirm people members of the Church. We confer the Holy Ghost. We ordain people to the priesthood, and we set them apart for that portion of the work of the Lord that they are called to perform. We raise our hands in salute. We hold them over our hearts as we take our pledge of allegiance to the flag. We clasp hands in friendship and fellowship. We lay them upon the shoulders of our friends to give commendation and encouragement. With a pair of willing, ambitious, capable, clean hands, we can move mountains and we can save souls.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/hold-up-your-hands.p6\" class=\"\">It was probably one of the greatest good fortunes of our lives when creation decided to flatten out the ends of both of our arms and place a hand on each one. When you put on your shirt in the morning, just imagine how you would get along if you had any other device except a hand on the end of your arm. Just suppose that you had a hoof or a claw or a wing, or a pair of pliers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/hold-up-your-hands.p7\" class=\"\">The story is told of a young man who went blind in his early youth. Many years later after an operation, the first thing that his newly restored vision rested upon was his own hand, and he thought he had never imagined anything quite so wonderful as his own hand with its circulation system, its communication system, its temperature control, its self-healing ability, and its wonderful covering of skin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/hold-up-your-hands.p8\" class=\"\">Or think of the usefulness of these wonderful little bony levers that we call fingers. They can readily be trained to play the piano, dial telephone numbers, and do the accounting. Someone once said that a man\u2019s best friends are his fingers.

The Lord knew then what every one of us ought to know now, that there are certain passages in the scriptures that must never be forgotten if our lives are to be successful. Therefore, to help the people to remember, he required that they write some of these passages down on pieces of parchment, encase them in little leather tubes, and bind them across their foreheads and between their eyes. They were required to hang them around their necks and bind them on their arms like wrist watches and wear them like rings upon their fingers. About this custom the Lord said to the people: \u201cAnd these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/hold-up-your-hands.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/hold-up-your-hands.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21295\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21295)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21295)\">Deut. 6:6\u20138<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/hold-up-your-hands.p12\" class=\"\">You will recall that your mother used to make an interesting adaptation of this idea. When she sent you on an important errand, the purpose of which she did not want you to forget, she helped you to remember by tying a red string on your finger with a bow on the top so that no matter where you went or what you did, you would always remember what your mother wanted you to do.

And after they had eaten, God said, \u201c\u2026 the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23858\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23858)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23858)\">Gen. 3:22<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/hold-up-your-hands.p17\" class=\"\">I would just like to point out in passing that the right kind of knowledge still tends to have that effect upon people. It still tends to make men and women become as God. A flaming sword was placed in the Garden of Eden to guard the tree of life, but fortunately for us there is no flaming sword guarding the tree of knowledge, and each one of us may eat to his heart\u2019s content. And maybe you can think of something more exciting than that, but I don\u2019t know what it would be. In this great age of restoration and enlightenment we can know about as much as we want to know about any subject, including God and his program for our eternal exaltation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/hold-up-your-hands.p18\" class=\"\">The second finger is the pointing finger. This is the finger you use to show people the way. This is the directing finger. And the second law of success says that you must be a convert before you can be a disciple. You must be a convert before you can be a leader. You must be a convert before you can show other people the way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/hold-up-your-hands.p19\" class=\"\">Jesus said to Peter, \u201cSimon, \u2026 when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31877\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31877)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31877)\">Luke 22:31\u201332<\/a><\/span>.) Peter may have been a little bit offended at this, as he probably felt that as the chief apostle, he was already converted; but what happened that very night at the house of Caiaphas when he denied the Lord three times may have indicated that even Peter was not fully converted. And it would help us if we made up a great credenda of beliefs and had strong, well-worked-out convictions centered in each one.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/hold-up-your-hands.p20\" class=\"\">The third finger is the big finger.

If the work of the Lord seems burdensome and makes us weary, or if we don\u2019t get exhilaration and uplift out of that part of the work of the world that life has given us to do, then we should repent.

However, the big finger cannot say to the little finger, \u201cI have no need of thee.\u201d The little finger may come at the end of the line-up, but that is the quarterback position, and you don\u2019t need a great big man to be the quarterback, providing the other members of the team are fully qualified and effectively functioning.

The pointing finger has some powerful, well-developed convictions about it; the big finger WANTS to do it, in capital letters; the ring finger gets great satisfaction from doing it; and all the little finger has to do is to do it.
