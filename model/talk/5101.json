As part of an outing, a group of Latter-day Saint Boy Scouts entered an abandoned mine in the mountains not far from here. Somehow, young Joshua Dennis was separated from the group and became lost in the mine. Anyone who has ever lost something valuable will remember that terrible feeling. The pain is most extreme when we have lost a loved one.

For days, many good people dropped everything they were doing to search for the one who was lost. Many shared the pain of his loss. Then, miraculously, he was found. Prayers were answered, and the mercy of a loving Heavenly Father was manifest in the happiness of family and friends reunited with the one who was lost. The pain of loss turned to the overwhelming joy of reunion.

We saw the conditions produced by rulers who had gratified their lusts at the expense of their people. Their palaces stood in shameful contrast to the workers\u2019 apartment houses built without indoor plumbing. Everywhere we saw the ugly effects of the neglect of public services. Truly, the Proverbs say, \u201cWhen the wicked \u2026 rule, the people mourn.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41628\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41628)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41628)\">Prov. 29:2<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/joy-and-mercy.p35\" class=\"\">The consequences of wickedness are far-reaching. They continue from generation to generation. The pitiful victims of physical and sexual and emotional abuse are more susceptible to Satan\u2019s manipulations. They are more likely to perpetuate these ugly transgressions within their own family relationships. Like highly contagious physical ailments, the spiritual diseases of lust and greed and corruption spread their evil effects, and Satan rejoices in the unhappiness and pain they cause in each succeeding generation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/joy-and-mercy.p36\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, old and young, I plead with each of you to remember that wickedness never was happiness and that sin leads to misery. Young people, do not seek happiness in the glittering but shallow things of the world. We cannot achieve lasting happiness by pursuing the wrong things. Someone once said, \u201cYou can never get enough of what you don\u2019t need, because what you don\u2019t need won\u2019t satisfy you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/joy-and-mercy.p37\" class=\"\">Young and old, turn your eyes and your hearts away from the deceptive messages of the media. There is no happiness in alcohol or drugs, only enslavement. There is no happiness in violence, only pain and sorrow. There is no happiness in sexual relations and physical familiarities outside the bonds of marriage, only degradation and increased momentum along the way to spiritual death.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/joy-and-mercy.p38\" class=\"\">There is no lasting happiness in what we possess. Happiness and joy come from what a person <span class=\"emphasis\">is,<\/span> not from what he or she <span class=\"emphasis\">possesses<\/span> or <span class=\"emphasis\">appears to be.<\/span> Youth, hold fast to your standards. Study and use that saving pamphlet, <span class=\"emphasis\">For the Strength of Youth.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/joy-and-mercy.p39\" class=\"\">Righteousness fosters righteousness. The effects of righteous examples are felt for generations to come. Good parenting produces youth who make good parents. Just as many of us have been strengthened by the noble examples of our pioneering ancestors in many lands, so the righteous choices and sacrifices of our day can bless our families and our friends and our nations for all the years to come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/joy-and-mercy.p40\" class=\"\">We appreciate the work of our <span class=\"emphasis\">Church News<\/span> and our Church magazines, which share worthy and wholesome examples for the strengthening of all. We are saddened by the negative examples highlighted in the media and in many other public communications. Examples are powerful. We should use them to build up, not to tear down.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/joy-and-mercy.p41\" class=\"\">I testify to you of the lasting happiness and ultimate joy of those who exercise faith in God and keep his commandments. I urge each of you to seek the joy that comes from keeping the commandments of God and exerting a righteous influence for the benefit of those we love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/joy-and-mercy.p42\" class=\"\">I testify to the truth of God\u2019s promise that the faithful \u201cshall enter into the joy of [the] Lord, and shall inherit eternal life.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19432\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19432)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19432)\">D&amp;C 51:19<\/a><\/span>.) I testify of God the Eternal Father and his Son Jesus Christ, the authors of the great plan of happiness and mercy.
