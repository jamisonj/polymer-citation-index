It is the oldest of the Jewish festivals, celebrating an event in advance of receiving the traditional Mosaic Law. It reminds every generation of the return of the children of Israel to the promised land and of the great travail in Egypt which preceded it. It commemorates the passage of a people from subjection and bondage to freedom and deliverance. It is the Old Testament festival of springtime when the world of nature awakens to life, growth, and fruition.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/christ-our-passover.p4\" class=\"\">Passover is linked with the Christian observance of Easter which we celebrate this weekend in this great conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Would it have surprised them that one so young and seemingly inexperienced would have known so much about the meaning of that fateful night in Egypt so long ago and so far away? Would they have been amazed at his knowledge of the lamb and the blood and the firstborn and the sacrifice? The scriptures are silent on such questions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/christ-our-passover.p19\" class=\"\">As the Gospel of John makes clear, the feast of the Passover marked significant milestones during the mortal ministry of Christ. At the first Passover in his ministry, Jesus made his mission known by purifying the temple when he drove from its portals the money changers and those who sold animals. In the second Passover Jesus manifested his power by the miracle of the loaves and fishes. Christ here introduced the symbols that would later have even greater meaning in the Upper Room. \u201cI am the bread of life,\u201d he said. \u201cHe that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29242\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29242)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29242)\">John 6:35<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/christ-our-passover.p20\" class=\"\">Of course, it would be the feast of his last Passover that would give full expression to this ancient celebration. By that final week of his mortal ministry, Jesus knew clearly what this particular Passover would mean to him. Trouble was already in the air. Matthew records:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/christ-our-passover.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/christ-our-passover.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cYe know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37087\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37087)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37087)\">Matt. 26:1\u20132<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/christ-our-passover.p23\" class=\"\">Knowing full well what awaited him, Jesus asked Peter and John to make arrangements for the paschal meal.

Jesus sat down with his disciples and, after the eating of the sacrificial lamb and of the bread and wine of this ancient feast, he taught them a newer and holier meaning of that ancient blessing from God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/christ-our-passover.p26\" class=\"\">He took one of the flat, round loaves of unleavened bread, said the blessing over it, and broke it into pieces that he distributed to the Apostles, saying: \u201cThis is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32225\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32225)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32225)\">Luke 22:19<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/christ-our-passover.p27\" class=\"\">As the cup was being poured, he took it and, giving thanks, invited them to drink of it, saying, \u201cThis cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32226\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32226)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32226)\">Luke 22:20<\/a><\/span>.)
