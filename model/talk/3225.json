The principal refused. He offered no further explanation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/judge-not-according-to-the-appearance.p67\" class=\"\">The delegation concluded, therefore, that the principal had acted for \u201cpolitical reasons,\u201d for he was known to have some deep philosophical differences with that teacher.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/judge-not-according-to-the-appearance.p68\" class=\"\">The teacher (and this is frequently the case) took the part of a mistreated soul.

Should all be made public, it would be doubtful that he could be reemployed as a teacher.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/judge-not-according-to-the-appearance.p70\" class=\"\">The principal, however, had some faith. If things were not noised about, the teacher might, through repentance and restitution, make himself again worthy to teach\u2014perhaps even in the Church school system.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/judge-not-according-to-the-appearance.p71\" class=\"\">This principal generously took much criticism, even abuse, over a long period of time.

Then she talked it over with her best friend, and then her sister, and received conflicting advice. Finally, her husband was told by the man he rides with that they\u2019d better see the bishop.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/judge-not-according-to-the-appearance.p78\" class=\"\">Indeed, it was noised about, but not by the bishop.
