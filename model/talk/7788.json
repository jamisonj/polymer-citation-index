We started by following the counsel of our Church leaders. We brought our children together and held weekly family home evenings as well as daily prayer and scripture study. It was not always easy, convenient, or successful, but over time these simple gatherings became treasured family traditions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/establishing-a-christ-centered-home.p24\" class=\"\">We learned that our children might not remember everything about the family home evening lesson later in the week, but they would remember that <span class=\"emphasis\">we held it.<\/span> We learned that later in the day at school they would probably not remember the exact words of the scriptures or the prayer, but they would remember that we <span class=\"emphasis\">did read<\/span> scriptures and we <span class=\"emphasis\">did have<\/span> prayer.
