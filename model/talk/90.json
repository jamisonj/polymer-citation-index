Bowen, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1943, pp. 81-83<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nWe talk about a great many of the departments of the Church, of its various organizations,\nand quorums, but we have often neglected to mention one of the very important and\ninfluential departments that it sustains. I refer to the Department of Education.\n<\/p><p>\nLIVING OF GOSPEL BRINGS BETTER TEMPORAL CONDITIONS\n<\/p><p>\nThis people has always been a people that believed in the enlightenment of its members.\nWherever the gospel has been carried by the missionaries of this Church, there has been an\nendeavor to raise the level of knowledge and understanding of its members. When our\nemissaries have gone to the islands of the seas, they have built schoolhouses, they have taught\nthe natives, they have tried to let light into their minds, and have tried to make them better. In\nevery way they have tried to improve the spiritual, mental, and temporal conditions of peoples\nthey have gone among.\n<\/p><p>\nWe could not be satisfied, as a people, with our ideals, to remain unacquainted with the\nlearning of the day. We could not be satisfied to be classed among the ignorant, and neither\nwould it conduce to our general temporal welfare if we did that.\n<\/p><p>\nThe farmer is a better farmer if he knows something about the science of agriculture. We\nhave conquered pests; we have saved millions through the learning that our people have\nacquired. You men sitting here do not have to think back very far to remember the day when\nyour sugar factories could not run because a little insect destroyed the beets. Those insects\nwere conquered because men came to learn how to produce a seed that would yield a beet\nthat could resist the onslaught of this little pest.\n<\/p><p>\nGreat acres of the land of this state have been brought into fertility and have produced the\nwherewithal to sustain life, because certain chemists studied in their laboratories and learned\nthe secret of making these lands productive, and of producing the kinds of seeds that would\nthrive in our climate.\n<\/p><p>\nIMPORTANT OBJECTIVES IN EDUCATION\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe in learning. Every time I have to do anything, I know that I could do it better if I\nonly knew more. The limit of my power is the limit of my knowledge and\nunderstanding; if I can extend the scope of these, I can grow in power, because truly,\nknowledge is power.\n<\/p><p>\nBut we would not at this time have set up schools in the Church to teach some of these things\nthat I have been talking about. There were times in our earlier history when all the\neducational advantages offered were those that were fostered by the Church. With the growth\nof the state in population and wealth, it has assumed the responsibility now for a great deal of\nthat kind of instruction.\n<\/p><p>\nBut there are other things that ought to go side by side with these elements of learning that I\nhave been talking about. It is an interesting observation, the cycle through which our thoughts\nhave run and the way the pendulum has swung from one end of the arc to the other,\nrespecting what constitutes a proper education. We have the old scholastics, who dealt in the\nclassics, and who spent their time in philosophical discussion, dealing with the meaning and\npurpose of life and man's relationship to the universe, rather than with what we have in this\nday come to regard as the more practical training.\n<\/p><p>\nThen we came upon a period when we thought it was more important in our educational\nsystem to prepare men to make a living and so education came to be supposed to have as its\npurpose the training of men in the art of making a living. We gave training in the crafts, in\nthe trades, and now a good many of our educators are looking over the field and are saying:\n\"We have lost something.\" They suspect that we have laid too much emphasis upon these\nso-called practical things. And so we are veering around again now to the notion that the\nclassics should be taught, that men should be concerned more with the intangibles; that\neducation is a business of cultivating the heart and soul of man, rather than training him in\nthe mere business of providing food.\n<\/p><p>\nEDUCATION AS A TEACHER OF MAN'S RELATIONSHIP TO GOD\n<\/p><p>\nWhile the pendulum has been swinging from one extreme of educational theory to the other,\nthe Church has had a fairly stabilized view combining the virtues of both. The basic\nconception upon which our system is elaborated is found in section 88 of the D&amp;C, from\nwhich I now read:\n<\/p><p>\nTeach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly\nin theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the\nkingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;\n<\/p><p>\nOf things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things\nwhich are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which\nare abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the\nland; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11891\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11891)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11891)\">D&amp;C 88:78-79<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs I interpret that scripture, it admonishes us in our educational system, first to make sure \nthat we do the things for which the classicists have so strongly contended, namely to teach \nmen in the art of living, and particularly living the highest philosophy rather\nthan to make education the mere instrumentality for getting their bread and butter. The first \nbusiness of education is to establish a proper understanding of man's relationship to the \nuniverse in which he lives, and to the God who created it. Those are the things which are \nessentially laid down here, in the first verse that I have read.\n<\/p><p>\nFollowing upon that is given us a latitude wide enough to accommodate the most vaulting\nambition. There is nothing from which we are barred. The whole wide world of knowledge is\nopen to us, and we are invited to enter in and make it our own. It is this combination of\npurpose and attainments which the educational system fostered by the Church is intended to\ncarry out.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have scores of teachers in our seminaries and our institutes, carrying on the teaching of\nthe eternal values to supplement what is taught in the other schools alongside of which they\nare placed. And at Brigham Young University at Provo, standing at the head of the system,\nwe hope we may train the men that will be the peers of any men who come out from any\ninstitutions of learning in all this broad land.\n<\/p><p>\nINFLUENCE OF GOOD TEACHERS NEEDED\n<\/p><p>\nSomething has been said of the sacrifices which the Authorities of the Church make in\naccepting the positions that come to them. These teachers make their sacrifices, too. The\namount of time and energy which they devote, and the intelligent effort they put forth in\norder to qualify themselves, would, turned into other channels, be vastly more remunerative.\n<\/p><p>\nAnyone who has the intelligence to make a good teacher has enough intelligence, if he wanted\nto direct it in commercial channels, to become vastly more successful financially. I cannot\ndevelop the ideas here, for want of time, that I would like to develop, but I would like to\nmake this plea to you leaders in the wards and stakes of the Church: That you induce the\nparents of the children to make use of these opportunities that are afforded them in the\nseminary system and the institute system of the Church and, for those qualified, in its\nuniversity.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is no use of our building buildings and manning them with teachers, unless students fill\nthe halls. We are living in a day when the influence and power of those men, specialized in\ntheir training and understanding, is needed to assist in the matter of development of character\nand the nurturing of a living faith in our boys and girls, if we will just put them under the\ninfluences that are provided for their convenience. Above all a conviction concerning the\npurpose of life and their own eternal destiny realizable through righteous living and\nconformance to laws of God should be given to the youth of our time.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless these teachers in their unselfish efforts, their earnest devotion, and their\nuntiring endeavors to make the kind of men and women of our boys and girls that we would\nlike to have them be, I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
