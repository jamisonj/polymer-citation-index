Farnsworth, back in 1927, must surely have been inspired of the Lord to develop this remarkable medium of communication. As you know, Brother Farnsworth was a member of the Church.

Some of the benefits, besides listening to the teaching of the gospel, we can receive by merely touching a button include receiving instant reports of local and world events and updates on weather; watching fantasy; exploring geography; living history; enjoying good theater, dance, and music; and experiencing culture from almost every country in the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-effects-of-television.p7\" class=\"\">For these kinds of programs we praise the industry. Unfortunately, however, far too much programming is not wholesome and uplifting but is violent, degrading, and destructive to moral values. This kind of television offends the Spirit of the Lord; therefore, I express a word of warning and caution about such programming.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-effects-of-television.p8\" class=\"\">Good families face very significant challenges in controlling the use of television and videotapes in their homes. I agree with Dr. Victor B.
