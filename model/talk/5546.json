She may have been seventeen\u2014tall, willowy, well dressed, and having a wild reaction to an overdose of drugs. While we watched, she collapsed, and I thought, There is no way this child can survive this experience. I wondered how she had come to this sad situation in her life. Had she not heard the words of the prophets? Had she heard them and laughed as if they were the warnings of men out of touch with the realities of a modern world? Had one of us been negligent in our opportunities to teach her? Had her parents known the truth but not been willing or able to help her understand?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p5\" class=\"\">While waiting in that hospital thinking, pondering, and praying for her, I recalled a principle the Lord teaches us in the 89th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. It is found in the fourth verse:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20142\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20142)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20142)\">D&amp;C 89:4<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p7\" class=\"\">Consider carefully the principle: \u201cI have warned you, and forewarn you, \u2026 by revelation.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p8\" class=\"\">We in this church stand before the world, in all humility and sincerity, and declare that Joseph Smith, Jr., was raised up by the Lord Jesus Christ and appointed to be the mortal instrument through which the doctrines, powers, keys, priesthood, and ordinances were restored to the earth. Since that day there has been a continual flow of revelation through those who have followed as the Lord\u2019s appointed Apostles and prophets.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p9\" class=\"\">Yesterday we sustained Howard W. Hunter as the President of the Church and as the prophet, seer, and revelator. I wonder if we have any concept of the importance of that event. It is worth some pondering and some praying. But let me point out that President Hunter has sat as one of those men who hold this sacred revelatory power for thirty-five years. He whom the Lord has called and we have sustained is not a novice in the principles, process, and practice of receiving divine direction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p10\" class=\"\">There is a question that each of us must deal with in a most solemn and serious way if our lives are to be what the Father of us all would have them be: \u201cWhat is our response when the living prophets declare the mind and the will of the Lord?\u201d This is the test of mankind in every dispensation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p11\" class=\"\">I sat in this tabernacle some years ago as President Joseph Fielding Smith stood at this pulpit. It was the general priesthood meeting of April 1972, the last general conference before President Smith passed away. He said: \u201cThere is one thing which we should have exceedingly clear in our minds. Neither the President of the Church, nor the First Presidency, nor the united voice of the First Presidency and the Twelve will ever lead the Saints astray or send forth counsel to the world that is contrary to the mind and will of the Lord.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-94911_000_025\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[In Conference Report, Apr. 1972, p. 99.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p12\" class=\"\">There came to me that evening a witness of the Spirit that he spoke the truth.

Reuben Clark, Jr., drew a very important distinction concerning revelation from the Lord:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cSome of the General Authorities have had assigned to them a special calling; they possess a special gift; they are sustained as prophets, seers, and revelators, which gives them a special spiritual endowment in connection with their teaching of the people. They have the right, the power, and authority to declare the mind and will of God to his people, subject to the over-all power and authority of the President of the Church.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p15\" class=\"\">President Clark continues: \u201cOthers of the General Authorities are not given this special spiritual endowment and authority covering their teaching; they have a resulting limitation, and the resulting limitation upon their power and authority in teaching applies to every other officer and member of the Church, for none of them is spiritually endowed as a prophet, seer, and revelator.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-94911_000_025\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Quoted in Brent L. Top, Larry E. Dahl, and Walter D. Bowen, <span class=\"emphasis\">Follow the Living Prophets<\/span> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1993), pp. 34\u201335.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p16\" class=\"\">I emphasize that the rest of us do not have that specific power and authority. The Seventy have an endowment that is uniquely theirs; temple presidents and matrons, stake presidents and bishops, as well as fathers and mothers, have an endowment that is uniquely theirs; but none of us has the power, authority, or responsibility that is given to the First Presidency and the Twelve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p17\" class=\"\">You may wonder why I stress this point so strongly. It is because a misunderstanding here can cause us deep pain and can be the means of misleading many others. Those who claim similar powers often declare that they are doing it with purity of heart and with total sincerity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p18\" class=\"\">One\u2019s intentions may be of the purest kind. The sincerity may be total and complete. Nevertheless, pure intentions and heartfelt sincerity do not give members of the Church authority to declare doctrine which is not sustained by the living prophets. While we are members of the Church, we are not authorized to <span class=\"emphasis\">publicly declare<\/span> our speculations as doctrine nor to extend doctrinal positions to other conclusions based upon the reasoning of men and women, even by the brightest and most well-read among us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p19\" class=\"\">The prophets are not only called to receive the doctrine and direct the ordinances through the keys they hold. They are also responsible to keep the saving doctrine pure so that people can hear and feel that doctrine in its sure and certain form.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p20\" class=\"\">Occasionally we have those who become a law unto themselves in these matters. Sadly, their pride leads them down a road which President Spencer W. Kimball warned us about: \u201cApostasy usually begins with question and doubt and criticism. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cThey who garnish the sepulchres of the dead prophets begin now by stoning the living ones. They return to the pronouncements of the dead leaders and interpret them to be incompatible with present programs. They convince themselves that there are discrepancies between the practices of the deceased and the leaders of the present. \u2026 They allege love for the gospel and the Church but charge that leaders are a little \u2018off the beam\u2019! \u2026 Next they say that while the gospel and the Church are divine, the leaders are fallen. Up to this time it may be a passive thing, but now it becomes an active resistance, and frequently the blooming apostate begins to air his views and to crusade. \u2026 He now begins to expect persecution and adopts a martyr complex, and when finally excommunication comes he associates himself with other apostates to develop and strengthen cults. At this stage he is likely to claim revelation for himself, revelations from the Lord directing him in his interpretations and his actions. These manifestations are superior to anything from living leaders, he claims.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-94911_000_025\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">The Teachings of Spencer W.

I fear that we have become so enamored with recreation, with fame and fortune, with videos, with television, and with what money can buy that we have little time for eternal things. We cannot take the time to obtain a knowledge of the doctrines of eternity\u2014for that requires sacrifice, effort, and struggle. Furthermore, we have learned to live in a world of clamor and noise and haste and hurry to the extent that we have often become immune to the Spirit of the Lord and the \u201cpeaceable things of the kingdom.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-94911_000_025\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20067\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20067)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20067)\">D&amp;C 36:2<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p25\" class=\"\">How do we prepare ourselves to be in harmony with the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-revelations-of-heaven.p26\" class=\"\">On one occasion during the Savior\u2019s mortal ministry, he was challenged by those who were opposing him.
