He explained that to the\nrighteous on his right hand he would say: \"Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the\nkingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a\nstranger, and ye took me in: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto\nme.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed\nthee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?\n<\/p><p>\n\"When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have\ndone it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35744\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35744)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35744)\">Matt. 25:34-40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>How to serve God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTo serve God, then, is to serve our fellowmen.\n<\/p><p>\nHow can we serve? Our ability to serve might well be increased through preparation.\n<\/p><p>\nIn seeking education, one should seek to develop those talents that he has that would make\nhim most serviceable to his fellowmen. Therefore, learn to do that which you enjoy doing, the\nthing you are happiest at doing. People like doing that which they do well.\n<\/p><p>\nGive only secondary thought to the monetary advantage of your chosen vocation. As you\nserve others, your joy in serving increases.\n<\/p><p>\nEinstein said: \"It's high time that the ideal of success should be replaced by the ideal of\nservice.\"\n<\/p><p>\nLord Halifax said, \"Service is the rent we pay for our own room on earth.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI like this slogan the Brigham Young University uses: \"Enter to Learn&mdash;Go Forth to Serve.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYour vocation should be to help you serve more fully. If one's education omits the spiritual\nside of life, it is very unbalanced.\n<\/p><p>\nTo know where we came from, why we are here and where we are going is most vital of all\nour learning.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the Church we learn by doing. Knowledge alone is of little value. For this reason the Lord\nhas given opportunities to serve in his kingdom. Each member of the Church may have the\nopportunity to serve in one capacity or another.\n<\/p><p>\nBeing a missionary is a wonderful way of serving. He who fulfills a mission with the idea\nuppermost in his mind to take the glorious message of the gospel to others, giving little\nthought to his own benefits, will have the greatest joy and happiness and success in his work.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay has said, \"Every member a missionary,\" which should give everyone an\nopportunity of serving in the kingdom of our Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nAll the activities of the Church are acts of service. Priesthood is given to us that we might be\nof service to others. There is no such thing as priesthood power that enables\na man to elevate or benefit himself, except as he serves others. He cannot use priesthood for\nhis own benefit. Priesthood is service.\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph Fielding Smith has said: \"No man is independent. Put a man off by himself where he\ncould communicate with none of his fellow beings or receive aid from them, and he would\nperish miserably. It is a mistake to draw within ourselves, as does a snail into its shell. No\nman has been given the Priesthood as an ornament only. He is expected to use it in behalf of\nthe salvation of others.\" (Joseph Fielding Smith, <i>The Way to Perfection<\/i>, p. 218.)\n<\/p><p>\nThen we have the unselfish service rendered by mothers. There is no greater service than\nhonorable motherhood, not just the biological service of motherhood, but the rearing of\nchildren and teaching them the ways of the Lord, teaching them what they should know and\nwhat they should do that they might live with him some day. To me, the greatest title of all is\nthe title of \"Mother.\" The Lord has said, \". . . he that is greatest among you shall be your\nservant\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35738\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35738)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35738)\">Matt. 23:11<\/a><\/span>). What better way to describe motherhood!\n<\/p><p>\nTemples are built, first, that the living might receive the ordinances of sealing of families\ntogether for time and all eternity, that each may serve each other as a family unit; then, that\nwe may take part in that grand and glorious work of service of vicarious work for the dead,\nof sealing families together for time and eternity.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident J. Reuben Clark, Jr., has reminded us, \"In the service of the Lord, it is not where\nyou serve but how.\" (<i>The Improvement Era<\/i>, June 1951, p. 412.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe greatest of all the acts of service was that of Jesus Christ, our Savior, who suffered as he\ndid and gave his life for us, for all mankind, that we might, through our faithfulness, receive\nimmortality and eternal life; not to satisfy the will of Christ alone, but for the will of our\nFather which is in heaven, who has declared, \". . . this is my work and my glory&mdash;to bring\nto pass the immortality and eternal life of man\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39277\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39277)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39277)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen we too must come to that degree of perfection of total service as he did, if we are to\nreceive the great blessings promised of immortality and eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nIf service is the work of God, and if we are to become as he is and return to live with him in\nhis kingdom, our work must be to serve others. There are many ways to serve. Every activity\nof the Church provides an opportunity to serve&mdash;priesthood, Relief Society, genealogy, the\npaying of tithes; all of the auxiliary organizations are mediums through which we may serve.\n<\/p><p>\nWe can serve God by serving our fellowmen and by keeping his commandments. This is the\ngospel of Jesus Christ, and I wish to bear testimony that this gospel has been restored in these\nlatter days by revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and to us today through President David\nO. McKay, who is now the President and Prophet of God in this dispensation. I pray the\nblessings of the Lord on all, that we may learn to do his will and serve him by serving our\nfellowmen; I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
