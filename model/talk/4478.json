He herded sheep much of his life in the rolling hills of Idaho\u2014both his own sheep and sheep for others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p5\" class=\"\">On one bitterly cold winter night, he was herding sheep for another man when a blizzard set in. The sheep bunched together, as sheep do, in the corner of a fenced area, and many died. Many other sheep on surrounding ranches also died that same night because of the weather.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p6\" class=\"\">Though the death of the sheep was no fault of his, James Fugal felt responsible and spent the next several years working and saving to repay the owner for his lost sheep.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p7\" class=\"\">This was the type of deep moral honor and accountability that was fostered by scripture-reading, God-fearing settlers on the early frontier.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p8\" class=\"\">This same desire to live Christian principles was evident in Aurelia Rogers, who was schooled on the plains and founded the Primary organization of the Church. She had a concern for the moral character and social development of children. Leaders of the Primary since Aurelia Rogers have proven to be worthy disciples and continue to teach wholesomeness, virtue, and love for one another as well as to instill a desire to understand and live by traditional values.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p9\" class=\"\">Recently, Sister Haight and I attended a ward sacrament meeting some distance from our home. After the sacrament, we found, to our delight, that the Primary would present the program, the theme being \u201cWe Believe in Being Honest.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p10\" class=\"\">I marveled at the eagerness and interest of these young children as they spoke about the fundamental principles they were learning in Primary of telling the truth, respecting the property of others, being trustworthy, and standing for the right.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p11\" class=\"\">I thought of James Fugal, the humble sheepherder, and how wonderful it was that these children were being taught the same values that made him a man of such noble character.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p12\" class=\"\">As we enjoyed the thoughtful and timely Primary presentation that emphasized these timeless moral and spiritual values, my thoughts seemed to concentrate on the similarity of two important heavenly directed events which we, as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, have special reason to be grateful for: the framing of the Constitution of the United States of America and the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ\u2014each, in a significant way, sustaining the other. In addition to heavenly direction, both would require a membership of honest, virtuous people if their divine purposes were to be realized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p13\" class=\"\">We attribute the rise of the American nation and its survival to two vital factors. First, God aided the efforts of those who established the republic. James Madison, who is considered the father of the Constitution and to whom President Benson referred this morning, wrote, \u201cIt is impossible for the man of pious reflection not to perceive in [the Constitution] a finger of that Almighty hand which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in the [establishing of our republic]\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Federalist,<\/span> no. 37, New York City: Modern Library, n.d., p. 231).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p14\" class=\"\">Second, through righteous conduct and example of its citizens. This is best expressed by Alexander Hamilton, a soldier turned statesman, who wrote that \u201cit seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Federalist,<\/span> no. 1, p. 33).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p15\" class=\"\">The important human attributes needed for this new nation to really become a cooperating and workable republic of separate states would be manifested by a people who demonstrated by their lives a belief and desire to live in a society of justice for all mankind. Likewise, the Lord, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, also recognized that, like the new nation, the restored gospel would have difficulty enduring without men and women of similar integrity and conduct.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p16\" class=\"\">On March 1, 1842, Joseph Smith, at the request of Mr. John Wentworth, editor of a Chicago newspaper, composed thirteen brief statements known as the Articles of Faith, which summarize some of the basic doctrines of the Church. As the concluding statement, the Prophet wrote this inspired code of conduct:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cWe believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul\u2014We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6993\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6993)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6993)\">A of F 1:13<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p18\" class=\"\">What an inspiring description of good people, God-fearing people, people committed to deal justly with mankind! These would be the type of people who could raise up a nation and help it survive, and the kind of people to comprehend the true gospel of Jesus Christ with the needed faith to proclaim it to the inhabitants of the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p19\" class=\"\">We here today, and people throughout the nation and the free world, are indebted to freedom-loving individuals everywhere who had the faith and integrity necessary to build the foundations of our societies upon fundamental moral values. Only in an atmosphere of freedom and trust could values like honesty and integrity truly flourish and thus encourage others to pursue their rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p20\" class=\"\">Therefore, it is with great alarm that we read newspaper accounts and hear daily media reports that describe the decline of moral decency and the erosion of basic ethical conduct. They detail the corrupting influence of dishonesty, from small-time, childish stealing or cheating to major embezzlement, fraud, and misappropriation of money or goods.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p21\" class=\"\">Headlines and feature stories dramatically demonstrate the need for honesty and integrity in family relationships, in business affairs, and in the conduct of government officials and religious ministries. Recent cover stories from major national publications with titles such as \u201cLying in America\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">U. S. News and World Report,<\/span> 23 Feb. 1987) and \u201cWhat Ever Happened to Ethics\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Time,<\/span> 25 May 1987) emphasize the need for public concern over the direction in which we are moving.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p22\" class=\"\">Public virtue, which expects men to rise above self-interest and to act in the public interest with wisdom and courage, was so evident in leaders like George Washington, who, we used to declare, could never tell a lie, and Abraham Lincoln, known as \u201cHonest Abe.\u201d In the past few years we have seen \u201cofficial after official\u2014both on the national and the local political scene\u2014put self-interest \u2026 above the larger public interest. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cMen and women have \u2026 been removed from federal office and even gone to jail in our times because they exceeded the limits set by the framers [of our Constitution and God\u2019s commandments]\u201d (Charles A.

However, some teachers avoid questions of right and wrong or remain neutral or guide children into developing their own values, which is leaving many children morally adrift.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p26\" class=\"\">Many of our youth have either lost the knowledge of what is right and what is wrong or were never taught these basic values. President Harold B. Lee\u2019s classic statement that \u201cthe most important of the Lord\u2019s work that you will ever do will be the work you do within the walls of your own home\u201d is most certainly true today. \u201cOurs is the responsibility as parents to teach our children chastity \u2026 [and not only to be morally clean but to be] faithful [and] valiant, striving to live [all of] the Lord\u2019s commandments\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Strengthening the Home,<\/span> Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1973, pp. 4, 7\u20138).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p27\" class=\"\">Some adults, including public officials and civic leaders, have also been led astray by longings for luxury and leisure.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p28\" class=\"\">The devastation that comes to the families and loved ones of those convicted of crimes such as stealing, fraud, misrepresentation, child abuse, sexual transgression, or other serious crimes is immeasurable. So many sorrows, heartaches, and even broken homes result from a false belief that people can set their own rules and do what they want to do as long as they don\u2019t get caught.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/ethics-and-honesty.p29\" class=\"\">Individuals may deceive and even go undetected or unpunished, but they will not escape the judgments of a just God.
