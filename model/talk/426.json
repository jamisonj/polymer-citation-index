Six days shalt thou labour, and do all\nthy work:\n<\/p><p>\nBut the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any\nwork, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant,\nnor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:\n<\/p><p>\nFor in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is,\nand rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and\nhallowed it (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22600\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22600)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22600)\">Ex. 20:8-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBefore coming to the modern revelation, I should like to say that ancient Israel found that one\nof its most difficult commandments to observe was that of remembering the Sabbath day.\nAfter they were led into captivity, they were among a people who knew not the Sabbath\nwhich they knew, and very soon they began to partake, as we are partaking (and let me say it\nis amazing how we follow round the clock of earlier peoples in our wanderings, or beginning\nof wanderings from the early tenets as they were taught to us) of the sins of those among\nwhom they lived. It came to be, as it is with us, that not alone was the matter one of laboring\non the Sabbath, but it was also one of recreation on the Sabbath. So\nrather trivial regulations (as they seem to us) were made by captive Israel in order to prevent\nancient Israel from breaking the Sabbath.\n<\/p><p>\nTIME FOR RECREATION\n<\/p><p>\nNow on this question of recreation, which I may return to again if I have time, I should like\nto say that there is not much excuse for most of us now to resort to the Sabbath for\nrecreation. Those who labor have a forty hour week, which means that they have Saturdays\noff. They have an eight-hour day, which gives them quite a lot of time either in the morning\nor in the evening, and there is no need whatsoever to resort to the Sabbath day for recreation.\nThere is an abundance of recreation time during the week.\n<\/p><p>\nMODERN REVELATION ON SABBATH\n<\/p><p>\nOn August 7, 1831, the Lord gave to the Prophet, then in Jackson County, Missouri, a\nrevelation which included directions about observing the Sabbath. I am reading from Section\n59:\n<\/p><p>\n\"And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world,\" that is what the\nLord said way back yonder,&mdash;\"that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the\nworld,\"&mdash;that is as true today as it was when the Lord spoke it, for our breaches of the\nSabbath \"spot\" us with the transgression of the world&mdash;\"thou shalt go to the house of prayer\nand offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12640\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12640)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12640)\">D&amp;C 59:9<\/a><\/span>).\nI call your attention to the fact that this\nmeeting in the house of prayer is the only assembly which the Lord authorizes on the Sabbath\nday. We are to go to the house of prayer and \"offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day.\"\n<\/p><p>\nFor verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay\nthy devotions unto the Most High; \n<\/p><p>\nNevertheless thy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days and at all\ntimes;\n<\/p><p>\nBut remember that on this, the Lord's day, thou shalt offer thine oblations and thy\nsacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, and before\nthe Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd on this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared with\nsingleness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or, in other words, that thy joy\nmay be full...\n<\/p><p>\nAnd inasmuch as ye do these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and\ncountenances, not with much laughter, for this is sin, but with a glad heart and a\ncheerful countenance&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nVerily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the fulness of the earth is yours, the\nbeasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which climbeth upon the trees\nand walketh upon the earth;\n<\/p><p>\nYea, and the herb, and the good things which come of the earth, whether for food\nor for rainment, or for houses, or for barns, or for orchards, or for gardens, or for\nvineyards...\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this end\nwere they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess, neither by extortion.\nAnd in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is\nhis wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not\nhis commandments...\n<\/p><p>\nBut learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward,\neven peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.\n<\/p><p>\nI, the Lord, have spoken it, and the Spirit beareth record. Amen\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12642\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12642)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12642)\">D&amp;C 59:9-13,15-17,20-21,23-24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFURTHER INSTRUCTIONS\n<\/p><p>\nIn November 1831, at Hiram, Ohio, in the great revelation dealing with many other things,\nthe Lord referred to the Sabbath again. I am reading from Section 68:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the inhabitants of Zion also shall remember their labors, inasmuch as they are\nappointed to labor, in all faithfulness; for the idler shall be had in remembrance\nbefore the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there are\nidlers among them; and their children are also growing up in wickedness; they also\nseek not earnestly the riches of eternity, but their eyes are full of greediness.\n<\/p><p>\nThese things ought not to be, and must be done away from among them;\nwherefore, let my servant Oliver Cowdery carry these sayings unto the land of\nZion.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd a commandment I give unto them&mdash;that he that observeth not his prayers\nbefore the Lord in the season thereof, let him be had in remembrance before the\njudge of my people.\n<\/p><p>\nThese sayings are true and faithful; wherefore, transgress them not, neither take\ntherefrom.\n<\/p><p>\nBehold, I am Alpha and Omega, and I come quickly. Amen\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12661\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12661)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12661)\">D&amp;C 68:29-35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn a revelation given to the Prophet on December 27, 1832, I am reading from Section 88, the\nLord said:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of\nwisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even\nby study and also by faith.\n<\/p><p>\nOrganize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a\nhouse of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house\nof glory, a house of order, a house of God;\n<\/p><p>\nThat your incomings may be in the name of the Lord; that your outgoings may be\nin the name of the Lord; that all your salutations may be in the name of the Lord,\nwith uplifted hands unto the Most High.\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, cease from all your light speeches, from all laughter, from all your\nlustful desires, from all your pride and light-mindedness, and from all your wicked\ndoings (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12695\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12695)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12695)\">D&amp;C 88:118-121<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOn another occasion the Lord said to the Prophet, and I am reading from Section 90, given at\nKirtland, Ohio, March 8, 1833:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd set in order the churches, and study and learn, and become acquainted with\nall good books, and with languages, tongues, and people\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12702\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12702)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12702)\">D&amp;C 90:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd at Winter Quarters, President Brigham Young\ndeclared \"The Word and Will of the Lord\":\n<\/p><p>\nLet him that is ignorant learn wisdom by humbling himself and calling upon the\nLord his God, that his eyes may be opened that he may see, and his ears opened\nthat he may hear;\n<\/p><p>\nFor my Spirit is sent forth into the world to enlighten the humble and contrite, and\nto the condemnation of the ungodly\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12756\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12756)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12756)\">D&amp;C 136:32-33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI have read these commandments regarding what should be done and what might be done on\nthe Sabbath, and I have noted that the Lord told them to build a house of prayer into which\nthey should go to learn the things which I have read to you.\n<\/p><p>\nACTIVITIES AT HOME AND ABROAD\n<\/p><p>\nNow, the ancient Israelites, as I have already told you, had a great many rules and\nregulations regarding what they might do on the Sabbath day. They found it necessary to\ndraw distinctions between what they might do in their homes and what they might do when\nthey were abroad.\n<\/p><p>\nThis raised difficulties. So in order to give a little more scope to their home activities, they\nmade a rule, a regulation, that if they were in a street that was a cul-de-sac (closed at one\nend), each household along the street would contribute a handful of meal, and out of this meal\nthey would make a cake, and then they would hang up this cake at the end, the open end of\nthe street, and thus all the street became part of the household of this whole group. If the\nstreet was open, they did the same thing by hanging a cake at each end of the street where\nthey lived.\n<\/p><p>\nMy reason for making that explanation is that I think there is a difference between what we\nmay do in our homes and what we may go abroad to do.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has told us what we may do in the house of prayer, and what we may do in the\nhouse of prayer we may do, I take it, in our homes. We may seek learning. We may read\ngood books. We may acquaint ourselves with languages, tongues, and people.\n<\/p><p>\nI call your attention again to the fact that the only places of gathering to which we are\nauthorized to go, the only gatherings we are authorized to attend, are the meetings in the\nhouse of prayer. No other gathering is authorized on the Sabbath.\n<\/p><p>\nI think we may listen to good music in the home. I do not think we may go joy riding, nor to\nbeach parties, nor on picnics! Nowadays, as this conference is witnessing throughout this\nvalley and in adjacent areas, you may have what we may call movies right in your home. We\nshall have them tomorrow, Sunday. I think there is a great difference between looking at a\ngood movie in your home and going to a movie house, a very great difference. But the home\nmovies we look at should be of a kind that teach things specified in the revelations as in order\nin the house of prayer.\n<\/p><p>\nSome of you are using in your Sunday Schools visual aids which in fact are frequently\nonly movies. But their character should be carefully guarded, and I am sure they will be, that\nnothing be shown that does not contribute to the learning we may get in the house of prayer,\nfor in Sunday School you are in the house of prayer. You will then be gaining the knowledge\nwhich the Lord said should be gained in the house of prayer. But that gives you no license to\ngo to commercial movies on Sunday, because we are not authorized to go to such gatherings.\nI think there is a sharp distinction in this matter.\n<\/p><p>\nHORSE RACING\n<\/p><p>\nOf course, I do not suppose there is any need of my even mentioning, though perhaps it\nmight be well for me to mention, that horse racing on Sunday is not a proper place for a\nLatter-day Saint to be. They have a good deal of it, they tell me, in the southern part of the\nstate. I have been in touch with some of the officers and know how difficult they think it is to\nhandle. If you Latter-day Saints cannot stay away from horse racing and betting on Sunday, I\nam not sure how much the Lord is going to listen to your prayers about some other things\nthat you very much desire. Of course, we may not gamble at any time or in any place.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I am merely making some suggestions to you as to what I think are sharp lines of\ndistinction. I think you may do anything in your home on Sunday or in the house of prayer\non Sunday which the Lord has said you might do, and the words of the Lord in the\nrevelations to which I have referred will tell you what you may do in the house of prayer.\n<\/p><p>\nBLESSINGS OF SABBATH OBSERVANCE\n<\/p><p>\nNow, may the Lord help us to observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy, because, as I read to\nyou at the very beginning, this commandment regarding the Sabbath was given, among other\nreasons, \"that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12641\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12641)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12641)\">D&amp;C 59:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then there follow along in that same revelation all the things which the Lord has given to\nus from the earth, and to me those things are recited by the Lord as showing what we are\nentitled to if we keep the Sabbath.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord help us keep the Sabbath I humbly pray, adding my testimony to those that\nhave been borne regarding the truth of this great work, the divinity of the mission of Joseph\nSmith, the sonship of Jesus, that we have the restored gospel and the restored priesthood. That\nthe Lord will bless us, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
