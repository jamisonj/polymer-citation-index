It is your duty to provide adequately for your family. You must prepare yourself for this responsibility and have the ambition to see that it is accomplished. Your wife should live her life with the comforting assurance that so long as you are healthy and well you will take care of her first above all others. She should not be forced into the labor market unless you become incapacitated.

Next to eternal life, the greatest of all gifts that our Father in heaven can bestow on a man is the opportunity of being blessed with sons and daughters. Every healthy and normal son of God should have the joy of bestowing the following gifts on his children:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/father-your-role-your-responsibility.p37\" class=\"\">First, an honored and respected name. I will be eternally grateful to a father who thought enough of me to give me his name. It was a name of honor and respect in the community in which I grew up. It carried before it the title of bishop from the time I was six months old until just a few months before I left to go on my mission. How proud I was of his service. I was pleased that he had the patience to involve me in his responsibilities. Working on a welfare farm, cleaning the chapel, balancing ward financial records, carrying a sack of flour to a widow, etc., were a part of my early life. I was with him so much I received the nickname of \u201cBishop.\u201d I attempted to wear it with pride and honor. It had the effect of making me reach a little higher. I wanted to try to be on the same plane as my father. Should not every child have the same opportunity?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/father-your-role-your-responsibility.p38\" class=\"\">Fathers, is it not your obligation to give your children an honored and respected name?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/father-your-role-your-responsibility.p39\" class=\"\">Second, every child needs a sense of security. I often think of the security of our old family home. It was a fortress against the adversary. Each morning and evening it was blessed by the priesthood as we would kneel in family prayer. That power was also manifest as my father blessed his family in time of need.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/father-your-role-your-responsibility.p40\" class=\"\">Fathers, is it not your obligation to give your children a home blessed with the power of the priesthood?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/father-your-role-your-responsibility.p41\" class=\"\">Third, an opportunity for development. My children taught me a great lesson one day. We had moved from California to New York where I had accepted an employment opportunity and we were in the process of finding a new home. We started close to the city, but each day that passed we would move further out to find a home more suited to our needs. In Connecticut we found just the one. It was a beautiful home nestled in New England\u2019s radiant forests. We were all pleased with the selection. The final test before making an offer for purchase was to ride the train into New York to check out the commuting time. I made the trip and returned very discouraged. The trip required an hour and a half each way. I returned to the motel where my family was waiting for me and gave them the choice of having a father or this new home. Much to my surprise, they said, \u201cWe will take the home. You are not around much anyway.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/father-your-role-your-responsibility.p42\" class=\"\">The shock of that statement was overwhelming to me. If that statement was true, I needed to repent fast. My children deserved a father. Is it not our obligation as fathers to spend as much time as possible with our children, to teach them honesty, industry, and morality?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/father-your-role-your-responsibility.p43\" class=\"\">Fourth, give your children the opportunity of having a joyful, happy childhood.
