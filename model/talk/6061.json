I quote from President Joseph F. Smith: \u201cJesus had not finished his work when his body was slain, neither did he finish it after his resurrection from the dead; although he had accomplished the purpose for which he then came to the earth, he had not fulfilled all his work. And when will he? Not until he has redeemed and saved every son and daughter of our father Adam that have been or ever will be born upon this earth to the end of time. \u2026 That is his mission. We will not finish our work until we have saved ourselves, and then not until we shall have saved all depending upon us; for we are to become saviors upon Mount Zion, as well as Christ. We are called to this mission. The dead are not perfect without us, neither are we without them.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote30-98905_000_017\">30<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Joseph F.
