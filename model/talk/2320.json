Being a grandfather of 14, I have learned to love grandchildren.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p4\" class=\"\">I am reminded of the grandfather who got on the airplane. As he went down the aisle looking for a seat, he came to an attractive woman, and he said, \u201cAre you a grandmother?\u201d And she said, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d So he passed her up. He went on and repeated it again. Finally he asked a lady, \u201cAre you a grandmother?\u201d And she said, \u201cNo, I am not.\u201d He said, \u201cMay I sit down?

Our faith and prayers were answered, and I want to thank all of my brethren here and all of my friends and others who joined with us in their faith and prayers for her recovery. She is listening from her hospital bed. I would like to take just a moment to tell her how much I love her. She has been a wonderful companion for 49 years this month. She has been an inspiration to me all the days that we have been married. She has been a fine mother and grandmother. We are looking forward to her return from the hospital.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p7\" class=\"\">The apostle Paul tells us: \u201c\u2026 faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24420\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24420)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24420)\">Heb. 11:1<\/a><\/span>.) Faith and belief have been used synonymously, and it is sometimes difficult for us to differentiate between the two. There <span class=\"emphasis\">is <\/span>a difference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p8\" class=\"\">We cannot have faith without belief, but we can believe without having faith.

Faith is trusting in our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p9\" class=\"\">The scriptures contain many assurances of salvation to those who exercise faith and obey the commandments.

Faith is the motivating force that impels action.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p10\" class=\"\">In <span class=\"citation\" id=\"26256\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26256)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26256)\">James 2:20<\/a><\/span> we read: \u201cBut wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p11\" class=\"\">Many believe that God will provide, but we cannot sit idly by and expect to get results. The Lord requires us to work for that which we seek. If we do our part and exercise faith, then we are promised he will help us in all our righteous undertakings. However, if we do not do our part, how can we expect the help of our Heavenly Father? Our late President David O. McKay said, \u201cThe rich rewards come only to the strenuous strugglers.\u201d In other words, to those who not only have faith but are willing to work and sacrifice in order to achieve their goals.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p12\" class=\"\">Some may ask, \u201cHow do we gain faith?\u201d The answer is that we gain faith just as we gain any other attribute. We must first establish a foundation, and then cultivate our thoughts and actions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p13\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith said: \u201cFaith comes by hearing the word of God, through the testimony of the servants of God. \u2026\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Documentary History of the Church, <\/span>vol. 3, p. 379.) Our very presence in meetings of this conference will tend to increase our faith because we come here with a desire to learn and to worship, to be motivated, and to be spiritually uplifted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p14\" class=\"\">I testify to all within the sound of my voice that my attendance at general conferences over a period of many years, hearing the testimonies of our leaders here and in other places, has constantly increased my faith and helped me to build a strong testimony as to the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p15\" class=\"\">Partaking of the sacrament administered by those having authority is a great aid to faith. The broken bread symbolizes the broken flesh of our Redeemer, and the holy cup represents his atoning blood. Reading the scriptures nurtures faith. Earnest prayer is essential to increasing one\u2019s faith. Prayer is vocalized faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p16\" class=\"\">Right living is the greatest of all faith builders. Sin is the greatest of all faith destroyers. Even small sins destroy faith. Vanity, pride, selfishness, greed, and hatred wound the fine spirit of God which nurtures and gives life to faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p17\" class=\"\">Ceaseless striving to find the bright light of living faith purifies the heart, strengthens the will, and develops sterling character.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p18\" class=\"\">The constant exercise of our faith by lofty thinking, prayer, devotion, and acts of righteousness is just as essential to spiritual health as physical exercise is to the health of the body. Like all priceless things, faith, if lost, is hard to regain. Eternal vigilance is the price of our faith. In order to retain our faith we must keep ourselves in tune with our Heavenly Father by living in accordance with the principles and ordinances of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p19\" class=\"\">Moses exercised faith when he led the children of Israel out of bondage. The Lord instructed him what to do, and he had faith that it could be done. He gathered the Israelites and proceeded on the journey.

They left their homes and most of their worldly belongings. Some of them left their families and friends to follow the Church leaders to an unknown land. The reason was obvious: they had great faith.

In our impatience, we wonder why God does not reveal himself in majesty and glory, that the whole world might instantly be brought to their knees to worship him. But when we think intelligently about the matter, we understand that God\u2019s slow, patient way of converting the world is best. When people are required to believe largely upon the testimony of others, they are compelled to grip the threads of truth firmly and hold on until they can develop strong faith. God\u2019s plan makes it necessary for us to nurture, cultivate, and enlarge our faith. In this long, patient process of developing our faith, we acquire fortitude and strength of character. These sterling qualities are of eternal worth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p39\" class=\"\">I have been thrilled with the faith manifested by many of our recently returned prisoners of war.

This is in such contrast to those who have protested everything our leaders have done to bring about the release of our prisoners and to reunite them with their families. I am sure we all feel grateful that this has been accomplished, and join together in giving thanks to our Heavenly Father for these great blessings. Our prayers and love are extended to all of these men, that they might get reestablished in the stream of life; that they might have joy in their labors and continue to show love for their God, their families, their country, and their fellowmen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p41\" class=\"\">There has never been a time in our lives, the history of the Church, or the history of our nation, when there existed a greater need for faith than today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p42\" class=\"\">We need faith in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, faith in our church leaders, faith in America, faith in ourselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/the-constant-exercise-of-our-faith.p43\" class=\"\">I conclude by bearing my witness as to the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
