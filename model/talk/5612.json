As I have witnessed the inspired manner in which President Gordon B. Hinckley fulfilled his calling as a counselor to Presidents Spencer W. Kimball, Ezra Taft Benson, and finally to Howard W. Hunter\u2014during their periods of declining health\u2014I rejoice with you in sustaining him as God\u2019s anointed prophet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p4\" class=\"\">With all the inspiration and love that I possess, I testify that Gordon B. Hinckley was foreordained to become the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; to be the mouthpiece of God on the earth at this time; and to lead God\u2019s people as prophet, seer, and revelator.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p5\" class=\"\">President Hinckley\u2019s calling Thomas S. Monson to continue in his effective administration in the First Presidency, now as First Counselor, and James E. Faust\u2019s call as Second Counselor, is inspired.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p6\" class=\"\">President Monson has demonstrated an unusual ability to lead and inspire others\u2014whether members of this church or other non-Church organizations\u2014in their desire to serve the Master. As a newly called Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles twenty-five years ago, my assignments were chaired by then Elder Thomas S. Monson. He was my kind but effective teacher\u2014schooling me in a more clear understanding of the worldwide mission of the Church and the duties and blessings available to a newly called servant of God. He was most effective and kind to me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p7\" class=\"\">President James E. Faust has impressed me not only with his abilities, experience, and knowledge of this divine work, but as a valued friend and adviser sitting next to me in our council meetings for these many years. He is gifted with an abundance of wisdom and uncommon spiritual direction and discernment that will be a blessing to the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p8\" class=\"\">These words of the prophet Alma are most appropriate at this time:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd this is the manner after which they were ordained\u2014being called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works; \u2026 therefore they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly great faith, are called with a holy calling\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10121\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10121)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10121)\">Alma 13:3<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p10\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, \u201cEvery man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the Grand Council of heaven before this world was.\u201d The Prophet Joseph continued, \u201cI suppose I was ordained to this very office in that Grand Council\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> p. 365).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p11\" class=\"\">President Gordon B.

God\u2019s hand directs this work. He prepares His servants. He knows their hearts. He knows the end from the beginning and raises up those servants who will carry out His designs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p13\" class=\"\">These are able, humble leaders, called by God to preside over His earthly kingdom in these last days. They are true and faithful servants, tested and refined by extreme circumstances. They are teachers and preachers of righteousness, examples to the world of goodness and obedience to God\u2019s commandments. We all would do well\u2014for ourselves and our posterity\u2014to heed their counsel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p14\" class=\"\">As an early Apostle, Elder Orson Hyde, said: \u201cIt is invariably the case, that when an individual is ordained and appointed to lead the people, he has passed through tribulations and trials, and has proven himself before God, and before His people, that he is worthy of the [position] which he holds. \u2026 Some one that understands the Spirit and counsel of the Almighty \u2026 is the [one] that will lead the Church\u201d (in <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 1:123).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p15\" class=\"\">No man better understands the Church, nor is better known to the members of the Church, than President Gordon B.

His parents set lofty examples and taught him how to work and to finish a task, which inspired him to attain a good education and a desire to serve mankind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p23\" class=\"\">He accepted the challenges of missionary work and gained the blessings of sharing the gospel with others when called as a missionary to England.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p24\" class=\"\">New talents were developed as he assisted his mission president in London in developing Church publicity for the media and for the members of the Church and for the world. That interest has continued throughout his years and continues on, of course, to the present day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p25\" class=\"\">His responsibilities in the Church missionary program added new methods and opportunities to proclaim gospel principles, and he was instrumental in expanding missionary work, particularly throughout the vast, teeming Orient in a most remarkable way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p26\" class=\"\">He has participated in the dedication and rededication of more temples than any other presiding officer in the Church. That is not only indicative of his love for temple work, but reflects the necessity for us to be actively involved in the work of redeeming our deceased ancestors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p27\" class=\"\">President Hinckley\u2019s marriage to his sweetheart, Marjorie Pay, added spiritual strength and increased desire to advance our Lord\u2019s work. She has been a most inspiring companion for nearly fifty-eight years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p28\" class=\"\">President Hinckley is not only a man for all seasons\u2014but for all the world!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p29\" class=\"\">He has usually been our spokesman in meeting representatives of governments and major worldwide organizations who come to pay their respects and honor to the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p30\" class=\"\">At a recent civic dinner honoring President Hinckley, the master of ceremonies said of him: \u201cIt is understandable that [members of the Church] worldwide always express their affection for you. All of us [here] hope the honor, tribute and love expressed this evening \u2026 from [those of] diverse churches and creeds will imbue you and yours with special fond memories to help comfort and inspire you for a lifetime\u201d (Dr. Nick S.

Hunter has come to a close. He loved the Lord and His work\u2014and we know that the Lord loved him. President Hunter taught us how to be more gentle, kinder, and more caring, and more worthy in our pursuit to become more Christlike.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/sustaining-a-new-prophet.p32\" class=\"\">And we now begin a new era of Church administration under President Gordon B.
