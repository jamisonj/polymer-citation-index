Any other type of religion will be cluttered with the apathy and\nmisconcepts of human wisdom. Here is a power that can lead to the highest pinnacle of\nachievement in mortality and to exaltation in immortality.\n<\/p><p>\nThe world gropes today for that direction which the Apostle Paul called:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . not . . . the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5149\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5149)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5149)\">2 Tim. 1:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOur civilization today is often referred to as a godless one, primarily because of the\nascendancy of worldly learning and the diminishing influence of faith or conviction; but it is\nnot a total loss of faith that we need fear, but rather a weakening of conviction, the watering\ndown of devotion which is taking place.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Philip E. Jacob, Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania and author\nof 'Changing Values in College,' says: 'The vast majority of today's college students profess\nbelief in God. But there is a \"ghostly quality\" to their religion. It is divorced from present-day\nconcerns, lacking in social responsibility.' Another survey, the Cornell University Values\nStudy, found: '. . . little or no evidence of \"absolute conviction or adherence\" and ended by\ncalling student belief 'secular religion.'\" (<i>This Week<\/i>, James DeFoe, \"God on the Campus,\"\nMarch 8, 1964, p. 6.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Tobacco is not good for man\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn February of 1833, the Prophet Joseph Smith made a statement to the world which\nwe believe was inspired of God. That statement concerned the harmful effects in the use of\ntobacco on the human body (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14444\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14444)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14444)\">D&amp;C 89:8<\/a><\/span>).\nHis declaration was not made with any malice toward anyone\nbut simply as a benefit to mankind (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14438\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14438)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14438)\">D&amp;C 89:2-3<\/a><\/span>).\nNow, after 130 years, we in our\npresent civilization have progressively reached a verdict concerning the deadly effect of this\nnarcotic.\n<\/p><p>\nAs a Prophet of God, Joseph Smith was led by divine inspiration and\nheavenly direction to make other statements, many of which are more far-reaching than the\none referred to. All have been for the benefit of mankind.\n<\/p><p>\nOne in particular, which is closely related with faith and conviction, he reiterated many times,\nas recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants of the Church. In June of 1829, nearly four years\nbefore he made the statement concerning the deadly effect of tobacco, he proclaimed these\nwords as they had been revealed to him from the Lord: \". . . the thing which will be of the\nmost worth unto you will be to declare repentance\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14370\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14370)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14370)\">D&amp;C 16:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Recognizing Right and Wrong<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the need of America! This is the need of the world! In the face of such urgency, it is\ntimely to ask, how shall we face this problem? First, there is necessity for a changed attitude\nin recognizing the difference between right and wrong. If we cannot recognize this difference,\nthen we cannot know what to repent of. To live in a society that does not recognize the\nvolitional right of choice in two opposites, of choosing right over wrong, can only bring the\nmasses to a state of decay. There seems no question that it is the will of the \"evil one\" that\nour choices in life or the exercise of agency shall be in behalf of one of two evils, rather than\nin right over wrong. I quote from a challenging editorial of a leading weekly magazine:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . one of the leading newspapers in London&mdash;published on August 8 a remarkable\neditorial entitled 'The New Morality.' It was prompted by the sex and spy scandals which\nhave stirred the indignation not only of the people of Great Britain, but also of the people of\nother countries. [Primarily because such modern behavior is not limited in its scope to these\nscandals.]\n<\/p><p>\n\"What is significant, however, is the manner in which 'The Telegraph' questions the attitude\namong so many intellectuals toward right and wrong.\n<\/p><p>\n\"In America today, for instance, we are being told that, if the end sought is good, it is not\nunmoral to break the law.\" (By permission <i>U.S. News and World Report<\/i>, August 26, 1963,\nDavid Lawrence, p. 104.)\n<\/p><p>\nBut Thomas Aquinas wrote that a good intention does not justify an evil. He said: \"A man\ncannot rightly steal because he intends to use the money for a good purpose&mdash;to help the\npoor.\"\n<\/p><p>\nExemplifying the modern trend, Canon Rhymes of England calls explicitly for a \"new moral\ncode\" based upon sympathy for the different needs of individuals. These needs may require\nthat individuals \"may need to break all Ten Commandments.\" In turn, the old morality, as it is\nnow being spoken of, would have condemned such needs; the new morality, says he, must\nrespect in them its own essence.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom the classroom, from some Christian pulpits, and from the politician's platform we are\nhearing today&mdash;\"all is right\" or rather whatever is done must be right. We see the manifest\nevidence of this tirelessly endorsing whatever actually occurs. Lord Silkin, for instance,\napparently distressed at the number of \"<i>Irregular marriages<\/i>,\" recently sought to remedy the\nsituation by calling them <i>regular<\/i>. A Ministry of Education's medical officer describes\n<i>unchastity<\/i> as not in his view \"<i>unchaste<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThus this supposedly new-found morality in our modern day destroys the efficacy of good\nover bad or of right over wrong. The immutable law of God that man becomes like unto him\nin knowing the difference between right and wrong or good and evil is lost in the subterfuge\nof man's unwillingness to repent.\n<\/p><p>\nIn this regard, William Hard writes of a \"split personality\" in America. I quote:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Clearly we have achieved a split personality. We are having a religious revival and a moral\ndecline.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I think it clear that we have not succeeded adequately in fusing 'worship' and 'the world.'\nWe have not succeeded adequately in fusing ritual and righteousness.\n<\/p><p>\n\"If a nation would achieve righteousness,\" challenges William Hard, \"<i>let it first achieve repentance.<\/i>\"\n(<i>Reader's Digest<\/i>, William Hard, \"How Law Abiding Are We&mdash;Really?\" May\n1959, pp. 39-41.)\nIn a washed-down type of conviction, we see the image of the unrepentant church member\nspoken of by Samuel Miller, Dean of the Harvard Divinity School:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Men who want to be sure that their goodness pays or that there will be a newspaper notice of\ntheir heroism, or that there is some profit in believing in God, simply do not know what faith\nis.\" (<i>Look<\/i>, Samuel Miller, \"What Can I Believe,\" Dec. 19, 1961, p. 9('.)\n<\/p><p>\n<i>What then is the greatest need of our present day<\/i>? Is it not what a prophet of God has\nproclaimed it to be, that the thing that will be of the greatest worth unto us in this modern\nday is to recognize and appropriate the principle of <i>repentance<\/i>?\n<\/p><p>\nIn the areas of mental illness, O. Hobart Mowrer of the University of Illinois makes this\nstatement concerning the benefit derived from repentance on persons that are emotionally\nfrustrated. He says when a person \"begins to accept his guilt and his sinfulness, the possibility\nof radical reformation opens up; and with this, the individual may legitimately, though not\nwithout pain and effort, pass from deep, pervasive self-rejection and self-torture to a new\nfreedom, of self-respect and peace.\" (<i>The American Psychologist<\/i>, O. Hobart Mowrer, \"Sin:\nthe Lesser of Two Evils,\" p. 304.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>First Principles; First Ordinances<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOne of our Articles of Faith, the content of which establishes the first principles of the gospel\nof Jesus Christ, reads as follows:\n<\/p><p>\n\"We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord\nJesus Christ; second, <i>Repentance<\/i>; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins;\nfourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6801\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6801)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6801)\">A of F 1:4<\/a><\/span>, italics added).\n<\/p><p>\nMay we concern ourselves briefly with that phase of this article which the Prophet Joseph\nSmith has declared repeatedly to be of the most worth unto us, that of <i>repentance<\/i>, which is\nthe forerunner of conviction.\n<\/p><p>\nThe agency of man is not a power to be left dormant or itself to be moved upon solely by\nexterior forces for good or evil. Man, if we understand the true meaning and purpose of\nagency, is to be an agent unto himself, assuming the prerogative of acting as a result of his\nown volition. Speaking of this the Lord has said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled . . .\nthe same is . . . not a wise servant . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their\nown free will . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14395\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14395)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14395)\">D&amp;C 58:26-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFor man to know good and evil, which characterizes him as being in the way to become like\nunto God, and then by virtue of choice or agency choose the good rather than the evil, he\nexperiences the crowning achievement of inward mastery. In the exercise of true repentance,\nwe vindicate unto ourselves the calling and work of Jesus Christ, for without repentance there\nis no real purpose to his mission. Here lies the measuring stick of achievement in earth life\nprobation.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Repentance, Basic Principle of Growth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nRepentance, therefore, is a basic principle of our Christian faith; for, if a man has a desire in\nhis heart to know the truth, the normal and positive reaction causes him to know that he has\nparticipated in acts that are wrong and therefore sinful. In this respect, all are in need of\nrepentance. The Apostle James says that if we say we have no need of repentance, we are\nliars, and the truth is not in us (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1070\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1070)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1070)\">1 Jn. 1:8<\/a><\/span>).\nIt can be our misfortune if we fail to recognize the difference\nbetween right and wrong.\n<\/p><p>\nRepentance leads to conviction, but is also unalterably connected with forgiveness; and when\nforgiveness flows into our consciousness, we experience a feeling of great joy, a release of\ntension and frustration. The Lord has supplied the simple panacea to\nhappiness through repentance.\n\"By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins&mdash;behold, he will <i>confess them<\/i> and\n<i>forsake them<\/i>\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14397\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14397)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14397)\">D&amp;C 58:43<\/a><\/span>, italics added).\n<\/p><p>\nThere should be no discrimination against that man or woman who may have done wrong in\nhis or her life. Wrong as it may be, unless it is the unpardonable sin, is not always the\ntragedy. The real tragedy is when one fails to rise above a weakness&mdash;to expose that\nweakness to the light so that emotional stress and the dishonor of sin may be banished\nforever. The unhappiest people in the world are those who try to hide their sins and then\nstubbornly will not repent and forsake their ways of wrong.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Forgiveness<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI recall several years ago, in line with my responsibilities as a bishop of the Church, of\ncounseling with a middle-aged married couple. Their lives were not happy ones. They wanted\nto go forward in the Church, but something seemed to mar the way. I finally concluded to\ntalk with each one separately. After a short while, with great difficulty, the wife told me of a\ntransgression in her life which took place during the first week of her marriage. After this\nterrible mistake, she resolutely tried to save her marriage by hiding her sin, and these many\nyears had not told a soul of this single instance. She succeeded in keeping their marriage,\nlargely because of the sterling worth of her fine husband; but there had built up inside of her,\nbecause of the sin she had kept hidden, such an emotional stress that she could not find\nhappiness.\n<\/p><p>\nHere then, I determined, was the cause for the lack of complete happiness. What was she to\ndo? I said to her that when she felt up to it she should confide completely in her husband and\nseek his forgiveness. At first she exclaimed, \"I could never do that!\" But somehow she got up\nthe courage to do it after biding her time. The husband, of course, was shocked; but he\nforgave her; and this brought peace and happiness to that home.\n<\/p><p>\nLater this woman sought me out to express her gratitude. She said, as I recall, \"I have never\nbeen so peaceful and happy in my life.\" And the husband, how did he feel? Well, I do not\nknow fully; but I do recall his words to me upon a later occasion, when he said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"The thing that provokes me is that she did not tell me this years ago. I would have forgiven\nher then, just the same as I do now.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI have always been impressed with the fine sensitivity of right that existed in a man that I\nknew, who, upon his deathbed, sought not to face his Maker with a lie on his lips even\nthough that falsehood which he had perpetrated against a friend was in his youth. This wrong\nhad stayed with him all his life.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen sins are committed, emotional stress is the result. The inward machinery is thrown out\nof calibration. There is only one way to get a release from it&mdash;<i>and this is through repentance<\/i>.\nTrue repentance, may I repeat, is \"When a man repenteth . . . behold, he will <i>confess [his sins]<\/i>,\nand <i>forsake them<\/i>.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14398\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14398)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14398)\">D&amp;C 58:43<\/a><\/span>, italics added).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"I will remember them no more\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nUnder these circumstances, where the forsaking element is positive and sure, the Lord has\nsaid: \"Behold, he who has repented of his sins, [and forsaken them] the same is forgiven, and\nI, the Lord, remember them no more\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14396\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14396)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14396)\">D&amp;C 58:42<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Conviction of Truth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTo conclude my remarks let me say, what men need today is conviction&mdash;yes, conviction in\na cause of truth. This we can attain through the doorway of repentance, which leads to the\nnoble life. That person who cannot recognize right over wrong and then by agency choose the\nright will not see the face of God our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nEdward Martin wrote a poem which could help us to make the decision. He called it, \"My\nName Is Legion.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Within my earthly temple there's a crowd;<br \/>\n       There's one of us that's humble, one that's proud,<br \/>\nThere's one that's broken-hearted for his sins,<br \/>\n       There's one that unrepentant sits and grins;<br \/>\n       There's one that loves his neighbor as himself,<br \/>\n       And one that cares for naught but fame and pelf.<br \/>\n       From much corroding care I should be free<br \/>\n       If I could once determine which is me.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;       (<i>Masterpieces of Religious Verse<\/i>, New York, Harper Brothers, 1948, p. 274.)\n<\/p><p>\nWalter Malone in speaking of hope, which could be the ever-present opportunity of knowing\nthe difference between good and evil and then to seek with positive desire to choose the good,\nhas said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"They do me wrong who say I come no more<br \/>\n       When once I knock and fail to find you in;<br \/>\n       . . .

This they have done and are\ndoing today in nearly every country in the world by the power of <i>conviction<\/i> and the voice of\ntestimony.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is to be hoped and prayed for that civilization today will heed this call, and that 130 years\nmore will not be needed to render a verdict in its behalf.\n<\/p><p>\nI have spoken today of but one phase of the Fourth Article of Faith of The Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\n\"We believe . . . in repentance . . .\" as it is associated with faith and baptism by immersion\nfor the remission of sins and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6802\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6802)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6802)\">A of F 1:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI bear my testimony of the need of strong convictions and of positive action in forsaking ways\nof error, of recognizing the issue of right and wrong, and then, through repentance, of\nchoosing the right.
