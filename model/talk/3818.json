This hospital, like almost every other in the land, was undergoing a massive expansion. Behind the desk where the receptionist sat was a magnificent plaque which bore an inscription of thanks to donors who had made possible the expansion. The name of each donor who had contributed $100,000 appeared in a flowing script, etched on an individual brass placard suspended from the main plaque by a glittering chain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/anonymous.p4\" class=\"\">The names of the benefactors were well known. Captains of commerce, giants of industry, professors of learning\u2014all were there. I felt gratitude for their charitable benevolence. Then my eyes rested on a brass placard which was different\u2014it contained no name. One word, and one word only, was inscribed: \u201cAnonymous.\u201d I smiled and wondered who the unnamed contributor could have been.

A favorite of mine is Charles Dickens\u2019\u201dA Christmas Carol.\u201d I can picture the trembling Ebenezer Scrooge seeing in vision the return of his former partner, Jacob Marley, though Jacob had been dead for seven years. The words of Marley penetrate my very soul, as he laments, \u201cNot to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life\u2019s opportunity misused!

He remembered the plight of the Bob Cratchit family, arranged with a lad to purchase the giant turkey (the size of a boy), and sent the gift to the Cratchits. Then, with supreme joy, the reborn Ebenezer Scrooge exclaims to himself, \u201cHe shan\u2019t know who sends it.\u201d (\u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d p. 481.)

It didn\u2019t really matter that he was Alfred Vanderbilt, the American multimillionaire. He did not give of worldly treasure; he gave his life. Said Emerson, \u201cRings and other jewels are not gifts, but apologies for gifts.

Acts of bravery and feats of heroism were in evidence that day, the most dramatic of which was one witnessed by the pilot of a rescue helicopter. The rescue rope was lowered to a struggling survivor. Rather than grasping the lifeline to safety, the man tied the line to another, who was then lifted to safety. The rope was lowered again, and yet another was saved. Five were rescued from the icy waters. Among them was not found the anonymous hero. Unknown by name, \u201che left the vivid air signed with his honor.\u201d (Stephen Spender, \u201cI think continually of those\u2014\u201d in <span class=\"emphasis\">Masterpieces of Religious Verse,<\/span> ed.

While doing so, an elderly patient in a wheelchair spoke aloud the words, \u201cI\u2019m cold.\u201d Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, one of the young men walked over to her, removed his own jacket, placed it about the patient\u2019s shoulders, gave her a loving pat on the arm, and then returned to the sacrament table. The sacred emblems were then blessed and passed to the assembled patients.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/anonymous.p19\" class=\"\">Following the meeting, I said to the young man, \u201cWhat you did here today I shall long remember.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/anonymous.p20\" class=\"\">He replied, \u201cI worried that without my jacket I would not be properly dressed to bless the sacrament.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/anonymous.p21\" class=\"\">I responded, \u201cNever was one more properly dressed for such an occasion than were you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/anonymous.p22\" class=\"\">I know not his name.

It was a dark night, and a cold rain had been falling throughout the entire day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/anonymous.p24\" class=\"\">We had come to visit the grave of a missionary who many years before had died while in the service of the Lord. A hushed silence shrouded the scene as we gathered about the grave. With a flashlight illuminating the headstone, I read the inscription:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"address\" id=\"\">Joseph A.

The marble headstone had been polished, weeds such as those which covered other graves had been carefully removed, and in their place was an immaculately edged bit of lawn and some beautiful flowers that told of tender and loving care. I asked, \u201cWho has made this grave so attractive?\u201d My query was met by silence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/anonymous.p29\" class=\"\">At last a twelve-year-old deacon acknowledged that he wanted to render this unheralded kindness and, without prompting from parents or leaders, had done so. He said that he just wanted to do something for a missionary who gave his life while in the service of the Lord. I thanked him; and then I asked all there to safeguard his secret, that his gift might remain anonymous.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/anonymous.p30\" class=\"\">Perhaps no one in my reading has portrayed this teaching of the Master quite so memorably or so beautifully as Henry Van Dyke in his never-to-be-forgotten \u201cThe Mansion.\u201d In this classic is featured one John Weightman, a man of means, a dispenser of political power, a successful citizen.
