Tens of thousands of bearers of the holy priesthood are gathered together to hear instructions from the presidency of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p4\" class=\"\">I was greatly impressed by the President\u2019s remarks. I am glad he said what he did. Listening to him, I was taken back in my thoughts a quarter of a century to an experience I had with President Heber J. Grant. We were discussing some criticism that had been directed against an action taken by him in his official capacity. Putting his arm across my back and resting his hand on my left shoulder, he said, \u201cMy boy, you always keep your eye on the President of the Church, and if he tells you to do something wrong, and you do it, the Lord will bless you for it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p5\" class=\"\">And then he added, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry, however; the Lord will never let his mouthpiece lead his people astray.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p6\" class=\"\">I haven\u2019t forgotten his counsel.

One of the covenants that we have entered into with the Lord is the covenant \u201cwhich belongeth to the priesthood.\u201d The 84th section of the Doctrine and Covenants talks about the priesthood. It says that \u201cthe sons of Moses and also the sons of Aaron [meaning the bearers of the Melchizedek and the bearers of the Aaronic Priesthoods] shall [yet] offer an acceptable offering and sacrifice in the house of the Lord \u2026 in this generation \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the sons of Moses and of Aaron shall be filled with the glory of the Lord, upon Mount Zion in the Lord\u2019s house, whose sons are ye; \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cFor whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken [the Aaronic and Melchizedek], and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15924\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15924)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15924)\">D&amp;C 84:31\u201333<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p12\" class=\"\">I believe that is true. I think that men and boys who magnify their callings in the priesthood have a change wrought in their bodies. This morning while President Lee was talking in the welfare meeting, he told about someone, some stranger, who saw President McKay and said to him, \u201cAre you a prophet of God?\u201d President McKay\u2019s answer was, \u201cYou look into my face and get the answer.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p13\" class=\"\">I heard a story once about President Joseph F. Smith, the father of our present beloved leader, who was down in Arizona attending some function with the governor and other prominent men. Some of them wanted to have their pictures taken with the President of the Church. President Joseph F. Smith graciously consented and stood with them while their pictures were taken. When they stepped back into the crowd, the governor was heard to say, \u201cYou know, when I stood out there by that man, I felt like a thief.\u201d He could feel the power in a great man who was magnifying his calling in the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p14\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cThey become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15925\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15925)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15925)\">D&amp;C 84:33\u201334<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p16\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph Smith used to repeatedly urge the brethren of the priesthood to make their calling and election sure. If we want to do that, we will have to magnify our callings in the priesthood.

That the obligations of \u201cthe oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood\u201d rest upon each of us there is no doubt, because the Lord says that \u201call those who receive the priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father, which he cannot break, neither can it be moved.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15930\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15930)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15930)\">D&amp;C 84:40<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p25\" class=\"\">So, we have entered into a covenant with the Lord in which he has promised us eternal life, if we keep our part of the covenant, which is, to magnify our callings in the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/the-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p26\" class=\"\">The revelation says that the Lord cannot break his part of the oath and covenant. But we can break our part of it, and many priesthood bearers do so.

God help us to understand this, and the great honor he has placed upon us by giving us the priesthood, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
