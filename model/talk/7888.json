This historically significant announcement with respect to missionary service is inspiring. I can remember the excitement in 1960 when the age for young men serving was reduced from 20 years of age to 19. I arrived in the British Mission as a newly called 20-year-old. The first 19-year-old in our mission was Elder Jeffrey\u00a0R. Holland, an incredible addition. He was a few months shy of being 20. Then over the course of a year, many more 19-year-olds arrived. They were obedient and faithful missionaries, and the work progressed. I am confident that an even greater harvest will be achieved now as righteous, committed missionaries fulfill the Savior\u2019s commandment to preach His gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/can-ye-feel-so-now.p6\" class=\"\">In my view, those of you in the rising generation are better prepared than any previous generation. Your knowledge of the scriptures is particularly impressive. However, the challenges your generation faces as you prepare for service are similar to those faced by all members of the Church. We are all aware the culture in most of the world is not conducive to righteousness or spiritual commitment. Throughout history, Church leaders have warned the people and taught repentance. In the Book of Mormon, Alma the Younger was so concerned about unrighteousness and lack of commitment that he resigned as chief judge, the leader of the people of Nephi, and concentrated all his efforts on his prophetic calling.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10411_000_005\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"123227\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123227)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123227)\">Alma 4:15\u201319<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/can-ye-feel-so-now.p7\" class=\"\">In one of the most profound verses in all of scripture, Alma proclaims, \u201cIf ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-10411_000_005\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"123228\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123228)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123228)\">Alma 5:26<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/can-ye-feel-so-now.p8\" class=\"\">Local leaders across the world report that when viewed as a whole, Church members, especially our youth, have never been stronger.
