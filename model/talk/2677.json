I guess there never was a time like this. We have transportation and communication facilities that boggle the mind. We can walk on the moon, send deep probes into space, and look closely at faraway planets; we can produce food in quantities and qualities never before possible. We have a distribution system which assures freshness and nutrition of fresh-picked fruits and vegetables in the middle of the winter.

The great welfare debacle in this and other countries is only now coming to light. For instance, New York City is currently facing a tremendous financial crisis as reported in <span class=\"emphasis\">Newsweek<\/span> magazine of August 4, 1975, which states that fully 22 percent of this city\u2019s total budget goes for public welfare. (\u201cNew York\u2019s Last Gasp,\u201d p. 24.) This is more than is spent on police protection, health or hospitals, or education.

Over $6.6 billion will be spent for this program in fiscal year 1976. That represents over one-half of the total U.S. Department of Agriculture budget. Over 19 million people\u2014almost one American out of eleven\u2014are now getting food stamps.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-worlds-greatest-need.p7\" class=\"\">Recent findings in the program reveal errors in 56.1 percent of the cases investigated: 12.2 percent of the households receiving food stamps were completely ineligible; 37.9 percent were issued too many or too few stamps, and 6 percent were incompletely registered. Of the food stamps issued, 15.2 percent went to ineligible households. Carl B. Williams, Deputy U.S. Commissioner of Welfare, says, \u201cAs it now stands, the system is in such a mess that the Government has practically abdicated its responsibility for seeing that the money gets to people who really need it. In effect,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Government is giving away billions of dollars with virtually no controls at all.\u201d (\u201cFood Stamps\u2014Out of Control?\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">U.S. News<\/span> <span class=\"emphasis\">and World Report,<\/span> Sept. 1, 1975, p. 12.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-worlds-greatest-need.p8\" class=\"\">Welfare lists grow daily, and we now face the startling fact that we have third and fourth generations growing up on welfare.

At the October conference of 1974, Elder Neal A. Maxwell uttered a truth upon which I have reflected much in recent weeks as successive failures of government programs have become more evident. He said, \u201cThe living of one protective principle of the gospel is better than a thousand compensatory government programs\u2014which programs are, so often, like \u2018straightening the deck chairs on the Titanic.\u2019\u201d (\u201cWhy Not Now?\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1974, p. 12.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-worlds-greatest-need.p27\" class=\"\">For instance, let us take one simple principle of the gospel, which we call the Word of Wisdom. This revelation is recorded in the 89th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. And we won\u2019t even consider all of this revelation, but only a part of it, only that part where the Lord warns \u201cthat inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good. \u2026 And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of your bodies.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16538\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16538)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16538)\">D&amp;C 89:5\u20137<\/a><\/span>.) This is a prohibition against drinking alcoholic beverages. If those in the United States would follow the Lord\u2019s counsel by living this divine law, we would be able to feed the starving masses of the world. I cite an Associated Press quote of Harvard University nutritionist Dr. Jean Mayer. Said he, \u201cEvery year we convert in this nation into alcoholic liquor enough grain to feed 50 million people in the starving nations.\u201d In the United States there are 95 million drinkers, of whom 10 million are confirmed alcoholics. These 10 million alcoholics in the United States cost this nation $10 billion a year counted in lost time, slow downs in work, illnesses, mistakes resulting in spoiled materials, domestic problems, and the rest of the attendant evils that go with alcoholism.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-worlds-greatest-need.p28\" class=\"\">Also, it has been proven that alcoholism shortens the life of every alcoholic from 10 to 12 years; 250,000 new alcoholics are added to this total every year. The Connecticut state mental health commissioner reports that 40 percent of the cases in the state mental health hospitals are attributed directly to alcohol. Superior Judge John A. Starbaro of Chicago has said that \u201c75 percent of all the divorce cases I have heard resulted from alcohol.\u201d Alcohol is responsible for one-half of the total traffic deaths in the United States. There are 25,000 persons killed every year on the highways in the U.S. It might be interesting to note that we had 57,000 American servicemen killed in the Vietnam War. This total is nearly duplicated every two years on America\u2019s highways.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-worlds-greatest-need.p29\" class=\"\">There has been much said about increasing the safety of automobiles, and much has been done.

Living this simple principle of the Word of Wisdom would enable us to feed the starving masses of the world. What is man\u2019s solution to this problem of starvation? It is pretty well summarized in this clipping that I took from the newspaper recently. It is datelined Singapore. It says that \u201cparents who insist on having more than two children will lose tax benefits, face discrimination in public housing and pay more maternity costs, the government has announced.\u201d Earlier the health ministry said that some discriminatory measures will be taken against new additions to large families in 9 1\/2 months. \u201cFor the Singapore of the 1970s,\u201d it said, \u201cthe third child is luxury. The fourth and fifth are antisocial acts.\u201d The new measures include vigorous family planning campaigns coupled with sterilization and abortion programs. \u201cThe government hopes to reduce the natural increase in the birth rate to less than one percent by 1980.\u201d (\u201cFamily Size Labels a Guy,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News,<\/span> Oct. 25, 1972, p.

The real answer is expanded missionary effort\u2014teach more people more truth, and they will improve their own lives.
