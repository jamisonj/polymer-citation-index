We have heard enough already, that if we can just remember half of what we\nhave heard and take it back to our stakes and wards, they will be enriched because of these\nconference sessions.\n<\/p><p>\nPREPARATION FOR THE RETURN OF THE SOLDIERS\n<\/p><p>\nA great deal has been said during the conference, and at the present time much is said and\nwritten, about postwar conditions and our responsibilities. In my work in the Church with the\nyoung people, particularly the boys of the Aaronic Priesthood, I feel that there are some\nthings to which we can well give thought along this line, for the Church will have to\nremember that our boys will be coming home, anticipating a great deal from us. We have had\nmany letters from boys who are in the service, in answer to some of the articles that have\nbeen written and published in the Church Section of The Deseret News and\nin The Improvement Era by our girls, on the value of priesthood to young womanhood.\nUsually the boys close with words something like this: \"It is wonderful to know that there are\nsuch girls to come home to,\" and then they tell us of the kind of girls they have met while\nthey have been away.\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems to me that the M.I.A. organizations will have a greater responsibility than they have\never had before, because these boys will expect more through having been away, and many of\nour girls have been waiting patiently, faithfully, and adhering to the teachings of the Church,\nwaiting until these boys do return home. I hope there will be due consideration given them,\nfor I am not unmindful of the fact that we owe so very much to them. They have offered\ntheir lives and all they have for us, and we ought to do all we can to make their homecoming\npleasant and welcome.\n<\/p><p>\nI was very happy while in California, a few years ago, in listening to a radio broadcast by a\nminister of the gospel, to know that this Church has what he indicated the world needs today.\nHe said, \"What we need today is a church for the youth of the land. We have been preaching\nto the old folks and letting the young people go to the devil.\" Now I am grateful that we have\nin the Church a program for the youth of the land, that our boys and girls are being taught the\ngospel and inspired with the spirit of it, that they are being entertained and kept together in a\nsplendid way. There is nothing else like it in all the world.\n<\/p><p>\nIMPRESSIONS MADE ON PROMINENT MEN\n<\/p><p>\nSome years ago the agent of the Holland-America Steamship line from Rotterdam, a Mr.\nHerschfeld, came here on a visit. I had met him in Holland. He had a letter of introduction to\nPresident Grant from the mission president, and President Grant invited me to the office\nbecause I could talk Dutch, and turned Mr. Herschfeld over to me to entertain. When evening\ncame, I said, \"Mr. Herschfeld, where would you like to go? I can take you to a show, or I\nwill take you for a ride around the valley, but if you would like to see Mormonism in action I\nwill take you to a Mormon bazaar.\" He said, \"I would surely like to see Mormonism in\naction.\" So we went down to the old Granite Stake Tabernacle, on State Street and\nThirty-third South. I introduced him to many of the Hollanders who were there, and he spent\nmoney freely. He was thrilled with what he saw. We went upstairs to an operetta that was\nbeautiful, and then I said, as they announced the dance downstairs, \"Probably you have had\nenough. I shall be glad to take you back to the hotel.\" He said, \"Mr. Richards, couldn't I see\nthe dance?\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"if you would like to.\" We went down to the dance hall, and, on\nour way back to the hotel, he said, \"You could not have made me believe that I could ever\nsee a group of hundreds of young people such as I have seen here tonight, dancing together\nwith no evidence of any evil thought or anything of that kind.\" He said, \"Mr.\nRichards, if I were a young man I surely would cast my lot with the Mormon people.\" Then\nhe went on to indicate that his daughter was the wife of a professor, and his son was a doctor,\nand he said, \"You know what they think of the Mormons in Holland.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we were in Los Angeles, we had a beautiful party in the Hollywood Stake tabernacle,\ngiven by the Deseret Club. Mr. Evans, who was in charge of all the Church groups on the\ncampus at the college, was there. I spent considerable time with him, and he said, \"Mr.\nRichards, I wish all the ministers in Los Angeles could see what I can see here tonight.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren, I often felt while in the South, that if television ever developed to the point\nthat the radio has, what a marvelous thing it would be to be able to set some of these parties\nwith our young people out where the world could see them.\n<\/p><p>\nPRAISE FOR THE YOUTH PROGRAM\n<\/p><p>\nI thank the Lord for the leadership of the Church in this youth program for holding our boys\nand girls together under clean and wholesome recreation, and I trust when restrictions are\nlifted that there will be increased attention given to this program here at home, such as it\ndeserves. I would like to admonish the bishops not to be too stingy with the Mutual officers\nwhom they expect to carry on this activity program. Don't tell them there is no money in the\nbudget. Go out and get the money if it is necessary. These boys and girls of ours are worth\nmore than our money, and they are entitled to the kind of leadership this Church is prepared\nto give. You can requisition the finest talent living within your wards and stakes, and you\ndon't have to pay for it. No one else can do that, so there is no excuse for not having the\nfinest parties possible. Then I think we ought to make sure that we maintain our standards. No\nboy ought ever to enter one of our recreation hails and mingle with our young women with\nthe smell of liquor on his breath, or a bottle of liquor on his person. The Lord expects us to\nguard and protect the lives and honor of our girls, and such men are in no fit condition to\nassociate with them.\n<\/p><p>\nMISSIONARY EXPERIENCES\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I would like to leave one other thought with you today. You have heard a marvelous\naddress during this conference, by Brother Benson, on missionary work. You brethren will\nrealize that because of the war many of our boys will be deprived of the privilege of going on\nmissions. Some of them will feel that the years they have spent in the service will have to\ntake the place of their missions, but we have a new generation of boys coming along, the\nboys of the Aaronic Priesthood of this Church, and I truly hope that every\nbishop and every father and mother will see to it that these boys grow to manhood with a\ndesire to fill a mission for the Church. It is not only a great responsibility that the Lord has\nplaced upon the Church, to see that the gospel is preached in all the world for a witness unto\nall nations (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34012\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34012)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34012)\">Matt. 24:14<\/a><\/span>),\nbut the great missionary system of this Church does more for the membership of\nthe Church individually and collectively than any other activity of the Church, in my\njudgment. When I was a boy, I desired with all my heart to go on a mission. I remember two\nreturned missionaries reporting their missions in the little country town where I was reared as\na boy, and as I have said many times, if they did not do unusually well that night, the Lord\ndid something for me, because when I went home, mere boy that I was, I got down on my\nknees and asked the Lord to help me to be worthy to go on a mission when I was old enough.\nWhen the train finally left the station here in Salt Lake, and I bade farewell to my parents, I\ntold them it was the happiest moment of my life. There were many tears shed upon that\noccasion, but there were a great many more tears shed in little old Holland when I left there\nto return home nearly three years later. When we were set apart for our missions, President\nAnthon H. Lund made a statement to us boys I will never forget. He said, \"Brethren, the\npeople will love you when you go into the mission field. Now,\" he said, \"don't get lifted up\nin the pride of your hearts and think they love you because of who you are. They will love\nyou because of what you are. You are servants of the Lord. You are clothed with his Holy\nPriesthood and that is what the people will love.\" I did not realize fully the meaning of those\nwords until I went to bid farewell to the Saints in Holland. One little mother, whose daughter\ncame to America only a few weeks before, said, \"Brother Richards, it was hard to see my\ndaughter leave, but it is much harder to see you go.\" A brother old enough to be my own\nfather, knelt down and kissed my hand an affectionate good-bye. As I closed my ministry, I\nshed tears all the way traveling from Amsterdam to Rotterdam, as I thought of how\nmarvelously the Lord had sustained and blessed me, and what that mission meant to me.\n<\/p><p>\nThen President Lund made another statement I could not help thinking of today when we\nheard Brother Kirkham telling about the boy on the street corner in Boston bearing his\ntestimony. President Lund said, \"Boys, if you ever lack for words to speak when you are\ncalled upon, just arise and testify that you know that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God and\nthe Book of Mormon is true, and I promise you that you shall not want for words to speak.\"\nThere isn't time to tell you how literally that was fulfilled. I remember one large conference\nheld in Rotterdam where we had about fifteen hundred people present. Some of the leaders of\nthe town came with their stovepipe hats and walking canes, and the mission president had\npromised me if I would take the minutes&mdash;I was secretary of the mission&mdash;he would not call on\nme to speak. Well, President Grant happened to be on the stand and he said,\n\"Call Brother Richards next,\" and so I spoke unexpectedly. Now, I want to bear testimony to\nyou here this day that the words of President Lund came to my mind, and I walked up to the\npulpit and bore testimony to the restoration of the gospel, and the divine mission of the\nProphet Joseph Smith. The Lord did something for me that day; he lifted me up until I felt\nthat the floor could have passed from under my feet, and I would still have been there\npreaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Later, when some of our people were baptized\nand I happened to be in that baptismal service, they told me that my talk that night, which I\nknew came from the Lord, was the thing that started them on the way to investigate the\ngospel.\n<\/p><p>\nFUTURE MISSIONARIES\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brothers and sisters&mdash;there are sisters on the air&mdash;I know of nothing in this world that can\ndo for your boys and girls what a mission can. Jesus said, \"And this is life eternal, that they\nmight know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27202\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27202)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27202)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>); and\nthere is no way I know of in the world where men can learn to know God as they can in the\nmission field. I have heard President Grant say that the experience of his life that he regarded\nas richer to him than any other in his Church work was the time he spent in Great Britain as a\nmissionary.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to recommend to the bishops this thought, that every boy in the Aaronic\nPriesthood who lives worthy to go on a mission, be interviewed by the bishop, for a mission\ncall initiates with the bishop. Do not attempt to be the judge whether he is financially able to\ngo or not until you have interviewed him in the presence of his parents. I have tried that. I\nremember in one home we did not think they could possibly send their boy. We told the\nmother&mdash;the father was not a member of the Church&mdash;All we knew was we would be proud to\nhave their boy represent our ward in the mission field, but we did not know whether they had\nany rich uncles or aunts, or grandparents that could help or not, and the mother said, \"Bishop,\nif you will call my boy on a mission I will see that he gets the money if I have to work every\nday he is gone to provide it.\" Now, brothers and sisters, I feel that if we promote this spirit,\nkeep it alive in the hearts of our people it should not be difficult at all for us to have one\npercent of our ward population in the mission field. We proved this could be done in two\nwards where I had the privilege of presiding. We have some ten to fifteen percent in the\narmed forces. The boys will bless you forever for the privilege that comes to them; and if\nthey cannot go they will be stronger Latter-day Saints, proud of the fact that their bishop had\ninterviewed them and given them an opportunity to go.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us to do all we can for our boys, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
