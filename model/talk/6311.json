The new declaration of the Relief Society begins, \u201cWe are beloved spirit daughters of God.\u201d To be a daughter of God means that you are the offspring of Deity, literal descendants of a Divine Father, inheriting godly attributes and potential.

I had left my family and friends and everything familiar the day before, and I knew I needed His help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/what-it-means-to-be-a-daughter-of-god.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cMy prayers were answered as I reflected on the tender experience with my father the day before. A wave of comfort fell over me as I realized that I had not come to college with the blessing of just my earthly father.

Perhaps He gave me words of advice and encouragement and told me that He believed in me, just as my earthly father had.

His mother, wishing to encourage him, \u201cbought tickets for a performance of the great Polish pianist, Paderewski. The night of the concert arrived and the mother and son found their seats near the front of the concert hall.

He whispered to the boy, \u2018Don\u2019t quit. Keep playing.\u2019 And then, leaning over, the master reached down with his left hand and began filling in the bass part. Soon his right arm reached around the other side, encircling the child, to add a running obbligato. Together, the old master and the young novice held the crowd mesmerized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/what-it-means-to-be-a-daughter-of-god.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cIn our lives, unpolished though we may be, it is the Master who surrounds us and whispers in our ear, time and time again, \u2018Don\u2019t quit.

In His infinite wisdom, the Lord requires worthy brethren to wear the mantle of the priesthood in order to enter the temple, but He permits the sisters to enter solely by virtue of their personal worthiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/what-it-means-to-be-a-daughter-of-god.p43\" class=\"\">A few years ago, after attending the temple for the first time, a sister wrote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/what-it-means-to-be-a-daughter-of-god.p44\" class=\"\">\u201cWhat a glorious blessing to be inside that house! My eyes, ears, and heart opened wide to absorb its teachings. I felt the reality of each covenant I made within every fiber and bone of my body. I felt I was standing right in front of the Lord each time I made covenants with him. The influence of the Lord was so great that I had no desire to leave the temple after the session was over. It became real to me then that I was surely in the world but not of it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/what-it-means-to-be-a-daughter-of-god.p45\" class=\"\">Four weeks later, she went through the temple on behalf of her mother and wrote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/what-it-means-to-be-a-daughter-of-god.p46\" class=\"\">\u201cThis was another glorious experience. I felt my mother\u2019s presence as I went through the endowment session, and when the marriage sealing was performed for my parents, I literally felt their presence at the altar. The influence of the Holy Spirit in the room was so strong that I broke down in tears while being sealed to my parents. I truly experienced a reunion with them. Ever since that day I have felt their presence so close that it doesn\u2019t seem real that they are gone.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote16-99911_000_040\">16<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cThe Glorious Moments,\u201d Sipuao Matuauto, <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Aug. 1974, 64.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/what-it-means-to-be-a-daughter-of-god.p47\" class=\"\">As stated in the Relief Society declaration, you are beloved spirit daughters of God.
