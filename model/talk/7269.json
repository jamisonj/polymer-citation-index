We are involved in terrible wars with lives lost and many crippling wounds.

I am advised that even right here among us there is some of this. I cannot understand how it can be. It seemed to me that we all rejoiced in the 1978 revelation given President Kimball [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"45189\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45189)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45189)\">O.D. 2<\/a><\/span>].

I remind you that no man who makes disparaging remarks concerning those of another race can consider himself a true disciple of Christ. Nor can he consider himself to be in harmony with the teachings of the Church of Christ. How can any man holding the Melchizedek Priesthood arrogantly assume that he is eligible for the priesthood whereas another who lives a righteous life but whose skin is of a different color is ineligible?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/the-need-for-greater-kindness.p10\" class=\"\">Throughout my service as a member of the First Presidency, I have recognized and spoken a number of times on the diversity we see in our society.

One such came the other day. It is from a woman who indicates that her first marriage ended in divorce. She then met a man who seemed to be a very kind and considerate individual. However, she discovered soon after marriage that his finances were in disarray; he had little money, yet he quit his job and refused employment. She was then forced to go to work to provide for the family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/the-need-for-greater-kindness.p14\" class=\"\">Years have passed, and he still is unemployed.

Of course, I know that all of this is the work of the adversary. He works on us as individuals. He destroys strong men. From the time of the organization of this Church he has done so.

I never heard a man bear a stronger testimony than he did when under the influence of the Spirit. But the moment he left the kingdom of God, that moment his power fell. \u2026 He was shorn of his strength, like Samson in the lap of Delilah. He lost the power and testimony which he had enjoyed, and he never recovered it again in its fulness while in the flesh, although he died [a member of] the Church\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Wilford Woodruff<\/span> [2004], 105).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/the-need-for-greater-kindness.p22\" class=\"\">I have permission to tell you the story of a young man who grew up in our community.

In the new location, at the age of 17, he was able to enroll in college. There, for the first time in his life, he felt the warmth of friends, one of whom, named Richard, asked him to join a club of which he was president. He writes: \u201cFor the first time in my life someone wanted me around. I didn\u2019t know how to react, but thankfully I joined. \u2026 It was a feeling that I loved, the feeling of having a friend. I had prayed for one my whole life. And now after 17 years of waiting, God answered that prayer.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/the-need-for-greater-kindness.p26\" class=\"\">At the age of 19 he found himself as a tent partner with Richard during their summer employment. He noticed Richard reading a book every night. He asked what he was reading. He was told that he was reading the Book of Mormon. He adds: \u201cI quickly changed the subject and went to bed. After all, that is the book that ruined my childhood. I tried forgetting about it, but a week went by and I couldn\u2019t sleep. Why was he reading it every night? I soon couldn\u2019t stand the unanswered questions in my head. So one night I asked him what was so important in that book. What was in it? He handed me the book. I quickly stated that I never wanted to touch the book. I just wanted to know what was in there. He started to read where he had stopped. He read about Jesus and about an appearance in the Americas. I was shocked. I didn\u2019t think that the Mormons believed in Jesus.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/the-need-for-greater-kindness.p27\" class=\"\">Richard asked him to sing in a stake conference choir with him. The day came and the conference started. \u201cElder Gary J. Coleman from the First Quorum of the Seventy was the guest speaker. I found out during the conference that he also [was a convert]. At the end Richard proceeded to pull me by the arm up to talk to him. I finally agreed, and as I was approaching him he turned and smiled at me. I introduced myself and said that I wasn\u2019t a member and that I had just come to sing in the choir. He smiled and said he was happy that I was there and stated that the music was great. I asked him how he knew the Church was true. He told me a short version of his testimony and asked if I had read the Book of Mormon. I said no. He promised me that the first time I read it, I would feel the Spirit.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/the-need-for-greater-kindness.p28\" class=\"\">On a subsequent occasion this young man and his friend were traveling.

He did so, and suddenly the inspiration of the Holy Spirit touched him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/the-need-for-greater-kindness.p29\" class=\"\">Time passed and his faith increased. He agreed to be baptized.
