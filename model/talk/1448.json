Men wonder, \"Where did we come from, and what is the object of life?\" The\nanswers to these questions are essential in order for each of us to achieve the maximum\nbenefits, happiness, and peace that this life affords.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Object of Life<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nBut to us God <i>has<\/i> revealed the object of life. He has revealed the great truth that he is our\nFather and that we are his spirit children. I am indeed grateful for this knowledge; and as we\nappreciate that we are spirit children of our Father in heaven, unlimited possibilities lie before\nus.\n<\/p><p>\nThrough the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, we learn that we enjoyed a premortal existence as\nspirit children of God the Father.\n<\/p><p>\nIn our first estate or premortal existence we had our free\nagency, and because of our choice and worthiness we were eligible to come to this earth&mdash;our\nsecond estate. Thus, at the time of our earthly birth our spirit entered into our mortal\nbody and became the life of our body.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Concept of Eternal Progress<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe knowledge that this life is the second estate opens up the great concept of eternal\nprogress. This is a basic truth of our religious thought. What a tremendous vision this gives\nus.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd why did we come to this second estate? To be proved and tested&mdash;to see if we will do\nall things whatsoever the Lord commands us (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"7239\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7239)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7239)\">Abr. 3:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJesus said, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35425\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35425)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35425)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Salvation and Exaltation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI bear witness to you that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, and that all of God's\nchildren will inherit immortality through the atonement of the Christ, <i>but<\/i> that only those who\nkeep God's commandments and endure to the <i>end<\/i> will inherit eternal life and exaltation in the\ncelestial kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nHow many experiences, pleasant and unpleasant, must we have, and how much knowledge\nmust we attain to become perfect, even as our Father in heaven is perfect? Let us consider\nthis matter before answering.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Experience Can Be A Blessing<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nGreat blessings come from the knowledge that we obtain and the experiences we have, and it\nshould be remembered that every experience has a value.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Joseph was proved the same as each of us is. He encountered intense opposition\nand what appeared to be insurmountable obstacles.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen he was crying to the Lord in Liberty Jail in March 1839, the word of the Lord came to\nhim, saying: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou my son,\nthat all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14685\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14685)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14685)\">D&amp;C 122:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure that it was difficult for the Prophet Joseph at that time to appreciate how this most\ndifficult experience would be for his good, but it undoubtedly was a preparation for greater\ntests that came later.\n<\/p><p>\nI love the Prophet Joseph Smith and bear witness that he was one of the great prophets of all\ntime.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Zion's Camp<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nYou may recall that historic and memorable journey of Zion's Camp to Missouri. Since it\nfailed of its purpose to reinstate the Saints in possession of their lands in Jackson County, it\nwas regarded by some as being an unprofitable episode.\n<\/p><p>\n\"A brother in Kirtland&mdash;one too weak in the faith to go with the camp&mdash;meeting Brigham\nYoung on his return from Missouri, said to him, 'Well, what did you gain on this useless\njourney to Missouri with Joseph Smith?' 'All we went for,' promptly replied Brigham\nYoung.\" (<i>Comprehensive History of the Church<\/i>, 1:370.)\n<\/p><p>\nIn the camp's journey of more than a thousand miles there were many experiences. There\nwere fatigues, hardships, and disappointments to overcome; all of these experiences were\nvaluable to the men who participated in them. Many became the leaders in two great exoduses\ninvolving the removal of 12,000 Saints from Missouri to Illinois and of more than 20,000\nfrom Illinois to the Salt Lake Valley.\n<\/p><p>\nIn another way also this Zion's Camp experience was profitable. In February 1835 a\nconference was held in which the Prophet explained \"that the trials and sufferings endured on\nthat journey to Missouri were not in vain, for it was the will of God 'that those who went to\nZion with a determination to lay down their lives, if necessary, should be ordained to the\nministry, to go forth to prune the vineyard for the last time.'\" (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, 1:372-373.) Thus it was\nfrom this group that the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was selected.\n<\/p><p>\nAgain it was the knowledge obtained and faith and strength that was developed that prepared\nthese men for the great work that was ahead of them.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, it is essential that each of us learn from our experiences as we are tried and tested by the\nafflictions of this life. God has explained that this is an important part of this life.\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems, however, that human nature wants to follow the easy paths; but each of us should\nthank the Lord for the difficulties we encounter.\n<\/p><p>\nI know that as we look back upon our lives, we will acknowledge that those experiences that\nwere the most difficult were in the end the most profitable. The lessons learned and faith\ndeveloped in such hours of hardship will prove to be of eternal value to us in our path of\neternal progress.\n<\/p><p>\nMany of us recall the dark days of the depression in the early nineteen thirties. The loss of\none's possessions is a humbling experience, especially with the responsibilities of a family,\nbut the lessons will never be forgotten.\n<\/p><p>\nLikewise, the loss of loved ones are sad experiences, but these difficult tests build great faith,\ncourage, and humility. In the presence of death we are made humble, for then we realize our\nown helplessness and our dependence upon our Heavenly Father for comfort.\n<\/p><p>\nThose who have fulfilled missions understand the difficulties and disappointments in bringing\nsouls into the kingdom of God. But none would deny the great opportunities for personal\ngrowth and development as well as eternal joy and happiness.\n<\/p><p>\nService to mankind through activity in the Church affords one of the great opportunities for\nexperience. This type of experience develops love, faith, wisdom, understanding, discernment\nand invariably results in increased knowledge.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior said, \"Woe unto You when all men shall speak well of you!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31649\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31649)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31649)\">Luke 6:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Adversity<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church and the people of the Church have encountered and will encounter many trials\nand tribulations, but as the Lord explained to the Prophet in Liberty Jail, \". . . all these things\nshall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14686\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14686)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14686)\">D&amp;C 122:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe should not expect all to speak well of us or expect all to be well with us continually. Let\nus prepare steadfastly to face adversity regardless of the form it takes, recognizing that such\nexperiences are necessary to the progress of the Church as well as ourselves as individuals.\n<\/p><p>\nGod has not promised us that we won't have problems and troubles, but he has promised us\ncomfort, increased faith and knowledge, as well as growth and development as we\nsuccessfully meet each challenge of life.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat may appear to be a small problem to some may be a major one to another. The\nimportant thing about a problem is: How do we react to it?\n<\/p><p>\nAs we pursue the study of the gospel of Jesus Christ, we perceive that it is a grand\nphilosophy of life, yes, the plan of life.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay has said that the purpose of the gospel is to change men's lives, to make\nbad men good and good men better, and to change human nature. (Film <i>Every Member a Missionary<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Blessing of the Spirit<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHow much learning and how many experiences do we need to become godlike? The answer is\nthat we need all we can receive on this earth; and as we successfully meet this life's\nchallenges, we will be prepared for more as we leave this estate and move into the next estate\nin the hereafter.\n<\/p><p>\nOur Father has sent us here for a short period of mortal experience. He has given us\nprinciples to guide us and has endowed us with free agency to choose our paths. As we\nchoose the right we are promised eternal progress and love and peace with our families and\nfriends. And he has promised us that as we keep his commandments his spirit will be with us\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40346\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40346)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40346)\">Mosiah 18:10<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14572\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14572)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14572)\">D&amp;C 20:77<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWords cannot describe the happiness that comes into our lives when the spirit of God is with\nus. This happiness includes a peace that passeth understanding except to the person that\nreceives it.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us truly appreciate the object of this life and endure to the end by meeting life's\nchallenges with a determination to make each experience of eternal value to us and thus\ncontribute to our eternal progress.\n<\/p><p>\nI thank the Lord for the prophet our beloved President David O. McKay, who stands at the\nhead of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today. May the Lord sustain him in\nhis great calling, and may we all have the good judgment and courage to follow his inspired\nadvice and counsel, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
