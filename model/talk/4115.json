Arthur Haycock, President Kimball\u2019s personal secretary, phoned me and said, \u201cElder Ashton, President Kimball wants you to go to the Utah State Prison with him.\u201d The next day we went. My delaying tactic had lasted only a few weeks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/spencer-w-kimball-a-true-disciple-of-christ.p27\" class=\"\">I called Warden Morris and said, \u201cMay we come and visit you? We do not want anyone to know of our visit. Could we just meet in your office and not go through the minimum, medium, or maximum security places? Perhaps you could invite two inmates with whom President Kimball could visit in your office. Later we could look around the grounds and talk with others.\u201d He agreeably made the arrangements.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/spencer-w-kimball-a-true-disciple-of-christ.p28\" class=\"\">We traveled to the institution, where about a thousand people are incarcerated. Soon into the warden\u2019s office came two prisoners. I was impressed with how hard the convicts looked\u2014how mean, how sullen. After they were introduced and sat down, I broke the silence by saying to President Kimball, \u201cWould you like to say a few words to these two men?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/spencer-w-kimball-a-true-disciple-of-christ.p29\" class=\"\">He said, \u201cYes.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/spencer-w-kimball-a-true-disciple-of-christ.p30\" class=\"\">They both looked steadily down at the floor.

One prisoner had been convicted for murder and the other for manslaughter. Here is a prophet. Here were two hardened criminals. What do you say? What do you do? Do you say, \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourselves? What a waste for you to be in such a place as this\u201d?

I learned more about interviewing in those fifteen minutes than in any similar period in my life. No condemnation. No judging. Only displaying a real interest in the person and his circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/spencer-w-kimball-a-true-disciple-of-christ.p37\" class=\"\">Before our interview was over, somehow the press found out that President Kimball was there. They were at the door and wanted to get into the warden\u2019s office for an interview and a picture.

I had the responsibility for his safety. I had tried to talk him out of it. But he is a disciple of Christ and holds on to the words of God: \u201cI was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: \u2026 Naked, and ye clothed me: \u2026 I was in prison, and ye came unto me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37084\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37084)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37084)\">Matt. 25:35\u201336<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/spencer-w-kimball-a-true-disciple-of-christ.p40\" class=\"\">After the pictures were taken, President Kimball looked at one prisoner and then at the other and said, \u201cThank you for letting me have my picture taken with you.\u201d Is there any doubt we love him?

One week I remember among the Twelve we had been almost everywhere around the globe. President Kimball listened to all of us and then gave his report: \u201cI spent Saturday and Sunday visiting the sick and the homebound.\u201d The rest of us who thought we had had a busy and productive weekend realized that a man of God had again taught us a lesson.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/spencer-w-kimball-a-true-disciple-of-christ.p46\" class=\"\">Has our prophet taught us anything through his prayers? Very often the Twelve and the First Presidency pray together. When President Kimball takes his turn to be voice, he generally includes this phrase in his prayers: \u201cBless our enemies. Help us to understand them, and them to understand us.\u201d He doesn\u2019t ask for vengeance or retaliation, just for understanding so differences can be resolved. Perhaps family differences and neighborhood problems could be resolved if we would follow our prophet\u2019s example and pray for patience and forgiveness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/spencer-w-kimball-a-true-disciple-of-christ.p47\" class=\"\">President Kimball once said, just after he became President of the Church, \u201cI thought I knew how to pray before, but now I am really learning how to pray.\u201d A man of God knows he can\u2019t reach goals alone.

There is a mighty bond between President Kimball, President Romney, and President Hinckley. As they serve together each one teaches us what it means to be united and to be men of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/spencer-w-kimball-a-true-disciple-of-christ.p55\" class=\"\">I leave you my witness that President Spencer W.
