I know these men personally. I know they are good\nmen. I know they are capable, and I know, too, their willingness to lay upon the altar any\nworldly possessions they have in order to serve the Lord in spirit and in truth.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe in the future of the Church. I believe it has a great destiny. I believe in its moral\nstandards. I believe its program is effective and the Church will grow and develop as the\nmissionary effort increases in the world. I believe faith in God is the\nvery foundation of right living, and I believe in the missionary system of the Church, which\nhas proved so successful in recent years, and I believe the work will continue to go forward.\n<\/p><p>\nI also believe that many of the old barriers and obstacles are crumbling and giving way, and\nthat we have a better opportunity than we have ever had to proclaim the gospel truths. I\nbelieve there are people in the world who are very anxious to hear the gospel message as it is\nproclaimed by humble men and women sent out from the headquarters of the Church to bear\ntheir testimonies.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to read a word from President Brigham Young. He said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"The Lord will never suffer this people to dwindle down, and be hid up in a corner; it cannot\nbe; neither does he want any person to help them but himself\" (<i>Discourses of Brigham Young<\/i>, p. 676).\n<\/p><p>\nIn other words, God is directing his work. It is not man-made, neither is it the creation of a\nhuman mind. The pioneer prophet Brigham Young was face to face with a gigantic task when\nhe undertook to colonize the West and to keep alive the missionary movement. It was not an\neasy thing to set up a commonwealth and to transform a desert into cities, towns, and villages,\nand to provide homes, schools, and churches. It required more than ordinary skill to build up\nfaith and hope and to develop a solid citizenship out of a people who came from many parts\nof the world.\n<\/p><p>\nBrigham Young could not have done it without God's help. He knew this, and never once did\nhe claim the credit for this achievement. When he died in 1877, his enemies saw the end of\nMormonism. There was no one, they argued, to take his place. He had presided over the\nChurch for thirty years. Those who had stood by him in the early emergencies and difficulties\nhad passed on. Willard Richards had died in 1854. Heber C. Kimball, the great prophet, and a\nstalwart, who had stood by his side in all the days of colonization and settlement, had died in\n1868. Parley P. Pratt had met an untimely death in 1857. George A. Smith, who was regarded\nas a great leader of courage and wisdom, had died in 1875. And many others who stood\nvaliantly by his side during the exodus and the colonization effort, also had passed on.\nMormonism could not survive, at least that was the verdict of those who did not and could\nnot understand. There was no leader, they claimed, to take his place. They saw the disruption\nand disorganization of the Church, and many would repudiate their allegiance and follow a\ndivided leadership.\n<\/p><p>\nThe enemies predicted the same thing when the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum Smith\nwere murdered. The great enterprise launched by them, they thought, would burst like a\nbubble, but God will always have in reserve someone to take the place of him who is gone.\nBrethren and sisters, God's work will triumph in the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nSpeaking of pioneer days, I should like to read a statement from the journal of Brother\nRichard Ballantyne, the organizer of the first Sunday School in the Rocky Mountains. Brother\nBallantyne wrote this just five years before his death. Speaking of pioneering days, he said:\n<\/p><p>\nBut those times are now past, and I believe never to return. A brighter day is now awaiting,\nbut it will have its dangers.\n<\/p><p>\n\"As wealth flows into the hands of the Church, and with its learning and refinement, pride is\napt to enter the hearts of the children of Zion, as it entered into the hearts of the Nephites.\n<\/p><p>\n\"God has signified by his servant that the day to favor Zion has come. The powers of the\nheavens are to be exerted in a way they never were before. The time for the uplifting of Zion\nhas come. Kings and rulers will favor her. Her beauty and righteousness are beginning to\nappear in the world. She will not be looked upon as she has been in the past. The shadows\nare passing away, and the light is breaking in upon us.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI bear my testimony that God's work will stand, that Joseph Smith was his divine Prophet\nappointed to usher in the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. I bear testimony that his\nsuccessors in the high office were all men of God, and that they were full of faith and\nprophecy. I bear testimony that the authority of the Holy Priesthood is operating in the\nChurch as it has always done and that it will continue to do so until\nevery knee shall bend and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41253\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41253)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41253)\">Philip. 2:10-11<\/a><\/span>), the Savior of the\nworld, and that the Latter-day Saints comprise his Church and kingdom about which the\nancient prophets spoke; and that the Church will continue to grow and extend itself, even\nbeyond our imaginations, for it will surely reach to the uttermost parts of the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that his Spirit may continue with us, and that we may serve him always with a\nsingleness of purpose, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
