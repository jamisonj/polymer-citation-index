It had rather long front paws and short back legs. Its movements were so slow that it was hard to know whether it was alive or dead. We were told that it was a sloth. I was intrigued because reference to the sloth appears in scripture. The Lord used it with disdain, referring to those who were slow to act.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/welfare-services-begins-with-you.p5\" class=\"\">When the welfare program was begun in the 1930s, it aimed to eliminate the curse of idleness, reestablish self-respect, and help people to help themselves. The basic principles of the Lord\u2019s economic system had earlier been revealed to the Prophet Joseph. Nearly everything that has happened since then has been to prepare us for the time when this program would be needed to a far greater extent. In the intervening years, many great principles have been declared. I shall review these briefly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/welfare-services-begins-with-you.p6\" class=\"\">President Grant declared: \u201cThe Church needs blessings, and the only way we can receive \u2026 them \u2026 is by keeping the laws on which these blessings are predicated. The fundamental law pertaining to the <span class=\"emphasis\">welfare<\/span> of our people is fast offering. The reason we want to stress the paying of fast offerings is because we need blessings that come from paying fast offerings.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/welfare-services-begins-with-you.p7\" class=\"\">President Clark counseled: \u201cLive within your means. Get out of debt. Keep out of debt. Lay by for a rainy day which has always come and will come again.

Without this teamwork, never in the world would we accomplish what we are doing in the welfare program.\u201d (Harold B.

It must begin with every member of the Church. \u2026 You have to act for yourself and be a participant before the welfare program is active in your household. Moving out from there, then, to quorums, to united teamwork \u2026 tremendous results can come.\u201d (Harold B.

Then only can we develop the faith necessary to an exaltation in the celestial kingdom.\u201d (Harold B.

In the last few years President Romney has restated and expounded the fundamental principles of the welfare program. The major addresses of the welfare sessions have been reported in the conference editions of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> magazine for the last five conferences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/welfare-services-begins-with-you.p24\" class=\"\">The preventive aspects of the welfare program can and must be accomplished by you quorum leaders learning, teaching, and implementing these principles. Besides the preventive work, there is the work of rehabilitation. The individual who is in need of sustenant help should be built back into a self-supporting member of the Church. This is the work of the priesthood quorums as Elder Hinckley illustrated so beautifully six months ago. The quorum must help its weakened members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/welfare-services-begins-with-you.p25\" class=\"\">Likewise, on you Aaronic Priesthood quorum leaders\u2014including the bishopric, of course\u2014falls the responsibility to teach welfare principles to over half a million young men and women.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/welfare-services-begins-with-you.p26\" class=\"\">Often we hear youth say: \u201cWhat is there to <span class=\"emphasis\">do?<\/span>\u201d In addition to the collection of fast offerings by the deacons, some of the finest opportunities lie in the area of Welfare Services. Brethren, build into your programs the excellent activities suggested in the <span class=\"emphasis\">Aaronic Priesthood Quorum Guidebook<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">The Activity Book.<\/span> Here is a sampling of the useful and interesting ways in which youth can participate in home storage and Welfare Services activities: store and preserve food and water, store firewood and make newspaper logs, prepare an inventory of family possessions, plant a garden, build a compost pile and make an outdoor storage pit, prune fruit trees, make shopping comparisons, learn about proper diet, cook game fish or meat, clean a house, repair an electrical cord, replace a water faucet, paint the interior and exterior of a house, and enjoy a festival of homemaking skills.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/welfare-services-begins-with-you.p27\" class=\"\">Each of these ideas has other suggested projects that are both fun and useful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/welfare-services-begins-with-you.p28\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, I have reviewed briefly these principles. They are true. You can live them. Now I give a word of caution, even warning. The word <span class=\"emphasis\">sloth<\/span> or <span class=\"emphasis\">slothfulness<\/span> appears in scripture twenty-five times, generally to condemn those who were slow to act. As we watched that sloth hanging in the tree, it reached out ever so slowly to pull off a leaf, then slower still brought it back and put it into its mouth. As we watched it we could understand the words <span class=\"emphasis\">impatient, irritated, exasperated.<\/span> The Savior\u2019s reference to the sloth and slothfulness illustrates His displeasure and impatience with the person who is slow to act, who is slothful. Brethren and sisters, our generation has been counseled patiently for more than forty years. It is no longer optional to learn and teach and implement these principles. It is crucial!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/welfare-services-begins-with-you.p29\" class=\"\">This work is divine. It will yet save and exalt us. That exaltation will come by living this law. May we in unity rise to this challenge and do it, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
