His success comes from developing the habit of hard work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/the-value-of-work.p5\" class=\"\">He was raised in poverty by a widowed mother. From age eleven, James worked six days a week every summer and delivered papers during the winter.

We are known throughout the world as a highly motivated, industrious people. Eric Hoffer once cautioned, \u201cPut a Mormon in a hopper and out comes a tycoon.\u201d (Quoted by C.

It is said that President Wilford Woodruff loved work. \u201cTo him it was a blessing, a privilege. \u2026 His toil in the canyons, his sweat in the harvest field, \u2026 were all important parts in divine economy. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/the-value-of-work.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cTo sweat, was a divine command as much so as to pray.\u201d (Matthias F.

Personifying his \u201cDo it!\u201d philosophy, President Kimball has committed himself not only to the pursuit of happiness, but to the happiness of pursuit. On one occasion, when Dr. Wilkinson showed concern for President Kimball\u2019s health and the increasing demands he was making on his body, President Kimball responded in a kindly way, \u201cYour job, Brother Wilkinson, is to keep me going at the pace I am going to go.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/the-value-of-work.p17\" class=\"\">This reminds me of the farmer who was feeling a little sluggish and went to see his doctor.

What I want from you is some more wax.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/the-value-of-work.p18\" class=\"\">President Kimball\u2019s complete dedication to his work sets a high standard for all of us. We have a moral obligation to exercise our personal capabilities of mind, muscle, and spirit in a way that will return to the Lord, our families, and our society the fruits of our best efforts. To do less is to live our lives unfulfilled. It is to deny ourselves and those dependent upon us opportunity and advantage. We work to earn a living, it is true; but as we toil, let us also remember that we are building a life. Our work determines what that life will be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/the-value-of-work.p19\" class=\"\">Work is honorable. It is good therapy for most problems. It is the antidote for worry. It is the equalizer for deficiency of native endowment. Work makes it possible for the average to approach genius. What we may lack in aptitude, we can make up for in performance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/the-value-of-work.p20\" class=\"\">As recommended by Korsaren: \u201cIf you are poor, work. \u2026 If you are happy, work. Idleness gives room for doubts and fears. If disappointments come, keep right on working. If sorrow overwhelms you, \u2026 work. \u2026 When faith falters and reason fails, just work. When dreams are shattered and hope seems dead, work. Work as if your life were in peril. It really is. No matter what ails you, work. Work faithfully. \u2026 Work is the greatest remedy available for both mental and physical afflictions.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Forbes Scrapbook of Thoughts on the Business of Life,<\/span> New York: Forbes Inc., 1968, p. 427.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">Let me suggest some other elements of the work ethic which are important:<\/p>\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>As Latter-day Saints, if we would be true to our religion, we must perform high-quality work. It is a matter of integrity. Every piece of work we do is a portrait of the one who produced it. We are increasingly concerned with the diminishing quality of work in our society. On every hand we see shoddy workmanship for which full compensation is expected, whether the product meets acceptable standards or not. We must be motivated by a higher ideal than simply meeting the artificial standard of a society which has allowed inferior performance to be acceptable. That is not the Mormon ethic. In times of unemployment, Latter-day Saints who practice the work principles of our religion should be in great demand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Let us give full, honest effort to our jobs as though we owned the enterprise. In a very real sense, each of us is in business for ourselves, no matter who pays us. Be honest with your employer. Make sure that \u201cthe laborer is worthy of his hire.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17840\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17840)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17840)\">D&amp;C 84:79<\/a><\/span>.) Our employers should get the best we have in us, not just enough to get by or to meet common standards. Each of us should set a personal standard based upon our ability. Let us exemplify the old pioneer motto: A Full Day\u2019s Work for a Full Day\u2019s Pay.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Continue to invest in your personal development. Expand your occupational horizons by constant study. Use your spare time wisely. If we waste thirteen minutes each day, it is the equivalent of two weeks a year without pay. Look to your present job as a stepping-stone along your career path. Take time to think. The dimensions of most jobs are constrained only by the mind of the uncreative worker. I like what one businessman counseled: \u201cIf at first you <span class=\"emphasis\">do<\/span> succeed, try something harder!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">4.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>To teach our children to work is a primary duty of parenthood. Our children have experienced unprecedented prosperity created by parents who have worked hard to provide what they themselves did not have as youngsters. If we are to save our children temporally and spiritually, we must train them to work. They must learn by example that work is not drudgery, but a blessing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/the-value-of-work.p26\" class=\"\">Fortunate is the young man or woman who has learned how to work.

She has passed this on to my sister and me. It was with great patience that she taught us to sew, cook, clean house, iron, etc. Can reironing one of Daddy\u2019s white shirts until it was perfect be a blessing? Or getting up to do the washing and ironing before school\u2014a blessing? Or peeling beets, shelling peas by the hour, husking bushels and bushels of corn for canning, picking berries at the crack of dawn before the sun got too hot\u2014blessings? You couldn\u2019t convince me then, but you can now.

Do not be confused by attempts to label some jobs as strictly male or strictly female. Generally speaking, each child should know how to do simple cooking, wash dishes, clean the house, mow the lawn, tend the baby, and wash the car. These skills will do much to make their adult lives happier and more productive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/the-value-of-work.p31\" class=\"\">Now, what about our leisure time? How we use our leisure is equally as important to our joy as our occupational pursuits. Proper use of leisure requires discriminating judgment. Our leisure provides opportunity for renewal of spirit, mind, and body. It is a time for worship, for family, for service, for study, for wholesome recreation. It brings harmony into our life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/the-value-of-work.p32\" class=\"\">Leisure is not idleness. The Lord condemns idleness.

Idleness in any form produces boredom, conflict, and unhappiness. It creates a vacancy of worth, a seedbed for mischief and evil. It is the enemy of progress and salvation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/the-value-of-work.p33\" class=\"\">Work is an essential element in the Lord\u2019s welfare plan; but it is a special kind of work. Work of the members, sanctified by love, produces the commodities which solve the temporal needs of our worthy poor. The laborer is blessed and sanctified in his unselfish service. The needy member accepts assistance in the spirit of love and gratitude. He knows it was provided by the toil and sacrifice of the Church members. To the extent of his ability, the needy member works for what he receives, as assigned by the bishop, thereby preserving his dignity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/the-value-of-work.p34\" class=\"\">The individual is all-important in the Lord\u2019s plan. Any system which does not require initiative, self-reliance, and the necessity of work for what we receive, if able, will not preserve its integrity.
