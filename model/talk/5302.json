John and Shirley Withers were successful advertising executives. They were on the fast track, indulging themselves in worldly pleasures.

Their previous behavior became incompatible with gospel principles. A new set of priorities and values replaced worldly interests. Alcohol and tobacco habits became expendable, although with great effort. Modesty became the dress standard. Prayer, scripture study, Relief Society and priesthood service became the focus. They were baptized and received the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-lord-of-life.p21\" class=\"\">As Sister Clarke and I, with some of our missionaries, assembled in the Salt Lake Temple, John and Shirley Withers, with their children, were sealed together as an eternal family.

Only those who humbly open their hearts have the courage to admit error and place their trust in the Lord for forgiveness and redemption.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">I do not know how our Savior actually performs the sanctifying miracle of the Atonement, how He takes upon Himself our anguish of mind and body and assumes our pain and guilt; but I know He does. This leads me to these conclusions:<\/p>\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The incomprehensible severity of His suffering should convince us that we are loved and very important to our Heavenly Father.

We must experience sorrow enough, suffering enough, guilt enough so we are conscious and appreciative of the heavier burden borne by the Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>My soul pains when His atonement is treated lightly, when the blessing of repentance is reduced to simply \u201ctaking care of it with the bishop,\u201d when there is brief confession without humility or godly sorrow. This attitude of entitlement rather than privilege was recently expressed by a young Church member who wrote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cI have done bad things that I knew were bad because I\u2019ve been taught that ever since I can remember. \u2026 I know repentance is a great gift. Without it I would be lost. I am not ready to repent of my sins; but I know that when I am ready, I can.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Such indulgence in premeditated sin shows pitiful misunderstanding of repentance. As Amulek warned, we must not procrastinate the day of our repentance until the end.

Judgment for us could be today or tomorrow. We must not risk our opportunity to repent. Salvation is not just an escape from the penalty of sin but deliverance from sinfulness. The truly penitent not only seek forgiveness for past sins but plead for the Savior to purge their hearts of the desire or appetite for sin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">5.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Finally, we must acknowledge the gift and comply with the conditions so that redemption might be complete. Love motivates our obedience to God.
