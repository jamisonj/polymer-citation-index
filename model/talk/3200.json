Also, I invite the honest in heart everywhere to join with us in worshiping our divine Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p6\" class=\"\">Since we last met in general conference here on Temple Square in Salt Lake City six months ago, we have witnessed much growth and expansion of the Lord\u2019s kingdom. We have opened a beautiful new temple in South America at Sao Paulo, Brazil, and have rededicated for the work of the Lord the temple in Logan, Utah, for the temple ordinances to be performed there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p7\" class=\"\">Five other temples are in varying stages of construction, and more are in contemplation toward fulfilling the prediction of latter-day prophets that holy temples will dot this and other lands from end to end, where the work of the Lord is being firmly established.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p8\" class=\"\">Our missionary force is constantly growing and is now approximately 28,000 missionaries. We think that there are tens of thousands of brethren and sisters in the Wasatch Front and elsewhere in the Church who could fill regular missions as worthy, able brethren and sisters if their bishops would call them on missions. We recognize that many of these missionaries are young men and young women, and it\u2019s a growing number always. They are spending two years of their lives in the mission field, in the most significant and unselfish volunteer service, to carry the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ to the nations of the world. These numbers are impressive, but we must not stop there. The need is ever greater, and more and more laborers are needed in the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p9\" class=\"\">We have established new missions covering almost all of the free world, and we are turning our attention more diligently now to one day sharing the gospel with our Father\u2019s children behind the so-called iron and bamboo curtains. We have need to prepare for that day. The urgency of that preparation weighs heavily upon us. That day may come with more swiftness than we realize.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p10\" class=\"\">Every year now we are adding approximately a hundred new stakes\u2014the locally governed ecclesiastical units of Mormonism composed of several wards and branches each. Only a few weeks ago we created the thousandth such stake of Zion at Nauvoo, Illinois, a place of deep historical significance to the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p11\" class=\"\">I rejoice with you, my brothers and sisters, in these statistical evidences of the progress and growth throughout Zion. It is indeed progress to add new thousands of people to a membership now in excess of four million. It is pleasing to build the temples and places of worship in so many lands and to add thousands of students to our expanding educational and training programs for both youth and adults.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p12\" class=\"\">We are happy to see the further expansion of our vast Church Welfare program, with new bishops\u2019 storehouses and production units for relief of the poor. The Savior has commanded and charged us with the care of the poor among us since the very earliest days of the Church\u2014even to the directing of the ways in which the responsibility should be discharged\u2014a program which has always stressed the independence of the individual by helping provide work opportunities and guiding lines for those who need rehabilitation. We feel very happy with this growth and all other growth that is being displayed in the Church in all the lands where we go.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p13\" class=\"\">Each of our quorums of the priesthood has increased steadily in membership, as also have our auxiliaries working especially among the children, the youth, and the women of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p14\" class=\"\">In all of this evidence of progress, there is cause for rejoicing, but unfortunately we cannot proclaim that \u201call is well in Zion.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4009\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4009)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4009)\">2 Ne. 28:21<\/a><\/span>] We find that we Latter-day Saints are also vulnerable to the destructive forces of evil that are all about us in this sin-sick world. Of the greatest concern in this day are those evils which tear at the fabric of the home and family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p15\" class=\"\">Often we have called upon our people, and we repeat it again, to give attention to the outward appearance of their homes and buildings, the barns, the sheds, the fences, the places of business, to make our communities attractive and desirable. We have asked, and repeat it again and again, that you plant trees and shrubs and vegetables and berry gardens to beautify your properties and help provide for your needs. Your response to these appeals has been gratifying, and many letters have been received telling of your cooperation in these matters, and we are very proud of you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p16\" class=\"\">Don\u2019t stop. Continue on. But while we would encourage you to continue to give attention to the outward appearance of your homes, we now implore you to give more and more attention to the <span class=\"emphasis\">interior<\/span> of your homes. I do not refer alone to the cleanliness and attractiveness of the home and furnishings, as important as these may be, but to the cleanliness and godliness of the family members and to the general atmosphere that prevails.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p17\" class=\"\">The Church\u2019s long-standing concern for children and its massive commitment in time and energy and resources to improve their lot are well-documented. We are constantly seeking ways to strengthen families and bless children, and that commitment will be continued and reinforced this year and in all the years to come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p18\" class=\"\">The Church welcomes the concerns of others to achieve these beneficial ends through appropriate means. We again are reemphasizing, however, that the greatest blessing we can give our own children and that can be extended to all the children of the world will come through the simple processes of teaching and training them in the way of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p19\" class=\"\">Home life, proper teaching in the home, parental guidance and leadership\u2014these are the panacea for the ailments of the world and its children. They are the cure for spiritual and emotional diseases and the remedy for its problems. Parents should not leave the training of children to others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p20\" class=\"\">There seems to be a growing tendency to shift this responsibility from the home to outside influences such as the school and the church, and of greater concern, to various child-care agencies and institutions. Important as these outward influences may be, they never can adequately take the place of the influence of the mother and the father. Constant training, constant vigilance, companionship, and being watchmen of our own children are necessary in order to keep our homes intact and to bless our children in the Lord\u2019s own way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p21\" class=\"\">The Doctrine and Covenants makes it very clear. It is the responsibility of the parents to teach their children. All other agencies are secondary. If parents do not teach their children\u2014<span class=\"emphasis\">their<\/span> children\u2014they will be held responsible.

We need to constantly guard against immorality, pornography, and sexual permissiveness that would destroy the purity of the family members, young and old.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p23\" class=\"\">Such evils are very real and very threatening.

If so, it is because I <span class=\"emphasis\">am<\/span> alarmed.

They come into our homes on ether waves by radio and the television screen. We find these evil forces almost everywhere we go. Exposure is almost constant. We track them into the home from the school, from the playground, from the theater, the office, and the marketplace. There are but few places we go in our everyday world where we can escape them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p27\" class=\"\">What then must be our service? What must we do? We must be constantly alert to their evil presence in our homes and destroy them as we would the germs and filth of disease. We must hunt them from the closets of our minds, freeing ourselves of such worldliness, quenching the embers of wickedness before they become destructive flames. How do we do this?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p28\" class=\"\">If we would escape those deadly thrusts of the evil one and keep our homes and families free and solidly fortified against all destructive influences so rampant about us, we must have the help of the very founder and organizer of this family plan\u2014the Creator himself. There is only one sure way and that is through the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and being obedient to its profound and inspired teachings. Surely we must be made to realize that the purchase price of a family hearth free of such evil influences is the keeping of the commandments of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p29\" class=\"\">Marriage, <span class=\"emphasis\">honorable<\/span> marriage, is ordained of God.
