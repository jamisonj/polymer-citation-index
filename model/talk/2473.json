A famous surgeon received a phone call one night from a doctor friend who said he had a young child on the operating table and needed the surgeon\u2019s help in order to save the child. It was a long drive across town to the hospital and the surgeon drove as fast as he could with safety. As he pulled up to a stop sign, a man wearing a brown leather jacket opened the door and slid in beside him with his hand in his pocket as though he had a gun. The man was excited, demanded the surgeon\u2019s car, and obviously was in no mood to discuss it. The surgeon stood helplessly on the highway as the man in the brown leather jacket sped away in his car.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p4\" class=\"\">By the time the surgeon finally arrived at the hospital, it was too late. The child had died only moments before. The other doctor asked the surgeon to come with him to meet the child\u2019s father in the hope that together they might offer him words of comfort. As they entered the waiting room, the father came forward\u2014he was the man in the brown leather jacket.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p5\" class=\"\">It occurs to me to wonder whether any of us here tonight are, in a different sense, men in brown leather jackets, who, through our lack of wisdom, perhaps not knowing it, certainly not wishing it, keep spiritual help from reaching our children when they need it. Or if we are young, we are tempted to follow a course that could damage the children that we will one day have.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p6\" class=\"\">This great meeting tonight is not only exciting and encouraging in its evidence of the tremendous priesthood potential in the kingdom of God, it also manifests the capacity of the Church to exercise a powerful influence in helping to meet one of the most vital needs in the world today, and that is supplying models of true manhood for boys who are on their way to becoming men.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p7\" class=\"\">The absence of fathers from their homes, for one reason or another, and the lack of father-image and influence in the lives of boys are obvious factors in the large troubles that face our society. My firmly-held conviction is that in the homes of the Church, and through priesthood leadership in the Church, the problem is correctable; the challenge can be met, if we will.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p8\" class=\"\">Only God knows the worth of a boy, but we too are fathers, and we have an inkling. A boy is priceless not only for himself, but every individual is a kind of an omnibus carrying with him all the past that has gone into his making, all the potential in him for influencing the present, and he has, in addition, the sobering reality to face that he carries within himself the seeds of the future. Under every normal circumstance there will be one day those who call him father, and to them and their future he has a great and solemn responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p9\" class=\"\">Boys need men to learn from, men to be with who understand their need for activities that are challenging and socially and spiritually constructive and that stretch them and give them a chance to learn manly skills, men to love and who love them, men who are models of what a man ought to be. The father should be the first line of strength, and a boy blessed with such a father is fortunate indeed. But of course even such a family can use all the supportive influence they can get from good men who genuinely care. But what of the boy who has no father, or whose father is not presently supplying what a father uniquely can give? To help him, the Lord has provided what I believe to be the finest program the world has ever known\u2014a program of bishops and counselors, advisers, teachers, Scoutmasters, leaders, home teachers, coaches\u2014strong men who really care. If the Lord\u2019s program is effectively operating, literally no boy in the whole Church should be without the blessing of choice men in his life, and every boy will, in fact, have several good men actively concerned for his well-being. I rejoice in the wonderful ward in which we live and in the great men who are interested in my son and the other lads they lead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p10\" class=\"\">Now, it should be said that we have no lack of appreciation for the wonderful influence of mothers and other noble women in guiding boys\u2014and no one in all the world is better qualified than I to understand that\u2014but it takes men to make men. Even mothers cannot do it by themselves, and certainly none should have to undertake the effort alone; nor can schools or other institutions supply the need. Boys need men!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p11\" class=\"\">The implications of this for fathers and for men who hold the priesthood are clear indeed. In many homes, in every neighborhood, in every community, in every ward and branch of the Church, there are boys who need the help of men, mothers who need men to help their boys.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p12\" class=\"\">Is it fair to ask what will happen if boys don\u2019t get what they need from good fathers or conscientious men whose blessing it is to help them? The answer is that they must improvise or learn from other youth as ignorant and inexperienced as themselves. They will learn on street corners or in school corridors where success may be measured in terms of physical, sexual, or economic prowess instead of in terms of character and quality relationships.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p13\" class=\"\">Now, brethren, if we need to do better than we are doing, and wish to do better, what program shall we follow? There is time here tonight to consider only the beginning of one answer among many, but that is a vital answer, and it needs to be understood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p\" class=\"\">In chapter 36 of the book of Alma in the Book of Mormon is a remarkable lesson for every father, or for those who stand in place of a father.

Remember that Alma, in youthful rebelliousness, had made some serious mistakes. He wanted his sons to avoid those mistakes and to find what he, Alma, had discovered of the tender mercies of God, without the terrible, painful experiences through which he had gone. In this deeply honest account Alma bore record of the torment through which he had passed and shared with Helaman three great messages which every father would want to deliver to his own son.

Nephi, you will remember, had himself been blessed with marvelous spiritual experiences, but he loved his father so much that, instead of criticizing or taking over, he helped him regain his self-respect and confidence by going to his father and asking Lehi to inquire of God where he, Nephi, should hunt. With that support, the older man found his faith and was again able to lead his people. The story itself is a minor incident in the Book of Mormon, but the lesson is not minor. It is no small thing to reestablish confidence and faith in a man at a critical point in his life when he has failed and is full of self-doubt.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p33\" class=\"\">So the scriptures are one remarkable and perhaps largely untapped source of strength for choice young men on their way to adult influence and responsibility, and for those who are now charged to guide them.

Early in his life, while he was a magistrate, a man was convicted of theft in his courtroom. The young judge felt compelled to impose a sentence of imprisonment. But when the man explained that he had stolen food to feed his impoverished family, the judge suspended the sentence and then levied a fine on every person in the courtroom for living in a city where a man had to steal bread to feed his family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p35\" class=\"\">One wonders if some such liability may not, in justice, one day be imposed upon parents and teachers and other adults in the Church who have failed to feed our young the bread of life for whatever reason.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p36\" class=\"\">Perhaps both boys and men will understand the analogy of an automobile which a young man desperately wanted and which his father promised him on his birthday if he merited it. \u201cJust go with sensible people and do sensible things,\u201d said the father, \u201cand on your birthday I\u2019ll see that you get the kind of car you want.\u201d The automobile was described in detail, with all the equipment a boy could imagine. So he went with sensible people, and did sensible things, and prepared himself, hoping almost beyond hope for the big day. It arrived. He looked out the window of the house and saw the car of his dreams sitting there. It had everything on it which he in his imagination had conceived. He could scarcely contain himself with love and appreciation. He ran from the house, looked it over, and then went back to his dad for the key.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/boys-need-men.p37\" class=\"\">\u201cThe key?\u201d said the father. \u201cOh, the key.
