Within the hour all who are assembled here\nwill be journeying to their homes. I am reminded in this thought of an experience at a\nnewsstand the other day. I walked about observing the magazines. I was intrigued by the\nnumber of those devoted to the restyling and beautification of our homes. Done in four-color\nprinting on good paper, their titles alone were enough to excite the imagination in the\ndirection of improvement, and their contents was a most compelling display of suggestions on\nhow to dress up the old place or plan for a new one.\n<\/p><p>\nThen my eyes drifted to the news magazines. Boldly printed on the cover of one of these was\na shocking question: \"Will city streets ever be safe again?\" Inside I read a provocative\ninterview between the editors of the magazine and the president of the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, Stanley R. Schrotel of Cincinnati. The interview describes\nwhat we have read so frequently of late&mdash;the rising tide of assault, robbery, and other serious\ncrimes inflicted on unsuspecting people by criminals, who, for the most part, are young men,\nmany of them yet in their teens. News stories indicate that one cannot safely walk the streets\nof some of our proudest cities. This is not only in the United States; the same problem is also\nfelt across the world.\n<\/p><p>\nI quote from the interview with Chief Schrotel: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Q. Are you saying that parents are to blame, really, for juvenile delinquency?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"A. I'd have to say that there is a woeful need today for greater strength in the home, greater\nrespect for parents as the authority symbol, and more parental guidance.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI find only one interpretation of this&mdash;serious failure in the homes of the people. There is\nfailure in cultivating those virtues which lead to respect for law, respect for associates, even\nrespect for self.\n<\/p><p>\nOther symptoms, less dramatic, but equally far-reaching in their consequences, are found in\nthe rising toll of domestic tragedies, the broken homes the children cast adrift from the ties\nthat should give security and stability to their lives. Add to this the cases of warped integrity,\nof malfeasance, of dereliction of duty, and we have a sordid and miserable\npicture.\n<\/p><p>\nPaul of old declared to Timothy: \"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall\ncome.\" He said nothing of atomic bombs or intercontinental missiles or death-dealing\nsubmarines.\n<\/p><p>\nRather, they shall be perilous because \". . . men shall be lovers of their own selves . . .\nblasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, .\n<\/p><p>\n\"Without natural affection . . . despisers of those that are good\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5144\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5144)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5144)\">2 Tim. 3:1-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe police chief lists some of the things he would do to curb this distressing problem. He\nincludes stricter law enforcement and more prison sentences. I would not presume to question\nhis formula as an expediency, but I think it is not a basic and enduring solution. The tide will\nbe turned only as the principles governing the behavior of the people are altered.\n<\/p><p>\nHonesty, character, integrity do not come of legislation or police action. Only as we build\nback into the fiber of our lives the virtues which are the essence of true civilization will the\npattern of our times change. That building process must begin in the homes of the people. It\nmust begin with recognition of God as our Eternal Father, of our relationship to him as his\nchildren, with communication with him in recognition of his sovereign position, and in\nsupplication for his guidance in our affairs.\n<\/p><p>\nPrayer, family prayer in the homes of this and other lands, is one of the simple medicines that\nwould check the dread disease that has eroded the fiber of our character. It is as simple as\nsunshine and would be as effective in curing our malady. We could not expect a miracle in a\nday, but in a generation we would have a miracle.\n<\/p><p>\nA generation or two ago family prayer in the homes of Christian people throughout the world\nwas as much a part of the day's activity as was eating. As that practice has diminished, our\nmoral decay has ensued.\n<\/p><p>\nI feel satisfied that there is no adequate substitute for the morning and evening practice of\nkneeling together&mdash;father, mother, and children. This, more than heavy carpets more than\nlovely draperies, more than cleverly balanced color schemes, is the thing that will make for\nbetter and more beautiful homes.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is something in the very posture of kneeling that contradicts the attitudes described by\nPaul: proud, \". . . heady, high-minded\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5148\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5148)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5148)\">2 Tim. 3:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is something in the very practice of father and mother and children kneeling together\nthat evaporates others of those qualities he described: \". . . disobedient to parents . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"Without natural affection\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5146\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5146)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5146)\">2 Tim. 3:2-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is something in the act of addressing the\nDeity that offsets a tendency toward blasphemy and toward becoming lovers of pleasure more\nthan lovers of God.\n<\/p><p>\nThe inclination to be unholy, as Paul described it, to be unthankful, is erased as together the\nfamily thank the Lord for life and peace and all they have.\n<\/p><p>\nThe scripture declares: \"Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14274\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14274)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14274)\">D&amp;C 59:7<\/a><\/span>). And\nagain: \". . . in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those\nwho confess not his hand\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14279\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14279)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14279)\">D&amp;C 59:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn remembering together before the Lord the poor, the needy, and the oppressed, there is\ndeveloped, unconsciously but realistically, a love for others above self, a respect for others, a\ndesire to serve the needs of others. One cannot ask God to help a neighbor in distress without\nfeeling motivated to do something oneself toward helping that neighbor. What miracles would\nhappen in the lives of the children of America, and of the world, if they would lay aside their\nown selfishness and lose themselves in the service of others. The seed from which this\nsheltering and fruitful tree may grow is best planted and nurtured in the daily supplications of\nthe family.\n<\/p><p>\nI know of no better way to inculcate love for country than for parents to pray before their\nchildren for the President and the Congress or the Queen and the Parliament\nof the land of their citizenship.\n<\/p><p>\nRecently I have seen on billboards in some of our cities a statement which reads, \"A nation at\nprayer is a nation at peace.\" I believe this. I hope this is more than a catchy motto. I am\nsatisfied that we shall not have peace unless and until we request it in the name of the Prince\nof Peace.\n<\/p><p>\nI know of nothing that will ease family tensions, that in a subtle way will bring about the\nrespect for parents which leads to obedience, that will affect the spirit of repentance which\nwill largely erase the blight of broken homes, than will praying together, confessing\nweaknesses together before the Lord, and invoking the blessings of the Lord upon the home\nand those who dwell there.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been impressed by a statement made by a man long since dead, the father of one of the\ngreat men who sits on this stand. James H. Moyle wrote to his grandchildren concerning the\nfamily prayer of his own home. He said: \"We have not gone to bed before kneeling in prayer\nto supplicate divine guidance and approval. Differences may arise in the best governed\nfamilies, but they will be dissipated by the . . . spirit of prayer . . . Its very psychology tends\nto promote the more righteous life among men. It tends to unity, love, forgiveness, to\nservice.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn 1872 Colonel Thomas L. Kane, the great friend of our people in the days of their distress\nin Iowa and at the time of the coming of the army to this valley, came west again with his\nwife and two sons. They traveled to St. George with Brigham Young, stopping each night in\nthe homes along the way. Mrs. Kane wrote a series of letters to her father back in\nPhiladelphia. In one of these she said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"At every one of the places we stayed on this journey we had prayers immediately after the\ndinner-supper, and prayers again before breakfast. No one was excused . . . the Mormons . . .\nkneel at once, while the head of the household, or an honored guest prays aloud  . . . They\nspend very little time in ascriptions, but ask for what they need, and thank Him for what He\nhas given.... (They) take it for granted that God knows our familiar names and titles, and will\nask a blessing on (a particular individual by name) . . . I liked this when I became used to\nit.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOh, that we as a people might cultivate this practice which was of such importance to our\npioneer forebears. Family prayer was as much a part of their worship as were the meetings\nconvened in this tabernacle. With the faith that came of these daily invocations, they grubbed\nthe sagebrush, led the waters to the parched soil, made the desert blossom, governed their\nfamilies in love, lived in peace one with another, and made their names immortal as they lost\nthemselves in the service of God.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have reached the tragic point in our history where evidently we cannot invoke the\nblessings of God in our schools, but we can pray in our homes. The family is the unit of\nsociety. The praying family is the hope of a better society. \"Seek ye the Lord while he may\nbe found\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25241\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25241)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25241)\">Isa. 55:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI was touched last fall by the heartbreaking statement of a young\nman in Japan. He said, \"I have been here for months. I can't learn the language. I dislike the\npeople. I am depressed by day and sleep at night. I wanted to die. I wrote my mother and\npleaded for an excuse to return home. I have her reply. She says: We're praying for you.\nThere is not a day passes that all of us do not kneel together in the morning before we eat\nand in the evening before we retire and plead with the Lord for his blessing upon you. We\nhave added fasting to our prayer, and when your younger brothers and sisters pray they say,\n\"Heavenly Father, bless Johnny in Japan and help him to learn the language and do the work\nhe was called to do.\"'\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis young man then went on to say through his tears, \"I will try again. I will add my prayers\nto theirs and my fasting to their fasting.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow, four months later, I have a letter from him in which he says, \"A miracle has happened.\nThe language has come to me as a gift from the Lord. I have learned to love the people\nin this beautiful land. God be thanked for the prayers of my family.\"\n<\/p><p>\nCan we make our homes more beautiful? Yes, through addressing ourselves as families to the\nsource of all true beauty. Can we strengthen our society and make it a better place in which\nto live? Yes, by strengthening the virtue of our family life through kneeling together and\nsupplicating the Almighty in the name of his Beloved Son.\n<\/p><p>\nThis simple practice, a return to family worship, spreading across the land and over the earth,\nwould in a generation largely lift the blight that is destroying us, and it would restore\nintegrity, mutual respect, and a spirit of thankfulness in the hearts of the people. That we of\nthis great Church, the kingdom of God may be faithful in setting an example before the world\nin this practice and in encouraging others to do likewise, I humbly pray, as I leave with you\nmy testimony of its virtue, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
