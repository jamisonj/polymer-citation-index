On the seat next to mine was a news magazine opened to an article which intrigued me. It was entitled \u201cThe Doubting American\u2014A Growing Breed\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">U.S. News and World Report,<\/span> 26 Feb. 1979, p. 74). Its message was that belief, the energizer of progress and the cement of civilization since the dawn of history, is running into trouble. People no longer have confidence in their government leaders. They think business does not have the integrity it once had, and even more alarming, a survey indicated there is less feeling regarding their obligation to religion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p4\" class=\"\">The conclusion to the questions asked on religion was that organized religion is not playing a central role in the religious lives of a sizable portion of the unchurched. Many feel that they can go it alone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p5\" class=\"\">Then the article went on to point out that young people gave replies like: \u201cWhy should I do something for another person? We do not see anymore why we shouldn\u2019t steal, why we shouldn\u2019t commit adultery, why we should honor our mother and our father.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p6\" class=\"\">I would guess it would be only natural in a world beset by one major problem after another that fears and doubts would trouble the souls of mankind. How contrary, however, is the lesson of history that man within himself cannot solve his problems. How fallacious is the thinking that one can be a law unto himself. How wrong it is to believe each individual can establish his own moral code, standards for honesty, and principles to be governed by. I have not found in history the success of any peoples who attempted to live under such an order. In fact, history has recorded that those civilizations which have been able to establish a value standard, a central belief, a uniting together, have experienced the greatest progress.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p7\" class=\"\">The religious history of mankind has demonstrated the success of those peoples who were strong enough to follow a standard which was above those established just by man. From the very beginning prophets have been heard to encourage mankind to seek a higher kingdom, the kingdom of God. We find, in the early pages of the Book of Mormon, Nephi warning the people:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized in his name, having perfect faith in the Holy One of Israel, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4002\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4002)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4002)\">2 Ne. 9:23<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p9\" class=\"\">John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, preparing the way for the mission of our Savior on earth, cried to the people, \u201cRepent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36627\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36627)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36627)\">Matt. 3:2<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p10\" class=\"\">As the Church was restored to the earth in this dispensation, the people were admonished to assist in building the kingdom of God here on earth in preparation for the return of our Lord and Savior. Brigham Young, addressing the Saints at Winter Quarters in 1847, said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cThe kingdom which we are establishing is not of this world, but is the kingdom of the Great God.

When a person determines to live a higher law, there should be a visible difference, a marked change in his appearance, his actions, the way he treats others, and the way he serves his fellowmen and his God. The scriptures are full of dramatic changes which occurred in the lives of individuals when they were converted to living the law of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p14\" class=\"\">There is a story in the Book of Mormon about the conflict that was occurring between those who wanted to believe and the unbelievers who were on the earth at that particular time. The scriptures record:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now it came to pass that the persecutions which were inflicted on the church by the unbelievers became so great that the church began to murmur, and complain to their leaders concerning the matter; and they did complain to Alma. And Alma laid the case before their king, Mosiah.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd it came to pass that king Mosiah sent a proclamation throughout the land round about that there should not any unbeliever persecute any of those who belonged to the church of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p17\" class=\"\">The sad part of the story is \u2026 \u201cThe sons of Mosiah were numbered among the unbelievers; and also one of the sons of Alma was numbered among them, he being called Alma, after his father; nevertheless, he became a very wicked and an idolatrous man. And he was a man of many words, and did speak much flattery to the people; therefore he led many of the people to do after the manner of his iniquities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the church of God; stealing away the hearts of the people; causing much dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his power over them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now it came to pass \u2026 he was going about to destroy the church of God, for he did go about secretly with the sons of Mosiah seeking to destroy the church, and to lead astray the people of the Lord, contrary to the commandments of God, or even the king\u2014\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40463\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40463)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40463)\">Mosiah 27:1\u20132, 8\u201310<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p20\" class=\"\">As Alma the Younger was going about in rebellion, an angel of the Lord appeared to him and the sons of Mosiah, and spake as with a voice of thunder.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the earth.\u201d And then the angel commanded him, saying, \u201cAlma, arise and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God?

He could not open his mouth, he became so weak he could not move his hands or his legs, and the people had to carry him and lay him before his father and rehearse before him all the things that had happened. Alma\u2019s father rejoiced, for he knew the Lord had answered his prayers, and he caused the priests to assemble themselves together, and they fasted and prayed that Alma would again receive the use of his limbs and receive his speech. They fasted and prayed for the space of two days and two nights. After such a display of faith, Alma received his strength and stood up and began to speak to those assembled and said: \u201cI have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit,<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p24\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40465\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40465)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40465)\">Mosiah 27:24\u201326<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-kingdom-of-god.p26\" class=\"\">Alma\u2019s life was changed.
