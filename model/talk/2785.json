The Articles of Confederation had been adopted but proved to be ineffectual. Under this instrument, the nation was without a president, a head. There was a congress, but it was a body destitute of any power. There was no supreme court.

George Washington, the presiding officer at the convention, was fifty-five. Alexander Hamilton was only thirty-two; James Madison, who recorded the proceedings of the convention with his remarkable <span class=\"emphasis\">Notes,<\/span> was only thirty-six. These were young men, but men of exceptional character, \u201csober, seasoned, distinguished men of affairs, drawn from various walks of life.\u201d (J.

Four had been on Washington\u2019s personal staff during the war. Among that assembly of the thirty-nine signers were to be found two future presidents of the United States, one the \u201cFather of his Country\u201d; a vice-president of the United States; a secretary of the treasury; a secretary of war; a secretary of state; two chief justices of the Supreme Court, and three who served as justices; and the venerable Franklin, a diplomat, philosopher, scientist, and statesman.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-constitution-a-glorious-standard.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cThey were not backwoodsmen from far-off frontiers, not one of them. \u2026 <span class=\"emphasis\">There has not been another such group of men in all<\/span> [the 200 years of our <span class=\"emphasis\">history<\/span>] <span class=\"emphasis\">that even challenged the supremacy of this group.<\/span>\u201d (J.

In 1787 three states ratified the Constitution. In the next year eight more followed; and on April 6, 1789, 187 years ago today, the Constitution of the United States went into operation as the basic law of the United States when the electoral college unanimously elected George Washington as the first president of the nation. This date, I believe, was not accidental.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-constitution-a-glorious-standard.p15\" class=\"\">In the final analysis, what the framers did, under the inspiration of God, was to draft a document that merited the approval of God himself, who declared it to \u201cbe maintained for the rights and protection of <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> flesh.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16754\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16754)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16754)\">D&amp;C 101:77<\/a><\/span>; italics added.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-constitution-a-glorious-standard.p16\" class=\"\">The document has been criticized by some as outmoded, and even a recent president of the United States criticized it as a document \u201cwritten for an entirely different period in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">U.S. News and World Report,<\/span> Dec. 17, 1962, p. 104.)

The founders had a strong distrust for centralized power in a federal government. So they created a government with checks and balances. This was to prevent any branch of the government from becoming too powerful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-constitution-a-glorious-standard.p20\" class=\"\">Congress could pass laws, but the president could check this with a veto. Congress, however, could override the veto, and by its means of initiative in taxation, could further restrain the executive department. The Supreme Court could nullify laws passed by the Congress and signed by the president. But Congress could limit the Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. The president could appoint judges for their lifetime with the consent of the Senate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-constitution-a-glorious-standard.p21\" class=\"\">Each branch of the government was also made subject to different political pressures.
