Way back then, by means of a 4-H Club project involving purebred Duroc pigs, I became familiar with work! As proof that what follows is not merely swollen memory, may I, with Elder Nelson\u2019s help, display very briefly this blanket of nearly 100 ribbons won by my prize pigs at various fairs over several years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p6\" class=\"\">Up near Elder Nelson\u2019s hand is a pink ribbon, won 60 years ago. It was the very first ribbon I ever won. I think the judge had a tender eye, and the pig wasn\u2019t really so choice, but he knew I needed encouragement and hence the fourth prize. The purple ribbons were for champions that were exhibited later on!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p7\" class=\"\">Thank you, Elder Nelson.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p8\" class=\"\">Brethren, I learned the hard way about the need to watch shifting pork prices at the local meat-packing plant. Careful records of profits and losses were kept with the help of my bookkeeper father. As in all things, my parents, so supportive, even ended up doing some of the perspiring themselves, including a special mother born 95 years ago today. She showed me how to work, and she loved me enough to correct me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p9\" class=\"\">In order to obtain low-cost pig feed, I regularly bought dozens and dozens of three-day-old loaves of bread at a bakery for a mere penny a loaf. Additionally, if present at the right time at a local dairy, I could get about 70 gallons of skim milk <span class=\"emphasis\">free!<\/span> Now I pay $2.50 a gallon\u2014an amusing irony. By saving in these ways, I could buy the needed grain for the pigs with the little hard cash that I had.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p10\" class=\"\">There were many times when a pregnant sow would give birth to her litter after midnight. The resultant weariness of attending to all that, and more, was real. Yet through it all, there was a sense of some accomplishment, including contributing to our family menus. Most young men my age did similar work. Back then, brethren, we were all poor together, and we didn\u2019t know it. Work was a given. Today, for some, receiving is a given.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p11\" class=\"\">However, there were real social downsides to raising pigs. Already shy, I remember vividly the principal of the junior high school coming into my class once and saying aloud in front of everybody: \u201cNeal, your mother just called. Your pigs are out!\u201d I felt like crawling under my desk but instead ran home to help round up the pigs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p12\" class=\"\">My father was loving but exacting. He noted that while I worked hard, my work was often not carefully done. I was a stranger to excellence. One summer day I determined to please Dad by putting in a number of needed fence posts, firmly implanted and fully aligned. I worked hard all that day and then scanned the lane expectantly down which my father would walk home. When he arrived, I watched anxiously as he carefully inspected the fence posts, even checking them with a level bar before pronouncing them to be fully satisfactory. Then came his praise. My sweat of the brow had earned Dad\u2019s commendation which, in turn, melted my heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p13\" class=\"\">Please forgive this brief autobiographical note, which I have used to express my deep appreciation for learning to work at an early age. Even so, brethren, I certainly did not always put my shoulder to the wheel with a \u201cheart full of song,\u201d but I did learn about shoulders and wheels, which helped later in life, when the wheels grew larger. Some of today\u2019s otherwise good young men mistakenly think that putting their shoulders to the wheel is the same thing as putting their hands on a steering wheel!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p14\" class=\"\">Our Heavenly Father has described His vast plan for His children by saying, \u201cBehold, this is my <span class=\"emphasis\">work<\/span> and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39975\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39975)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39975)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added). Consider the significance of the Lord\u2019s use of the word <span class=\"emphasis\">work.<\/span> What He is doing so lovingly and redemptively is, nevertheless, work\u2014even for Him! We, likewise, speak of \u201cworking out our salvation,\u201d [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"41350\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41350)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41350)\">Philip. 2:12<\/a><\/span>] of the \u201claw of the harvest,\u201d [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"23376\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23376)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23376)\">Gal. 6:7<\/a><\/span>] and of the \u201csweat of the brow\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"39978\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39978)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39978)\">Moses 5:1<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24145\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24145)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24145)\">Inspired Version, Gen. 4:1<\/a><\/span>). These are not idle phrases. Instead, they underscore the importance of work. In fact, brethren, work is always a spiritual necessity even if, for some, work is not an economic necessity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p15\" class=\"\">Thus I speak to you as good young men, including seven fine grandsons listening tonight, among them two missionaries and three recently ordained deacons. I remind you that the gospel of work is part of \u201cthe fulness of the gospel.\u201d Though joyful, missionary work is work. Though joyful, temple work is work. Alas, a few of our underwhelmed youth work all right, but mostly at trying to please themselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p16\" class=\"\">Unfortunately, a few of our otherwise good youth are unstretched, having almost a free pass. Perks are provided, including cars complete with fuel and insurance\u2014all paid for by parents who sometimes listen in vain for a few courteous and appreciative words.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p17\" class=\"\">Young men, your individual mix of work will vary, understandably, by season and circumstance as between the hours spent on <span class=\"emphasis\">homework<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">family work<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">Church work, part-time work,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">work on service projects.<\/span> Each form of work can stretch your talents. Nevertheless, watch for the warning lights. For instance, if you are engaged in <span class=\"emphasis\">part-time work,<\/span> are all your wages spent on yourself? Is tithing paid? Is some saved for a mission? President Spencer W. Kimball gave us this crisp counsel: \u201c[If the young man] is permitted to spend his all on himself, that spirit of selfishness may continue with him to his grave\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball<\/span> [1982], 560).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p18\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Homework<\/span> from school is surely a necessity, but does mental work squeeze out spiritual work entirely? Your grade-point average is very important, but what is your GPA for Christian service?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p19\" class=\"\">Doing <span class=\"emphasis\">Church work<\/span> can develop vital reflexes, and the need for this form of work will never cease. But are you merely going through the motions?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p20\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Family work<\/span> is vital too, but does it really go beyond merely keeping your own rooms clean and picking up your own clothes?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p21\" class=\"\">Whatever the mix of work, the hardest work you and I will ever do is to put off our selfishness. It is heavy lifting!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p22\" class=\"\">A balance of work needs to be orchestrated, because some forms of work tend to dominate other forms, like fathers working late at the office too often. Our preferred chores need little encouragement just as in Elder Spencer Condie\u2019s paraphrase of Strauss\u2019s warning to orchestra conductors: \u201cNever give an encouraging nod to the brass section, or you\u2019ll never hear the strings again!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p23\" class=\"\">Be careful, fathers, when you inordinately desire things to be better for your children than they were for you. Do not, however unintentionally, make things worse by removing the requirement for reasonable work as part of their experience, thereby insulating your children from the very things that helped make you what you are!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p24\" class=\"\">Granted, some tactical situations have changed! For most young men, there are no cows to be milked, pigs to be fed, et cetera. Yes, some of today\u2019s work may seem artificial and contrived. Nevertheless, young men, be patient with your parents as they try to help provide reasonable and meaningful work. In that connection, how blessed we would be if more sons could work alongside their fathers, if only occasionally. Fathers and sons, if such teaming up is not already happening at all, please, in the next three months, select just one, stretching chore to do together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p25\" class=\"\">Young men, I do not know what your individual gifts are, but you have them!

Long ago, President Brigham Young advised: \u201cI want to see our Elders so full of integrity that [their work] will be preferred. \u2026 If we live our religion and are worthy [of] the name \u2026 Latter-day Saints, we are just the men that all such business can be entrusted to with perfect safety; if it can not [be] it will prove that we do not live our religion\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young<\/span> [1954], 232\u201333).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p29\" class=\"\">When the time comes, young men, make your career choices. Know that whether one is a neurosurgeon, forest ranger, mechanic, farmer, or teacher is a matter of preference not of principle. While those career choices are clearly very important, these do not mark your real career path. Instead, brethren, you are sojourning sons of God who have been invited to take the path that leads home. There, morticians will find theirs is not the only occupation to become obsolete. But the capacity to work and work wisely will never become obsolete. And neither will the ability to learn. Meanwhile, my young brethren, I have not seen any perspiration-free shortcuts to the celestial kingdom; there is no easy escalator to take us there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p30\" class=\"\">Now, whether holders of the Aaronic or the Melchizedek Priesthood, at no time has it been more important for you to know <span class=\"emphasis\">who<\/span> you are than in today\u2019s world.

You were actually with God in the beginning (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20963\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20963)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20963)\">D&amp;C 93:29<\/a><\/span>).
