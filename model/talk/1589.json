On that day, the quiet air of Sinai's desert was broken as jet aircraft\nstreaked toward their targets, cannons sounded, tanks lumbered, men fought and died, women\nwept, children cried. The Holy Land, once the personal province of the Prince of Peace (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25328\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25328)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25328)\">Isa. 9:6<\/a><\/span>), again\nwas shattered by war.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Sounds of conflict and war<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThis troubled land has witnessed much conflict; its peoples have suffered terrible trials and\ntribulations. No single battle is better remembered, however, than occurred in the Valley of\nElah during the year 1063 B.C. Along the mountains on one side, the feared armies of the\nPhilistines were marshaled to march directly to the heart of Judah and the Jordan Valley. On\nthe other side of the valley, King Saul had drawn up his armies in opposition.\n<\/p><p>\nHistorians tell us that the opposing forces were about evenly matched in number and in skill.\nHowever, the Philistines had managed to keep secret their valued knowledge of smelting and\nfashioning iron into formidable weapons of war.  The sound of hammers pounding upon\nanvils and the sight of smoke rising skyward from many bellows as the smiths went about the\ntask of sharpening weapons and fashioning new ones must have struck fear into the hearts of\nSaul's warriors; for even the most novice of soldiers could know the superiority of iron\nweapons to those of brass.\n<\/p><p>\nAs often happened when armies faced each other, individual champions challenged others\nfrom the opposing forces to single combat.  There was considerable precedent for this sort of\nfighting; and on more than one occasion, notably during the tenure of Samson as judge,\nbattles had been decided by individual combat.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Single combat&mdash;Goliath vs. David<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow, however, the situation was reversed as far as Israel was concerned, and it was a\nPhilistine who dared to challenge all others&mdash;a veritable giant of a man called Goliath of\nGath.  Old accounts tell us that Goliath was ten feet tall.  He wore brass armor and a coat of\nmail.  And the staff of his spear would stagger a strong man merely to lift, let alone hurl. \nHis shield was the longest ever seen or heard of, his sword a fearsome blade\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2566\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2566)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2566)\">1 Sam. 17:4-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis champion from the Philistine camp stood and cried unto the armies of Israel: \"Why are\nye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose\nyou a man for you, and let him come down to me\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2567\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2567)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2567)\">1 Sam. 17:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHis challenge was that if he were overpowered by the Israelite warrior, then all the Philistines\nwould become servants to the Israelites.  On the other hand, if he were victorious, the\nIsraelites would become their slaves. Goliath roared: \"I defy the armies of Israel this day; give\nme a man, that we may fight together\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2568\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2568)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2568)\">1 Sam. 17:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, for 40 days came the challenge met only by fear and trembling. And all the men of\nIsrael, when they saw the man Goliath, \"fled from him and were sore afraid\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2569\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2569)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2569)\">1 Sam. 17:24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Faith of a shepherd boy<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThere was one, however, who did not quake with fear nor run in alarm. Rather, he stiffened\nthe spine of Israel's soldiers by his piercing question of rebuke toward them: \". . . Is there\nnot a cause? . . . Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with\nthis Philistine\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2570\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2570)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2570)\">1 Sam. 17:29,32<\/a><\/span>). David, the shepherd boy, had spoken.  But he did not\nspeak just as a shepherd boy, for the hands of Samuel, God's prophet, had rested upon his\nhead and anointed him, and the Spirit of the Lord had come upon him.\n<\/p><p>\nSaul said to David: \"Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou\nart but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2571\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2571)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2571)\">1 Sam. 17:33<\/a><\/span>). But David persevered\nand, bedecked with the armor of Saul, prepared to meet the giant.  Realizing his helplessness\nso garbed, David discarded the armor, took instead his staff in his hand, chose five smooth\nstones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag; and with his sling in hand, he drew\nnear to the Philistine.\n<\/p><p>\nAll of us remember the shocked exclamation of Goliath: \"Am I a dog, that thou comest to me\nwith staves? . . . Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the\nbeasts of the field\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2573\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2573)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2573)\">1 Sam. 17:43-44<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen David said: \"Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I\ncome to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou\nhast defied.\n<\/p><p>\n\"This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand . . . that all the earth may know that there\nis a God in Israel.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for the\nbattle is the Lord's, and he will give you into our hands.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that\nDavid hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the\nPhilistine . . . that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.\n<\/p><p>\n\"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the\nPhilistine, and slew him\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2574\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2574)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2574)\">1 Sam. 17:45-50<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe battle had thus been fought.  The victory had been won.  David emerged a national hero,\nhis destiny before him.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Acclaimed hero<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSome of us remember David as a shepherd boy divinely commissioned by the Lord through\nthe prophet Samuel. Others of us know him as a mighty warrior, for doesn't the record show\nthe chant of the adoring women following his many victorious battles, \"Saul\nhas slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2576\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2576)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2576)\">1 Sam. 18:7<\/a><\/span>)? Or perhaps we look\nupon him as the inspired poet or as one of Israel's greatest kings.  Still others recall that he\nviolated the laws of God and took that which belonged to another&mdash;the beautiful Bathsheba.\nHe even arranged the death of her husband, Uriah.\n<\/p><p>\nI, however, like to think of David as the righteous lad who had the courage and the faith to\nface insurmountable odds when all others hesitated, and to redeem the name of Israel by\nfacing that giant in his life&mdash;Goliath of Gath.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A Goliath in your life?<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWell might we look carefully into our own lives and judge our courage, our faith. Is there a\nGoliath in your life?  Is there one in mine?  Does he stand squarely between you and your\ndesired happiness?  Oh, your Goliath may not carry a sword or hurl a verbal challenge of\ninsult that all may hear and force you to decision.  He may not be ten feet tall, but he likely\nwill appear equally as formidable, and his silent challenge may shame and embarrass.\n<\/p><p>\nOne man's Goliath may be the stranglehold of a cigarette or perhaps an unquenchable thirst\nfor alcohol. To another, his Goliath may be an unruly tongue or a selfish streak that causes\nhim to spurn the poor and the downtrodden.\n<\/p><p>\nEnvy, greed, fear, laziness, doubt, vice, pride, lust, selfishness, discouragement&mdash;all spell\nGoliath.\n<\/p><p>\nThe giant you face will not diminish in size or in power or strength by your vain hoping,\nwishing, or waiting for him to do so.  Rather, he increases in power as his hold upon you\ntightens.\n<\/p><p>\nThe poet Alexander Pope truly describes this truth: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,<br \/>\n      As, to be hated, needs but to be seen; <br \/>\n      Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,<br \/>\n      We first endure, then pity, then embrace.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe battle for our immortal souls is no less important than the battle fought by David.  The\nenemy is no less formidable, the help of Almighty God no farther away.  What will our\naction be?  Like David of old, \"our cause is just.\" We have been placed upon earth not to fail\nor fall victim to temptation's snare, but rather to succeed.  Our giant, our Goliath, must be\nconquered.\n<\/p><p>\nDavid went to the brook and carefully selected five smooth stones with which he might meet\nhis enemy (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2572\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2572)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2572)\">1 Sam. 17:40<\/a><\/span>).  He was deliberate in his selection, for there could be no turning back, no second\nchance&mdash;this battle was to be decisive.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Equipment essential to victory<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJust as David went to the brook, well might we go to our source of supply&mdash;the Lord.  What\npolished stones will you select to defeat the Goliath that is robbing you of your happiness by\nsmothering your opportunities?  May I offer suggestions: \n<\/p><p>\nThe stone of <i>courage<\/i> will be essential to your victory.  As we survey the challenge of life,\nthat which is easy is rarely right. In fact, the course that we should properly follow at times\nappears impossible, impenetrable, hopeless.\n<\/p><p>\nSuch did the way appear to Laman and Lemuel.  When they looked upon their assignment to\ngo unto the house of Laban and seek the records according to God's command, they\nmurmured, saying it was a hard thing that was required of them (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1640\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1640)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1640)\">1 Ne. 3:5<\/a><\/span>).  Thus, a lack of courage\ntook from them their opportunity; and it was given to courageous Nephi, who responded, \"I\nwill go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth\nno commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they\nmay accomplish the thing which he commandeth them\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1641\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1641)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1641)\">1 Ne. 3:7<\/a><\/span>). Yes, the stone of\ncourage is needed.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us not overlook the stone of <i>effort<\/i>&mdash;mental effort and physical effort.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The heights by great men reached and kept<br \/>\n      Were not obtained by sudden flight,<br \/>\n      But they, while their companions slept.<br \/>\n      Were toiling upward through the night.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;      (\"Ladder of St. Augustine.\")\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Decisive action<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe decision to overcome a fault or correct a weakness is an actual step in the process of\ndoing so.  \"Thrust in thy sickle with thy might\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14903\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14903)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14903)\">D&amp;C 4:4<\/a><\/span>) was not spoken of missionary work alone.\n<\/p><p>\nThen there must be in our selection the stone of <i>humility<\/i>, for haven't we been told through\ndivine revelation that when we are humble, the Lord, our God, will lead us by the hand and\ngive us answer to our prayers?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd who would go forth to battle his Goliath without the stone of <i>prayer<\/i>, remembering that\nthe recognition of a power higher than oneself is in no way debasing; rather it exalts.\n<\/p><p>\nFinally, let us choose the stone of <i>duty<\/i>.  Duty is not merely doing the thing we ought to do,\nbut doing it when we should, whether we like it or not.\n<\/p><p>\nArmed with this selection of five polished stones to be propelled by the mighty sling of faith,\nwe need then but to take the staff of virtue to steady us; and we are ready to meet the giant\nGoliath, wherever, and whenever, and however we find him.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Marshal resources for battle<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe stone of <i>courage<\/i> will melt the Goliath of fear; the stone of <i>effort<\/i> will bring down the\nGoliaths of indecision and procrastination.  And the Goliaths of pride, of envy, of lack of\nself-respect will not stand before the power of the stones of <i>humility, prayer<\/i>, and <i>duty<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>\nAbove all else, may we ever remember that we do not go forth alone to battle against the\nGoliaths of our lives. As David declared to Israel, so might we echo the knowledge, \". . . the\nbattle is the Lord's, and he will give [Goliath] into our hands\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2575\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2575)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2575)\">1 Sam. 17:47<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>No victory by default<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe battle must be fought.  Victory cannot come by default.  So it is in the battles of life. \nLife will never spread itself in an unobstructed view before us.  We must anticipate the\napproaching forks and turnings in the road.\n<\/p><p>\nHowever, we cannot hope to reach our desired journey's end if we think aimlessly about\nwhether to go east or west.  We must make our decisions purposefully.  Our most significant\nopportunities will be found in times of greatest difficulty.\n<\/p><p>\nThe vast, uncharted expanse of the Atlantic Ocean stood as a Goliath between Christopher\nColumbus and the new world.  The hearts of his comrades became faint, their courage\ndimmed, hopelessness engulfed them; but Columbus prevailed with his watchword,\n\"Westward, ever Westward, sail on, sail on.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Power of calm conscience<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nCarthage jail; an angry mob with painted faces; certain death faced the Prophet Joseph Smith. \nBut from the wellsprings of his abundant faith he calmly met the Goliath of death.  \"I am\ngoing like a lamb to the slaughter, but I am as calm as a summer's morning.
