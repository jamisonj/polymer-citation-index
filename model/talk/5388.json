The priesthood is not, however, a floating essence. It must be conferred by ordination with specific offices. It is held by men under sacred duty to use its authority to accomplish God\u2019s work for the blessing of men, women, and children alike. No one can claim priesthood authority except it is conferred openly by those possessing the authority, \u201cand it is known to the church that he has authority and has been regularly ordained by the heads of the church\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19804\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19804)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19804)\">D&amp;C 42:11<\/a><\/span>). The exercise of priesthood authority is directed by the keys of the priesthood. These keys rest with the presiding local and General Authorities of the Church. Those who have the keys are responsible for the guiding momentum and direction of the work of the Lord on the earth. Clearly, as Alma states, the shepherds of the Church are responsible for protecting the flock:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/keeping-covenants-and-honoring-the-priesthood.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cFor what shepherd is there among you having many sheep doth not watch over them, that the wolves enter not and devour his flock?

Bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, and others who have the responsibility of keeping the Church pure must perform this labor in a spirit of love and kindness. It should not be done in a spirit of punishment, but rather of helping. However, it is of no kindness to a brother or sister in transgression for their presiding officers to look the other way. Some words on this subject come from President John Taylor:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/keeping-covenants-and-honoring-the-priesthood.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cFurthermore, I have heard of some Bishops who have been seeking to cover up the iniquities of men; I tell them, in the name of God, they will have to bear \u2026 that iniquity, and if any of you want to partake of the sins of men, or uphold them, you will have to bear them. Do you hear it, you Bishops and you Presidents? God will require it at your hands.

Those Councils are more in tune with the Lord than any individual persons they preside over, and the individual members of the Councils are generally guided by those Councils. In this church, where we have lay leadership, it is inevitable that some will be placed in authority over us who have a different background from our own. This does not mean that those with other honorable vocational or professional qualifications are any less entitled to the spirit of their office than any other. Some of the great bishops of my lifetime included a brickmason, a grocer, a farmer, a dairyman, and one who ran an ice cream business. What any may have lacked in formal education was insignificant. They were humble men, and because they were humble, they were taught and magnified by the Holy Spirit. Without exception, they were greatly strengthened as they learned to labor diligently to fulfill their callings, and to minister to the Saints they were called to preside over. So it is with all of the callings in the Church. President Monson teaches us, \u201cWhom the Lord calls, the Lord qualifies\u201d (Thomas S. Monson, <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1988, p. 43).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/keeping-covenants-and-honoring-the-priesthood.p23\" class=\"\">How should the holders of the priesthood treat the women of the Church? The sisters of this church since the beginning have always made a great and marvelous contribution to the work of the Lord. They have added so very much of intelligence, work, culture, and refinement to the Church and our families. The contributions of the sisters as we move into the future are needed more than ever to help establish the values, the faith, and the future of our families, and the well-being of our society. They need to know they are valued, honored, and appreciated. The sisters who serve as leaders need to be invited to participate and to be listened to and included in our stake and ward council meetings, particularly concerning matters involving sisters, youth, and children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/keeping-covenants-and-honoring-the-priesthood.p24\" class=\"\">How should those who bear the priesthood treat their wives and the other women in their family?

The Lord values his daughters just as much as he does his sons. In marriage, neither is superior; each has a different primary and divine responsibility. Chief among these different responsibilities for wives is the calling of motherhood. I firmly believe that our dear faithful sisters enjoy a special spiritual enrichment which is inherent in their natures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/keeping-covenants-and-honoring-the-priesthood.p25\" class=\"\">President Spencer W.
