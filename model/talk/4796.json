Reuben Clark spoke words that apply to pioneers in every age. In his description of \u201cThem of the Last Wagon,\u201d President Clark paid tribute to the rank and file, \u201cthose great souls, \u2026 in name unknown, unremembered, unhonored in the pages of history, but lovingly revered round the hearthstones of their children and their children\u2019s children.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">J. Reuben Clark: Selected Papers on Religion, Education, and Youth,<\/span> ed. David H. Yarn, Jr., Provo: Brigham Young Univ. Press, 1984, pp. 67\u201368; see also <span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era,<\/span> Nov. 1947, pp. 704\u20135, 747\u201348.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p5\" class=\"\">In every great cause there are leaders and followers. In the wagon trains, the leaders were \u201cout in front where the air was clear and clean and where they had unbroken vision of the blue vault of heaven.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">J. Reuben Clark: Selected Papers,<\/span> p. 69.) But, as President Clark observed, \u201cBack in the last wagon, not always could they see the brethren way out in front and the blue heaven was often shut out from their sight by heavy, dense clouds of the dust of the earth. Yet day after day, they of the last wagon pressed forward, worn and tired, footsore, sometimes almost disheartened, borne up by their faith that God loved them, that the Restored Gospel was true, and that the Lord led and directed the brethren out in front.\u201d (Ibid.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p6\" class=\"\">The purposes of God were accomplished by the unswerving loyalty and backbreaking work of the faithful tens of thousands who pushed on, as President Clark said, \u201cwith little praise, with not too much encouragement, and never with adulation.\u201d (Ibid., pp. 69\u201370.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd thousands upon thousands of these \u2026 measured to their humble calling and to their destiny as fully as Brother Brigham and the others measured to theirs, and God will so reward them. They were pioneers in word and thought and act and faith, even as were they of more exalted station. \u2026 God keep their memories ever fresh among us \u2026 to help us meet our duties even as they met theirs.\u201d (Ibid., pp. 73\u201374.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p8\" class=\"\">President Clark\u2019s words of tribute also apply to the membership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in our day. In every nation, in every worthy occupation and activity, members of this church face hardships, overcome obstacles, and follow the servants of the Lord Jesus Christ as valiantly as the pioneers of any age. They pay their tithes and offerings. They serve as missionaries or as Church Service volunteers, or they support others who do so. Like the noble young mothers who postpone the pursuit of their personal goals in order to provide the needs of their children, they sacrifice immediate pleasures to keep commitments that are eternal. They accept callings and, in the service of others, they willingly give their time and sometimes their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p9\" class=\"\">They do as the Savior taught: They deny themselves; they take up their crosses daily; they follow Him.

These are those the Savior likened to the seed that fell on good ground: \u201cin an honest and good heart, having heard the word, [they] keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32356\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32356)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32356)\">Luke 8:15<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p10\" class=\"\">The fruits of the gospel issue from every honest and good heart, without regard to past origins or current positions in the Church. As President Clark declared, \u201cThere is no aristocracy of birth in this Church; it belongs equally to the highest and the lowliest.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">J. Reuben Clark: Selected Papers,<\/span> p. 73.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p11\" class=\"\">I will give some illustrations of modern pioneers. My examples are not necessarily the most notable, but I believe they are typical of the rank-and-file Latter-day Saints who are the heart and the hands of this great latter-day work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p12\" class=\"\">Our older couple missionaries, now numbering over 2,600 throughout the world, provide an unequaled example of Christian service. Who could calculate the contribution these couples are making in furthering the mission of the Church? They preach the gospel, strengthen leaders and members in struggling branches, serve in temples and visitors\u2019 centers, and in countless other ways accomplish the essential work of the kingdom, both the important and the routine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p13\" class=\"\">In a missionary meeting in a remote corner of the world, Sister Oaks and I listened as a devoted brother said, \u201cI never thought I could teach the gospel. I only thought I could fish. But now that I am here, I get so wrapped up in telling people about the gospel!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p14\" class=\"\">A few minutes later, another devoted missionary, his wife, said, \u201cI feel so sorry for those who have nothing to worry about and occupy them except how many steps to the swimming pool or the golf course!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p15\" class=\"\">Time after time, the pioneers President Clark praised left their homes, loaded their wagons, and moved to new hardships at the direction of their prophet. In our day, many couples go on mission after mission. One dear veteran described her family\u2019s reaction: \u201cOur children say, \u2018We hope you\u2019ll come by and at least have dinner with us before you go on another mission.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p16\" class=\"\">Every day other thousands set aside personal preferences and give devoted service as teachers and leaders, as temple workers, in name extraction, and in so many other ways.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p17\" class=\"\">The Apostle Paul described the followers of Christ as \u201crejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42942\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42942)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42942)\">Rom. 12:12<\/a><\/span>.) We are tested for those qualities in different ways at different times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p18\" class=\"\">A few weeks ago, some members of my family visited the Winter Quarters cemetery at Florence, Nebraska. There they saw Avard T. Fairbanks\u2019s marvelous statue of the pioneer parents looking down at the body of their baby, soon to be left in its grave at the side of the trail. Those pioneers received some of their toughest tests at graveside. Some modern pioneers receive their tests at bedside. One sister wrote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cMy mother cared for her mother until [Grandma] was ninety-eight. My dad now has Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and my mother patiently cares for him. \u2026 The amazing part of this is the attitude of my mother. She always thought she would travel after she retired. She has always kept a beautiful home, loving to entertain others. She maintains her home as best she can, but has had to put aside many things that bring her joy. The amazing part is the joy my mother radiates. Her attitude is so beautiful. She finds real joy in the simple things of life. She is the pillar of strength to the whole family as she uplifts us all with her positive attitude.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p20\" class=\"\">There are hidden heroines and heroes among the Latter-day Saints\u2014\u201cthose of the last wagon\u201d whose fidelity to duty and devotion to righteousness go unnoticed by anyone except the One whose notice really matters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p21\" class=\"\">Others, including those who have been called to prominent positions, are more noticeable, but surely no more noble.

The criteria for that ultimate goal is the same for every person\u2014leader or follower, prominent or obscure: Have we received the ordinances of salvation and kept our covenants? A member of the Church in Great Britain said it best. He had served as stake president. As that period of prominence came to an end, he told Elder Boyd K. Packer why it did not bother him to be released: \u201cI served because I am under <span class=\"emphasis\">covenant.<\/span> And I can keep my covenants quite as well as a home teacher as I can serving as stake president.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1987, p. 24.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p24\" class=\"\">Numberless officers, teachers, advisers, and clerks keep their covenants in that same way.

I was guilty of great hypocrisy and deception before God in matters of infidelity. This Saturday I am going to be baptized and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

It grieves me to know of the great contribution I made to the Lord\u2019s suffering in Gethsemane, but I glory in the proposition that I, as a result of that suffering, might turn my life and make His purposes my purposes.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/modern-pioneers.p27\" class=\"\">This writer expressed gratitude for \u201cthe Lord\u2019s repentance process,\u201d which would now \u201callow me to become the father, son, and priesthood-bearer that I always appeared to be.

Everyone is wronged at some point by someone, and many suffer serious wrongs.
