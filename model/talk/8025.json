I had left my home in Brigham City, Utah, with only embers of a testimony, and I felt the need for something more. Virtually our whole senior class in a matter of weeks was on its way to the war zone. While stationed on the island of Ie Shima, just north of Okinawa, Japan, I struggled with doubt and uncertainty. I wanted a personal testimony of the gospel. I wanted to <span class=\"emphasis\">know!<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p7\" class=\"\">During one sleepless night, I left my tent and entered a bunker which had been formed by lining up 50-gallon fuel drums filled with sand and placed one on top of the other to form an enclosure. There was no roof, and so I crawled in, looked up at the star-filled sky, and knelt to pray.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p8\" class=\"\">Almost mid-sentence it happened. I could not describe to you what happened if I were determined to do so. It is beyond my power of expression, but it is as clear today as it was that night more than 65 years ago. I knew it to be a very private, very individual manifestation. At last I knew for myself. I <span class=\"emphasis\">knew<\/span> for a certainty, for it had been given to me. After some time, I crawled from that bunker and walked, or floated, back to my bed. I spent the rest of the night in a feeling of joy and awe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p9\" class=\"\">Far from thinking I was someone special, I thought that if such a thing came to me, that it could come to anyone. I still believe that. In the years that have followed, I have come to understand that such an experience is at once a light to follow and a burden to carry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p10\" class=\"\">I wish to share with you those truths which are the most worth knowing, the things that I have learned and experienced in nearly 90 years of life and over 50 years as a General Authority. Much of what I have come to know falls into the category of things which cannot be taught but can be learned.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p11\" class=\"\">Like most things of great worth, knowledge which is of eternal value comes only through personal prayer and pondering. These, joined with fasting and scripture study, will invite impressions and revelations and the whisperings of the Holy Spirit. This provides us with instruction from on high as we learn precept upon precept.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p12\" class=\"\">The revelations promise that \u201cwhatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection\u201d and that \u201cknowledge and intelligence [are gained] through \u2026 diligence and obedience\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129689\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129689)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129689)\">D&amp;C 130:18\u201319<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p13\" class=\"\">One eternal truth that I have come to know is that God lives. He is our Father. We are His children. \u201cWe believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129690\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129690)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129690)\">Articles of Faith 1:1<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p14\" class=\"\">Of all the other titles that He could have used, He chose to be called \u201cFather.\u201d The Savior commanded, \u201cAfter this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in heaven\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129691\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129691)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129691)\">3 Nephi 13:9<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"129692\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129692)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129692)\">Matthew 6:9<\/a><\/span>). His use of the name \u201cFather\u201d is a lesson for all as we come to understand what it is that matters most in this life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p15\" class=\"\">Parenthood is a sacred privilege, and depending upon faithfulness, it can be an eternal blessing. The ultimate end of all activity in the Church is that a man and his wife and their children can be happy at home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p16\" class=\"\">Those who do not marry or those who cannot have children are not excluded from the eternal blessings they seek but which, for now, remain beyond their reach. We do not always know how or when blessings will present themselves, but the promise of eternal increase will not be denied any faithful individual who makes and keeps sacred covenants.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p17\" class=\"\">Your secret yearnings and tearful pleadings will touch the heart of both the Father and the Son. You will be given a personal assurance from Them that your life will be full and that no blessing that is essential will be lost to you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p18\" class=\"\">As a servant of the Lord, acting in the office to which I have been ordained, I give those in such circumstances a promise that there will be nothing essential to your salvation and exaltation that shall not in due time rest upon you. Arms now empty will be filled, and hearts now hurting from broken dreams and yearning will be healed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p19\" class=\"\">Another truth I have come to know is that the Holy Ghost is real. He is the third member of the Godhead. His mission is to testify of truth and righteousness. He manifests Himself in many ways, including feelings of peace and reassurance. He can also bring comfort, guidance, and correction when needed. The companionship of the Holy Ghost is maintained throughout our lives by righteous living.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p20\" class=\"\">The gift of the Holy Ghost is conferred through an ordinance of the gospel. One with authority lays his hands on the head of a new member of the Church and says words such as these: \u201cReceive the Holy Ghost.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p21\" class=\"\">This ordinance alone does not change us in a noticeable way, but if we listen and follow the promptings, we will receive the blessing of the Holy Ghost. Each son or daughter of our Heavenly Father can come to know the reality of Moroni\u2019s promise: \u201cBy the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the <span class=\"emphasis\">truth<\/span> of all things\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129693\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129693)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129693)\">Moroni 10:5<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p22\" class=\"\">A supernal truth that I have gained in my life is my witness of the Lord Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-witness.p23\" class=\"\">Foremost and underpinning all that we do, anchored throughout the revelations, is the Lord\u2019s name, which is the authority by which we act in the Church.
