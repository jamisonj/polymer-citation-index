Together we purchased a worn-down 1938 Piper Cub and started the work of returning it to its original form. The project was a labor of love. It had special meaning for me because I had learned to fly in a similar airplane when I was a young man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/the-joy-of-the-priesthood.p7\" class=\"\">This airplane was first built only 35 years after the Wright brothers made their famous first flight. Just thinking of that makes me feel very old.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/the-joy-of-the-priesthood.p8\" class=\"\">The engine did not have an electric starter; as you were priming the engine from the cockpit, someone else on the ground would grab hold of the propeller and hurl it with might until the engine would run on its own. Each engine start was a moment of excitement and bravery.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/the-joy-of-the-priesthood.p9\" class=\"\">Once the plane was airborne, it became clear the Piper Cub was not built for speed. As a matter of fact, when there was a strong headwind, it seemed as though we were not moving at all. I remember flying together with my teenage son, Guido, above the autobahn in Germany, and sure enough, the cars below passed us comfortably!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/the-joy-of-the-priesthood.p10\" class=\"\">But, oh, how I loved this little plane! It was the perfect way to experience the wonder and beauty of flight. You could hear, feel, smell, taste, and see what flying was all about. The Wright brothers expressed it this way: \u201cThere is [nothing] equal to that which aviators enjoy while being carried through the air on great white wings.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10411_000_024\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Wilbur Wright, in James Tobin, <span class=\"emphasis\">To Conquer the Air: The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight<\/span> (2003), 238.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/the-joy-of-the-priesthood.p11\" class=\"\">In contrast, earlier this year I had the privilege to fly in a sophisticated F-18 fighter jet with the world-famous Blue Angels, the United States Navy\u2019s flight demonstration team.

However, flying with the Blue Angels also quickly reminded me that being a jet fighter pilot is a young man\u2019s game. To quote the Wright brothers again, \u201cMore than anything else the sensation [of flying] is one of perfect peace, mingled with an excitement that strains every nerve to the utmost.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-10411_000_024\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Wright brothers, in Tobin, <span class=\"emphasis\">To Conquer the Air,<\/span> 397.]<\/span><\/sup> In addition, flying with the Blue Angels suggested a totally different way of having \u201cangels\u201d round about you and bearing you up.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/the-joy-of-the-priesthood.p13\" class=\"\">If you were to ask me which of these two flying experiences I enjoyed more, I\u2019m not sure I could tell you.
