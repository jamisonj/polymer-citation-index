[{"Verse":"0","Text":"<i>Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at or near Fayette, New York, December 1830. HC 1:128\u2013131. At this time the Prophet was engaged almost daily in making a translation of the Bible.  The translation was begun as early as June 1830, and both Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer had served as scribes. Since they had now been called to other duties, Sidney Rigdon was called by divine appointment to serve as the Prophet\u2019s scribe in this work (<a onclick=\"getScripture('?book=sec&chap=35&verses=20&jst=')\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\">verse 20<\/a>).
