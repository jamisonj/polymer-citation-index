My sixteen years of experiences with them has taught me that they are true prophets, true ministers, and servants of the Lord, Jesus Christ. I know that they love me, and I know that they love you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/they-taught-and-did-minister-one-to-another.p4\" class=\"\">A few years ago while I was serving as stake president, I had some special, spiritual experiences, one of which I\u2019d like to share with you today. One time in a stake conference, one of my great friends and reactivated brothers stood and bore his testimony of the power that had come into his life because of the teachings of Jesus Christ and of those who had ministered unto him. His heart was full, his eyes overflowed, as he stood before the audience with his arms around his two sons. He said, \u201cMy gratitude knows no bounds. My life has been totally changed by the gospel and by the people who have truly loved me. I will need to spend the rest of my life ministering and teaching others as partial repayment for all that I have received.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/they-taught-and-did-minister-one-to-another.p5\" class=\"\">And minister and serve he did, with love, unending effort, and great personal concern. As a home teacher, he was assigned to some special, great families who, as he had once been, were away from the Church and had challenges\u2014some almost overwhelming.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/they-taught-and-did-minister-one-to-another.p6\" class=\"\">He began his work in earnest, going to them as a friend and servant\u2014a true minister. He visited and visited and served them in every way that he could. At first (just as he had been), they didn\u2019t want to talk to him or hear his message, and often they would leave the room when he came. But he understood, for he had done it himself a hundred times to others, leaving his wife alone to hear them. He understood how they felt, expressed as follows by a reactivated man who is currently a bishop in the Church:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/they-taught-and-did-minister-one-to-another.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t living a righteous life, I looked down my nose at others. When you lose the Spirit of the Lord, you don\u2019t judge things properly. You look to judge negatively and to find fault. You wrap yourself in your own cocoon, so to speak, and you rationalize. But when I started working with these men, I found some of these fellows like to do the things that I like to do. I found out that they put their shoes on the same way I did. It was the influence of those men; they accepted me. They put their arms around me, and they accepted me for what I was and who I was. And we went to work, and I ate in their homes. And I just started catching the Spirit.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/they-taught-and-did-minister-one-to-another.p8\" class=\"\">My friend prayed harder and harder for guidance and direction, went to the homes more often, and began to teach and encourage his families to pray for help to overcome problems.

Every day after work for twenty years, he bought alcohol and consumed it until he could hardly find his way home. He received friendship and encouragement to pray to heaven for help. One day after his work, while he was driving into the countryside with his bottle, a voice came into his heart to stop his car, walk out into the field, and pray to Father in Heaven for help. His simple prayer was heard by his Father in Heaven, and as he stood up and walked back to his car, all desire to drink liquor left his life. The powers of heaven had descended upon him, and he knew that God lived and loved him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/they-taught-and-did-minister-one-to-another.p10\" class=\"\">I heard him later stand before the members and testify of the love of God and of my friend and others who had ministered unto him and taught him.

Kimball gave these insights about the ministry of the Savior: \u201cNever did the Savior give in expectation. I know of no case in his life in which there was an exchange. He was always the giver, seldom the recipient. Never did he give shoes, hose, or a vehicle; never did he give perfume, a shirt, or a fur wrap. His gifts were of such a nature that the recipient could hardly exchange or return the value. His gifts were rare ones: eyes to the blind, ears to the deaf, and legs to the lame; cleanliness to the unclean, wholeness to the infirm, and breath to the lifeless. His gifts were opportunity to the downtrodden, freedom to the oppressed, light in the darkness, forgiveness to the repentant, hope to the despairing. His friends gave him shelter, food, and love. He gave them of himself, his love, his service, his life. The wise men brought him gold and frankincense. He gave them and all their fellow mortals resurrection, salvation, and eternal life. We should strive to give as he gave. To give of oneself is a holy gift.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Wondrous Gift,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1978, p. 2.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/they-taught-and-did-minister-one-to-another.p12\" class=\"\">One of the great stories on ministering to others comes from Alma in the Book of Mormon.

Ammon, one of the sons of Mosiah, truly gave himself to teaching and ministering unto the people for over fourteen years. He had waxed strong in the knowledge of truth by searching the scriptures diligently, by much prayer and fasting, and he received the spirit of prophecy and revelation and taught with power and authority from God. He prayed that he might be an instrument in the hands of God to bring the knowledge of the truth unto the Lamanites, a wild and hardened and ferocious people. As he came to the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites bound him and carried him before the king, Lamoni, to slay him or to make a slave of him. <span class=\"emphasis\">And now the ministry and teaching began.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/they-taught-and-did-minister-one-to-another.p13\" class=\"\">The king asked him if he desired to stay among the Lamanites.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/they-taught-and-did-minister-one-to-another.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cYes,\u201d he responded, \u201cfor a time\u2014perhaps even until the day I die.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9522\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9522)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9522)\">Alma 17:23<\/a><\/span>.]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/they-taught-and-did-minister-one-to-another.p15\" class=\"\">And the king was pleased with Ammon and untied him and offered him one of his daughters to wife.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/they-taught-and-did-minister-one-to-another.p16\" class=\"\">But Ammon offered instead himself to be a servant to the king.
