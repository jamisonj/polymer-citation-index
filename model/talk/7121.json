As we entered, we were greeted by a temple worker, a dear friend from our ward. That greeting began a remarkable experience for us. We were met and served, more than any time I remember, by many people we knew: friends from previous wards, friends from the community, men and women we had served with in various callings. The last person I encountered was a young woman I didn\u2019t recognize. She was lovely, and when she began to speak, I immediately remembered: Robin, one of the young women in my Laurel class when I was first a Young Women president. As we visited and exchanged memories and life updates, she told me how much that time had meant to her. I felt the same way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p5\" class=\"\">I left the temple feeling moved by so much kindness, aware how important friends have been to me throughout my life. The Lord has touched my spirit time and again, and more often than not, His touch has reached me through the hand of a friend.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p6\" class=\"\">Thirty-eight years ago this month, Dean and I, then newlyweds, traveled to New Mexico to visit my parents. While there, my father took us on a day trip into the mountains in the northern part of the state. In the afternoon, we encountered a car stranded on the roadside with a flat tire. The driver told my father that his spare was also flat and he needed a ride to the nearest town to get the tire fixed. My father, seeing the man\u2019s family inside the car, said to him, \u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to get to town and back before dark. But listen, you have the same size wheel as mine. Take my spare, and the next time you come to Albuquerque, bring it back to me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p7\" class=\"\">The stranger, shocked by the offer, said, \u201cBut you don\u2019t even know me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p8\" class=\"\">Daddy\u2019s response, typical for him, was, \u201cYou\u2019re an honest man, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ll bring the tire back.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p9\" class=\"\">A few weeks later I asked my dad about the spare tire.

Most people his age <span class=\"emphasis\">receive<\/span> meals-on-wheels, but my dad <span class=\"emphasis\">delivers<\/span> food to the \u201caged.\u201d He\u2019s often at the bedside of friends who are ill or dying. He goes out with his chain saw helping the Rotary club with their annual cleanup efforts. As I think of Daddy\u2019s life and actions, I\u2019m reminded of President Boyd K. Packer\u2019s thought: he\u2019s \u201cactive in the gospel\u201d (\u201cThe Golden Years,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 2003, 82). His life, as the hymn suggests, touches lives for good, and in the touching, all are enriched (see \u201cEach Life That Touches Ours for Good,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 293).

But perhaps they would feel more of His love if they looked for His hand in the actions of those who care for them. It may be a member of their branch or ward, a neighbor, or even a stranger who blesses them and manifests Christ\u2019s love. Elder Henry B. Eyring instructed us: \u201cYou are called to represent the Savior. Your voice to testify becomes the same as His voice, your hands to lift the same as His hands\u201d (\u201cRise to Your Call,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 2002, 76). If we can lift others in Christ\u2019s name, surely we can also be lifted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p12\" class=\"\">One home teacher I know faithfully made monthly visits to an elderly widow. More than just visit, however, each fall he winterized the sister\u2019s air conditioner and checked the filter on her furnace. Was that God\u2019s love or the love of the home teacher? The answer, of course, is both.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">What greater gift dost thou bestow,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">What greater goodness can we know<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Than Christlike friends, whose gentle ways<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Strengthen our faith, enrich our days.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p17\" class=\"\">(<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 293)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p18\" class=\"\">I have been blessed throughout my life with Christlike friends\u2014from friends of my youth to the many people who have blessed our family in all the wards we have lived in. Their faith and commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ, their service, their wise and gentle instruction have enriched our lives. Some of my friends are very different from me. We disagree about things, and we can even irritate each other. But friendship allows for differences\u2014in fact, it embraces them. I love to visit stakes made up of people from a variety of backgrounds, ages, and ethnic origins.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p19\" class=\"\">I\u2019m experiencing right now a special dimension of sisterhood and friendship as I serve with Sisters Parkin and Pingree and the other women in the auxiliary presidencies and boards. These are <span class=\"emphasis\">good<\/span> women. Oh, how I love them. After three years together, my dear sisters in the presidency know me well. They know my faith and testimony, but they also know my insecurities and worries. They know that when I\u2019m tired after a long training trip, I\u2019m not my best self. But I feel their love and patience, and I know they still think the best of me. Their testimonies and prayers bolster me. Their laughter brightens my day. In every sense, we are sisters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p20\" class=\"\">I have had similar experiences with my own family. One of my younger sisters has been struggling with cancer the past few months. We don\u2019t live close, but phone calls bring her near. We have shared love, prayers, memories, and tender testimonies as she has gone through this difficult ordeal. My sisters are treasured friends. So are my brothers, my dear husband, my children, and my grandchildren (no matter how noisy those grandchildren are).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p21\" class=\"\">In the early years of the Restoration, new members gathered to create Zion. Zion was both a place and purpose\u2014a spirit. We no longer gather in the same way. Our branches and wards are now our Zion. But they take on the spirit of Zion only when members care for one another. Sadly, we sometimes hear of women and men who have had their feelings hurt and become alienated by other Church members. If you are on either side of this dilemma\u2014the offender or the one who has been offended\u2014seek forgiveness; see your own part in the fault. Remember Christ\u2019s admonition to us: \u201cI say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44284\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44284)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44284)\">D&amp;C 38:27<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p22\" class=\"\">I recently had the opportunity to speak to a woman who asked me about Joseph Smith. She was clearly skeptical about his calling and mission. As I spoke to her, the words of the Lord to Oliver Cowdery came to me: \u201cStand by my servant Joseph, faithfully\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44285\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44285)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44285)\">D&amp;C 6:18<\/a><\/span>).

He said, \u201cFriendship is one of the grand fundamental principles of \u2018Mormonism\u2019; [it is designed] to revolutionize and civilize the world, and cause wars and contentions to cease and men to become friends and brothers\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 5:517).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p24\" class=\"\">And yet, he knew that friendship was more than an abstraction. He learned one day that a brother\u2019s house had been burned by enemies. When Church members said they felt sorry for him, the Prophet took some money from his pocket and said, \u201cI feel sorry for this brother to the amount of five dollars. How much do you \u2026 feel sorry [for him]?\u201d (in Hyrum L. Andrus and Helen Mae Andrus, comps., <span class=\"emphasis\">They Knew the Prophet<\/span> [1974], 150).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p25\" class=\"\">Do we feel about friendship as the Prophet Joseph did? Do we turn our good feelings into practical assistance? God knows the needs of His children, and He often works through us, prompting us to help one another. When we act on such promptings, we tread on holy ground, for we are allowed the opportunity to serve as an agent of God in answering a prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/what-greater-goodness-can-we-know-christlike-friends.p26\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, if we are friends to the Prophet Joseph, then we are friends to the Savior as well. Do we live lives that proclaim \u201cdevotion to the Savior\u2019s name\u201d? (see <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 293). Joseph Smith did, and in this year, as we honor the man who ushered in the dispensation of the fulness of times, we should remember not only his friendship to humanity, but his friendship and dedication to the Lord. The Prophet said: \u201cI will try to be contented with my lot, knowing that God is my friend. In Him I shall find comfort\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith,<\/span> comp. Dean C.

His greatest desire for us, His brothers and sisters, is to bring us back to our Father.
