Her name is Adele, and she and her two grown daughters\u2014one of whom is handicapped\u2014have lived for many years in the Rose Park area of the Salt Lake Valley.

During the time the makeover of her home had been accomplished, Adele and her two daughters had been hosted in a city a number of miles away where they themselves had received some pampering.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-sacred-call-of-service.p34\" class=\"\">I was present when the limousine bearing Adele and her daughters arrived on the scene.

What a thrilling moment it was when the blindfolds were removed and Adele and her daughters turned around and saw their new home. They were absolutely stunned by the magnificent project which had been completed, including a redesign of the front, an extension of the home itself, and a new roof. The outside looked new and immaculate. They could not help but cry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-sacred-call-of-service.p36\" class=\"\">I accompanied Adele and others as we entered the home and were amazed at what had been accomplished to beautify and enhance the surroundings. The walls had been painted, the floor coverings changed. There were new furnishings, new curtains, new drapes. The cupboards in the kitchen had been replaced; there were new countertops and new appliances. The entire house had been done over from top to bottom, each room spotless and beautiful. Adele and her daughters were literally overcome. However, just as poignant and touching were the expressions on the faces of those who had worked feverishly to make the house new. Tears welled in their eyes as they witnessed the joy they had brought into the lives of Adele and her daughters. Not only had a widow\u2019s burden been made lighter, but countless other lives were touched in the process.

On this particular occasion we journeyed by bus 90 miles north to the Clarkston, Utah, cemetery. There, in the quiet of that beautiful setting, we gathered the youth around the grave of Martin Harris, one of the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon. While we surrounded the beautiful granite shaft which marks his grave, Elder Glen L. Rudd, then the bishop of the other ward, presented the background of the life of Martin Harris and read from the Book of Mormon his testimony and that of Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer. The young men listened with rapt attention, realizing they were standing at the grave site of one who had seen an angel and had actually beheld the plates with his own eyes. They reverently touched the granite marker designating the grave and pondered the words they had heard and the feelings they had felt.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-sacred-call-of-service.p40\" class=\"\">Then we walked a short distance to a pioneer grave.
