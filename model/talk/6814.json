He asked his son what was discussed at a recent Sunday evening fireside. The young man replied, \u201cRaising the bar.\u201d He then informed his father he was weary of the theme because it was the subject of every recent class and meeting. My first thought was, \u201cThat\u2019s great; the prophet\u2019s message is being discussed, heard, and acted upon.\u201d My second thought related to the young man\u2019s feelings concerning repetitive reminders. Repetitive reminders can be an irritant when we are trying hard to do our best.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p8\" class=\"\">As a youth I would tune out my mother\u2019s repetitive reminder: \u201cDavid, remember who you are.\u201d The reminder always brought some interesting comments from my friends. Irritation set in when my father repeatedly pointed out President George Albert Smith\u2019s home as we traveled along 13th East in Salt Lake City and reminded me that a living prophet of God who loved me lived there. Today I am most grateful for those repetitive reminders.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p9\" class=\"\">The term \u201craising the bar\u201d is often used in the world of sports to describe achieving higher levels of performance. The use of a sports metaphor may help describe why it is critical to respond to what President Hinckley asked us to do last conference when he said: \u201cI hope that our young men, and our young women, will rise to the challenge [Elder Ballard] has set forth. We must raise the bar on the worthiness and qualifications of those who go into the world as ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-23905_000_020\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cTo the Men of the Priesthood,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 2002, 57; <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Nov. 2002, 57.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p10\" class=\"\">A year ago we experienced a wonderful Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. For most Olympic events, athletes must attain minimum levels of achievement in order to qualify to compete. Our lives are similar to the Olympic qualification process in that we need to achieve and maintain standards in order to participate in the important <span class=\"emphasis\">spiritual<\/span> events of life. World-class athletes have a disciplined daily routine. They master the skills demanded by their sport. Only then can they qualify to participate in the contest. And that\u2019s the way it is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p11\" class=\"\">Young men, if you want to be world class and qualified to be participants in the really important events of life like priesthood ordinations, blessings of the temple, and missionary service, you too must develop a disciplined daily routine of honesty, virtue, study, and prayer. And that\u2019s the way it is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p12\" class=\"\">Olympians know and understand the <span class=\"emphasis\">rules<\/span> that govern their sport. Broken rules can bring severe penalties and even disqualification. At the last Olympics, failure to observe rules associated with performance-enhancing drugs brought medal forfeiture. One of the harshest penalties levied on an athlete occurs in the game of golf. Just signing a scorecard with an incorrect score entered for any one of the 18 holes brings <span class=\"emphasis\">disqualification.<\/span> There is <span class=\"emphasis\">zero<\/span> tolerance. It doesn\u2019t matter if the error benefits or hurts the individual; the penalty is the same\u2014<span class=\"emphasis\">disqualification.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p13\" class=\"\">After more than 50 years, I can still hear the words of a tournament official: \u201cSorry, son, we must disqualify you for signing an incorrect scorecard.\u201d My disqualification came as a result of my mentioning to the official that I needed to correct my score. For weeks I said to myself: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I remain silent? Besides, the error was an innocent mistake. The total score was correct.\u201d Though my performance was good enough to find me in the winner\u2019s circle, I left the awards presentation empty-handed. And that\u2019s the way it is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p14\" class=\"\">My young friends, rules are important, even critical. In life there are also penalties, perhaps even disqualification, if rules are broken. Our participation in life\u2019s important events may be jeopardized if we fail to follow the rules contained in our Father in Heaven\u2019s commands. Involvement in sexual sin, illegal drugs, civil disobedience, or abuse could keep us on the sidelines at key times. You would do well to view rules as <span class=\"emphasis\">safety restraints,<\/span> not as <span class=\"emphasis\">chains that bind. <\/span>Obedience builds strength. And that\u2019s the way it is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p15\" class=\"\">In 1834 the Prophet Joseph Smith recorded, \u201cNo month ever found me more busily engaged than November; but as my life consisted of activity and unyielding exertions, I made this my rule: <span class=\"emphasis\">When the Lord commands, do it.<\/span>\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-23905_000_020\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 2:170.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p16\" class=\"\">For some, sports are a business. The difference between winning and losing can be a substantial amount of money. Athletes hire agents to handle their business affairs. Agents, personal trainers, coaches, and managers assist the athlete to enhance performance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p17\" class=\"\">Our Father in Heaven has provided His precious young sons with a superb support team more than equal to the one used by the athlete. Our parents make <span class=\"emphasis\">superb agents.<\/span> They look after our interests. They are not only interested in us, but because they love us, they are terrific consultants as well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p18\" class=\"\">The Apostle Paul in teaching the Colossians said, \u201cChildren, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10498\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10498)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10498)\">Col. 3:20<\/a><\/span>). In addition to our parents, think about the vast support network that has been provided to enhance our <span class=\"emphasis\">spiritual<\/span> performance. Our bishops serve as <span class=\"emphasis\">personal trainers<\/span> and use their sacred priesthood keys to bless our lives. Seminary teachers, quorum advisers, and home teachers round out the support team which has been assembled by the Lord to help us prepare for the big games of life. As you follow and obey, your performance will steadily improve. When the Lord commands, do it. And that\u2019s the way it is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p19\" class=\"\">One of the defining differences between the good and the great is what sports psychologists call \u201cfocus.\u201d Competitors who have the ability to set aside the unimportant and be completely attentive to that which is critical are able to improve their performance. Focus is a critical success factor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p20\" class=\"\">I overheard a conversation between golfing great Arnold Palmer and a young caddie he was using for the first time. The young caddie, while handing Mr. Palmer his club, told him the distance to the flag was 165 yards, there was an unseen stream on the left, and a long and treacherous rough on the right. In a very kind but firm way, Mr. Palmer reminded the young man that the only information he required was the distance to the hole. He further suggested he didn\u2019t want to lose focus by worrying about what was on the right or left.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p21\" class=\"\">It is easy to lose sight of the really important objectives of life. There is much to distract us. Some are floundering in the water hazards on the left, and others are finding the long, treacherous rough on the right insurmountable. Safety and success come when focus is maintained on the important opportunities found by driving the ball straight down the middle\u2014priesthood advancement, temple worthiness, and missionary service. And that\u2019s the way it is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/and-thats-the-way-it-is.p22\" class=\"\">May our Father in Heaven bless each one of you. I testify to one and all that Jesus is the Christ. He lives, and His love for us is perfect. I\u2019m grateful for a great prophet who helps us understand that when the Lord commands, do it, because that\u2019s the way it is.
