Smith, a prophet of the Lord, warned that \"There are at\nleast three dangers that threaten the Church within\" (<i>Gospel Doctrine<\/i>, p. 312). He also\ncounseled the Authorities of the Church to warn the people unceasingly against them.\n<\/p><p>\nThese dangers are:\n<\/p><p>\nFlattery of prominent men in the world,<br \/>\nFalse educational ideas,<br \/>\nSexual impurity.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to comment briefly on these three dangers.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Flattery<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFirst, <i>the flattery of prominent men in the world:<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Master warned, \"Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31620\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31620)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31620)\">Luke 6:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs Latter-day Saints we have been driven, mobbed, misunderstood, and maligned. We have\nbeen a peculiar people. Now we are faced with world applause. It has been a welcome\nchange, but can we stand acceptance? Can we meet the danger of applause? In the hour of a\nman's success applause can be his greatest danger.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is, of course, nothing wrong with being honored by men, if one is being honored for a\ngood thing, if one comes to these honors through righteous living, and if, while holding these\nhonors, one lives honorably. One should strive to have wide influence for good.\n<\/p><p>\nHowever, virtue is not the only basis for being singled out and promoted. As the world gets\nmore wicked, a possible way to attain worldly success may be to join the wicked. The time is\nfast approaching when it will require great courage for Latter-day Saints to stand up for their\npeculiar standards and doctrine&mdash;all of their doctrine, including the more weighty principles\nsuch as the principle of freedom. Opposition to this weighty principle of freedom caused\nmany of our brothers and sisters in the pre-existence to lose their first estate in the war in\nheaven.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are far removed from the days of our forefathers who were persecuted for their peculiar\nbeliefs. Some of us seem to want to share their reward but are ofttimes afraid to stand up for\nprinciples that are controversial in our generation. We need not solicit persecution, but neither\nshould we remain silent in the presence of overwhelming evils, for this makes cowards of\nmen. We should not go out of the path of duty to pick up a cross there is no need to bear, but\nneither should we sidestep a cross that clearly lies within the path of duty.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are in the world, and I fear some of us are getting too much like the world. Rather than\ncontinue a peculiar people, some are priding themselves on how much they are like everybody\nelse, when the world is getting more wicked. The Lord, as he prayed for his Apostles, said, \".\n. . the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the\nworld\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28149\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28149)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28149)\">John 17:14<\/a><\/span>).\nAs Latter-day Saints, we too have been called out of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nSome things are changeless&mdash;priceless. We must anchor ourselves to the eternal verities of\nlife, for life is eternal. The honors of men more often than not are fleeting. Anxious to run\nafter the honors of office or succumb to the pressures of public glamour and worldly acclaim,\nsome of us are no longer willing to stand up for all the principles of the\ngospel. We seek to justify our unrighteousness by claiming that if only we can get title or\nposition, then think of the good we can do. Hence we lose our salvation en route to those\nhonors. We sometimes look among our numbers to find one to whom we can point who\nagrees with us, so we can have company to justify our apostasy. We rationalize by saying that\nsome day the church doctrine will catch up with our way of thinking.\n<\/p><p>\nSeeking the applause of the world, we like to be honored by the men the world honors. But\ntherein lies real danger, for ofttimes, in order to receive those honors, we must join forces\nwith and follow those same devilish influences and policies which brought some of those men\nto positions of prominence.\n<\/p><p>\nMore and more the honors of this world are being promoted by the wicked for the wicked.\nWe see this in publicity and awards that are given to movies, literature, art, journalism, etc.\nWe see in our own newspapers widely read columnists carried who advocate one world\nsocialism who have been consistently caught in falsehoods, and who continually parrot the\ncommunist line. Less and less we see the virtuous rewarded by the world, and when they are,\nofttimes it almost seems to be done insidiously in order to get us to swallow the many evils\nfor which the wicked are even more profusely honored.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, President Joseph F. Smith was right. Today we are being plagued within by the flattery\nof prominent men in the world.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>False Educational Ideas<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSecond, <i>false educational ideas:<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the past several years many of our institutions of learning have been turning out an\nincreasing number of students schooled in amorality, relativity, and atheism&mdash;students\ndivested of a belief in God, without fixed moral principles or an understanding of our\nconstitutional republic and our capitalistic, free enterprise economic system. This follows a\npattern which was established years ago at some of our key colleges that produced many of\nthe teachers and leaders in the educational field across the country today.\n<\/p><p>\nThe fruits of this kind of teaching have been tragic, not only to the souls of the individuals\ninvolved but also to the parents and even to our country. We saw these tragic fruits with some\nof our boys in Korea.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen a survey was recently made among students asking which they would prefer, nuclear\nwar or surrender to the communists, those campuses scored highest for surrender who had\nbeen most permeated by these cowardly teachings of false economic principles, atheism, and\namorality. On one very liberal college campus over 90 percent favored surrender. Other\nsurveys on moral standards are equally alarming. More disturbing is the fact that the more\ncollege courses the students take on these campuses, the worse their thinking seems to\nbecome. Freshmen who have just left home or work do not seem as fully permeated with the\nbrainwashing as the seniors.\n<\/p><p>\nSome alumni of various schools have expressed concern. One alumnus from Yale wrote a\nbook a few years ago entitled <i>God and Man at Yale<\/i>. Another group (which includes Teddy\nRoosevelt's hero son Archibald) from Harvard University established the Veritas Foundation\nand wrote a book, <i>Keynes at Harvard<\/i>, explaining the degree to which the destructive Fabian\neconomic philosophy has permeated educational institutions and government. Concerned\neducators have begun to write books. Professor E. Merrill Root authored <i>Collectivism on the Campus<\/i>\nand <i>Brainwashing in the High Schools<\/i>. Dr. Max Rafferty, now state superintendent\nof schools in California, wrote <i>Suffer Little Children<\/i> and <i>What They Are Doing to Your Children.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nIn the school history textbooks of recent years, some of the greatest phrases in American\nhistory have been dropped. <i>This Week Magazine<\/i> recently surveyed history books issued\nbefore 1920 and since 1920. Patrick Henry's famous words, \"Give me liberty or give me\ndeath,\" appeared in twelve out of the fourteen earlier texts, but in only two out of the\nforty-five recent texts. Perhaps this might help explain the percentage of students who are\nwilling to surrender to communism.\n<\/p><p>\nThe whole process can be quite insidious. Young people know that the best\njobs are available to college graduates. They want to do well at school. When exam time\ncomes, they must give back to the teacher what the teacher wants. Now under the guise of\nacademic freedom&mdash;which some apparently feel is freedom to destroy freedom&mdash;some\nteachers reserve to themselves the privilege of teaching error, destroying faith in God,\ndebunking morality, and depreciating our free economic system. If questions reflecting the\nteacher's false teachings appear on the exam, how will the student answer who believes in\nGod and morality and our Constitution? One student put on his exam paper what he knew the\nprofessor wanted to see, but then the student added a little p.s. which said, \"Dear Professor So\nand So: I just want you to know I don't believe one word of what I just wrote above.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThese kinds of professors are not concerned about the truth or even giving both sides of a\nquestion that only has one right answer. They weight the scales on the side of falsehood. If\nthey can see there is another side, it usually gets but passing and belittling reference. To give\nthe impression that they are objective, these professors often invite someone to present a\ndifferent point of view in one lecture, while the professor spends the whole semester pointing\nout the other side.\n<\/p><p>\nNow truth, if given as much time and emphasis as error, will invariably prove itself. And if\nour young students could have as much time studying the truth as they and some of their\nprofessors have had time studying error, then there would be no question of the outcome. The\nproblem arises when under the pressure of a heavy course of study and the necessity of\nparroting back what certain professors have said, the student does not have the time or take\nthe time to learn the truth. If he does not learn the truth, some day he will suffer the\nconsequences. Many an honest student, after graduation, has had to do some unlearning and\nthen fresh learning of basic principles which never change and which he should have been\ntaught initially.\n<\/p><p>\nNow these false educational ideas are prevalent in the world, and we have not entirely\nescaped them among teachers in our own system. There are a few teachers within the Church\nwho while courting apostasy still want to remain members in the Church, for being members\nmakes them more effective in misleading the Saints. But their day of judgment is coming, and\nwhen it does come, for some of them it would have been better, as the Savior said, that a\nmillstone had been put around their necks and they had drowned in the depths of the sea\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35379\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35379)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35379)\">Matt. 18:6<\/a><\/span>), than\nto have led away any of the youth of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has stated that his Church will never again be taken from the earth because of\napostasy. But he has also stated that some members of his Church will fall away. There has\nbeen individual apostasy in the past, it is going on now, and there will be an even increasing\namount in the future. While we cannot save all the flock from being deceived, we should,\nwithout compromising our doctrine, strive to save as many as we can. For as President Clark\nsaid, \"We are in the midst of the greatest exhibition of propaganda that the world has ever\nseen.\"\n<\/p><p>\nParents, stay close to your children; you cannot delegate your responsibility to the educators\nno matter how competent they may be. Parents have a duty to train their children, to talk over\ntheir problems with them, to discuss what they are learning at school. And it is neither wise\nnor safe, as President Stephen L Richards stated, to leave the determination of our\neducational system and policies exclusively to the professional educators.\n<\/p><p>\nStudents, study the writings of the prophets. Fortunately, the consistent position taken over the\nyears by the prophets of the Church on vital issues facing this nation have recently been\ncompiled in an excellent book entitled <i>Prophets, Principles and National Survival<\/i> [by Jerreld\nL. Newquist].\n<\/p><p>\nStudents, pray for inspiration and knowledge. Counsel with your parents. Let Sunday be the\nday to fill up your spiritual batteries for the week by reading good church books, particularly\nthe Book of Mormon. Take time to meditate. Don't let the philosophies and falsehoods of\nmen throw you. Hold on to the iron rod. Learn to sift. Learn to discern error through the\npromptings of the Spirit and your study of the truth.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, false educational ideas are a serious threat today.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Immorality<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThird, <i>sexual immorality:<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nSexual immorality is a viper that is striking not only in the world, but in the Church today.\nNot to admit it is to be dangerously complacent or is like putting one's head in the sand. In\nthe category of crimes, only murder and denying the Holy Ghost come ahead of illicit sexual\nrelations (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9044\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9044)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9044)\">Alma 39:5<\/a><\/span>),\nwhich we call fornication when it involves an unmarried person, or the graver sin of\nadultery when it involves one who is married. I know the laws of the land do not consider\nunchastity as serious as God does, nor punish as severely as God does, but that does not\nchange its abominableness. In the eyes of God there is but one moral standard for men and\nwomen. In the eyes of God chastity will never be out of date.\n<\/p><p>\nThe natural desire for men and women to be together is from God. But such association is\nbounded by his laws. Those things properly reserved for marriage, when taken within the\nbonds of marriage, are right and pleasing before God and fulfil the commandment to multiply\nand replenish the earth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23698\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23698)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23698)\">Gen. 1:28<\/a><\/span>).\nBut those same things when taken outside the bonds of marriage are a\ncurse.\n<\/p><p>\nNo sin is causing the loss of the Spirit of the Lord among our people more today than sexual\npromiscuity. It is causing our people to stumble, damning their growth, darkening their\nspiritual powers, and making them subject to other sins.\n<\/p><p>\nRecently, a young man commented that if he quit reading books, watching TV, seeing\nmovies, reading newspapers and magazines, and going to school, there was a chance he might\nlive a clean life. And this explains, in large part, the extent to which this insidious evil has\nspread, for the world treats this sin flippantly. These evil forces build up your lust and then\nfail to tell of the tragic consequences. In so many movies the hero is permitted to get away\nwith crime so long as he can joke about it, or explain he was powerless to do anything, or\nelse at the close of the movie show forth one minimal virtue that is supposed to cover over\nthe grossest of sin. Many of our prominent national magazines pander to the baser side, but\nthen try to cover for themselves by including other articles, too.\n<\/p><p>\nSo garbled in values have our morals become that some youth would not dare touch a\ncigarette but freely engage in petting. Both are wrong, but one is infinitely more serious than\nthe other.\n<\/p><p>\nParents should give their children specific instructions on chastity at an early age, both for\ntheir physical and moral protection. Years ago President David O. McKay, God bless him,\nread a statement written by Mrs. Wesley to her famous son John. I commend it to you as a\nbasis for judgment pertaining to the matter of chastity. \"Would you judge of the lawfulness or\nunlawfulness of pleasure? Take this rule: Now note, whatever weakens your reason, impairs\nthe tenderness of your conscience, obscures your sense of God, takes off your relish for\nspiritual things, whatever increases the authority of the body over the mind, that thing is sin\nto you, however innocent it may seem in itself.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Avoid Pitfalls of Immorality<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMay I suggest some steps to avoid the pitfalls of immorality:\n<\/p><p>\n(1) Avoid late hours and weariness. The Lord said retire to your bed early\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14435\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14435)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14435)\">D&amp;C 88:124<\/a><\/span>), and\nthere are good reasons for that. Some of the worst sins are committed after midnight by tired\nheads. Officers in the wards and stakes, branches and missions should not keep our people,\nespecially our youth, up late at night even for wholesome recreation.\n<\/p><p>\n(2) Keep your dress modest. Short skirts are not pleasing to the Lord, but modesty is. Girls,\ndo not be an enticement for your downfall because of your immodest and tight-fitting clothes.\n<\/p><p>\n(3) Have good associates or don't associate at all. Be careful in the selection of your friends.\nIf in the presence of certain persons you are lifted to nobler heights, you are in good\ncompany. But if your friends or associates encourage base thoughts, then you had best leave\nthem.\n<\/p><p>\n(4) Avoid necking and petting like a plague, for necking and petting is the concession which\nprecedes the complete loss of virtue.\n<\/p><p>\n(5) Have a good physical outlet of some sport or exercise. Overcome evil with good. You can\novercome many evil inclinations through good physical exertion and healthful activities. A\nhealthy soul, free of the body-and-spirit-dulling influences of alcohol and tobacco, is in better\ncondition to overthrow the devil.\n<\/p><p>\n(6) Think clean thoughts. Those who think clean thoughts do not do dirty deeds. You are not\nonly responsible before God for your acts but also for controlling your thoughts. So live that\nyou would not blush with shame if your thoughts and acts could be flashed on a screen in\nyour church. The old adage is still true that you sow thoughts and you reap acts, you sow acts\nand you reap habits, you sow habits and you reap a character, and your character determines\nyour eternal destiny. \"As a man thinketh, so is he\"\n(see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"41465\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41465)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41465)\">Prov. 23:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n(7) Pray. There is no temptation placed before you which you cannot shun. Do not allow\nyourself to get in positions where it is easy to fall. Listen to the promptings of the Spirit. If\nyou are engaged in things where you do not feel you can pray and ask the Lord's blessings on\nwhat you are doing, then you are engaged in the wrong kind of activity.\n<\/p><p>\nYes&mdash;avoid late hours; dress modestly; seek good associates; avoid necking and petting; have\na good physical outlet; think good thoughts; pray.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless us as a people. We have taken upon us sacred covenants. We must be\nfaithful. We are in the world, it is true, but we must not partake of the evils of the world. Let\nus be ever on guard against the flattery of prominent men in the world, false educational\nideas, and sexual impurity, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
