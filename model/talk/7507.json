My father taught us that when we wanted to catch one of our horses to ride, all we had to do was to put a handful of grain into a bucket and shake it for several seconds. It didn\u2019t matter if the horses were in a corral or a large field; they would come on the run to eat the grain. We could then gently slip a bridle over their heads while they were eating. I was always amazed that such a simple process worked so well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/nourished-by-the-good-word-of-god.p6\" class=\"\">On some occasions, when we didn\u2019t want to take the time to get the grain from the barn, we would put dirt in the bucket and shake it, attempting to trick the horses into thinking that we had grain for them to eat. When they discovered our deception, some of the horses stayed, but others would run away and be nearly impossible to catch. It often took several days to regain their trust. We learned that taking the time to consistently feed our horses grain made them much easier to work with and provided them with increased nourishment and greater strength.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/nourished-by-the-good-word-of-god.p7\" class=\"\">Even though many years have passed since my days on the ranch, the experience I have just described has helped me as I have considered the following question: What can we as teachers and leaders in the Church do to provide increased doctrinal and spiritual nourishment for those we serve?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/nourished-by-the-good-word-of-god.p8\" class=\"\">Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has taught: \u201cMost people don\u2019t come to church looking merely for a few new gospel facts or to see old friends, though all of that is important. They come seeking a spiritual experience. They want peace. They want their faith fortified and their hope renewed. They want, in short, to be nourished by the good word of God, to be strengthened by the powers of heaven. Those of us who are called upon to speak or teach or lead have an obligation to help provide that, as best we possibly can.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-00611_000_034\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cA Teacher Come from God,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1998, 26.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/nourished-by-the-good-word-of-god.p9\" class=\"\">The Savior and His servants have not only taught us the importance of helping others be \u201cnourished by the good word of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"51417\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51417)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51417)\">Moroni 6:4<\/a><\/span>); they have also provided inspired direction concerning how teaching and leading can best be accomplished.
