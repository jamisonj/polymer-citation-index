CANNON\n<\/p><p>\nThat came to my mind this noon when our beloved President suggested that something should\nbe said in this conference by way of appreciation and tribute to two members of the General\nAuthorities who, since our last Conference, have passed to the other side&mdash;President Rudger\nClawson and Elder Sylvester Q. Cannon.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Grant is one of the most thoughtful men in the world, one of the most kind-hearted.\nMany people do not know that. This request is typical of him; his mind was on an\nappreciation of services rendered by these two men who associated with him so many years,\nparticularly Brother Clawson, who came into the Council somewhere near the time or soon\nafter President Grant was called.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Clawson was a heroic defender of truth. He faced death, as you know, on one\noccasion, folded his arms and said, \"Shoot.\" His life, however, was preserved. His companion\nsacrificed his life, was martyred for the truth. President Clawson's heroism on other occasions\nis a good example for us, when we face temptation. Rather than yield the truth or honor, let\nus sacrifice any convenience, and if necessary life itself.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Clawson's life was integrated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nHe has passed to a great reward.\n<\/p><p>\nElder Sylvester Q. Cannon was Presiding Bishop of this Church for many years. Hours\ncounted nothing; it was just service, early morning until late at night. The gospel was all in\nall to him. In fact, he, I believe, shortened his life through over-exertion. We pay tribute to\nhis memory, and pray God to bless his loved ones, and give them the assurance that Brother\nCannon, too, received the welcome plaudit: \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter\ninto the joy of thy Lord\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33861\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33861)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33861)\">Matt. 25:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
