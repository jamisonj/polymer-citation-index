With tender emotion she said, \u201cMom, I just had the most incredible experience with Ashley.\u201d Ashley is her daughter who was five years old at the time. Michelle described the morning as being one of constant squabbling between Ashley and three-year-old Andrew\u2014one wouldn\u2019t share and the other would hit.

The thought of Heavenly Father helping her little brother share must have piqued Ashley\u2019s interest, and she began to pray, first asking Heavenly Father to help Andrew share. As she asked Him to help her be kind, she began to cry. Ashley ended her prayer and buried her head on her mother\u2019s shoulder. Michelle held her and asked why she was crying. Ashley said she didn\u2019t know.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/teaching-our-children-to-understand.p16\" class=\"\">Her mother said, \u201cI think I know why you\u2019re crying.

It\u2019s Heavenly Father\u2019s way of telling you He loves you and will help you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/teaching-our-children-to-understand.p17\" class=\"\">She asked Ashley if she believed this, if she believed Heavenly Father could help her.

These moments are spontaneous and unplanned and happen in the normal flow of family life. They come and go quickly, so we need to be alert and recognize a teaching moment when our children come to us with a question or worry, when they have problems getting along with siblings or friends, when they need to control their anger, when they make a mistake, or when they need to make a decision.

His daughter said that when it was her turn, he gave her a journal and they sat together, just the two of them, and discussed and shared feelings about gospel principles. He had her draw a visual aid as they went along. It showed the premortal existence, this earth life, and each step she needed to take to return to live with Heavenly Father.
