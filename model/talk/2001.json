I quote from this article by Rabbi Arthur Herlzterg:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-iron-rod.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cWhat people come to religion for, is an ultimate metaphysical hunger, and when that hunger is not satisfied, religion declines \u2026 the moment that clerics become more worldly, the world goes to hades the faster.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-iron-rod.p7\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 Religion represents the accumulation of man\u2019s insight over thousands of years into such questions as the nature of man, the meaning of life, the individual\u2019s place in the universe.

To the faithful members of the Church this will be an oft-related incident recorded in the Book of Mormon. To those not of our faith this may, if they will ponder seriously, be very significant in the light of many trends in our modern society.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-iron-rod.p10\" class=\"\">In this dream, or better called a vision, the prophet Lehi was led by a heavenly messenger through a dark and dreary waste to a tree laden with delicious fruit which proved to be very satisfying to his soul. He beheld a river of water nearby along which was a straight and narrow path leading to the tree laden with delicious fruit. Between the river bank and the path was a rod of iron, presumably to safeguard the travelers from falling off the narrow path into the river.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-iron-rod.p11\" class=\"\">As he looked, he saw large groups of people crowding forward to gain access to the spacious field where the tree with fruit was located. As they pressed forward along the path, a great mist of darkness arose, so dense that many who started lost their way and wandered off and were drowned in the murky water or were lost from view as they wandered into strange paths. There were others, however, likewise in danger of being lost because of the blinding mist, who caught hold of the iron rod and, by so doing, held their course so that they too could partake of the delicacies which had beckoned them to come, despite the hazardous journey. Across, on the opposite side of the river, were multitudes of people pointing fingers of scorn at those who made the journey safely [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1668\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1668)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1668)\">1 Ne. 8:27<\/a><\/span>].<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-iron-rod.p12\" class=\"\">As with many other ancient prophets in biblical history, dreams or visions of this nature were effective means by which the Lord communicated with his people through prophet-leaders. Just so, this dream had great significance, as the Lord revealed to the prophet Lehi. The tree laden with fruit was a representation of the love of God which he sheds forth among all the children of men. The Master himself, later in his earthly ministry, explained to Nicodemus how that great love was manifested. Said he: \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\u201d; and then the Master added: \u201cFor God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28619\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28619)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28619)\">John 3:16\u201317<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-iron-rod.p13\" class=\"\">The rod of iron as seen in the vision interpreted was the word of God, or the gospel of Jesus Christ, which led to the tree of life that the Master explained to the woman at the well in Samaria was as \u201ca well of [living] water springing up into everlasting life.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28623\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28623)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28623)\">John 4:14<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-iron-rod.p14\" class=\"\">Those, as seen in the vision, who were across the river pointing fingers of scorn represented the multitudes of the earth which are gathered together to fight against the apostles of the Lamb of God.
