We sorrow with them, realizing that if there are justifiable ones, the justifiable ones are few. Generally, divorce is spelled <span class=\"emphasis\">SELFISHNESS<\/span> on the part of one party, generally both. It is ugly and generally most destructive for the people concerned, in their loss, their sorrow, their loneliness and frustration, particularly with the many children who are greatly deprived.
