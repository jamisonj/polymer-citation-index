Latter-day Saint women twelve and older gathered in more than 1,400 congregations around the world to listen to President Spencer W. Kimball, Sister Ruth H. Funk, formerly general president of the Young Women organization; Sister Elaine Cannon, Young Women general president; and Sister Barbara B. Smith, Relief Society general president. Translations of President Kimball\u2019s message were recorded and sent in the appropriate languages to congregations which did not receive the broadcast.<\/span>\n      <\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p5\" class=\"\">My dear sisters, the women of the Church, young and older, it is such a privilege to have an opportunity to speak to you in your many different locations and situations around the world. I only wish we could meet all the women of the Church in one large body, but we are grateful that the Lord has blessed us with the technology to make tonight\u2019s worldwide assemblies possible. In a way, it is much like the gatherings that used to be held in this historic tabernacle, where all could be sitting together and listening together. I never tire of expressing appreciation for the way in which technology helps us build the kingdom and serve the Saints. In many ways, in spite of the complexities of our growing size, it allows us to keep in touch, perhaps even more adequately than long distances and poor communications did for our pioneer forebears.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p6\" class=\"\">This is an unique and significant gathering.

My dear sisters, choose to keep the commandments of God. For men, for women, for young, for old, this is the secret to happiness, here and hereafter. Keeping them with self-mastery and personal discipline allows the real freedoms that exalt and sustain us. The basic commandments are as simple as they are true: the Ten Commandments [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"22893\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22893)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22893)\">Ex. 20:3\u201317<\/a><\/span>] as given by God to Moses and the addition to them of what the Savior said\u2014to love the Lord with all your heart, mind, might and strength, and thy neighbor as thyself [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"17036\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17036)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17036)\">D&amp;C 59:5<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32012\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32012)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32012)\">Luke 10:27<\/a><\/span>].<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p12\" class=\"\">Attend to your personal and family prayers and family devotions. Keep the Sabbath day holy in thought and deed. Live strictly the Word of Wisdom. Attend to all family duties. Keep your life clean and free from all unholy and impure thoughts and actions. Cultivate those associations and activities which will not threaten and lower your high, righteous standards.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p13\" class=\"\">Study the scriptures. Thus you may gain strength through the understanding of eternal things. You young women need this close relationship with the mind and will of our Eternal Father. We want our sisters to be scholars of the scriptures as well as our men.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p14\" class=\"\">You need an acquaintanceship with his eternal truths for your own well being, and for the purposes of teaching your own children and all others who come within your influence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p15\" class=\"\">Be chaste and do everything in your power to help others to be.

They are divine principles which, if adhered to, will make you supremely happy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p17\" class=\"\">The words of all inspired prophets will teach you that violations of the law of chastity are sins in the eyes of your Heavenly Father. It is a transgression to be involved in any illicit sex activity such as fornication or adultery. It is a transgression to become involved in lesbianism or to engage in any lustful activity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p18\" class=\"\">The sexual drives which bind men and women together as one are good and necessary. They make it possible to leave one\u2019s parents and cleave unto one another. But here, more than almost any other place, we must exercise self-control. These drives which are the fountainhead of human life are to be allowed expression only in the sanctity of marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p19\" class=\"\">Among your most important choices in life should be a temple marriage. Honorable, happy, and successful marriage is surely the goal of every person.

In a true marriage there must be a union of minds as well as of hearts. Emotions must not wholly determine decisions, but the mind and the heart, strengthened by fasting and prayer and serious consideration, will give one a maximum chance of marital happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p22\" class=\"\">Some young people think of happiness as a glamorous life of ease, luxury, and constant thrills, but true marriage is based on happiness that is more than that, one that comes from giving, serving, sharing, sacrificing, and selflessness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p23\" class=\"\">You can set your goals, young women, to make you reach and strain. Keep striving for them. Be prayerful and humble in seeking wisdom and knowledge. You are in the time of your life for studying and preparing. Learn all you can. Growth comes from setting your goals high and reaching for the stars.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p24\" class=\"\">Now, the General Authorities are very much aware of the fact that many of our sisters are widows. Others have become divorced. Still others have never had the privilege of temple marriage. We want all such sisters to understand that when we speak of family life, it is not done to make them feel sad or unappreciated. The leaders of the Church have said often, and clearly, that women in such circumstances include some of the most noble spirits of our Father in Heaven. Those who make the best of what life has given to them will be rewarded for all that they have done in the service of our Heavenly Father and their fellowman.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p25\" class=\"\">Those of you who do not now experience the traditional women\u2019s role, not by choice, but for reasons beyond control, can still do so much to help others. Your talents and time must not be misused simply because all of the preferred ways of sharing and giving are not open to you presently.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p26\" class=\"\">The Lord knows, too, that through circumstances beyond their control, some mothers are faced with the added responsibility of earning a living.

Family life is the best method for achieving happiness in this world, and it is a clear pattern given to us from the Lord about what is to be in the next world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p28\" class=\"\">We have no choice, dear sisters, but to continue to hold up the ideal of the Latter-day Saint family. The fact that some do not now have the privilege of living in such a family is not reason enough to stop talking about it. We do discuss family life with sensitivity, however, realizing that many sisters do not presently have the privilege of belonging or contributing to such a family. But we cannot set aside this standard, because so many other things depend upon it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p29\" class=\"\">Young women should plan and prepare for marriage and the bearing and rearing of children. It is your divine right and the avenue to the greatest and most supreme happiness. You should also make choices looking forward to productive use of your time once the children are grown and gone from under your wing. You should seek for ways to bless the lives of all with whom you associate. You should know the truth of all things. You should be prepared to help build the kingdom of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p30\" class=\"\">You may answer that finding a husband is not within the power of a young woman. The man has the choice. To the extent that that is true, remember that what the Lord expects of each of his daughters is that she seek out those opportunities and make those choices which will keep her worthy of living again with him. Then she will be prepared for marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p31\" class=\"\">There is a great and grand principle involved here. Just as those who do not hear the gospel in this life, but who would have received it with all their hearts had they heard it, will be given the fulness of the gospel blessings in the next world\u2014so, too, the women of the Church who do not in this life have the privileges and blessings of a temple marriage, through no fault of their own, who would have responded if they had an appropriate opportunity\u2014will receive all those blessings in the world to come. We desire all you sisters to know how much we love and appreciate you. We respect you for your valiant and devoted service, and have many opportunities to observe how dedicated you are!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p32\" class=\"\">When I think of the women of the Church, I think of my own beloved Camilla and how greatly our family has been blessed because of her talents and leadership. What makes her\u2014and literally millions of others of you like her\u2014so trustworthy and so trusting? I think there are some realities to look at.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p33\" class=\"\">For one thing, Mormon women are basically strong, independent, and faithful. They have chosen to live by a creed and a way of life that can be demanding at best. From the earliest days of the Church, active membership has meant faith, fortitude, denial, selflessness, and good service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p34\" class=\"\">All Church programs are designed to assist us, whether we are men or women, in becoming better Latter-day Saints.

Self-pity is always a sad thing to see and especially when there is no justification for it. To be a righteous woman is a glorious thing in any age. To be a righteous woman during the winding up scenes on this earth, before the second coming of our Savior, is an especially noble calling. The righteous woman\u2019s strength and influence today can be tenfold what it might be in more tranquil times. She has been placed here to help to enrich, to protect, and to guard the home\u2014which is society\u2019s basic and most noble institution. Other institutions in society may falter and even fail, but the righteous woman can help to save the home, which may be the last and only sanctuary some mortals know in the midst of storm and strife.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p37\" class=\"\">One of the important messages that emerges from the history of great women in all ages is that they cared more for the future of their families than for their own comfort. Such good women had a grasp of what matters in life. When called upon to do so, they could fashion a lovely city in the midst of a swamp or make the desert blossom as a rose.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p38\" class=\"\">Selflessness is a key to happiness and effectiveness; it is precious and must be preserved as a virtue which guarantees so many other virtues. There are so many things in the world which reinforce our natural selfishness, and neither our men nor women should be partakers thereof. We have grown strong as a people because our mothers and our women have been so selfless. That ennobling quality must not be lost, even though some of the people of the world may try to persuade otherwise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p39\" class=\"\">While there is much variety in the circumstances in which the women of the Church find themselves, they still have much more in common with each other than with other groups. Let us be conscious of doctrines which preach unity but which end up dividing. We hope our women as well as our men will be conscious of the philosophies of the world which would attempt to reverse the wisdom of the Lord when he told us that we can find ourselves only by losing ourselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p40\" class=\"\">There is a constant need to develop and to maintain tenderness. The world\u2019s ways harden us. The tenderness of our women is directly linked to the tenderness of our children. The women of the Church do so much to teach our sons and daughters and to prepare the rising generation. Let us make no mistake about it\u2014the home is the seedbed of Saints! Both sin and selfishness destroy our spiritual sensitivity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p41\" class=\"\">I am grateful for the way in which our sisters are encouraged to perform acts of Christian service as a result of their affiliation with Relief Society and other Church organizations. I hope our young women of the Church will establish early in their lives a habit of Christian service. When we help other people with their problems, it puts ours in fresh perspective.

Let us create a climate in which we encourage the sisters of the Church to have a program of personal improvement. It ought to be a practical and realistic program, which is determined personally and not imposed upon them. Yet it ought to cause them to reach for new levels of achievement. We are not asking for something spectacular but rather for the women of the Church to find real self-fulfillment through wise self-development in the pursuit of righteous and worthy endeavors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p45\" class=\"\">We should be as concerned with the woman\u2019s capacity to communicate as we are to have her sew and preserve food.
