I am overwhelmed with feelings of thanksgiving this morning. I feel so richly blessed of the Lord. As I look into the faces of the thousands upon thousands who are gathered in this new and beautiful hall and then think of the hundreds of thousands who are assembled across the world listening to this conference, I am almost overcome with feelings of gratitude for the great unity that exists among us. If I may speak personally for a little while, I think no man has been blessed so richly as I have been blessed. I cannot understand it. I so much appreciate your many expressions of kindness and love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p5\" class=\"\">Through the great goodness of others I have traveled far and wide across the earth in the interest of this Church. I have had remarkable opportunities to speak to the world through the generosity of the media. I have lifted my voice in testimony in the great halls of this nation, from Madison Square Garden in New York to the Astrodome in Houston.

Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your prayers. Thank you for your support in the great work we are all trying to accomplish. Thank you for your obedience to the commandments of God. He is pleased and loves you. Thank you for your faithfulness in carrying forward the great responsibilities which you have. Thank you for your ready response to every call which is made upon you. Thank you for bringing up your children in the way of light and truth. Thank you for the unfailing testimonies which you carry in your hearts concerning God our Eternal Father and His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p13\" class=\"\">I am so grateful for the youth of the Church. There is so much of evil everywhere. Temptation, with all its titillating influences, is about us everywhere. We lose some to these destructive forces, unfortunately. We sorrow over every one that is lost. We reach out to help them, to save them, but in too many cases our entreaties are spurned. Tragic is the course they are following. It is the way which leads down to destruction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p14\" class=\"\">But there are so many, many hundreds of thousands of our young people who are faithful and true, who are straight as an arrow and as strong as a great wave of the sea in following the course they have mapped out for themselves. It is a course of righteousness and goodness, a course of accomplishment and achievement. They are making something of their lives, and the world will be so much the better for them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p15\" class=\"\">I am profoundly grateful for this wonderful season of history in which we live.

That is a living testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son of the Almighty God, the Prince of Peace, the Holy One.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p17\" class=\"\">On one occasion at a missionary meeting in Europe, an elder raised his hand and said, \u201cGive us your testimony and tell us how you gained it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p18\" class=\"\">I feel I might try saying a few words this morning on the evolution of my testimony. This is a personal area, of course. I hope you will excuse that.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p19\" class=\"\">The earliest instance of which I have recollection of spiritual feelings was when I was about five years of age, a very small boy. I was crying from the pain of an earache. There were no wonder drugs at the time. That was 85 years ago. My mother prepared a bag of table salt and put it on the stove to warm. My father softly put his hands upon my head and gave me a blessing, rebuking the pain and the illness by authority of the holy priesthood and in the name of Jesus Christ. He then took me tenderly in his arms and placed the bag of warm salt at my ear. The pain subsided and left. I fell asleep in my father\u2019s secure embrace. As I was falling asleep, the words of his administration floated through my mind. That is the earliest remembrance I have of the exercise of the authority of the priesthood in the name of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p20\" class=\"\">Later in my youth, my brother and I slept in an unheated bedroom in the winter. People thought that was good for you. Before falling into a warm bed, we knelt to say our prayers. There were expressions of simple gratitude. They concluded in the name of Jesus. The distinctive title of Christ was not used very much when we prayed in those days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p21\" class=\"\">I recall jumping into my bed after I had said amen, pulling the covers up around my neck, and thinking of what I had just done in speaking to my Father in Heaven in the name of His Son. I did not have great knowledge of the gospel. But there was some kind of lingering peace and security in communing with the heavens in and through the Lord Jesus.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p22\" class=\"\">When I went on a mission to the British Isles, that testimony quickened. Each morning, my companion and I read the Gospel of John together, commenting on each verse. It was a wonderful, illuminating experience. That marvelous testament opens with a declaration of the divinity of the Son of God. It states:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cThe same was in the beginning with God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cAll things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26894\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26894)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26894)\">John 1:1\u20133, 14<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/my-testimony.p27\" class=\"\">I thought of that declaration much then, and I have thought of it much since.
