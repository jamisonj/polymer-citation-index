I have thrilled with the messages that have been given here at\nthis conference. I am thrilled with the progress of the missionary work and the growth of the\nChurch throughout its length and breadth. This is truly a blessed people and a choice\ngeneration in which to live.\n<\/p><p>\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ has been given to people throughout the earth at various times,\neven at the time of Adam and the time of Noah and coming down to\nthe time of Abraham, who was given a very significant promise. Speaking to Abraham, the\nLord said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"... I give unto thee a promise that this right shall continue in thee, and in thy seed after thee\n[that is to say, the literal seed, or the seed of the body] shall all the families of the earth be\nblessed, even with the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of\nlife eternal\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7213\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7213)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7213)\">Abr. 2:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the time and generation when this blessing is being fulfilled. The blessings of the\ngospel are coming to all the peoples of the earth. The Lord is truly touching their hearts and\nopening the way for them to receive the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord is also assisting in other ways which I have mentioned here before, I believe, and I\ncannot help continually being grateful for the outpouring of knowledge which has come upon\nthe earth since the restoration of the gospel, which makes it possible for this, gospel to be\ntaught to all the people of the earth through the modern facilities that have been developed\nand prepared and which continue to grow. I am very thankful and grateful for these facilities.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>The Church Section<\/i> of the News recently mentioned the number of copies of the Book of\nMormon being printed&mdash;nearly 500,000 copies are being printed annually and sent throughout\nthe world. The facilities that make it possible to send the Book of Mormon to the ends of the\nearth, among the various peoples of the earth, as has been indicated here by other speakers,\nare peculiar to our Church. Not only the Book of Mormon but also much other Church\nliterature is being translated into many languages so that not only we of the English speaking\npeoples may have the gospel, but also many others throughout the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is truly a choice generation. I am sure there is no blessing given but what there is an\nobligation. Where much is given, much is expected. We have heard from many speakers at\nthis conference of our obligation to teach the gospel, to warn our neighbors, and above all to\nlive the gospel ourselves. I would like just briefly to refer to a revelation given by the Lord.\nIn section 41 of the Doctrine and Covenants, he said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Hearken and hear, O ye my people, saith the Lord and your God, ye whom I delight to bless\nwith the greatest of all blessings, ye that hear me; and ye that hear me not will I curse, that\nhave professed my name, with the heaviest of all cursings\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13869\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13869)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13869)\">D&amp;C 41:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis is a strong warning, but I believe truly that the Lord means what he says. He has given\nus the blessings; he continues to pour out his blessings upon us in rich abundance; and then\nhe gives the warning that we who have accepted the gospel, if we do not live up to these\ncovenants, he will pour out upon us \"the heaviest of all cursings.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI could not help thinking when Brother Hinckley was speaking about Hiroshima, that this\nsummer I visited again at Oakridge, Tennessee, and found that the process which developed\nthe atomic bomb which was dropped on Hiroshima is now so obsolete that that process is no\nlonger in operation. If we think of what might happen to this world if the people of this world\ndo not keep the commandments of the Lord, we cannot stretch our imagination far enough to\nimagine what the Lord might pour out upon this generation when he says, he might pour out\nupon us \"the heaviest of all cursings.\" All the blessings and all the scientific developments\nwhich have been given to us, might be turned upon us to our condemnation.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray the Lord's blessings upon us that we will heed his teachings, that we will teach our\nneighbor and develop righteousness throughout this earth.\n<\/p><p>\nThe history generally given to us in the Book of Mormon and all this world's history is a\nrepetition of righteousness with peace and prosperity, and with unrighteousness there is war\nand desolation. This shall be repeated throughout the life of this earth, and we are no\nexception.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord's blessings be with us, that we may ever be faithful, keeping the\ncommandments of the Lord and doing that which he desires of us in teaching the gospel to\nour neighbors, our friends, our relatives; and so live the gospel that we will be that kind of\nmissionary, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
