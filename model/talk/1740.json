Theodore Tuttle, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1969, pp. 130-132<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nThis has been a glorious conference. Brothers and sisters, I have thrilled as I have listened to\nthe counsel of inspired men. I have made many resolutions to do and be better.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful beyond expression for having been reared in a home of faith where testimony\nwas nurtured early and continually. Today I bear you my testimony that I know that God\nlives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was a prophet, and that President David O.\nMcKay is a living prophet today. \n<\/p><p>\n<b>Importance of the family<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFrequently we perform marriages in the temple. These marriages are properly called\ncelestial marriages, temple sealings, or eternal marriages. The thing that we really do is to\norganize the most basic unit in the Church&mdash;the family. The family is the most important\nrelationship in this life. In reality, the bride and groom are called to assignments in the family\nfrom which they are fever released, except by transgression. This is the one eternal unit which\ncan exist in the presence of God.\n<\/p><p>\nA man's home is his most important consideration; not his business nor farm nor political\noffice, not even his church or civic service. It is his family. These other things only provide\nthe means to become a provident husband and exemplary father. The most noble achievement\nof God or man is the glorified family unit. \"No other success,\" President McKay has\nemphasized, \"can compensate for failure in the home\" (<i>The Improvement Era<\/i>, June 1964, p. 445).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A divine institution<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe family is a divine institution. The first family unit was organized by our Heavenly\nFather: \"And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone;\nI will make him an help meet for him.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and\nthey shall be one flesh\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23795\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23795)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23795)\">Gen. 2:18,24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has instructed his children in the basic family relationships.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15348\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15348)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15348)\">D&amp;C 42:22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10516\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10516)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10516)\">Col. 3:19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10515\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10515)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10515)\">Col. 3:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Thou shalt live together in love\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15352\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15352)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15352)\">D&amp;C 42:45<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10518\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10518)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10518)\">Col. 3:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10517\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10517)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10517)\">Col. 3:20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe home is the source of happiness, serenity, and peace. Only in a home filled with unity\nand love can man or woman find the pure, undiluted heavenly joys. There is no substitute,\nthough Lucifer would tell men otherwise.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Home the teaching unit<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe home is the teaching unit of the Church. The parents are the teachers. The course\nis more extensive than a university curriculum. Always parents are venturing through it for\nthe first time. The classes start at birth and never terminate. There are some graduations, but\nthe schooling continues.\n<\/p><p>\nSome mistakenly suppose that while children are young, they do not need their mother.\nHence, she seeks employment outside the home. Few things could be more detrimental to the\nfamily at any time. Bloom's study of a thousand children reveals that \"it is especially\nnoteworthy that for a number of the most significant human characteristics the most rapid\nperiod of development appears to be in the first five years of life . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"The child enters first grade after having gone through perhaps the most rapid period of\ndevelopment which will take place throughout his life . . . Much of the variation of children at\nthe beginning of the first grade can be attributed to variations in the <i>home environments<\/i> as\nwell as to hereditary influence\" (Benjamin S. Bloom, <i>Stability and Change in Human Characteristics<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Truths to be taught<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSomeone is to teach children to pray (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15379\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15379)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15379)\">D&amp;C 68:28<\/a><\/span>),\nto walk uprightly before the Lord, to seek\nearnestly the riches of eternity (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15381\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15381)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15381)\">D&amp;C 68:31<\/a><\/span>),\nto teach faith (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15374\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15374)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15374)\">D&amp;C 68:25<\/a><\/span>),\nrepentance, baptism, and the Holy Ghost, and to\nobserve the Sabbath day. Children are to be taught to observe the Word of Wisdom\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15411\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15411)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15411)\">D&amp;C 89:1-21<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;to\nabstain from the use of alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee. Children are to be taught obedience\nto parents and the law.\n<\/p><p>\nSomewhere they are to learn to be honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and to do good\nto all men (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6877\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6877)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6877)\">A of F 1:13<\/a><\/span>). They are to be taught to honor their parents. They are to learn the meaning of\nintegrity and work and service.\n<\/p><p>\nThe responsibility to teach all these things rests in the home.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Testimony to be inculcated<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nChildren are not born with testimonies of the divinity of this work. Testimony must be\ninculcated into their lives early and continually. The scriptures must be studied if we are to\ndevelop a generation of believers.\n<\/p><p>\nRecently I was in the home of a fine stake president and participated in their daily scripture\nclass.\n<\/p><p>\nFor the past year, he and his family have been reading the scriptures together for 15 minutes\neach morning. In that time, they have completed their study of the Doctrine and Covenants,\nthe Pearl of Great Price, and half the Book of Mormon. What a joy. What an example. A\nwise father. A sustaining mother. Fortunate children.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Help for the family<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is organized to help the family. No\nother organization provides more help. The whole program of the Church is correlated to\nsupplement the teachings of the home. The Church speaks out boldly against\nthe common evil of this day&mdash;the deliberate limiting of families by birth control. It teaches,\nrather, the sacred obligation resting upon husband and wife to bring children into the world.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.\n<\/p><p>\n\"As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41899\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41899)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41899)\">Ps. 127:3-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Church program assists home<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church counsels members to set aside one night each week to meet in a home\nnight, to study and have fun and regulate the home affairs. Those who follow this wise\ncounsel know how eagerly youngsters respond to such an occasion.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church sends home teachers to visit families at least monthly. They carry a message of\nencouragement. They are a second witness in the home.\n<\/p><p>\nTo assist families, the Church has organized a wide range of activities where young people\ncan find wholesome companionship and personal development for all ages.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a cardinal teaching of the Church that the man is the head of the family. He is to be the\nbread-winner. It teaches him how to preside in that home through his priesthood power. It\nteaches that the wife is to be a companion to her husband and stand by his side. There is to\nbe no confusion as to the roles of husband and wife. Children are to identify with a strong,\nmanly father. They identify with a lovely mother who sustains and supports but does not\nusurp the leadership of the father. The mother is queen of the home. The Church teaches that\nwomanhood is glorified by motherhood. President McKay has said, \"Wherever a woman is, or\nwhatever a woman does, she is at her best, her divinest best, at home! There is the center of\nher power.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Challenge to the family<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe family as an institution is under tremendous pressure. It is important to know,\ntherefore, that the family is a problem-solving unit. The husband and wife cannot generate\nmore problems than they can solve if they will follow the counsel the Lord has given. The\nsolution to family problems is not separation, but repentance.\n<\/p><p>\nCouples are to continue to court, to pray, to be one. They are to keep alive the magic and\nthrill of romance and learn how to express love. Couples young and old must learn to\ncommunicate with one another. This one thing alone can solve most marital problems.\n<\/p><p>\nThe challenge to the family is great. We are here to practice successful family living. Proper\nfamily living makes heaven on earth and develops Gods in embryo. Success in the home leads\nto the abundant life with our Eternal Father. May we all seek, ever more earnestly, for the\neternal riches of a wholesome, honorable home, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
