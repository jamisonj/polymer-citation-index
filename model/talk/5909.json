We were blessed to have enough land, not enough to make a living, but enough to make work for a young boy. My parents were good, hardworking, industrious people. In order to make ends meet, my father took outside employment. Each morning before he left for work, he would make a list of chores he wanted me to accomplish before he came home that evening.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/as-good-as-our-bond.p5\" class=\"\">I remember on one occasion one of the items on the list was to take a small broken part from our hay rake to the blacksmith shop to have it repaired. I was uncomfortable about going. My father hadn\u2019t left any money, and I wondered what I should do. I put off going as long as I could. When all my other chores were finished, I knew I couldn\u2019t avoid it any longer. Father expected the broken part to be repaired when he came home, and it was my responsibility to see that it was done.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/as-good-as-our-bond.p6\" class=\"\">I can still remember walking the mile or so to the blacksmith shop. I even remember how uncomfortable I was as I watched him weld the part. As he finished, I nervously told him that I had no money, but that my father would pay him later. I\u2019m sure he sensed my anxiety. He patted me on the shoulder and said, \u201cSon, don\u2019t worry, <span class=\"emphasis\">your father\u2019s word is as good as his bond.\u201d<\/span> I remember running all the way home, relieved that the part had been repaired and grateful that my father was known as a man whose word was as good as his bond.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/as-good-as-our-bond.p7\" class=\"\">As a boy I didn\u2019t fully understand what that meant, but I knew it was good and something to be desired. It was years later that I recognized that a person whose word is as good as his bond is a person of honesty and integrity, a person to be trusted. In today\u2019s world, there are some who think nothing of breaking their word, their promises, their covenants with man and with God. What a blessing it is to deal with those whom we can trust.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/as-good-as-our-bond.p8\" class=\"\">A powerful example of this can be found in the Book of Mormon. You will remember the assignment given to Nephi and his brothers by their father, Lehi, to go to Jerusalem to obtain the plates of brass from Laban. After an unsuccessful attempt, the brothers desired to return to their father in the wilderness. Nephi recognized that they had a task to perform, an assignment to fulfill. He stated, \u201cWe will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-97905_000_015\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2124\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2124)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2124)\">1 Ne. 3:15<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> They tried again, and again they failed.
