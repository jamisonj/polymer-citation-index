The magnitude of the calling was overwhelming and the responsibility frightening. My inadequacy humbled me. But my Heavenly Father did not leave me to wander in darkness and in silence, uninstructed or uninspired. In his own way he revealed the lessons he would have me learn.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/yellow-canaries-with-gray-on-their-wings.p5\" class=\"\">One evening at a late hour my telephone rang. I heard a voice say, \u201cBishop Monson, this is the hospital calling. Kathleen McKee, a member of your congregation, has just passed away. Our records reveal that she had no next of kin, but your name is listed as the one to be notified in the event of her death. Could you come to the hospital right away?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/yellow-canaries-with-gray-on-their-wings.p6\" class=\"\">Upon arriving there, I was presented with a sealed envelope which contained a key to the modest apartment in which Kathleen McKee had lived. A childless widow 73 years of age, she had enjoyed but few of life\u2019s luxuries and possessed scarcely sufficient of its necessities. In the twilight of her life she had become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Being a quiet and overly reserved person, little was known about her life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/yellow-canaries-with-gray-on-their-wings.p7\" class=\"\">That same night I entered her tidy basement apartment, turned the light switch, and in a moment discovered a letter written ever so meticulously in Kathleen McKee\u2019s own hand. It rested face up on a small table and read:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/yellow-canaries-with-gray-on-their-wings.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cBishop Monson,<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/yellow-canaries-with-gray-on-their-wings.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cI think I shall not return from the hospital.

Two of them are beautiful, yellow-gold in color, and are perfectly marked. On their cages I have noted the names of friends to whom they are to be given. In the third cage is \u2018Billie.\u2019 He is my favorite. Billie looks a bit scrubby, and his yellow hue is marred by gray on his wings. Will you and your family make a home for him? He isn\u2019t the prettiest, but his song is the best.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/yellow-canaries-with-gray-on-their-wings.p11\" class=\"\">In the days that followed, I learned much more about Kathleen McKee. She had befriended many neighbors in need. She had given cheer and comfort almost daily to a cripple who lived down the street. Indeed, she had brightened each life she touched. Kathleen McKee was much like \u201cBillie,\u201d her prized yellow canary with gray on its wings. She was not blessed with beauty, gifted with poise, nor honored by posterity. Yet her song helped others to more willingly bear their burdens and more ably shoulder their tasks.

Envy and discouragement then take their toll.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/yellow-canaries-with-gray-on-their-wings.p21\" class=\"\">Can we not appreciate that our very business in life is not to get ahead of others, but to get ahead of ourselves? To break our own records, to outstrip our yesterdays by our todays, to bear our trials more beautifully than we ever dreamed we could, to give as we have never given, to do our work with more force and a finer finish than ever\u2014this is the true idea: to get ahead of ourselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/yellow-canaries-with-gray-on-their-wings.p22\" class=\"\">To live greatly, we must develop the capacity to face trouble with courage, disappointment with cheerfulness, and triumph with humility. You ask, \u201cHow might we achieve these goals?\u201d I answer, \u201cBy getting a true perspective of who we really are!\u201d We are sons and daughters of a living God, in whose image we have been created. Think of that truth: \u201cCreated in the image of God.\u201d We cannot sincerely hold this conviction without experiencing a profound new sense of strength and power, even the strength to live the commandments of God, the power to resist the temptations of Satan.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/yellow-canaries-with-gray-on-their-wings.p23\" class=\"\">True, we live in a world where moral character ofttimes is relegated to a position secondary to facial beauty or personal charm. We read and hear of local, national, and international beauty contests. Throngs pay tribute to Miss America, Miss World, and Miss Universe. Athletic prowess, too, has its following. The winter games, the world Olympics, the tournaments of international scope bring forth the adoring applause of the enthralled crowd.
