Moyle suggested that when someone speaks we ought to get three things out of the message. First and least important (but still very important), we ought to get what is said. Second, and more important, we ought to have a spiritual experience. Third, and most important, we should keep the commitments we make to ourselves. Let\u2019s write them down and follow through. Don\u2019t ever make a commitment to yourself you don\u2019t intend to keep\u2014if you do, you weaken your character.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/food-storage.p5\" class=\"\">For twenty-six years, since I was fifteen, I was involved in the grocery industry. I learned much about human nature during those years. I remember the effects that strikes, earthquakes, and rumors of war had on many very active Latter-day Saints. Like the five foolish virgins, they rushed to the store to buy food, caught in the panic of knowing that direction had been given by the prophet but not having followed that direction\u2014fearful that maybe they had procrastinated until it was everlastingly too late.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/food-storage.p6\" class=\"\">It was interesting because only in Latter-day Saint communities did people seem to buy with abandon. It was not a few Latter-day Saints\u2014it was a significant number. It caused great increases in sales. One such experience came when a so-called prophecy by someone outside the Church was greatly publicized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/food-storage.p7\" class=\"\">How foolish we can sometimes be! We have a living prophet; we have God\u2019s living oracles, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles. Let us follow the Brethren and be constant. We need have no fear if we are prepared.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/food-storage.p8\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, what have we done in our stakes and wards to see that every Latter-day Saint has a year\u2019s reserve of food to sustain life? Let\u2019s not only keep teaching the principle, but let\u2019s also teach our people how.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/food-storage.p9\" class=\"\">This morning I would like to discuss food storage. Let me suggest three or four things we can do. Start by taking an inventory\u2014take a physical count of all of your reserves. This would be a great family home evening project if you\u2019re prepared. If not, it may be terribly embarrassing to you in front of your family. Imagine how the powerful testimony you bear concerning a living prophet must sound to your children, who know that as a family head you have been counseled for years to have a year\u2019s reserve of food on hand. We need to know where we are. Every family should take an inventory\u2014get all the facts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/food-storage.p10\" class=\"\">Second, decide what is needed to bring your present reserve levels to a year\u2019s supply. Then make a list and prepare a plan. Consider first, what are the basics?\u2014wheat (or grain from your locale), sugar or honey, dried milk, salt, and water. Most of us can afford such basics. Buy them from your monthly food budget allowance. The Church discourages going into debt to buy for storage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">Now that you know where you are and where you need to be, the third step is to work out a time schedule for when you will reach your goal. I suggest that one year from today we ought to have a year\u2019s supply of food in all active\u2014and many inactive\u2014members\u2019 homes in the Church. Where food storage violates the law of your land, then abide the law. However, even in those cases we can plant gardens and fruit trees and raise rabbits or chickens. Do all you can within the laws of your community, and the Lord will bless you when the time of need comes. Now here are some suggestions how:<\/p>\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Follow the prophet. He has counseled us to plant a garden and fruit trees. This year don\u2019t just think about it\u2014do it. Grow all the food you possibly can. Also remember to buy a year\u2019s supply of garden seeds so that, in case of a shortage, you will have them for the following spring. I\u2019m going to tell you where to get the money for all the things I\u2019m going to suggest.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Find someone who sells large bulk of grains, depending on your locale. Make arrangements to buy a ton or so of grain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Find someone who sells honey in large containers and make arrangements to buy what you can afford on a regular basis or buy a little additional sugar each time you go to the store.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">4.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Purchase dry milk from the store or dairy, on a systematic basis.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">5.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Buy a case of salt the next time you go to the store. In most areas, 24 one-pound packages will cost you less than $5.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">6.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Store enough water for each member of your family to last for at least two weeks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/food-storage.p18\" class=\"\">Where the foods I mentioned are not available or are not basic in your culture or area, make appropriate substitutions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/food-storage.p19\" class=\"\">Now you ask, \u201cWhere do I get the money for these things? I agree we need them, but I\u2019m having a hard time making ends meet.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">Here is how you do it. Use any one or all of these suggestions, some of which may not be applicable in your country:<\/p>\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Decide as a family this year that 25 or 50 percent of your Christmas will be spent on a year\u2019s supply. Many families in the Church spend considerable sums of money for Christmas. Half or part of these Christmas monies will go a long way toward purchasing the basics. I recall the Scotsman who went to the doctor and had an X-ray taken of his chest. Then he had the X-ray gift-wrapped and gave it to his wife for their anniversary. He couldn\u2019t afford a gift, but he wanted her to know his heart was in the right place. Brethren, give your wife a year\u2019s supply of wheat for Christmas, and she\u2019ll know your heart is in the right place.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>When you desire new clothes, don\u2019t buy them. Repair and mend and make your present wardrobe last a few months longer. Use that money for the food basics. Make all of your nonfood necessities that you feasibly can, such as furniture and clothing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cut the amount of money you spend on recreation by 50 percent. Do fun things that do not require money outlay but make more lasting impressions on your children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">4.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Decide as a family that there will be no vacation or holiday next year unless you have your year\u2019s supply. Many Church members could buy a full year\u2019s supply of the basics from what they would save by not taking a vacation. Take the vacation time and work on a family garden. Be together, and it can be just as much fun.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">5.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you haven\u2019t a year\u2019s supply yet and you do have boats, snowmobiles, campers, or other luxury possessions, sell or trade one or two or more of them and get your year\u2019s supply.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">6.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Watch advertised specials in the grocery stores and pick up extra supplies of those items that are of exceptional value.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">7.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Change the mix in your family\u2019s diet. Get your protein from sources less expensive than meat. The grocery bill is one bill that can be cut. Every time you enter the store and feel tempted by effective and honest merchandising to buy cookies, candy, ice cream, non-food items, or magazines\u2014don\u2019t! Think carefully; buy only the essentials. Then figure what you have saved and spend it on powdered milk, sugar, honey, salt, or grain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/food-storage.p28\" class=\"\">The Lord will make it possible, if we make a firm commitment, for every Latter-day Saint family to have a year\u2019s supply of food reserves by April 1977. All we have to do is to decide, commit to do it, and then keep the commitment. Miracles will take place; the way will be opened, and next April we will have our storage areas filled. We will prove through our actions our willingness to follow our beloved prophet and the Brethren, which will bring security to us and our families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/food-storage.p29\" class=\"\">Now regarding home production: Raise animals where means and local laws permit. Plant fruit trees, grapevines, berry bushes, and vegetables. You will provide food for your family, much of which can be eaten fresh. Other food you grow can be preserved and included as part of your home storage. Wherever possible, produce your nonfood necessities of life. Sew and mend your own clothing. Make or build needed items. I might also add, beautify, repair, and maintain all of your property.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/food-storage.p30\" class=\"\">Home production of food and nonfood items is a way to stretch your income and to increase your skills and talents.

I have looked into the sunken eyes of Saints, in almost the last stages of starvation. I have seen faithful mothers carrying their children, three and four years of age, who were unable to walk because of malnutrition. I have seen a hungry woman turn down food for a spool of thread.
