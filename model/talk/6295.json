He is a big, handsome, splendid young man who served in the Argentina Buenos Aires South Mission. One night, about 11 months into his mission, some armed robbers accosted Elder Voorheis and his companion. In a senseless act of violence, one of them shot Elder Voorheis in the head. For days he hovered between life and death, unable to speak, hear, move, or even breathe on his own. Through the faith and prayers of a host of people over a long period of time, he eventually was taken off life support and brought back to the United States.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/hope-an-anchor-of-the-soul.p13\" class=\"\">After months of extensive hospitalization and therapy, Elder Voorheis became stronger, but he was still paralyzed and unable to speak. Progress was slow. His parents decided that they should bring their son home and care for him in the loving atmosphere of their own family. However, their modest home lacked the space or equipment to give the needed therapy. Many kind neighbors, friends, and benefactors pitched in to build an addition to the home and provide physical therapy equipment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/hope-an-anchor-of-the-soul.p14\" class=\"\">Elder Voorheis is still almost completely paralyzed and unable to speak, but he has a wonderful spirit and can respond to questions with hand movements.

His parents do not ask, \u201cWhy did this happen to our noble son, who was serving at the call of the Master?\u201d No one has a certain answer except perhaps in circumstances where higher purposes are served. We must walk in faith. We recall the Savior\u2019s reply to the question, \u201cWho did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?\u201d The Savior answered that no one was at fault but that the works of God might be manifest in him.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-99911_000_024\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"29950\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29950)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29950)\">John 9:2\u20133<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Rather than harbor bitterness, the members of the Voorheis family bow their heads and say to the Lord: \u201cThy will be done.

Sometimes we ask God for miracles, and they often happen but not always in the manner we expect. The quality of Elder Voorheis\u2019s life is less than desirable, but the influence of his life on others is incalculable and everlasting both here and in Argentina.
