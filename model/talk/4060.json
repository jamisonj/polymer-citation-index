We have been blessed tonight by the music and the spoken word and by a rich outpouring of the Spirit. I am humbled and honored by this call to serve the Lord and you, and feel greatly the responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/striving-together-transforming-our-beliefs-into-action.p5\" class=\"\">Here we are in the Tabernacle.

We have promised to live our lives in ways that reflect the gospel principles, concerned about and supportive of those about us. President Kimball has said that \u201cgreat women and men are always more anxious to serve than to have dominion.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1979, p. 104.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/striving-together-transforming-our-beliefs-into-action.p7\" class=\"\">Since my husband\u2019s release as president of the California San Diego Mission, I look at him and my eyes grow misty. At such times he must think the responsibilities of my calling are great (and they are) or that I have burdens and difficult decisions to make (and I do). But my tears are for the respect and admiration I feel for him and for his deep commitment to the Lord, no matter what the call is. When the call came for me to fill this responsibility, he immediately did what was necessary to conclude our mission business and, without hesitation, actively supported me. The ability to do this, I believe, comes from an understanding of gospel principles, knowledge of the covenants we make, determination to live in accordance with that knowledge\u2014and <span class=\"emphasis\">a great love of the Lord.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/striving-together-transforming-our-beliefs-into-action.p8\" class=\"\">Again from President Kimball: \u201cThe real heroines \u2026 are women who are more concerned with being righteous than with being selfish. \u2026 [They] have true humility, which places a higher value on integrity than on visibility.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1979, p. 104.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/striving-together-transforming-our-beliefs-into-action.p9\" class=\"\">Already I have seen examples of women who so impress me with their spirit and dedication to the Lord; their lives reveal consistent gratitude and faith. There are single women who have found their way into the hearts of entire wards through their good works; mothers of various ages and circumstances (married, widowed, or divorced) who allow nothing to obstruct their mission to rear children in righteousness; wives who nurture and sustain their husbands in sometimes difficult situations; and women who are willing to defend the home and hearth in the public arena and through community service. I have become aware of the refining process through which these women go as they forget themselves in the service of others and sacrifice as they strive to build the kingdom, fulfilling the admonition of President Kimball to \u201cbe a much needed force for love and truth and righteousness, \u2026 <span class=\"emphasis\">nurturing<\/span> families, friends, and neighbors.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1979, p. 103.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/striving-together-transforming-our-beliefs-into-action.p10\" class=\"\">We are striving together with one heart and one mind to become that Zion society in which our beliefs are transformed into action.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/striving-together-transforming-our-beliefs-into-action.p11\" class=\"\">Recently at a fast and testimony meeting, a young woman stood and expressed gratitude for her Primary class and commented how well, with the encouragement of their mothers, each girl had responded to both class work and activities.

So, every act of man, the moment it is fitted into the great plan, the plan of salvation, receives spiritual coinage, and passes from hand to hand, from mind to mind, to accomplish the great work of God.\u201d (In Conference Report, Apr. 1922, p. 97.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/striving-together-transforming-our-beliefs-into-action.p24\" class=\"\">My 87-year-old mother-in-law was called to serve as my visiting teacher.
