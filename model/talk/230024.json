Therefore, relying upon the words of the Lord, we must, we are bound to conclude that they do not even <span class=\"italic\">believe<\/span> the Gospel, or if they do the promise of Christ certainly fails. I am aware that such a conclusion gives a choice between but two horns of a disagreeable dilemma, but we had nothing to do in the arrangement of matters which have brought it about; we only speak of facts as they exist. Again, ask the ministers of any of the Protestant churches where they got their authority to preach? They will tell you not from the Roman Mother Church which claims Apostolic succession from Peter, but they will refer you I think, in most instances, to the words of Jesus already quoted, wherein he instructed his disciples to go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"66769\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 66769)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(66769)\">Mark 16:15<\/a><\/span> etc. They will tell you that here is where they get their authority, and they claim that commission is to them as well as to those to whom it was di<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"199a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD23\/JoD23_0199.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;199a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1328\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>rectly given. Let us submit the test and see how this claim stands. Those who anciently had the commission and authority were endorsed by the spirit and power of God which caused certain heavenly gifts and blessings to follow those who believed their testimony and teachings. Do any of those gifts and blessings follow the believers in the teachings of modern divines who claim the same authority and commission? No, not one. They the ministers themselves hold them nonessential, and hence done away. They are, indeed, done away so far as our Christian friends are concerned, and so is the authority and commission of their ministers done away, so far as the endorsement of their teaching by the Holy Ghost is concerned. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n667\"> I desire here to bear my testimony that the gifts and blessings enumerated by the Savior as<span class=\"citation\" id=\"70448\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 70448)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(70448)\">John 16:13<\/a><\/span> those that should follow believers, do follow in this day, the authoritative preaching and administration of the ordinances of the Gospel, and that the Elders of this Church are clothed with authority from God.

In seeking to illustrate how the various Christian sects were moving heavenward, this divine compared the kingdom of God to the city of Philadelphia, which has numerous railway connections leading from almost every direction but all centering in that city. Upon these numerous railways daily move many trains composed of numerous cars containing many people traveling from various directions on different roads, but all bound for the city of Philadelphia. Now this doctrine being broad and liberal would certainly commend itself to every thoughtful and charitable Christian did it not, when tested by the Master's perfect standard, reveal a defect&#x2014;a fatal one too, which all who rely upon it must eventually find to their disappointment and sorrow.

No, the various denominations are not only divided against each other, but in some instances are divided among themselves. During the late civil war, as was stated yesterday, members of the same church south of the Mason and Dixon line were praying for the destruction of their brethren of the same church north of it, while, on the other hand, those north were making a like petition to the same God against their brethren south of that line. According, however, to their own idea of God, He could hardly have heard and answered either party; for, having no body he could not hear, and having no passions he would have been indifferent, had he been able to hear. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n670\"> Notwithstanding this, however, many, very many on both sides were destroyed and, as we believe, needlessly. Of one thing we may be certain, and that is the members of the various Christian denominations are not one. Therefore there is but one of two conclusions at which the reasoning and thoughtful can arrive. Either God has ceased to answer the prayer of His Son, or the various conflicting religious sects are not believers in the Gospel. And as they put great stress upon faith or belief, I have endeavored and think I have not failed to show that they are not even true believers, for they are certainly not united and one with Christ as He is one with the Father, <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"200b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD23\/JoD23_0200.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;200b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1327\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> nor as His ancient disciples were one with Him. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n671\"> In mentioning these matters, I have tried to do so in a respectful manner, having regard for the feelings of those who differ from us in religious affairs. There are many people in the world who do not believe as we do, but for whom I entertain a high personal regard; for according to the light they have, they are moral, honest and just, and are as devoted to what they believe to be right as we possibly can be. Thousands and hundreds of thousands of people in the world are just as sincere as we are; but to be sincere in a matter does not make that matter true. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n672\"> While at the City of Mexico recently, I saw many exhibitions of religious devotion and sincerity. On certain feast days people there do strange things. I have seen women walk upon their knees three miles over rough stony roads, being rewarded at the end of their painful journey with a plaited crown of thorns placed upon their heads, while being carried upon the shoulders of strong men, amid the cheering multitude, who praised them for having accomplished what they believed to be a saintly, meritorious task. Again, I have seen ladies of refinement, wealth and influence trail their rich satin and velvet robes through the dirt and filth accumulated upon the floors of the great cathedral, for hours they would kneel in adoration before an image, while being jostled by ignorant, degraded, vermin-covered Indians, worshipping at the same shrine. On other occasions I have witnessed for weeks together the revelry of Catholic maskers who frequented the streets, theaters and balls, night and day. At some of those masked balls it was said  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"201a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD23\/JoD23_0201.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;201a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1326\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>scenes were enacted that were so immoral in their tendency that the general of the Mexican army issued orders prohibiting officers and men of the army from attending them. And yet, at the termination of the thirty days' dissipation, religious sincerity caused those poor, ignorant people to feel free from sin after confessing to their priests and receiving absolution for all their abominations and securing a great black mark in the form of a cross in their foreheads. Now, while these things, and many others which I have no time to mention, appeared very repugnant, immoral and debasing in their practice and tendency, yet I respected those people in their religious belief, customs and ceremonies as I desire to respect the people of other creeds so long as they do not infringe upon the rights and liberties of others. For God intends that all should be absolutely free in such matters. When Adam and Eve were placed in the Garden, the doctrine of free agency was fully established and endorsed by the Creator, for He there gave a conditional commandment, obedience to which was to perpetuate life, disobedience was to bring death, but the choice was left with the man and woman, and from that day to this he has intended that man should act upon his own agency; that he should be permitted to receive the truth, choosing the path that leads back to the presence of God and the knowledge that comes from above; or, on the other hand, to reject it, following in the path which leads to ruin and destruction. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n674\"> In this great American government a man should be free to worship the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost; he should be equally free to worship a mountain, a <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"201b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD23\/JoD23_0201.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;201b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1326\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> stream, the sun, moon, or anything or not to worship at all; so long as his practice and belief do not interfere with the inalienable rights guaranteed to man, so long should he be free. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n675\"> From the time when God gave to man and woman their free agency in the Garden of Eden, making the law and defining the penalty for breaking that law, I can find nothing in the revelations that would bind or fetter the soul or the body of the children of men.

I still desire and hope to be able to continue praying for them and for the President and cabinet, that they may honor the positions to which the people have called them. We will uphold, sustain and pray for them at least until God rejects and condemns their works. There is salt in the nation yet.

To overcome the fear arising from the contemplated action of constituents at home, and the cut and the sting of the party leaders in Congress, required more courage than we could reasonably expect from members of the dominant party. Moral courage is a virtue possessed by few men in this gilded age in which ambition, rather than principle, too frequently is the moving cause which prompts to action. When, therefore, party leaders, sarcastic and unscrupulous, shake their fists under the noses of their timid followers, daring them to place themselves upon record as advocates of &#x201C;Mormonism&#x201D; by opposing measures intended for the bondage of &#x201C;Mormons,&#x201D; it is indeed difficult, and we ought not to expect weak men, under such circumstances, to do what is right. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n679\"> I remember before going East, certain petitions to Congress were being circulated in the midst of the Latter-day Saints, which were afterwards, I understand, signed by about 65,000 people, and what was the prayer of those petitioners&#x2014;did they ask Congress to endorse polygamy, or in the least manifest sympathy for the marital relations of  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"203a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD23\/JoD23_0203.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;203a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1324\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>the Latter-day Saints?

I bear my testimony that the statement is utterly untrue. No part of the Union possesses a freer and more independent people than these mountain valleys. Indeed I hesitate not to say that their equal in fearlessness of wrongful church, political or other influences cannot be found elsewhere. They neither crouch beneath public opinion nor cower before the pulpit and press. The names of prominent businessmen of Eastern cities, with whom for years our merchants have done business, appeared in the public prints as the vice-presidents of anti-&#x201C;Mormon&#x201D; meetings; thus making them seem to join in the raid against our people. When asked regarding the matter a number confessed that their names had been used without either their knowledge  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"204a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD23\/JoD23_0204.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;204a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1323\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>or consent. But they had not the moral courage necessary to stem the current of public opinion and run the risk of incurring the displeasure of the press by withdrawing their names; and, while disclaiming to me personally, any sympathy with the anti-&#x201C;Mormon&#x201D; raids, then so numerous in the East, they dare not publicly so express themselves. Now, while expressing sympathy for those who, under any circumstances, could be placed in such a position, I am bold to assert that nowhere in Utah among Latter-day Saints could such a thing be found. Such domination, ecclesiastical, political or social does not exist in Utah among the &#x201C;Mormons;&#x201D; possibly it may exist in the midst of those comprising their enemies, and known here as the &#x201C;ring.&#x201D; Whatever may have been said or whatever may hereafter be asserted regarding the domination of the &#x201C;Mormon&#x201D; Priesthood, I know no people who regard more highly the individual rights of man or who are more willing to defend them than the people called &#x201C;Mormons,&#x201D; who here, as elsewhere, have the moral courage to protect and defend their names while maintaining their individuality. I don't think they would hesitate to defend the oppressed whether Jew, Gentile or &#x201C;Mormon,&#x201D; nor would they sacrifice in their lack of independence, principle or persons at the shrine of public opinion or popular prejudice. The &#x201C;Mormon&#x201D; Priesthood dominates the affairs of the &#x201C;Mormon&#x201D; people upon the principles of righteousness and equity. Outside of these it has neither power nor authority. I wish this were equally true with the religious, political and social organizations throughout the Union; but it is not, as I have already shown.

It is true a number of honorable members in each branch recognized and protested against the passage of that unconstitutional and un-American measure, but how few, if any, comprehended the opportunity afforded a great statesmen to stem the current and by the force of patriotism and the power of right, rise above the waves of popular prejudice and, striking out of disguises stand proudly upon the solid foundations of constitutional law while victoriously battling for human freedom and the natural rights of man. Such an opportunity had made Webster, Clay or Sumner even greater than the great men we now esteem them. The thought of such as they were, the devotion to principle, liberty and right exhibited by Washington, Jefferson, Adams, and others in their struggles for human freedom, have made me proud to be an American citizen. But when I see sacred principles, for the establishment of which our fathers devoted property, honor and lives, trampled under foot by our national lawmakers, in order to answer the fanatical demands of religious bigots against a few thousand loyal citizens in Utah, I blush and almost wish I had been foreign born. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n685\"> Aside from these drawbacks evidencing the degeneracy into which statesmen are falling, I have ever been proud of my citizenship.

Under other circumstances I have been thrown into contact with men and women who, while appearing chaste and fair without, were foul and corrupt within, but who nevertheless, would act as though the touch of a &#x201C;Mormon&#x201D; Elder was pollution. Hundreds of times I have been forced to notice the reluctance of men, themselves not averse to the destruction of chastity, to publicly appear in the company of Elders, whom I knew, would suffer their right hands to be burned from their bodies rather than look upon a woman with lust, much less seek to destroy virtue, or defile themselves with the unclean. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n688\"> Whatever the world may think or say to the contrary, the Elders of this Church are the purest men on earth, and there are abundance of facts with which to substantiate the assertion.

When recently gazing upon his monument in Washington, D.C. which has been so many years in building, I asked myself the question: Is all this mass of polished marble being accumulated and put together with such accurate nicety and at such vast expense because George Washington was willing to float with the current of public opinion, right or wrong, or is it because he had those noble sentiments which beat and throb in generous hearts for freedom? He, while possessing many ideas of the English aristocratic school, was no weathercock to be turned by the passing breeze. How few men in the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, appear to have been close students of history. Had they been such they would have seen in the characters of Washington, Jefferson, and the Adams's something far different from that possessed by the average statesmen of our day. Close students of history should be able to sense the fact, that in emergencies when the waves of popular feeling run high, great men whose hearts beat for liberty and freedom come to the front but they do not float with the tide, nor are they swerved by prejudice or biased by public opinion. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n694\"> Public opinion followed Jesus Christ into the garden of Gethsemane when, alone and unwatched by His Apostles, He prayed to the Father for strength to endure suffering which caused drops of blood to ooze from every pore of his agonized  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"207a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD23\/JoD23_0207.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;207a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1320\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>body.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"68262\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 68262)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(68262)\">Luke 22:44<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"81826\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 81826)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(81826)\">Mosiah 3:7<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"84201\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 84201)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(84201)\">D&amp;C 19:18<\/a><\/span> Public opinion followed him to the bench of the heathen judge who, being above the prejudices of the age, washed his hands of innocent blood<span class=\"citation\" id=\"66328\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 66328)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(66328)\">Matt. 27:24<\/a><\/span> and said: &#x201C;I find no guilt in this man.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"68270\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 68270)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(68270)\">Luke 23:4<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"70796\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 70796)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(70796)\">John 18:38<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"70803\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 70803)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(70803)\">John 19:4,6<\/a><\/span> But the self-righteous Jew&#x2014;the hypocritical Scribe and Pharisee&#x2014;cried out, &#x201C;Crucify Him!&#x201D; &#x201C;Crucify Him!&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"68287\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 68287)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(68287)\">Luke 23:21<\/a><\/span> &#x201C;His blood be on us, and our children.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"66351\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 66351)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(66351)\">Matt. 27:25<\/a><\/span> Public opinion has caused rivers of human blood to flow; sacrificing, it is said, sixty millions of lives during the reign of the inquisition.

Heat and cold, hunger and thirst, were each and all forgotten in the intense desire to be free from the cruel persecution of our enemies. We asked for neither riches nor fame, but around the camp fires at night the people were inspired with but one prayer during the weary days of that long journey&#x2014;it was for peace and rest&#x2014;freedom to worship God without being molested, without being persecuted by cruel, relentless enemies.

Securing the support of public opinion it sent, in 1857, all army to Utah to despoil our people, while sedition ripened in the heart of the nation. In 1862, it culminated in a congressional enactment against a religious tenet, notwithstanding the positive and explicit prohibition of the Constitution which forbids Congress to pass any law &#x201C;respecting the establishment of religion or preventing the free exercise thereof,&#x201D; it urged and succeeded in passing the Poland law, under the provisions of which &#x201C;Mormon&#x201D; citizens were deprived of trial by an impartial jury of their peers, and by the decision of biased judges were not only subject to, but some of them actually were, tried by packed juries. At the demand of the clergy of the various religious denominations throughout the Union the Edmunds bill, substantially as it was drafted by clergymen and carpetbag officials here, became law; and without excuse or apology citizens in Utah are deprived of franchise, a sacred, blood bought right, without which no American can ever feel proud or properly exercise the liberties bequeathed by our fathers to their children. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n701\"> Now what does it all mean?

And right here in this connection I desire to repeat what I have said in public once before. In reviewing the tribulations through which the Saints have passed, and while contemplating the wrongs which they have endured at the hands of despoilers, I have felt and said, rather than be robbed as my father on several occasions was, on account of his religion, I would endeavor to have facts plainly submitted to the President of these United States, so that he might fully understand the situation, and then, before I would permit my possessions&#x2014;the hard earnings of year's of toil&#x2014;to go into the hands of those who covet our property, and who would rob us, as our fathers were robbed, I would deed it to, and make a present, if he would accept it, of all the property I have to the President and his successor in office forever, as a perpetual reminder, that here, in free America, whole communities of citizens have been plundered, persecuted and deprived of the peaceful possession of property without cause and without redress. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n704\"> It is said &#x201C;there are no persons in Utah who desire the property of the &#x201C;Mormons&#x201D; except upon the fair basis of purchase.&#x201D; I would be glad if this were true, for I wish to think well of all men, and especially of fellow citizens, but I fear recent movements and present indications will scarcely warrant belief in the statement, and if future developments of the plot of conspirators do not demonstrate that polygamy was the chosen pretext with which to excite and blind the public mind, while unscrupulous tricksters sought <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"209b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD23\/JoD23_0209.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;209b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1318\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> to transfer the revenues of the Territory and virtually the property of the majority of the people through increased and excessive taxation, to the control of the insignificant minority in this Territory, then I am neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet. The passage of the Edmunds bill and the means used to make it law, are but a part of the plot concocted in this city and endorsed by certain parties east against the rights and liberties of the people of Utah. The peculiar mathematical calculation by which Governor Murray succeeded in counting about 1,300 votes for a person almost unknown here, a greater number than over 18,000 cast for Hon. George Q. Cannon, the people's choice for Delegate to Congress, was but another part of the program, and one which has, thus far, deprived us of representation in the National Legislature, and rendered nugatory, to the majority in this Territory, the sacred right of franchise. The late President Garfield, in a public State document, declared, in effect, that as a person who plotted against the life of the king in a monarchical government committed treason, so one who tampered with the ballot-box and thereby deprived the citizen of his right of franchise also committed treason. If this be sound doctrine and authoritatively enunciated, what crime has the Governor of Utah Territory committed? If the canvassing of those votes and the issuance of a certificate of election to a man who received only about one-fifteenth of the whole number, foreshadow the future action of our chief executive, what have the people of Utah to expect, by way of justice, from him?

I cannot and never expect to. From childhood I have been taught to respect officials because of the dignity of their offices, and it may be possible to respect the office after having lost confidence in the man occupying it. As people, our regard for the Government ought perhaps to enable us to do this in the future, as in the past. Faithful, loyal citizens can afford to do it, and much more, if necessary. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n707\"> But says one, &#x201C;You are thought to be neither faithful nor loyal to the Government, and it is believed by many that you make secret covenants against it.&#x201D; In answer I have this to say: The brain that concocted and the heart that prompted such accusations were possessed by the wicked and cruel.

As to making secret covenants against the Government, I never was requested to do it, and would have <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"210b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD23\/JoD23_0210.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;210b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1317\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> spurned the request and the person making it if I had been. As applied to this people the charge is false as those who make it. I think, however, I can understand why these false and unjust accusations are made. We have been treated from the beginning like an unloved child, when asking for bread we have been given a stone, for a fig we have been given a serpent.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"63769\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 63769)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(63769)\">Matt. 7:9-10<\/a><\/span> Now, who ever knew a father to be just to an unloved child? Or one unwilling to listen to the accusations of the favored against him? And here may be applied the saying &#x201C;We can forgive those who injure us, but those we injure, never.&#x201D; And that is just the position we occupy. We have been injured, repeatedly injured, and those who have injured cannot forgive us. They hate us because they know they have wronged us. If statesmen and lawmakers disregard the Constitution by overriding and trampling on its provisions in their efforts to solve the &#x201C;Mormon&#x201D; problem, I hold the act to be no less treasonable than if performed by private citizens. I say treasonable because disregard for the Constitution by the nation's lawmakers, must ultimately result in their rejection by the people, or in the dissolution of the Government. Thus the charge of lawbreaking and disloyalty might more consistently come from, than against us. Of one thing we are certain: that which is a crime to an individual or a community cannot become a virtue in lawmakers, even though advocated as an expedient. George Washington, in his farewell address to the American people, foreseeing, perhaps, what might occur, uttered the following forcible sentiments: &#x201C;If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modifica<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"211a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD23\/JoD23_0211.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;211a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1316\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>tion of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed.&#x201D; Very different are these sentiments from those uttered not many years since by a prominent republican leader in the House of Representatives, who, when asked if he, as a lawyer, would state to the House that the measure introduced by him, and then under consideration by it, was in its provisions in harmony with the Constitution, answered with a sneer, &#x201C;Why, any justice of the peace would tell the gentleman it is <span class=\"italic\">not<\/span> constitutional, but it is a measure we want and one we shall pass, and by the time its constitutionality is tested, it will have accomplished the object we have in view.&#x201D; The same sentiments as those we have referred to were clearly and unhesitatingly uttered by members of Congress pending the final passage of the Edmunds bill. They show the drift of the party, perhaps the spirit of the times, in which the sentiments of Washington are below par. Other members, while not entertaining such views, lacked moral courage to oppose them. Some of them came privately and confessed that the Edmunds bill was an infamous measure; but, said they, What can we do? Public sentiment is against your people, and we dare not defend you; if we do, our constituents will withdraw their support, and we shall be retired.&#x201D; The force of such reasoning we may not comprehend, but we do feel that we have no desire to have any man sacrifice himself or his prospects for us.

Does a knowledge of this fact tend to destroy our confidence in man? No, I think not, but it does tend, by showing how weak and unreliable man is, to increase our trust in God. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n710\"> In asking for a commission of honorable gentlemen to visit Utah to investigate affairs before passing judgment upon us, we did express as I said before, a hope that we might be fairly tried before being convicted. The signers of these petitions knew, and their enemies here knew that the charges constantly heaped up against this people could be proven utterly false if a chance to do so were afforded. But that is just what certain parties did not want, fearing that a thorough investigation conducted by honorable men would defeat their plot against the people of Utah.
