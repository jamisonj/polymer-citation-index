The naming of two men to the Council of the Twelve on one occasion is something that has not happened in a long while.

I wish that we might have heard from each of them. We have announced the construction of five new temples. That will make a total of twenty-five new temples either recently completed or in course of construction. There has been nothing like it ever before in the history of the Church or of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p9\" class=\"\">While President Kimball is unable to stand at this pulpit and speak to us, we are on occasion able to converse with him, and he has given his authorization to that which has been done.

We have been counseled by the Brethren and have been strengthened in our faith. As we are about to separate, I should like to emphasize the importance of watching the little things in our lives. Have you ever noticed a large gate in a farm fence? As you open it or close it there appears to be very little movement at the hinge. But there is great movement at the perimeter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p11\" class=\"\">Speaking to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1831, the Lord said: \u201cOut of small things proceedeth that which is great.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18132\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18132)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18132)\">D&amp;C 64:33<\/a><\/span>.) It is so with good or evil, my brothers and sisters. Small, kind acts can grow into mammoth good institutions. The Boy Scout movement is an example of this as is known by anyone acquainted with the history of this great institution. It is so likewise with evil things. Small acts of dishonesty, small acts of an immoral nature, small outbursts of anger can grow into great and terrible things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p12\" class=\"\">There stood once on the grounds right here, before ever this building was constructed, a bowery\u2014a rather crude structure in which the Saints met in those days of their poverty. In September of 1857, there was presented in that old bowery on a Sunday afternoon, what was really the concluding act of a drama of great tragedy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p13\" class=\"\">On that Sunday Brigham Young was conducting a meeting and introduced to the congregation a man who appeared to be old and infirm and weary of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p14\" class=\"\">Said President Brigham Young to the congregation:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cBrother Thomas B.

My voice never was very strong, but it has been very much weakened of late years by the afflicting rod of Jehovah. He loved me too much to let me go without whipping. I have seen the hand of the Lord in the chastisement which I have received. I have seen and known that it has proved he loved me; for if he had not cared anything about me, he would not have taken me by the arm and given me such a shaking.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cIf there are any among this people who should ever apostatize and do as I have done, prepare your backs for a good whipping, if you are such as the Lord loves.

You will not then think nor feel for a moment as you did before you lost the Spirit of Christ; for when men apostatize, they are left to grovel in the dark.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 5:206.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p23\" class=\"\">Speaking in a voice that was difficult to hear, and appearing as an old man when he was actually only fifty-seven years of age, he spoke of the travails through which he had passed before he had finally made his way to the valley of the Great Salt Lake and asked that he might be baptized again into the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p24\" class=\"\">I wondered, as I read that story so filled with pathos, what had brought him to this sorry state. I discovered it, in the <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> in a talk given to the Saints in this same bowery the year before by George A. Smith. I think, if you\u2019ll bear with me for a minute or two, it is worth the telling to illustrate to all of us the need to be careful in dealing with small matters which can lead to great consequences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p25\" class=\"\">According to the account given by George A. Smith, while the Saints were in Far West, Missouri, \u201cthe wife of Thomas B. Marsh, who was then President of the Twelve Apostles, and Sister Harris concluded they would exchange milk, in order to make a little larger cheese than they otherwise could. To be sure to have justice done, it was agreed that they should not save the strippings (to themselves), but that the milk and strippings should all go together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p26\" class=\"\">Now for you who have never been around a cow, I should say that the strippings came at the end of the milking and were richer in cream.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cMrs. Harris, it appeared, was faithful to the agreement and carried to Mrs. Marsh the milk and strippings, but Mrs. Marsh, wishing to make some extra good cheese, saved a pint of strippings from each cow and sent Mrs. Harris the milk without the strippings.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p28\" class=\"\">A quarrel arose, and the matter was referred to the home teachers. They found Mrs. Marsh guilty of failure to keep her agreement. She and her husband were upset and, \u201can appeal was taken from the teacher to the bishop, and a regular Church trial was had.\u201d President Marsh did not consider that the bishop had done him and his lady justice for they (that is, the bishop\u2019s court) decided that the strippings were wrongfully saved, and that the woman had violated her covenant.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cMarsh immediately took an appeal to the High Council, who investigated the question with much patience, and,\u201d says George A. Smith, \u201cI assure you they were a grave body. Marsh being extremely anxious to maintain the character of his wife, \u2026 made a desperate defence, but the High Council finally confirmed the bishop\u2019s decision.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cMarsh, not being satisfied, took an appeal to the First Presidency of the Church, and Joseph and his counselors had to sit upon the case, and they approved the decision of the High Council.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/small-acts-lead-to-great-consequences.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cThis little affair,\u201d Brother Smith continues, \u201ckicked up a considerable breeze, and Thomas B.

But it led to, or at least was a factor in, Governor Boggs\u2019 cruel exterminating order which drove the Saints from the state of Missouri, with all of the terrible suffering and consequent death that followed. The man who should have settled this little quarrel, but who, rather, pursued it, troubling the officers of the Church, right up to the Presidency, literally went through hell for it. He lost his standing in the Church. He lost his testimony of the gospel. For nineteen years he walked in poverty and darkness and bitterness, experiencing illness, and loneliness. He grew old before his time. Finally, like the prodigal son in the parable of the Savior (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32188\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32188)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32188)\">Luke 15:11\u201332<\/a><\/span>), he recognized his foolishness and painfully made his way to this valley, and asked Brigham Young to forgive him and permit his rebaptism into the Church.
