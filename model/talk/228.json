Lee, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1946, pp. 67-72<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI could ask for no preface more fitting for what I desire to say this morning, than the singing\nof that grand hymn, \"Come, Come, Ye Saints.\" As I sit through the conferences from year to\nyear, I contemplate the great effort and sacrifice that have gone into the efforts you have\nmade in coming to these conferences and the seriousness with which you attend, regularly and\nfaithfully, and in listening to all that is said and the actions taken. I have asked myself the\nquestion as to the purpose, after all, of a general conference, and I am reminded of the words\nof the Lord when he gave us, in a revelation, the pattern by which important matters\npertaining to his Church should be presented to the people. This is what he said\n<\/p><p>\n. . . let it be done as it shall be counseled by the elders of the church at the conferences,\naccording to the knowledge which they receive from time to time\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12257\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12257)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12257)\">D&amp;C 58:56<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Will of the Lord Again Revealed<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nAs in olden times, so in our day, holy men of God speak as they are moved upon by the Holy\nGhost (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4799\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4799)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4799)\">2 Pet. 1:21<\/a><\/span>),\nand whatsoever they speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture,\nshall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord,\nand the word of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12264\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12264)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12264)\">D&amp;C 68:4<\/a><\/span>). It should be a great comfort\nto the Latter-day Saints in this day of which the Lord foretold, when peace should be taken\nfrom the earth, and the devil would have power over his own dominion, to hear the Lord say\nin revelation that in that day he would reign in the midst of his people and would have power\nover his Saints (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12217\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12217)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12217)\">D&amp;C 1:35-36<\/a><\/span>).\nBut in this day when the arm of the Lord shall be revealed, they who will not\nlisten to the voice of the Lord, neither to the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the\napostles and prophets, shall be cut off from among the people\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12212\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12212)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12212)\">D&amp;C 1:14<\/a><\/span>). Some of the most profound\nthinkers in our generation, other than Church members, have realized the need for revelations\nfrom the Lord in order to give vitality to the teachings of a church. It was Ralph Waldo\nEmerson who said:\n<\/p><p>\nThe Hebrew and Greek scriptures contain immortal sentences that have been the bread of life\nto millions, but they do not have epical integrity, are fragmentary and are not shown in their\norder to the intellect. . . .\n<\/p><p>\nNor can the Bible be closed until the last great man is born. . . . Men have come to speak of\nrevelation as somewhat long ago given and done, as if God were dead. That injury to faith\nthrottles the preachers and the goodliest of institutions become an uncertain and inarticulate\nvoice. The need was never greater for revelation than it is today.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>The Purpose of Revelation<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nIn our day the Lord has given us the reason and the purpose for which revelations are given.\nHe said to us in one of the earliest revelations in this day of the restored Church:\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the\nearth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., . . . and gave him commandments; And\nalso gave commandments to others, that . . . The weak things of the world shall . . . break\ndown the mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in\nthe arm of flesh&mdash;But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, . . . That\nfaith also might increase in the earth; That mine everlasting covenant might be established;\nThat the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed. . . Behold, I am God and have spoken it;\nthese commandments are of me, and were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the\nmanner of their language, that they might come to understanding. And inasmuch as they\nerred, it might be made known; And inasmuch as they sought wisdom, they might be\ninstructed; . . . And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong, and blessed\nfrom on high, and receive knowledge from time to time\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12214\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12214)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12214)\">D&amp;C 1:17-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, obedient to that purpose, there have been in this day, our day, men commissioned of\nthe Lord with power and authority, and he has given them the inspiration to teach and\nproclaim these things to the world for the purpose the Lord has set forth, and he has done it\nhere in this conference and will continue to do so until the end of the conference, that the\nimportant things might be counseled by the elders of the Church to this people according to\nthe inspiration and revelation they receive from time to time. As the Latter-day Saints go\nhome from this conference, it would be well if they consider\nseriously the importance of taking with them the report of this conference and let it be the\nguide to their walk and talk during the next six months. These are the important matters the\nLord sees fit to reveal to this people in this day in the year 1946.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Foresight of Church Leaders<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nThe divine nature of the activities of this Church was never more attested than in the\ndevelopments of this last decade, when, under the inspiration of heaven, our leaders have been\ntrying to prepare this people against the calamities which were shortly to come upon the\ninhabitants of the earth. At the time when the nations of the world were fomenting hate and\nracial prejudices, this, the Church of Jesus Christ, was sending missionaries to many of these\nnations, preaching the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of God. We were exemplifying\nthat brotherhood here at home by the teamwork of priesthood quorums and by ward and stake\ngroups working on welfare projects and in missionary activities. When a false and inflated\nprosperity was abroad in the land, caused by the demands of the recent war, this people,\nlargely by volunteer labor, were filling storehouses with surpluses that would otherwise have\ngone to waste. They were building a grain elevator and storing grain at the\ntime when wheat was being destroyed because it was not needed. They were, in obedience to\nthe counsel of the leaders of the Church, filling their own cellars and their own basements\nwith the commodities necessary to meet the needs that were foreseen in a day to come, and in\norder to reduce the drain on the public supply that would otherwise be needed for the\nprosecution of the purposes of this government. The things, it seems to me, that we need most\nin the world today, are, first, a recognition of the \"modern Josephs\" represented in the\nleadership of the Church today, because of the prophetic vision they have exercised in seeing\nthis day of want and destruction; and second, we need \"modern Pharaohs\" in this and other\nnations, who will recognize the statements of these leaders of the Church as the mind of the\nLord and the word of the Lord to the world in this day.\n<\/p><p>\nAn unintentional testimony was given to us recently in the nation's capital by a high-placed\ngovernment official when he said after we had explained to him the welfare activities of the\nChurch \"You have done the very thing in your Church that the government is now trying to\ndo in its present program to provide food for the starving nations of Europe.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAs the carloads of foodstuffs and clothing and bedding move down to the seaports to be\ntransported overseas to feed our needy people, and as the truckloads in our country go to meet\nsimilar needs in that distressed area, I have felt in my heart that surely this is sufficient\nevidence of the hand of the Lord being laid bare in behalf of his people.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Tenth Anniversary of Church Welfare Program<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nToday marks the tenth anniversary of the inauguration or the announcement of the churchwide\nactivity known as the Church welfare program. I cannot come to this day without looking\nback over the days that have passed. I have remembered some of those who lathered this\nwork, since its inception, who have been called to their eternal home: President Heber J.\nGrant, Melvin J. Ballard, Nicholas G. Smith, Campbell M. Brown, J. Frank Ward, Robert L.\nJudd, Elias S. Woodruff, Byron D. Anderson. As I think of their passing, I can't help\ncontemplating what their interest is in the welfare program wherever they are today. I can't\nbelieve that it is less than it was here; and if the Lord gives them the opportunity to exercise\nthat influence, I am certain they will be exercising it. What of us here? In paying due honor\nto what they attempted to build, I wonder if we have remembered their words. We have\nrepeated often the statement that was given to us by President Grant when this program was\nlaunched. These were his words and you heard them repeated, time and again, when he said:\n<\/p><p>\nOur primary purpose is to set up, insofar as it might be possible, a system\nunder which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole abolished, and\nindependence, industry, and thrift and self-respect be once more established amongst our\npeople. The aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves. Work is to be\nre-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership.\n(<i>The Improvement Era<\/i>, April 1946. p. 209.)\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Foundation Stones of Welfare Work<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nI traveled over the Church by request of the First Presidency with Elder Melvin J. Ballard in\nthe early days of the welfare program to discuss with local Church leaders the details essential\nto its beginning. There were three favorite passages of scripture that he frequently quoted to\nthe people. One statement that he often repeated was this \"We must take care of our own\npeople, for the Lord has said that all this is to be done that:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . the church may stand independent above all other creatures beneath the celestial world\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12274\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12274)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12274)\">D&amp;C 78:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again he taught, after quoting from the one hundred fifteenth section of the Doctrine and\nCovenants:\n<\/p><p>\nVerily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the\nnations (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12310\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12310)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12310)\">D&amp;C 115:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the day of demonstration of the power of the Lord in behalf of his people. And again\nquoting the one hundred fourth section:\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his\nportion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy, he shall, with the\nwicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12298\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12298)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12298)\">D&amp;C 104:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI read these quotations to you today to remind you of the foundation stones on which the\nwelfare work of the Church has been laid.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Obligation to Care for Our Own<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nAs I have recalled the experiences of the last ten years, I have thought of the welfare work as\na kind of temporal turning of the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the\nfathers (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32707\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32707)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32707)\">Mal. 4:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYou who may think that a far-fetched statement, may I remind you of one or two scriptures?\nTo Timothy, the Apostle Paul said:\n<\/p><p>\nBut if any [man] provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath\ndenied the faith, and is worse than an infidel\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2798\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2798)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2798)\">1 Tim. 5:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again the commandment from Mt. Sinai, and interpreted by the Master, you will\nremember, to mean the taking care of aging parents by children:\n<\/p><p>\nHonour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord\nthy God giveth thee (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22566\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22566)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22566)\">Ex. 20:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFrom these two scriptures I make these two conclusions: In the first place\nthose who refuse to care for their own are subject to a judgment more severe than that which\nwould be meted out to one who lost his faith and had become as an infidel; and second, that\nthose who refuse to honor father and mother in the way the Master explained, are\njeopardizing their tenure upon this land which the Lord has given us. I have thought a great\ndeal about that. I wonder whether that tenure shall be jeopardized because of the burdensome\ntaxation that shall increase and grow until we are virtually displaced in our ownership, if we\ndon't take care of our own, or I am wondering whether the Lord will withdraw his blessings,\nas Amulek declared in the thirty-fourth chapter of Alma\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50067\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50067)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50067)\">Alma 34:28-29<\/a><\/span>),\nif we refuse to succor those who\nstand in need of help (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8846\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8846)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8846)\">Alma 4:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd on the other hand, so far as children are concerned, I have remembered what the Apostle\nPaul said about that: He predicted a time that would come in the last days, a perilous time\nwhen men should be lovers of their own selves, covetous, disobedient, unthankful, unholy,\nwithout natural affection (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5093\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5093)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5093)\">2 Tim. 3:1-4<\/a><\/span>).\nThat sounds strangely familiar to the language of the Lord in this day, when he declared:\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there are idlers among\nthem; and their children are also growing up in wickedness; they also seek not earnestly the\nriches of eternity, but their eyes are full of greediness. These things ought not to be, and must\nbe done away from among them (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12268\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12268)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12268)\">D&amp;C 68:31-32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI have asked myself if the failure of children to take care of their aging parents, when they\ncome to a day of want and are in need of sustenance, is due to the failure of parents, in the\nday gone by, to teach those same children to avoid the curse of idleness, and to be responsible\nin righteousness before our Heavenly Father. Unless we teach our children today correct\nprinciples, they, like some children today, will be thankless and without the natural affection\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5096\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5096)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5096)\">2 Tim. 3:3<\/a><\/span>)\nnecessary to cement this society upon a firm, determined foundation. Yes, it seems to me that\nin very deed, the welfare plan has been a kind of turning of the hearts of the children to the\nfathers and the fathers to the children\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32708\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32708)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32708)\">Mal. 4:6<\/a><\/span>),\nthat we might be prolonged upon this land which the\nLord our God has given us (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22567\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22567)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22567)\">Ex. 20:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<i>The Lord's Plan for Security<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has given us in this day the greatest organization upon the face of the earth, with\nhis power and his authority to direct it. He has given us sound principles; he has shown us the\nplan and the way by which want and distress may be done away among us. He has shown us\nthe way to brotherly love. If the afflictions which have been predicted do come upon us, they\nwill come upon us because we have not kept the faith and because we have been disobedient\nand have thrown away the opportunities that our Heavenly Father has given us to prepare for\nthe day of calamity which he foretold\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12213\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12213)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12213)\">D&amp;C 1:17<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12251\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12251)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12251)\">D&amp;C 45:49-50<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12323\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12323)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12323)\">D&amp;C 136:35<\/a><\/span>),\nover one hundred years ago, would come in this generation.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember at the dedication of the grain elevator in 1940 hearing President McKay in an\ninspired and prophetic prayer utter these words:\n<\/p><p>\nMay this be an edifice of service, a contribution of love, and as such we dedicate it unto thee\nand ask thy blessings to attend all who have contributed to its erection and all who may\ncontribute to the keeping of these bins filled with the wheat which is considered necessary to\nbe preserved preparatory to the judgments that await the nations of the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nMy prayer is today that those who contribute, and those who receive as well, shall so live in\nthe bonds of brotherhood and unity and oneness, that the Lord can reign in the midst of his\nSaints and be a power over them and a shield, as he promised in the ninety-seventh section of\nthe Doctrine and Covenants (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12285\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12285)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12285)\">D&amp;C 97:18-28<\/a><\/span>)\nhe would be, if we his Saints would keep his commandments in the day when the\njudgments were about to descend upon the earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12300\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12300)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12300)\">D&amp;C 109:38<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30250\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30250)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30250)\">JS&mdash;H 1:45<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us so to live and to keep in harmony with his Spirit that these things may be with\nthe Saints in our day, I pray humbly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
