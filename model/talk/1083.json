Millions accept him as the Great Teacher, whose teachings, however,\nare not applicable to modern social conditions. A few accept him for what he really\nis&mdash;\"Only Begotten of the Father\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27893\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27893)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27893)\">John 1:14<\/a><\/span>)\nwho came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for\nthe world and to bear the sins of the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13893\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13893)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13893)\">D&amp;C 76:41<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLast Monday morning, October third, the Premier of Soviet Russia threatened that if the\nUnited Nations does not reorganize as he demands, the communist bloc will \"rely on their\nown strength to block us.\" He also threatened to ignore the United Nation's peace-making\nmachinery unless the Secretary General of the United Nations resign, and his position, that is,\nthe Secretary's position, be replaced by a communist-styled, three-man presidium armed with\nveto powers.\n<\/p><p>\nWho is this man who presumes to tell the United Nations what to do? He is a man who\nrejects the divinity of Jesus Christ and denies the existence of God, who is imbued with the\nfalse philosophy of Karl Marx, whose aim in life was \"to dethrone God and destroy\ncapitalism.\" He is a follower of Lenin, who said, \"I want children to hate their parents who\nare not communists.\" The followers of these men, to gain their ends, \"resort to all sorts of\nstratagems, maneuvers, illegal methods, evasions, and subterfuges.\" This atheistic attitude, and\nthe advice to hate others, even one's own family, is just the opposite of the spirit of love as\nmanifest and taught by the Savior. In sessions in another part of the United States are men\nwho believe as I have indicated and who are willing to resort to any subterfuge, any scheme,\nthat will further their ends to dethrone God. We appeal to God, who exists and lives, and with\nwhom we are in harmony this morning&mdash;we have met in the name of his Beloved Son.\n<\/p><p>\nAbout fifty years ago, Lord Balfour, Prime Minister of Great Britain, delivered a lecture in\nthe McEwen Hall of the University of Edinburgh, upon the subject, \"The Moral Value which\nUnites the Nations,\"&mdash;the moral values. In an interesting and convincing manner, the\ngentleman presented the fundamental ties that unite the different nations of the world: First,\ncommon knowledge; second, common commercial interests; third, the intercourse of\ndiplomatic relationships; fourth, the bonds of human friendships.\n<\/p><p>\nThe audience greeted his masterful address with a great outburst of applause. As the presiding\nofficer arose to express his appreciation and that of the audience, a Japanese student who was\ndoing graduate work at the university stood up, and leaning over the balcony said, \"But Mr.\nBalfour, what about Jesus Christ?\"\n<\/p><p>\nMr. Robin E. Spear, to whom Professor Lang related this incident, writes as follows: \"One\ncould have heard a pin drop in the hall. Everyone felt at once the justice of the rebuke. The\nleading statesman of the greatest Christian empire in the world had been dealing with the\ndifferent ties that are to unite mankind and had omitted the one fundamental and essential\nbond. And everyone felt, too, the dramatic element in the situation&mdash;that the reminder of his\nforgetfulness had come from a Japanese student from a faraway, non-Christian land.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNearly two thousand years ago, Christ's chief apostle on one occasion, when he was arraigned\nbefore the Jews for having healed an impotent man, made the following declaration:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of\nNazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man\nstand here before you whole.\n<\/p><p>\n\"This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the\ncorner.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given\namong men, whereby we must be saved\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7859\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7859)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7859)\">Acts 4:10-12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat was a most dramatic occasion, and it took strength and fearlessness to make that\nstatement to those men, some of whom had participated in Christ's crucifixion. Peter, on that\noccasion, bore a strong testimony to those people. These officers warned Peter and John\nnot to preach Jesus Christ and him crucified, but they heard Peter and\nJohn answer as I have read, and they saw the impotent man standing before them healed.\nThey counseled among themselves what to do. Returning, they cautioned Peter and John not\nto preach Jesus Christ, but Peter, as spokesman under the inspiration of the Lord, answered:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7863\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7863)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7863)\">Acts 4:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe knowledge that Jesus is truly the Son of the Living God had been declared by Peter in\nthe presence of his Master on an occasion when Jesus and his apostles were at Caesarea\nPhilippi, when Christ had asked his disciples,\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? [a grammatical error, by the way, which\ncomes down through the ages.]\n<\/p><p>\n\"And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or\none of the prophets.\n<\/p><p>\n\"[And Jesus] saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"And Simon Peter, [the spokesman, fearless, impetuous by nature answered], Thou art the\nChrist, the Son of the living God.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, [Simon, son of\nJona]; for <i>flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee<\/i>, but my Father which is in heaven.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter [Simon's other name, which means a rock], and\nupon this rock [of revelation] I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail\nagainst it\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35044\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35044)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35044)\">Matt. 16:13-18<\/a><\/span>, italics added).\n<\/p><p>\nComparatively speaking, only a small group of men and women knew him as he really\nis&mdash;the Son of God, the Redeemer of mankind. This testimony has been revealed to every\nsincere man and woman who has conformed to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ,\nwho has obeyed the ordinances and become entitled to and has received the Spirit of God and\nthat of the Holy Ghost. Every individual stands independent in his sphere in that testimony,\njust as these thousands or incandescent lamps which make Salt Lake City so brilliant at night,\neach one of which stands and shines in its own sphere, yet the light in it is produced by the\nsame power, the same energy from which all the other lights receive their energy. So each\nindividual in the Church stands independently in his sphere, independently in the knowledge\nthat God lives, that the Savior is the Redeemer of the world, and that the gospel of Jesus\nChrist has been restored through Joseph Smith the Prophet.\n<\/p><p>\n\"To some it is given,\" says the Lord in the Doctrine and Covenants, \"by the Holy Ghost to\nknow that Jesus is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13878\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13878)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13878)\">D&amp;C 46:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is to these I refer who stand firm upon the rock of revelation in the testimony that they bear\nto the world. But the Lord says further that there are those to whom it is given to believe\nupon the testimony of the words of others\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13879\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13879)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13879)\">D&amp;C 46:14<\/a><\/span>). Note that. They believe upon the words of others\nthat they may also receive salvation if they continue faithful. For all these, however, there\ncomes a testimony also of daily experience. The members of the Church throughout the world\nfind confirmation of their testimony in every performance of duty. They know that the gospel\nteaches them to be better individuals, that obedience to the principles of the gospel makes\nthem stronger men and truer women. Every day such knowledge comes to them, and they\ncannot gainsay it. They know that obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ makes them\nhappier, better, and truer husbands, true and honored wives, obedient children. They know\nthat obedience to the principles of the gospel makes them in every respect ideal home\nbuilders. The ideal is there. They sense it in their minds. They cannot gainsay it. They know\nit, and they know that transgression of these principles will have the opposite effect upon their\nindividual lives and upon their home lives. They know that obedience to the gospel fosters\ntrue brotherhood and fellowship among mankind. They know that they are better citizens by\nvirtue of obedience to the laws and ordinances So, as they go through their daily activities\nand apply religion in their weekly vocations, the truth of the gospel\nbecomes exemplified in their lives, thus with a testimony of the Spirit, the testimony of\nreason, and the testimony of daily experience, members of the Church throughout the world\nstand impregnable.\n<\/p><p>\nI have always been strongly impressed with a statement by Thomas Nixon Carver in his book,\n<i>The Religion Worth Having<\/i>, wherein he says:\n<\/p><p>\n\"The church that can say to the un-churched, 'Our way is best because it works best, our\npeople are efficient, prosperous, and happy because we are a body who aid one another in the\nproductive life; we waste none of our substance in vice, luxury, or ostentation; we do not\ndissipate our energy in brawling, gambling, or unwholesome habits; we conserve our\nresources of body and mind and devote them to the upbuilding of the Kingdom of God, which\nis not a mystical, but a real kingdom; it is a body of people dominated by ideas of\nproductivity, which is mutual service. We do not strive for the things that satisfy but for the\nmoment and then leave a bad taste; we strive for the things which build us up and enable us\nand our children to become strong, to flourish, and to conquer. We strive to make ourselves\nworthy to receive the world by fitting ourselves to use the world more productively than\nothers. We believe that obedience to God means obedience to the laws of nature, which are\nbut the manifestations of His will, and we try by painstaking study to acquire a most complete\nand exact knowledge of that will, in order that we may conform ourselves to it. We believe\nthat a reverence for God is respect for these laws; that meekness is teachableness and\nwillingness to learn by observation and experience. By practicing this kind of meekness or\nteachableness we believe that we shall inherit the earth, whereas the unmeek, the unteachable,\nwho are dominated by pride of tradition, shall not. We offer you hard work, frugal fare,\nsevere discipline, but a share in the conquest of the world for the religion of the productive\nlife.' Such a church,\" he continues, \"is rounded upon the rock of economic efficiency and the\ngates of hell shall not prevail against it.\"\n<\/p><p>\nMy testimony, as yours, is that this Church of Jesus Christ can offer to the world all the good\nthings which this author is looking for, and more, because God has revealed more in the\ngovernment and conduct of his Church.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren and sisters, the testimony of the gospel is an anchor to the soul\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24288\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24288)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24288)\">Heb. 6:19<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22218\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22218)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22218)\">Ether 12:4<\/a><\/span>)\nin the midst of\nconfusion and strife. Knowledge of God and his laws means stability, means contentment,\nmeans peace, and with that a heart full of love reaching out to our fellow men, offering the\nsame blessings, the same privileges. Love will beget tolerance and kindness.\n<\/p><p>\nNow I suggest that during the next month or so, when our towns and cities and states will be\nmore or less stirred by political contention, that we restrain our tempers, control our tongues,\nand try to manifest charity and love for one another. Let us not besmear our brother's\nreputation. I mean that while we are urging our particular political belief, that we avoid\ndealing in personalities. We cannot afford to hurt our brother's feelings and wound him.\n<\/p><p>\nLeaders in the Church, in fact all members thereof, are striving to establish the kingdom of\nGod. Let us hold to that fact as the anchor of our soul and then breathe forth charity and love\nto those who may not see just as we do.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Oh, brother Man! fold to thy heart thy brother,<br \/>\nWhere pity dwells, the peace of God is there;<br \/>\nTo worship rightly is to love each other,<br \/>\nEach smile a hymn, each kindly deed a prayer.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Follow with reverent steps the great example<br \/>\nOf Him whose holy work was 'doing good';<br \/>\nSo shall the wide earth seem our Father's temple,<br \/>\nEach loving life a psalm of gratitude.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Then shall all shackles fall; the stormy clangor<br \/>\nOf wild war music o'er the earth shall cease;<br \/>\nLove shall tread out the baleful fire of anger,<br \/>\nAnd in its ashes plant the tree of peace!\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;          (John Greenleaf Whittier)\n<\/p><p>\nIn conclusion, let us stand with our hearts centered and our aims firmly fixed upon this\neternal truth&mdash;that the gospel of Jesus Christ is among men for the redemption and salvation\nof the human family. Let us go forth in that spirit and deal with our fellow men in the spirit\nof love and kindness. Let us work in our councils, in our quorums, guided by that same spirit.\n<\/p><p>\nGod grant that we may remain true to the Church, that we may ever be found defending the\nmen whom God has called to guide us, and realize that harmony with them means that we are\nin harmony with God, for he sustains them. I pray for this blessing for all of us throughout\nthe entire world, and that each member may carry the responsibility of his membership in the\nChurch preparatory to the establishment of the kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
