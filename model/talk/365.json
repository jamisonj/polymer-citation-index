I pray for the\ninspiration of heaven and for your faith and prayers as I attempt to speak to you briefly this\nafternoon.\n<\/p><p>\nFAITH OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS\n<\/p><p>\nI never return from visiting one of the great missions of the Church, as I did this week, or\nreturn from visiting a stake of Zion, but what my heart is filled with gratitude as I note the\ndevotion, the loyalty, and the faith of the Latter-day Saints. As I witness the growth of the\nwork of the Lord in various parts of the world, my heart rejoices. With you, my brethren and\nsisters, I love this great latter-day work. I am wondering today if we fully appreciate what we\nhave.\n<\/p><p>\nI have sometimes said to my wife, as I returned from visiting in the stakes, that I do not\nknow exactly what heaven is going to be like, but I could ask nothing finer over there than to\nhave the pleasure and joy of associating with the type of men and women I meet in the\nleadership of the stakes and wards of Zion and the missions of the earth. Truly we are richly\nblessed. President Smith continually calls our attention to the rich treasures of heaven that\ncome to us as Latter-day Saints, members of the true church of Christ. It is about one of these\nblessings that I should like to speak briefly this afternoon.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Joseph said many years ago that one of the greatest sins for which the Latter-day\nSaints are guilty is the sin of ingratitude\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12462\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12462)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12462)\">D&amp;C 59:21<\/a><\/span>).\nI wonder, my brethren and sisters, if we are fully grateful for all that we enjoy.\n<\/p><p>\nDISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF TRUE CHURCH\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the distinguishing features, and a very important feature, of the true church of Christ\nis its priesthood, the authority of God. It is widely distributed among the male membership of\nthe Church, boys and men, Fathers and sons, and its blessings are shared by our mothers,\ndaughters and wives. Do we fully understand and appreciate what it means to us? What is it\nand what is its significance to those of us who have been blessed with it?\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Joseph F. Smith said:\n<\/p><p>\n[The priesthood] is nothing more nor less than the power of God delegated to man by which\nman can act in the earth for the salvation of the human family, in the name of the Father and\nof the Son and of the Holy Ghost, and act legitimately; not assuming that authority, nor\nborrowing it from generations that are dead and gone, but authority that has been given in this\nday in which we live by ministering angels and spirits from above, direct from the presence\nof Almighty God . . . (<i>Gospel Doctrine<\/i>, 1939 edition, pp. 139-140).\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Taylor said: \n<\/p><p>\n[Priesthood] is the power of God delegated to intelligences in the heavens and to men on the\nearth (<i>The Gospel Kingdom<\/i>, p. 129).\n<\/p><p>\nSo priesthood transcends this mortal life. Its power and greatness has been referred to by\nprophets, modern and ancient. In my own heart I can conceive of nothing greater that man\ncan possess than the priesthood of God, coupled with a burning testimony of the divinity of\nthis work. The two should always be coupled together. Priesthood is the very heart of the\nChurch. We may have the priesthood without the Church, but never the Church without the\npriesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nGIFT OF THE HOLY PRIESTHOOD\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many gifts that we enjoy as members of the Church, but I can think of none greater\nthan the gift of the Holy Priesthood, the authority to represent God in the earth. This\npriesthood is destined to build and exalt men as well as to assist the Lord in the promotion of\nhis great work in saving and exalting the souls of men.\n<\/p><p>\nIn recent weeks, in fact, within the last few days, there have come into this building two\ndistinguished Americans, one of them the President of the United States. I was not able to\nattend the meeting at which he spoke, but as I sat here the other night and contemplated our\nblessings as we listened to the other distinguished visitor, I wondered how men of the\npriesthood regard their priesthood in comparison with the honors of men, political and\notherwise. Is the wealth of the world or the honors of men to he compared with the\npriesthood of God\n<\/p><p>\nI realize it comes easy. Our boys twelve years of age, if worthy, receive the Holy Priesthood\nby the laying on of hands, and our young men are hardly more than boys when at nineteen\nthey receive the holy Melchizedek Priesthood, the authority to officiate in the most sacred\nordinances known to man. This priesthood will, if they are worthy, entitle them eventually to\na place in the celestial kingdom of God. I have been amazed at the great number of men and\nboys in the Church who hold this great authority and who have in their hands this great\nblessing, if they will only take advantage of it.\n<\/p><p>\nI checked a few figures recently which indicate that we have approximately 280,140 men and\nboys in the Church who hold the priesthood. There are 146,330 who hold the Melchizedek\nPriesthood&mdash;elders in the Church&mdash;who are candidates for the celestial kingdom. \"We\nhave 133,810 boys who have been blessed with this great privilege of serving in the home of\nthe Master.\n<\/p><p>\nOBLIGATION OF THE PRIESTHOOD BEARER\n<\/p><p>\nWhat is the obligation of the priesthood bearer? We have been referred to as the greatest body\nof men on the face of the earth. Of course the fact that we possess the priesthood, is no\nassurance of our exaltation. But certainly in terms of power, prerogative, and responsibility no\ngroup of men in all the world has been blessed with such obligations and opportunities as has\nthe body of men and boys in the Church who hold the priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been impressed, too, my brethren and sisters, that probably nowhere in all the world\ncan we find a group of men who give so unselfishly of their time, their means, and their\ntalents to the promotion of good and righteousness in the world as does this body of men. I\nmarvel as I witness the great voluntary service which is carried forward by this body of\npriesthood, and always in the back of my head, as I give encouragement to greater activity, is\nthe assurance that this is a choice group of men. In the Church, there is truly a spirit of\nunselfish service.\n<\/p><p>\nSPIRIT OF SERVICE\n<\/p><p>\nThere came to my office a few days ago a fine upstanding, sweet-spirited elderly man. He\ncame in timidly and took a chair at the desk, and then he said: \"Brother Benson, how old can\na man be before he is too old to go on a mission?\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I answered: \"My good brother, I do not know that there is any upper age limit.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe said: \"I have been on two missions, and I would like to go on one more before I pass\naway. I would like to go back to Oklahoma, where I served my second mission.\n<\/p><p>\nDo you think I am too old?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"How old are you?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Eighty-six; but I would like to go once more before I die.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow, there is much of that spirit among the priesthood of the Church. I thrill with it, my\nbrethren, and I am grateful to be associated with men who carry that spirit. I have been\nimpressed in reading the revelations, that there are at least four significant things pertaining to\nthis priesthood which have been emphasized by the Lord to his prophets.\n<\/p><p>\nIf I may, I would like to refer to those four items.\n<\/p><p>\nOATH AND COVENANT OF PRIESTHOOD\n<\/p><p>\nBack in 1832 when the missionaries had returned from their fields of labor to Kirtland, Ohio,\nand had evidenced concern about the priesthood which they had been blessed with, the Lord\ngave a revelation on priesthood, contained in the 84th section of the D&amp;C. In that revelation\nthe Lord spoke of the \"oath and covenant\" of the priesthood\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12487\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12487)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12487)\">D&amp;C 84:39-40<\/a><\/span>), and the obligation of men who\nhold it to be true and faithful to that priesthood and to magnify their callings. The Lord said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and\nthe magnifying of their callings, are sanctified by the Spirit, . . [and become] . . . the church\nand kingdom and the elect of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12485\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12485)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12485)\">D&amp;C 84:33-34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then, even more significant, this great promise was made: . . . therefore all that my\nFather hath shall be given unto him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12486\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12486)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12486)\">D&amp;C 84:38<\/a><\/span>),\nthe priesthood bearer who is faithful and\nmagnifies his calling.\n<\/p><p>\n. . . this,\" says the Lord, \"is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the\npriesthood. . . those who receive the priesthood,\" the Lord indicates, \"receive this oath and\ncovenant of my Father, which he cannot break\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12488\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12488)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12488)\">D&amp;C 84:39-40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd this solemn warning:\n<\/p><p>\nBut whoso breaketh this covenant after he hath received it, and altogether turneth therefrom,\nshall not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to come\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12489\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12489)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12489)\">D&amp;C 84:41<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow this covenant is between our Heavenly Father and those of us who bear the priesthood\nWe promise when we receive it to be true and faithful, to honor the priesthood and magnify\nit.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord promises in return the richest blessings of eternity.\n<\/p><p>\n\"ANXIOUSLY ENGAGED IN A GOOD CAUSE\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe <i>second<\/i> significant thing spoken of in the revelations is found in the fifty-eighth section of\nthe D&amp;C and was given to the elders 117 years ago. It is to the effect that men who hold the\npriesthood \"<i>should be anxiously engaged in a good cause<\/i>\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12458\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12458)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12458)\">D&amp;C 58:26-27<\/a><\/span>). The Lord points out that it is not\nto be expected, it is not expedient, \"it is not meet,\" he says, \"that I should command in all\nthings,\" for he that does not anything until he is commanded is a slothful servant. And then\nhe says: \". . . men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause. . . and bring to pass much\nrighteousness\" (D. &amp; C. 58:26-27), of their own free will for the power is in them to be\nagents unto themselves\n<\/p><p>\nSo it is not enough to receive the priesthood and then sit back passively and wait until\nsomeone prods us into activity When we receive the priesthood, we have the obligation of\nbecoming actively and anxiously engaged in promoting the cause of righteousness in the earth,\nbecause the Lord says:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a commandment with\ndoubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12460\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12460)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12460)\">D&amp;C 58:29<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPRIESTHOOD EXERCISED UPON RIGHTEOUSNESS\n<\/p><p>\nThe <i>third<\/i> significant thing regarding the priesthood and the priesthood bearer is that it should\nbe exercised \"<i>only upon principles of righteousness<\/i>\".\nReference was made by President Clark\nthis morning to that section of prayer and prophecies of the Prophet Joseph, section 121, in\nwhich it is pointed out that many are called but few are chosen. And the reason why they are\nnot chosen is because men's hearts are so set upon the things of this world and aspire to the\nhonors of men that they do not learn fundamental lessons\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12546\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12546)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12546)\">D&amp;C 121:34-35<\/a><\/span>). \"That the rights of the priesthood\nare inseparably connected with the powers of heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12547\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12547)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12547)\">D&amp;C 121:36<\/a><\/span>), and the priesthood\ncan be exercised and controlled only upon the principles of righteousness. Yes, there is danger\nin receiving authority and power, if exercised unrighteously. And the Prophet makes it very\nclear that it seems to be the disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little power,\nto exercise unrighteous dominion over their fellows, and when that time comes, then there\nusually follows the spirit of apostasy, a spirit of criticism, a tendency to persecute the Saints\nand fight against the Church (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12548\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12548)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12548)\">D&amp;C 121:38-39<\/a><\/span>).\n\"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue\nof the priesthood,\" says this section, \"only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and\nmeekness, and by love unfeigned\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12549\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12549)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12549)\">D&amp;C 121:41<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd then great promises follow to the man\nwho exercises his priesthood upon the principles of righteousness.\n<\/p><p>\nACT IN ALL DILIGENCE\n<\/p><p>\nThe <i>fourth<\/i> significant thing is found in that great revelation on the priesthood, given through\nthe Prophet to the Council of the Twelve and the Church as the Twelve were about to depart\non missions to various parts of the country. It is contained in the 107th section of the D&amp;C.\nThe Lord closes that great revelation with these words:\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, now <i>let every man learn his duty<\/i>, and to <i>act in the office in which he is<\/i>\n<i>appointed, in all diligence<\/i>. He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he\nthat learns not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12525\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12525)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12525)\">D&amp;C 107:99-100<\/a><\/span>, italics speaker's).\n<\/p><p>\nThere are two obligations in connection with that significance injunction; first, that we learn\nour duty, and secondly, that we act in the office in which we have been appointed in all\ndiligence.\n<\/p><p>\nNow to help to make this priesthood more effective in our lives and in the lives of those we\nserve, the Lord has provided quorums of the priesthood&mdash;service units, classes,\nbrotherhoods&mdash;through which we may operate and make our efforts more productive of good.\n<\/p><p>\nOBLIGATIONS OF PRIESTHOOD\n<\/p><p>\nThere are really two great obligations resting upon the priesthood quorum, or brotherhood.\nFirst, is the obligation of looking after the welfare of our members. Anything pertaining to the\nsocial, economic, or spiritual welfare of members should be the concern of the quorum. In\naddition, it is the great obligation of quorums to assist in promoting the program of the\nChurch which is three-fold:\n<\/p><p>\nfirst, the building up of the stakes and wards of Zion and keeping the people in the line of\ntheir duty; second, the carrying of the message of the restored gospel to those who have not\nyet heard it or accepted it; and third, the carrying forward of the great responsibility of temple\nwork for the living and the dead in the houses of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nThese obligations rest squarely upon the priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nINACTIVE MEMBERS PRESENT CHALLENGE\n<\/p><p>\nNow, my brethren, we face a great challenge. At the present time we have wide participation\nand wide activity, and we are making progress as evidenced by the records that come in from\nall parts of the Church. Our progress is splendid. Our performance probably was never any\nbetter, if as good, as now, yet there is much to be done. As we have checked the records for\nlast year, we find that approximately one-third of the total Melchizedek Priesthood\nmembership is not engaged in any Church activity of any kind. In addition to this group we\nhave approximately twenty thousand men over twenty-one who hold no priesthood;\napproximately fifty-six thousand adult members of the Aaronic Priesthood, and some four\nthousand boys twelve to twenty-one not yet ordained. This gives a total of eighty thousand for\nwhich the Lord will hold us in large measure responsible, to win them to activity and\ndevotion, so that they may receive the Holy Melchizedek Priesthood and enjoy blessings\nwhich flow therefrom. This great number, plus inactive Melchizedek Priesthood members,\npresent a great responsibility and challenge. In their veins flow some of the best blood of this\ndispensation.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are expected, in very deed, to be our brother's keeper\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23535\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23535)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23535)\">Gen. 4:9<\/a><\/span>), and if we fail, we will, of course,\nbe our own accusers. Now is the time to live the standards of the Church, to magnify our\npriesthood, to live worthy of the rich promises made to us as bearers of the priesthood. Let\nus, therefore, be anxiously engaged in a good cause. Let us be true to the oath and covenant\nof the priesthood. Let us exercise the priesthood upon the principles of righteousness. And let\nus all learn our duty and act in the office in which we have been appointed in all diligence.\n<\/p><p>\nI leave with you, my brethren and sisters, my testimony that no greater blessing can come to\nany man on this earth than to receive the priesthood of God and a testimony of the divinity of\nthis work, if he honors that priesthood and lives according to the teachings and standards of\nthe church.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the work of God. I know it as I know I live. May God help us as a body of men,\nclothed with power and authority, to help establish Zion and build up the kingdom, to go\nforward and accomplish the work which the Lord would have us do, without flinching and\nwithout hesitation, in all faithfulness, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
