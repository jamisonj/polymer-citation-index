As you know, the facade of the Mormon Pavilion at the New York World's Fair was a\nreplica of the front of the Salt Lake Temple. Many visitors commented on its beauty and\nreligious significance. It served as a beacon and a magnet to draw millions of people to the\npavilion.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Millions seek greater light and knowledge<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe found after visiting with millions of visitors at the Mormon Pavilion that many were\nsincerely seeking for greater light and knowledge relative to God's plan of life. Many wanted\nto know more about a living, personal God and about a living, personal Jesus Christ. They\nseemed hungry and anxious to hear the teachings of the Savior as they were taught and lived\nby him. They wanted to hear the doctrines of the holy scriptures as given by the ancient\nprophets, apostles, and Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Youthful missionaries have the spirit<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe main exhibit at the pavilion was the missionaries. The priesthood and the Holy Ghost\nwere manifest to tens of thousands through the spirit, love, and dedication of the missionaries.\nMany visitors left their comments.\n<\/p><p>\nA Catholic said: \"There should be more young men like this called all over the world. This is\nthe most instructive religious pavilion at the fair. I'm impressed with so many young men\nknowing the truth.\"\n<\/p><p>\nA Baptist said: \"Words fail to describe the beauty seen here. I wish every faith had as much\nconviction and such dedicated young people with the ideals of the spirit. There is hope for the\nfuture through your young people.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe Mormon Pavilion with its achievements is one of the greatest, most far-reaching\nmissionary ventures of our time. We learned many lessons from the visitors at the pavilion;\nand if the lessons are fully used, they will help to bring into reality one of the great requests\nof our prophet, President David O. McKay. He requested that every member be a missionary\nand that each member bring one or more persons into the Church each year.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord said in modern-day revelation, \"Behold, I sent you out to testify and warn the\npeople, and it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14829\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14829)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14829)\">D&amp;C 88:81<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI have asked hundreds of members if they would like to bring someone into The Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and each said, \"Yes\"; but year after year passes, and they do\nnot accomplish their desire. Only a very small percent of the Saints bring one or more\nconverts into the Church each year. We have more than one million possible members who\nwould like to help in reaching and teaching their friends, who would like to bring someone\ninto the Church each year.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Other centers of information<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe are in the process of creating and setting up similar exhibits to those used at the Mormon\nPavilion in each of the church bureaus of information where space is available. In the areas\nsuch as Salt Lake City the local missionaries and the Saints will be able to bring their friends\nand neighbors to the Salt Lake Temple Square Bureau of Information and there, with the help\nof visual aids, teach them about the restoration of the gospel and bring their friends to a\nknowledge of the Church of Jesus Christ. The exhibits will be built around the teachings and\ndoctrines as taught and exemplified by the Savior. It has always been most interesting to me\nto know that Jesus not only taught his plan of life and salvation, but he also set the example\nand requested that we follow him. This leaves little room for private interpretation.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Member missionaries to use the exhibits<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMissionary Saints through the help of the exhibits will be able to encourage their friends and\nneighbors to turn to the God-inspired scriptures to seek and find the true gospel through the\nrecorded message that our Father in heaven has left here on the earth for us.\n<\/p><p>\nThe exhibits will start with the creation of man in the image and likeness of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23721\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23721)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23721)\">Gen. 1:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe ancient prophets will be shown as God and heavenly messengers appeared and directed\nthem in the Lord's program.\n<\/p><p>\nThe teachings and examples of Jesus Christ will be shown through murals and various visual\naids, such as Jesus setting the example for proper water baptism, and all Christians will be\nencouraged to know and follow his example.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Exhibits review fundamentals of the Restoration<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJesus called, ordained, and built his Church around Twelve Apostles. Through visual aids and\nthe spoken word, we will encourage the people to know that apostles are an essential part of\nJesus Christ's Church.\n<\/p><p>\nThe apostasy from the teachings of Jesus Christ will be shown through visual aids. Men have\nchanged the concept of God and Jesus Christ. Some have even gone so far as to say that God\nis without body, parts, or passions. Men changed the baptism of Jesus. Men discontinued the\nTwelve Apostles. The Melchizedek Priesthood was changed. Tithing was discontinued among\nmany. And many other changes were made that time will not permit to bring to our attention.\n<\/p><p>\nWe will show through visual aids the First Vision and the restoration of the Church and the\nteachings and plan of life as given by the Savior.\n<\/p><p>\nThe same film on eternal life that was shown at the pavilion will be used. I would like to\nquote a statement by Norman Vincent Peale regarding the film. He said, \"The film told the\nstory of where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going.\" He added, \"The\nfilm motivated one to want to make the most of earth life, and the last two minutes of the\nfilm were the most touching, the most inspirational, and most revealing of any two minutes of\na film I have ever seen in my entire life.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe also said, \"I don't know the name of the character-actor who was the grandfather, but\nwhen he died and entered the eternal existence, bewilderment and wonder were written on his\nface. All of a sudden, he caught a glimpse of his wife from whom he had been parted. She\nran to him and threw her arms around him. Then came his brothers, sisters, mother and father,\naunts, uncles, grandparents, and all who were near and dear to him on earth. Surrounded by\nthose who loved him, the camera gave us a closeup of his face, whereon was written radiant,\nexultant joy. I have never seen such a character portrayal, nor such a beautiful scene. Out of\nthis film, I learned two things: (1) an entirely new concept of the purpose of life and its\nconnection with the eternities, and (2) an entirely new concept of the importance of the family\nin connection with the eternities.\" (Interview with T. Bowring Woodbury and Norman Vincent\nPeale, May 20, 1964.) Our family program is one of our great missionary tools.\n<\/p><p>\nWe hope that many exhibits will be created to assist the Saints and the missionaries to teach\nand love their neighbors and friends into the Church. We hope that it will be possible to have\nsimilar portable exhibits that can be attractively set up in the cultural halls and stake centers\nof the Church. They would run for a week or ten days, and the missionaries and Saints can\nbring their friends and neighbors. The World's Fair film on eternal life could also be shown\nas part of this exhibit.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Friends and neighbors to gain the spirit of the Restoration<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWith sufficient bureaus and portable units we should be able to have a half million Saints and\nmissionaries participate. Can you picture a half million Saints with the help of the Lord\nteaching their friends and neighbors about the restoration of God's program through a prophet\nof God and teaching them to see the plan of life as taught by the Savior and not the plan that\nhas been changed and corrupted by men?\n<\/p><p>\nThe religious unrest in the world today is causing the honest in heart to seek and look for the\nliving God. Many of our friends and neighbors are waiting to hear and know God's program\nfor man.\n<\/p><p>\nFellow Saints, you who have a testimony that God lives, that Jesus Christ lives, and that\nGod's plan of life is essential for entrance into the kingdom of heaven, you have a\nresponsibility to warn your neighbors. In my humble opinion the greatest potential missionary\npower and force of this Church is vested in the Saints. May we follow our Prophet and teach\nour friends and neighbors, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
