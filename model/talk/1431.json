This week\nand every week men and women all around the world will be getting together to discuss their\nproblems, exchange ideas, and try to develop more effective techniques for accomplishment.\nIf it is desirable for doctors and lawyers and teachers and farmers to get together to pool their\nideas and experiences and then use them to uplift and motivate each other, how much more\nimportant such a program should be for us, who labor in this greatest of all enterprises which\nJesus referred to as \"my Father's business\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31647\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31647)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31647)\">Luke 2:49<\/a><\/span>).\nThis is the business of building\ncharacter, godliness, and eternal exaltation into human lives. God has said that it is his work\nand his \". . . glory&mdash;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39239\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39239)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39239)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>).\nBut that is also our work, and it is also our glory, as God has invited each one of us to have a\nmembership in his firm and to take as great a part as we desire in promoting our own eternal\nwelfare. And what a stimulating idea it is that we may find our greatest employment in that\nwork in which God himself spends his entire time.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the chief characteristics of our age is our high standard of accomplishment. We live in\nthe greatest period of enlightenment and progress ever known in the world. No one desiring\nexcitement or wonders or miracles could complain about our age. In super jets we can now\nfly through the stratosphere faster than sound. In atomic submarines we can live comfortably\nin the depths of the sea or travel under the polar ice cap. And we are even now flapping our\nwings for an adventure into space. But next to God himself, the thing that we know less about\nthan anything else in the world is our own individual selves. That great masterpiece of\ncreation which God fashioned in his own image still remains the mystery of the universe.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen someone asks us questions about science, invention, or history, we can answer them.\nBut if we were asked to write out an analysis of ourselves and tell about our mind and soul\nqualities, we might not give a very good answer. We could not even explain why it is that we\ndo as we do when we believe as we believe. Or when men are asked about the purpose of life\nor the origin and destiny of their own souls, they usually become confused and largely remain\nsilent.\n<\/p><p>\nShakespeare's Macbeth expressed his philosophy by saying, \"Life . . . is a tale told by an\nidiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\" (<i>Macbeth<\/i>, Act V, scene 5.) That is, life\ndidn't mean anything to Macbeth, and there are many in our day who share this opinion of\nlife. Hamlet said, \"How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this\nworld! . . . 'tis an unweeded garden, that grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature\npossess it merely.\" (<i>Hamlet<\/i>, Act I, scene 2.) And in this country last year, over 20,000 people\nfollowed this persuasion and destroyed their own lives.\n<\/p><p>\nThe old Persian philosopher Omar Khayyam, who was among the wisest men of his day,\nconfessed his own inability to comprehend life by saying,\n<\/p><p>\n\"I came like Water, and like Wind I go?\n<\/p><p>\n     \"Into this Universe, and Why not knowing<br \/>\n     Nor <i>whence<\/i>, like Water willy-nilly flowing; <br \/>\n     And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,<br \/>\n     I know not <i>Whither<\/i>, willy-nilly blowing.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Up from Earth's Centre through the Seventh Gate<br \/>\n     I rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate,<br \/>\n     And many a Knot unravel'd by the Road; <br \/>\n     But not the Master-knot of Human Fate.\n<\/p><p>\n\"There was one Door to which I found no Key; <br \/>\n     There was the Veil through which I might not see.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;     (From \"The Rubaiyat,\" st. 28-29, 31-32, tr. by Edward Fitzgerald.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Three Stages of Existence<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSomeone has tried to help us understand life by comparing it to a three-act play. The\nscriptures tell of a long premortal existence, which was our first act. There is a little, short\nmortality, which is the second act; and then there is an eternal, everlasting third act. And\nsomeone has said that if you went into the theater after the first act had been finished and left\nbefore the third act began, you might not understand the play. Frequently life just doesn't\nmake sense, when like Macbeth or Hamlet or Omar Khayy\u00e1m we look at it in too limited\nperspective. How fortunate we are therefore to have God's point of view about life and to\nknow his answers to the great questions. And it has been said that \"the Big Three\" among the\nquestions of life are these&mdash;whence, why, and whither. Because of the particular relationship\nexisting between God and man, they can best be studied together.\n<\/p><p>\nOut of the golden age of Greece, we hear Socrates say, \"Know thyself.\" And Jesus gave a\ncompanion instruction when he said, \". . . this is life eternal, that they might know thee the\nonly true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28218\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28218)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28218)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>). To get a better\nappreciation for both God and ourselves, we might very profitably go back into the scriptures\nfor a review of our own first act.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Mortality<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Bible says that God is the literal Father of our spirits, and Jesus Christ was his\nfirst-begotten Son (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24333\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24333)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24333)\">Heb. 1:6<\/a><\/span>).\nLike Jesus we have all seen God, as we lived with him\nduring that long period of our first estate. Presumably we saw the foundations of this earth\nbeing laid and knew that we were going to have the great privilege of living upon it. We were\ninformed at that time that during our second estate we would be added upon\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7241\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7241)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7241)\">Abr. 3:26<\/a><\/span>) with these\nbeautiful, wonderful bodies, without which we could not have a fullness of joy either here or\nhereafter. We were told that for a few years we would have this miraculous power of\nprocreation, making it possible for us to have children and organize a family, which under the\nauthority of the priesthood would be the basic unit throughout eternity. When given this good\nnews the scripture tells us that \". . . all the sons of God shouted for joy\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26716\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26716)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26716)\">Job 38:7<\/a><\/span>). And I am\nconfident that if we now understood the importance of life as we understood it then, when we\nwalked by sight, we would be willing to crawl on our hands and knees through life for this\ntremendous privilege which we presently enjoy. But we also knew then that during our second\nestate it would be necessary for us to learn to walk a little way by faith. It was important in\nour development that we see good and evil side by side. We needed to be tested and tried\nwith the temptations of mortality and to develop a godly character by the exercise of our own\nfree agency.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A Blessing<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHenry Thoreau, an early American philosopher, once said that we should thank God every\nday of our lives for the privilege of having been born, and then he went on to speculate on\nthe rather unique supposition of what it might have been like if we had not been born, and he\npointed out some of the advantages that we would have missed as a consequence. But the\nscriptures tell us that one-third of all the spirit children of God never were born and never can\nbe born because they joined the rebellion of Satan and their own evil caused them to fail in\ntheir first estate (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42384\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42384)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42384)\">Rev. 12:4,7-9<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd yet every spirit child of God hungers for a body. Some unembodied\nspirits who appeared to Jesus in his day preferred to have the bodies of swine rather than have\nno bodies at all (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35449\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35449)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35449)\">Matt. 8:31-32<\/a><\/span>).\nBut because we successfully passed the requirements of our first estate; we\nearned the right to continue our progression into this life. From the beginning we have lived\nunder the promise that if we passed the test of faithfulness during our years of mortality, we\nwould graduate into a glorious, everlasting third estate. The third act is where the happy\nendings are; that is where the rewards are handed out. The third act is where, like the\nRedeemer himself, we may qualify for a glorious bodily resurrection and have all of the\npossibilities of eternal progression made available to us. To help us get ready we may pre-live\nour own third act by studying the prophetic pages of the holy scriptures.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>In His Image<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI have a relative who practices this interesting forward-looking philosophy. When she reads a\nnovel, she always reads the last chapter first. She wants to know before she starts where she is\ngoing to be when she gets through. That is also a pretty good idea for life.\n<\/p><p>\nNothing is more clearly written in the scripture than the fact that the life of Christ did not\nbegin at Bethlehem; neither did it end on Calvary. Jesus said, \"I came forth from the Father,\nand am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28215\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28215)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28215)\">John 16:28<\/a><\/span>). In\nhis prayer in Gethsemane he said, \"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self\nwith the glory which I had with thee before the world was\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28220\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28220)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28220)\">John 17:5<\/a><\/span>). Jesus was the\nfirst-begotten Son of God in the spirit and the only-begotten Son of God in the flesh (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24334\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24334)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24334)\">Heb. 1:6<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28161\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28161)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28161)\">John 1:14<\/a><\/span>).\nBut God is also <i>our<\/i> eternal Heavenly Father, and it is just as certain\nthat <i>our<\/i> lives did not begin when we were born; neither will they end when we die. Like our\nElder Brother, in the spirit we were also begotten in God's image. We were also endowed\nwith a set of his attributes and made heirs to his glory. And the greatest idea that I know of in\nthe world is God's promise that through our faithfulness we may become even as he is.\n<\/p><p>\nBut these truths having to do with our own glorious destiny have always been difficult for\nsome people to get into their souls. When Jesus said, \"I and my Father are one\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28192\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28192)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28192)\">John 10:30<\/a><\/span>),\nthe people took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. They gave their reason by saying, \". . .\nbecause that thou, being a man, makest thyself God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28193\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28193)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28193)\">John 10:33<\/a><\/span>). Jesus quoted to them the\nancient Psalm in which God pointed out the destiny of his faithful children by saying, \"I have\nsaid, Ye are gods\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41853\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41853)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41853)\">Ps. 82:6<\/a><\/span>). Then trying to help them to understand, Jesus said, \"Is it not\nwritten in your law, I said, Ye are gods?\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd said he, \"If he [God] called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the\nscripture cannot be broken; \n<\/p><p>\n\"Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest\nbecause I said, I am the Son of God?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28194\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28194)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28194)\">John 10:34-36<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Partake of the Divine Nature\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe are still having some of this problem in our own day. In our disbelief we downgrade our\ndivine possibilities. Paul said to the Corinthians, \"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither\nhave entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love\nhim\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"405\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 405)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(405)\">1 Cor. 2:9<\/a><\/span>).\nWe can imagine some wonderful things, but we cannot even conceive of\nthat magnificent experience that lies beyond the borders of this life. Certainly the greatest\nwonders of the future will not be in the improvement of our television or our airplanes; they\nwill be primarily in ourselves. The greater the understanding of our own future, the more\neffectively we will be able to prepare for it. And why should we call God our Heavenly\nFather and at the same time fail to believe his promise that the offspring of God may\nsomeday become like the parent? The great message of the Church in our own day is that\nGod the Eternal Father has reappeared upon this earth to reestablish among men a belief in\nthe God of Genesis, the God of Mount Sinai, the God of Calvary, and the God of the latter\ndays. The message has been renewed that the second coming of Jesus Christ to the earth is\nnear at hand, and he has also reaffirmed the fact that those who are faithful will be exalted\nand permitted to rule with him throughout eternity. If we only believe, then all things are\npossible (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33181\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33181)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33181)\">Mark 9:23<\/a><\/span>) \nand we will be able to make the necessary preparation. If the godlike powers of man\nare so manifest even in his present fallen state, what may be the eternal potential of that great\nmasterpiece which God created in his own image?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Handiwork of God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe universe is God's handiwork, but man is his son. God placed the gold and silver in the\nearth, but he endowed his children with his own attributes and made them heirs to his\npotentialities. And according to his own immutable laws of heredity, the children may hope\nsometime to become like the parents. We should cling to our inheritance. There is everything\nin knowing our origin and possible destiny and in constantly reaffirming them in our lives.\nSomeone once said to his friend, \"Who do you think you are?\" And he whispered quietly to\nhimself, \"I wish I knew.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSomeday we will more clearly know who we are. We will understand the great scriptural\nteaching that God, angels, spirits, and men are all of the same species in different stages of\nrighteousness and development. The scriptures point out that Jesus, the firstborn Son of God,\nwas in \". . . the brightness of his [the Father's] glory, and the express image of his person\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24332\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24332)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24332)\">Heb. 1:3<\/a><\/span>).\nBut this same great truth also applies to us and will be manifest in our own future.\n<\/p><p>\nIn singing of man's glory, the inspired Psalmist said, \"When I consider thy heavens, the work\nof thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained\n<\/p><p>\n\"What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?\n<\/p><p>\n\"For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and\nhonour.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things\nunder his feet\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41846\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41846)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41846)\">Ps. 8:3-6<\/a><\/span>).\nAnother translation of this line says, \"Thou madest him a little\nwhile inferior to the angels\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24335\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24335)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24335)\">Heb. 2:7<\/a><\/span>,\nmarginal rendering of King James version). Certainly\nGod must have had a great destiny in mind for us when he promised to give us dominion\nover the works of his hands and to put all things under our feet. John the Revelator refers to\nman's divine possibilities by saying that God will make us kings and priests unto him for\never (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"42381\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42381)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42381)\">Rev. 1:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Progress in Mortality<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMany years ago in speaking of the possibility of the eternal progression of God's children, B.\nH. Roberts said, \"Think for a moment what progress a man makes within the narrow limits of\nthis life. Regard him as he lies in the lap of his mother, a newborn babe! There are eyes,\nindeed, that may see, but cannot distinguish objects; ears that may hear, but cannot distinguish\nsounds; hands as perfectly fashioned as Yours or mine, but helpless, withal; feet and limbs,\nbut they are unable to bear the weight of his body, much less walk. There lies a man in\nembryo, but helpless. And yet, within the span of three score years and ten, by the marvelous\nworking of that wondrous power within . . . what a change may be wrought! From the\nhelpless babe may arise one like Demosthenes, or Cicero, or Pitt, or Burke, or Fox, or\nWebster, who shall compel listening senates to hear him, and by his master mind dominate\ntheir intelligence and their will, and compel them to think in channels that he shall mark out\nfor them. Or from such a babe may come a Nebuchadnezzar, or an Alexander, or a Napoleon,\nwho shall found empires and give direction to the course of history. From such a beginning\nmay come a Lycurgus, a Solon, a Moses, or a Justinian, who shall give constitutions and laws\nto kingdoms, empires and republics, blessing happy millions unborn in their day, and direct\nthe course of nations along paths of orderly peace and virtuous liberty. From the helpless babe\nmay come a Michelangelo, who, from some crude mass of stone from the mountain side shall\nwork out a heaven-born vision that shall hold the attention of men for generations, and make\nthem wonder at the God-like powers of man that has created an all but living and breathing\nstatue. Or a Mozart, a Beethoven, or a Handel . . . may . . . call out from the silence those\nmelodies and the richer harmonies that lift the soul out of its present narrow prison house and\ngive it fellowship for a season with the Gods. Or from that . . . babe may arise a master mind\nwho shall seize the helm of the ship of state, and give to a nation course and direction\nthrough troublesome times, and anchor it at last in a haven of peace, prosperity and liberty;\ncrown it with honor, too, and give it a proud standing among the nations of the earth; while\nhe, the savior of his country, is followed by the benedictions of his countrymen.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And all this may be done by a man in [one short] life! Nay, it has been done, between the\ncradle and the grave . . . Then what may not be done in eternity by one of these God-men?\nRemove from his path the incident of death; or, better yet, contemplate him as raised from the\ndead; and give to him in the full splendor of manhood's estate, immortality, endless existence,\nwhat may we not hope that he will accomplish? What limits can you venture to fix as\nmarking the boundary of his development, of his progress? . . . Why should there be any\nlimits thought of? Grant immortality to man and God for his guide, what is there in the way\nof intellectual, moral, and spiritual development that he may not aspire to? If within the short\nspace of mortal life there are men who rise up out of infancy and become masters of the\nelements of fire and water and earth and air, so that they well-nigh rule them as Gods, what\nmay it not be possible for them to do in a few hundreds or thousands of millions of years? . . .\nTo what heights of power and glory may they not ascend?\" (B. H. Roberts, <i>The Mormon Doctrine of Deity<\/i>, 1903, pp. 33.)\n<\/p><p>\nCertainly one of the greatest concepts of holy scripture is this great truth wherein speaking of\nour potentiality God himself has proclaimed, \"I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are\nchildren of the most High\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41854\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41854)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41854)\">Ps. 82:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless our lives that through our understanding, our faith, and our good works we\nmay reach the glorious destiny which he has ordained.
