Perhaps you have been widowed or divorced. You may be coping with the challenges of single parenthood as a result of having taken a wrong turn outside of marriage, but you are now living within the framework of the gospel, having turned your life around. Bless you for avoiding the type of companionship that would come at the expense of virtue and discipleship. That would be far too high a price to pay.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/faith-fortitude-fulfillment-a-message-to-single-parents.p6\" class=\"\">Although you may at times have asked, why me? it is through the hardships of life that we grow toward godhood as our character is shaped in the crucible of affliction, as the events of life take place while God respects the agency of man.

Maxwell commented, we cannot do all the sums or make it all add up because \u201cwe do not have all the numbers.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10405_000_017\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Neal\u00a0A.

Day to day you face the struggles of life, doing the work that was always meant for two but doing it largely alone. You have to be father as well as mother. You run your household, watch over your family, sometimes struggle to make ends meet, and miraculously you even find the wherewithal to serve in the Church in significant ways. You nurture your children. You cry and pray with them and for them. You want the very best for them but fret every night that your best may never be good enough.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/faith-fortitude-fulfillment-a-message-to-single-parents.p8\" class=\"\">Whilst reluctant to be overly personal, I am the product of such a home. For most of my childhood and teenage years, my mother raised us on her own in poor circumstances. Money was carefully rationed. She coped with an inner loneliness, desperate at times for support and companionship. Yet despite all of this, there was a dignity about my mother, a tremendous source of determination and sheer Scottish grit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/faith-fortitude-fulfillment-a-message-to-single-parents.p9\" class=\"\">Thankfully, her later years were more blessed than the beginning. She married a new convert, a widower; they were sealed in the London England Temple and later briefly served there as ordinance workers.
