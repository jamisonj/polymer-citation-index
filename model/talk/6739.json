Another engine came by, but he wouldn\u2019t stoop to help the little train over the mountain because he was a freight engine.

I have never been over the mountain.\u201d But she was concerned about disappointing the children on the other side of the mountain if they didn\u2019t get all of the goodies in the cars.

Because he had been the leader of that group of Saints, President Young asked him to account for the tithing that he had collected from the members of the Church in California, including those involved in the gold rush, but he did not do so.
