The year was 1933, when because of the Great Depression, employment opportunities were scarce. The location was the eastern part of the United States. Arlene Biesecker had just graduated from high school. After a lengthy search for employment, she was finally able to obtain work at a clothing mill as a seamstress. The mill workers were paid only for each of the correctly completed pieces they sewed together daily. The more pieces they produced, the more they were paid.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/love-the-essence-of-the-gospel.p21\" class=\"\">One day shortly after starting at the mill, Arlene was faced with a procedure that had her confused and frustrated. She sat at her sewing machine trying to unpick her unsuccessful attempt to complete the piece on which she was working. There seemed to be no one to help her, for all of the other seamstresses were hurrying to complete as many pieces as they could. Arlene felt helpless and hopeless. Quietly, she began to cry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/love-the-essence-of-the-gospel.p22\" class=\"\">Across from Arlene sat Bernice Rock. She was older and more experienced as a seamstress. Observing Arlene\u2019s distress, Bernice left her own work and went to Arlene\u2019s side, kindly giving her instruction and help. She stayed until Arlene gained confidence and was able to successfully complete the piece. Bernice then went back to her own machine, having missed the opportunity to complete as many pieces as she could have, had she not helped.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/love-the-essence-of-the-gospel.p23\" class=\"\">With this one act of loving kindness, Bernice and Arlene became lifelong friends. Each eventually married and had children. Sometime in the 1950s, Bernice, who was a member of the Church, gave Arlene and her family a copy of the Book of Mormon. In 1960, Arlene and her husband and children were baptized members of the Church. Later they were sealed in a holy temple of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/love-the-essence-of-the-gospel.p24\" class=\"\">As a result of the compassion shown by Bernice as she went out of her way to help one whom she didn\u2019t know but who was in distress and needed assistance, countless individuals, both living and dead, now enjoy the saving ordinances of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/love-the-essence-of-the-gospel.p25\" class=\"\">Every day of our lives we are given opportunities to show love and kindness to those around us.

The two-year-old boy had severed an artery in his arm when he fell on a piece of glass while playing near his home. The town was 450 miles (725 km) south of Anchorage and was certainly not on the flight path. However, medics at the scene had sent out a frantic request for help, and so the flight was diverted to pick up the child and take him to Seattle so that he could be treated in a hospital.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/love-the-essence-of-the-gospel.p28\" class=\"\">When the flight touched down near the remote town, medics informed the pilot that the boy was bleeding so badly he could not survive the flight to Seattle.
