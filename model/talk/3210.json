The setting was stake conference. Elder Joseph Fielding Smith and Elder Alma Sonne had been assigned to reorganize our stake presidency. The Aaronic Priesthood, including members of bishoprics, were providing the music for the conference. Those of us who served as bishops were singing along with our young men. As we concluded singing our first selection, Brother Smith stepped to the pulpit and announced the names of the new stake presidency. I am confident the other members of the presidency had been made aware of their callings, but I had not. After reading my name, Brother Smith announced, \u201cIf Brother Monson is willing to respond to this call we shall be pleased to hear from him now.\u201d As I stood at the pulpit and gazed out on that sea of faces, I remembered the song we had just sung.

Kimball when he was chairman of the Missionary Executive Committee of the Church. Those never-to-be-forgotten missionary assignment meetings were filled with inspiration and occasionally interspersed with humor. Well do I remember the recommendation form for one prospective missionary on which the bishop had written: \u201cThis young man is very close to his mother. She wonders if he might be assigned to a mission close to home in California so that she can visit him on occasion and telephone him weekly.\u201d As I read aloud this comment, I awaited from President Kimball the pronouncement of a designated assignment. I noticed a twinkle in his eye and a sweet smile cross his lips as he said, without additional comment, \u201cAssign him to the Johannesburg South Africa Mission.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-army-of-the-lord.p31\" class=\"\">Too numerous to mention are the many instances where a particular call proved providential.

The next day was one of the longest in my young life. I was awaiting my adviser\u2019s return from work an hour before he arrived. He took me to his loft, which was in a small barn at the rear of his yard. As I looked at the most beautiful pigeons I had yet seen, he said, \u201cSelect any male, and I will give you a female which is different from any other pigeon in the world.\u201d I made my selection. He then placed in my hand a tiny hen. I asked what made her so different. He responded, \u201cLook carefully, and you\u2019ll notice that she has but one eye.\u201d Sure enough, one eye was missing, a cat having done the damage. \u201cTake them home to your loft,\u201d he counseled. \u201cKeep them in for about ten days and then turn them out to see if they will remain at your place.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-army-of-the-lord.p41\" class=\"\">I followed his instructions. Upon releasing them, the male pigeon strutted about the roof of the loft, then returned inside to eat. But the one-eyed female was gone in an instant. I called Harold, my adviser, and asked: \u201cDid that one-eyed pigeon return to your loft?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-army-of-the-lord.p42\" class=\"\">\u201cCome on over,\u201d said he, \u201cand we\u2019ll have a look.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-army-of-the-lord.p43\" class=\"\">As we walked from his kitchen door to the loft, my adviser commented, \u201cTom, you are the president of the teachers quorum.\u201d This I already knew. Then he added, \u201cWhat are you going to do to activate Bob?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-army-of-the-lord.p44\" class=\"\">I answered, \u201cI\u2019ll have him at quorum meeting this week.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-army-of-the-lord.p45\" class=\"\">Then he reached up to a special nest and handed to me the one-eyed pigeon. \u201cKeep her in a few days and try again.\u201d This I did, and once more she disappeared. Again the experience, \u201cCome on over and we\u2019ll see if she returned here.\u201d Came the comment as we walked to the loft, \u201cCongratulations on getting Bob to priesthood meeting. Now what are you and Bob going to do to activate Bill?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-army-of-the-lord.p46\" class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll have him there this week,\u201d I volunteered.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-army-of-the-lord.p47\" class=\"\">This experience was repeated over and over again. I was a grown man before I fully realized that, indeed, Harold, my adviser, had given me a special pigeon; the only bird in his loft he knew would return every time she was released.
