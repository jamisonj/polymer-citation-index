I arose one morning all bright eyed and bushy tailed, greeted the dawn with a smile\u2014only to realize suddenly that with the birthday to be celebrated that day I now had a teenage grandchild. I thought about it for a minute and then did what any responsible, dignified adult would do. I got back in bed and pulled the covers over my head.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/to-young-women.p5\" class=\"\">Traditional joking aside about the harrowing experience of raising teenagers, I want to say to my own granddaughter and the vast majority of the youth of the Church whom I meet around the world how extraordinarily proud we are of you.

Because this precious eldest grandchild of whom I spoke is a young woman, I am going to address my remarks to the young women of the Church, but I hope the spirit of what I say can apply to women and men of all ages. However today, as Maurice Chevalier used to sing, I want to \u201cthank heaven for little girls.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/to-young-women.p7\" class=\"\">First of all, I want you to be proud you are a woman.

He knows your hopes and dreams, including your fears and frustrations. And He knows what you can become through faith in Him.

Fathers and mothers, prophets and apostles have no motive except to bless your life and to spare you every possible heartache we can spare you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/to-young-women.p10\" class=\"\">For you to fully claim Heavenly Father\u2019s blessings and protection, we ask you to stay true to the standards of the gospel of Jesus Christ and <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> slavishly follow the whims of fads and fashions. The Church will never deny your moral agency regarding what you should wear and exactly how you should look. But the Church will always declare standards and will always teach principles. As Sister Susan Tanner taught this morning, one of those principles is modesty. In the gospel of Jesus Christ, modesty in appearance is <span class=\"emphasis\">always<\/span> in fashion.

We used to speak of \u201cbest dress\u201d or \u201cSunday dress,\u201d and maybe we should do so again. In any case, from ancient times to modern we have always been invited to present our best selves inside and out when entering the house of the Lord\u2014and a dedicated LDS chapel is a \u201chouse of the Lord.\u201d Our clothing or footwear need never be expensive, indeed should <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> be expensive, but neither should it appear that we are on our way to the beach. When we come to worship the God and Father of us all and to partake of the sacrament symbolizing the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we should be as comely and respectful, as dignified and appropriate as we can be. We should be recognizable in appearance as well as in behavior that we truly are disciples of Christ, that in a spirit of worship we are meek and lowly of heart, that we truly desire the Savior\u2019s Spirit to be with us always.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/to-young-women.p13\" class=\"\">In this same vein may I address an even more sensitive subject. I plead with you young women to please be more accepting of yourselves, including your body shape and style, with a little less longing to look like someone else. We are all different. Some are tall, and some are short. Some are round, and some are thin. And almost everyone at some time or other wants to be something they are not! But as one adviser to teenage girls said: \u201cYou can\u2019t live your life worrying that the world is staring at you. When you let people\u2019s opinions make you self-conscious you give away your power. \u2026 The key to feeling [confident] is to always listen to your inner self\u2014[the <span class=\"emphasis\">real<\/span> you.]\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-25911_000_011\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Julia DeVillers, <span class=\"emphasis\">Teen People,<\/span> Sept. 2005, 104.]<\/span><\/sup> And in the kingdom of God, the real you is \u201cmore precious than rubies.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote9-25911_000_011\">9<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44460\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44460)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44460)\">Prov. 3:15<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Every young woman is a child of destiny and every adult woman a powerful force for good.

We should all be as fit as we can be\u2014that\u2019s good Word of Wisdom doctrine. That means eating right and exercising and helping our bodies function at their optimum strength. We could probably all do better in that regard. But I speak here of optimum health; there is no universal optimum size.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/to-young-women.p14\" class=\"\">Frankly, the world has been brutal with you in this regard. You are bombarded in movies, television, fashion magazines, and advertisements with the message that looks are everything! The pitch is, \u201cIf your looks are good enough, your life will be glamorous and you will be happy and popular.\u201d That kind of pressure is immense in the teenage years, to say nothing of later womanhood. In too many cases too much is being done to the human body to meet just such a fictional (to say nothing of superficial) standard. As one Hollywood actress is reported to have said recently: \u201cWe\u2019ve become obsessed with beauty and the fountain of youth. \u2026 I\u2019m really saddened by the way women mutilate [themselves] in search of that.
