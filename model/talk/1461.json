Smith, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1966, pp. 40-42<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nThe scriptures are replete with the admonition to endure to the end with a promise of eternal\nlife as a reward. To the Nephites the Lord said, \"Look unto me, and endure to the end, and ye\nshall live; for unto him that endureth unto the end will I give eternal life\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5692\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5692)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5692)\">3 Ne. 15:9<\/a><\/span>). In\nthe Doctrine and Covenants the Lord says, \". . . whosoever is of my church, and endureth of\nmy church to the end, him will I establish upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not\nprevail against them\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14733\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14733)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14733)\">D&amp;C 10:69<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Endure to the end\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat does it mean to endure? One definition is: \"to have duration; to continue.\" This would\nbe to outlast time; this is important too. But here is another definition: \"to withstand or bear,\nas pain, sorrow, destructive force, without yielding; to suffer patiently, to remain firm, as\nunder trial or suffering; to bear up under adversity.\" One of the main purposes of this life is\nto overcome obstacles, to gain strength, to grow to the point where we can endure many\nthings. For instance, can you endure others and their differences of opinion? Can you accept\nthe gospel of Jesus Christ in the face of adversity? Can you live as Christ taught, that you\nmight be worthy of eternal life? To endure means more than just a good start alone&mdash;we\nmust finish with zeal.\n<\/p><p>\nLife is much like a basketball game. You don't win if you don't start well and then slow\ndown; but if you get off to a bad start, it is possible to catch up and even win. The finish is\nof most importance. Remember the parable Jesus gave of the laborers. He said, \"For the\nkingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the\nmorning to hire labourers into his vineyard.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his\nvineyard.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And he went out\" repeatedly during the day and hired other laborers even unto the eleventh\nhour, telling each that he would pay them that which was right. Then at the end of the day,\npaying the last laborer hired first, he paid each a penny, giving the same reward for the day's\nlabor to each person (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35614\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35614)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35614)\">Matt. 20:1-15<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Lord not only said to endure but to endure to the\nend&mdash;to the end of life, your life. How long is your life? Time is relevant. Brother Longden\nhas just told us quite a bit about time which should stir up our interest in how we use it.\nWhich time calendar do you use to measure your lifetime on the earth?\n<\/p><p>\nWhile Abraham was in Egypt, the Lord taught him much concerning the stars, especially\nthose that control the times and the seasons. Thus Abraham wrote: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And I saw the stars, that they were very great, and that one of them was nearest unto the\nthrone of God; and there were many great ones which were near unto it; \n<\/p><p>\n\"And the Lord said unto me: These are the governing ones; and the name of the great one is\nKolob, because it is near unto me, for I am the Lord thy God: I have set this one to govern\nall those which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the Lord said unto me, by the Urim and Thummim, that Kolob was after the manner of\nthe Lord, according to its times and seasons in the revolutions thereof; that one revolution was\na day unto the Lord, after his manner of reckoning, it being one thousand years according to\nthe time appointed unto that whereon thou standest. This is the reckoning of the Lord's time,\naccording to the reckoning of Kolob\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7245\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7245)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7245)\">Abr. 3:2-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A thousand years&mdash;one day to the Lord<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSo according to this, 1000 years of our time is equivalent to one day with the Lord. If you\nwere to live to be 100 years old on earth, that would be 1\/10 of one day with the Lord. Now\nsuppose we divide the Lord's day into 24 equal parts, as our day is, just for comparative\npurposes: 100 years of our life would be equal to 1\/10 of 24, or 2.4 hours. So according to\nthis, if you live to be 100 on this earth, that would be equivalent to 2.4 hours in the Lord's\ntime calendar. If you live to be 75, that would be one hour and 48 minutes. Fifty years of this\ntime is equivalent to one hour and 12 minutes in the Lord's time.\n<\/p><p>\nImagine yourself for a moment back in the spirit world before you came to earth. You were\nliving in the presence of God in the celestial world. You knew from firsthand experience the\nfullness of the glory of God. You knew you could not participate in his glory, or become as\nhe is, because you were only a spirit; you didn't have a physical body. Now the opportunity\ncomes for you to go to earth where you can receive such a body and become as he is. Of\ncourse, you shouted for joy! Then let's assume that you were instructed that you would be\nallotted 100 years of mortal time. To you there and then, that would be two hours and 24\nminutes. That would be the only time calendar you would be familiar with&mdash;only about 21\/3\nhours.\n<\/p><p>\nOnly 21\/3 hours to earn such a great reward&mdash;and some may not live 100 years; most of us\nwill not. So we will assume about two hours time in the Lord's time is allotted to us in this\nlife.\n<\/p><p>\nBrother John Longden has just told us that the average life was 70 years; that is about 1.7\nhours in the Lord's time. I think that for that short length of time you would be willing to put\nup with most anything. We have in this life two golden hours.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Promises for enduring<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWouldn't you promise to endure almost anything for two hours to get the blessings that the\nLord has promised of eternal life and to become as he is? He has promised that all that the\nFather has shall be given unto you. Then suppose you were instructed that you would have\nmuch to endure in this life on earth. Nothing would be too great to endure for two hours,\nwould it? You would be willing to promise to build this body and keep it clean. You would\nnot participate in any activities that would defile the body. You would be willing to accept the\nteachings of the Savior. You would accept his gospel when it was presented unto you. You\nwould meet any adversity willingly for two hours. Even though you were instructed that you\nwould have pain, sorrow, sickness, misery, wars, and even horrible wars to go through, you\nwould still be willing to come, and even to beg for the opportunities of coming, to endure for\ntwo hours' time. Yes, even if you were told you would be born crippled, maimed, diseased,\nyou would still be willing to come to endure whatever might be required of you to get the\nblessings of eternal life as a result of but a short period of time. You would even be willing\nto accept being born blind on this earth if it meant the outcome of this short time would be\nthat you would have the blessings of eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure that you would have promised that you would accept the gospel against any\nopposition. You would live the gospel. Oh, yes. You would be told that you would have to\nlive the Word of Wisdom. You would have to pay your tithing. You would be asked to attend\nmany meetings. You would be required to give much of your time and your assistance in\norder to promote the work of the Lord upon the earth. You might be asked to sing in the\nchoir occasionally.\n<\/p><p>\nYou might be required to do genealogical research work and to spend much of your time in\nthe temples or in many other activities in behalf of someone else. You might be instructed\nthat you would be required to be a bishop and give of your time unselfishly, as a bishop does,\nall for the benefit of others. What price could you pay that would be too high and too great\nfor the blessings of eternal life and to become as your Heavenly Father?\n<\/p><p>\nSome say when the missionaries come to them, \"I am too old; it is too late in life to change\nnow. I am too old to change my religion.\" To such people I might say, \"All the more reason\nwhy you had better make the change quickly so that you will be prepared to meet your Maker\nand say, 'I tried at the last minute when the opportunity first came to me.'\" No one is too old\nto start doing good or to make changes and amendments in the right direction.\n<\/p><p>\nIf you are married for 50 years in this life, that is equivalent to one hour and 12 minutes in\nthe Lord's time.\n<\/p><p>\nCan you, as married couples, put up with each other and learn to be faithful in all things for\nan hour and 12 minutes? Could you withstand the test of prosperity? This is a test under\nwhich many individuals, as well as cities or nations, fall. Can we as a Church, can we as\nAmericans, can we of this latter day withstand the trial of prosperity for two hours or so of\nthe Lord's time? I think that when the Lord does the judging, he will think in terms of the\neternal time, the Lord's time. And he might say, could you not be faithful for such a short\ntime as two hours, or an hour and a half, whatever time was allotted you&mdash;a matter of one or\ntwo hours, generally speaking. If so, if you can meet these challenges to endure to the end, the\nblessings of eternal life are yours.\n<\/p><p>\nThen you can say, as Paul wrote to Timothy, \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my\ncourse, I have kept the faith: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous\njudge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his\nappearing\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5167\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5167)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5167)\">2 Tim. 4:7-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord's blessings be yours to endure the trials of life and to endure temptations, to\nendure discouragement, to endure all adversities of Satan. That you may have the blessings of\njoy and eternal life I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
