I know this to be true. But this evening I would like to address you as the \u201cchoice generation\u201d because never before in history have individuals been blessed with so many choices. More choices mean more opportunities; more opportunities mean more potential to do good and, unfortunately, evil. I believe that God sent you here at this time because He trusts you to successfully discern among the mind-boggling choices available.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-choice-generation.p6\" class=\"\">In 1974, President Spencer\u00a0W.

You are growing up with one of the greatest tools for good in the history of man: the Internet. With it comes an elaborate buffet of choices. The abundance of choice, however, carries with it an equal portion of accountability. It facilitates your access to both the very best and the very worst the world has to offer. With it you can accomplish great things in a short period of time, or you can get caught up in endless loops of triviality that waste your time and degrade your potential. With the click of a button, you can access whatever your heart desires. That\u2019s the key\u2014what does your heart desire? What do you gravitate toward? Where will your desires lead?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-choice-generation.p8\" class=\"\">Remember that God \u201cgranteth unto men according to their desire\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129586\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129586)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129586)\">Alma 29:4<\/a><\/span>) and that He \u201cwill judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129587\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129587)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129587)\">D&amp;C 137:9<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"129588\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129588)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129588)\">Alma 41:3<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-choice-generation.p9\" class=\"\">Elder Bruce\u00a0R. McConkie said: \u201cIn a real though figurative sense, the <span class=\"emphasis\">book of life<\/span> is the record of the acts of men as such record is written in their own bodies. \u2026 That is, every thought, word, and deed has an [effect] on the human body; all these leave their marks, marks which can be read by Him who is Eternal as easily as the words in a book can be read\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Mormon Doctrine,<\/span> 2nd ed. [1966], 97).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-choice-generation.p10\" class=\"\">The Internet also records your desires, expressed in the form of searches and clicks. There are legions waiting to fill those desires. As you surf the Internet, you leave tracks\u2014what you communicate, where you have been, how long you have been there, and the kinds of things that interest you. In this way, the Internet creates a cyber profile for you\u2014in a sense, your \u201ccyber book of life.\u201d As in life, the Internet will give you more and more of what you seek. If your desires are pure, the Internet can magnify them, making it ever easier to engage in worthy pursuits. But the opposite is also true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-choice-generation.p11\" class=\"\">Elder Neal\u00a0A. Maxwell put it this way:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-choice-generation.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cWhat we insistently desire, over time, is what we will eventually become and what we will receive in eternity. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-choice-generation.p13\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 Only by educating and training our desires can they become our allies instead of our enemies!\u201d (\u201cAccording to the Desire of [Our] Hearts,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1996, 21, 22).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-choice-generation.p14\" class=\"\">My young brothers, if you are not proactive in educating your desires, the world will do it for you. Every day the world seeks to influence your desires, enticing you to buy something, click on something, play something, read or watch something. Ultimately, the choice is yours. You have agency. It is the power to not only act on your desires but also to refine, purify, and elevate your desires. Agency is your power to become. Each choice takes you closer to or further from what you are meant to become; each click has meaning. Always ask yourself, \u201cWhere will this choice lead?\u201d Develop the ability to see beyond the moment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-choice-generation.p15\" class=\"\">Satan wants to control your agency so he can control what you become. He knows that one of the best ways to do this is by trapping you with addictive behavior. Your choices determine whether technology will empower you or enslave you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-choice-generation.p16\" class=\"\">May I offer four principles to help you, the choice generation, educate your desires and guide your use of technology.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"topic\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>First: Knowing Who You Really Are Makes Decisions Easier<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-choice-generation.p18\" class=\"\">I have a friend who learned this truth in a very personal way. His son was raised in the gospel, but he seemed to be wandering spiritually. He frequently declined opportunities to exercise the priesthood. His parents were disappointed when he declared that he had decided not to serve a mission. My friend prayed earnestly for his son, hoping that he would have a change of heart. Those hopes were dashed when his son announced that he was engaged to be married. The father pleaded with his son to get his patriarchal blessing. The son finally agreed but insisted on visiting the patriarch alone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-choice-generation.p19\" class=\"\">When he returned after the blessing, he was very emotional. He took his girlfriend outside, where he could talk to her privately. The father peeked out the window to see the young couple wiping away each other\u2019s tears.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-choice-generation.p20\" class=\"\">Later the son shared with his father what had happened. With great emotion he explained that during the blessing, he had a glimpse of who he was in the premortal world. He saw how valiant and influential he was in persuading others to follow Christ. Knowing who he really was, how could he not serve a mission?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/priesthood-session\/the-choice-generation.p21\" class=\"\">Young men, remember who you really are.

There are countless ways technology can distract you from what is most important. Follow the adage \u201cBe where you are when you are there.\u201d When you are driving, drive. When you are in class, focus on the lesson. When you are with your friends, give them the gift of your attention. Your brain cannot concentrate on two things at once.
