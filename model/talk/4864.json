I would like to talk about the Aaronic Priesthood\u2014first, what it is not. It is not an activity; and second, it is not a priesthood in which we advance because of age. We are advanced in the priesthood because of worthiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-return-with-honor.p4\" class=\"\">Now let us discuss what the Aaronic Priesthood is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-return-with-honor.p5\" class=\"\">The Aaronic Priesthood years are a preparatory period of our lives when we prepare ourselves in this earth life to be worthy to return with honor to the presence of our Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-return-with-honor.p6\" class=\"\">We cannot remember that we once lived with our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and that we probably sat in meetings much like this, where the Father\u2019s plan for us was explained. We cannot remember that Lucifer, a son of God the Father, a brother of Jesus Christ, rebelled against God\u2019s plan and, in his rebellion, promised he would bring us all back home. But Lucifer would have denied us our free agency, the freedom to make decisions. We cannot remember that his plan was not accepted by us because, without choice, there would not have been a purpose for coming to this mortal probation. We would not have had opposition or repentance. We would not have learned obedience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-return-with-honor.p7\" class=\"\">So we chose not to go with Lucifer because if we had, we never would have been able to progress in earth life with our objective of returning back into the presence of our Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-return-with-honor.p8\" class=\"\">All of us on earth are winners because we chose to come to this mortal probation, which Alma described as a preparatory state.

There an instructor would teach us about emergencies which could occur when flying a jet-fighter at the speed of sound. For each emergency, we were taught the procedures for avoiding disaster. We would practice each procedure over and over so that when a real emergency came, we would have developed what was called an automatic, or conditioned, response. We would know exactly what to do if the fire-warning light lit up or the panel indicated some other technical failure in the airplane. We would even predetermine the safe altitude at which we would bail out if the plane were on fire or out of control.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-return-with-honor.p22\" class=\"\">This training process can be compared to the lessons we learn in our homes and in the quorums of the Aaronic Priesthood\u2014the preparatory period of our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-return-with-honor.p23\" class=\"\">We are here at priesthood meeting this evening to learn those things which are necessary to prepare us to be strong and dedicated priesthood holders. We are preparing ourselves to take on higher laws and covenants such as obedience, sacrifice, service, chastity, and consecration of our time and talents. Why do we do this? We should learn this before we go to the temple, brethren, because afterwards it will help each of us to be valiant missionaries, caring eternal companions, and devoted fathers.

His team earned the opportunity to play in a New Year\u2019s Day bowl game. Before 100,000 spectators and a large TV audience, his team lost by a huge score. It turned out that he and the other members of his team had not kept the training rules that their coach had tried to teach them. They paid a dear price. They had to live with the consequences of knowing they were not prepared to play the big game; they had to live with the final, very embarrassing score.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-return-with-honor.p26\" class=\"\">Years passed. Two members of this same football team were in my flight-training unit. One was an exemplary, well-disciplined student\u2014a model pilot who had learned his lesson well from the failure in the bowl game.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-return-with-honor.p27\" class=\"\">However, the other friend had not learned to listen to those with more knowledge and more experience. When it came time for him to go to the trainer to learn emergency procedures and to precondition his mental and physical responses so that they would be automatic, even instantaneous, this all-American would put his arm around the instructor and say, \u201cCheck me off for three hours of emergency procedure.\u201d Then, instead of training, he would go to the swimming pool, pistol range, or to the golf course. Later in the training the instructor said to him, \u201cWhat are you going to do when there is an emergency and you are not prepared?\u201d His answer, \u201cI am never going to bail out; I am never going to have an emergency.\u201d He never learned the emergency procedures which he should have mastered in preparatory training.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-return-with-honor.p28\" class=\"\">A few months later, on an evening mission, fire erupted in the quiet sky over Texas. The fire-warning light lit up. When the plane dropped to 5,000 feet in flames, the young pilot who was with him said, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d And, with centrifugal force pulling against him, the young man who took his training seriously struggled to get out of the airplane and bailed out. His parachute opened at once. And he slammed to the ground. He received serious injuries but survived.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-return-with-honor.p29\" class=\"\">My friend who had not felt the need to train stayed with the airplane and died in the crash.

For example, the use of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs should turn on warning lights because, when we choose to use these substances, we become slaves; and our free agency is limited. We must be prepared with a conditioned response to reject them\u2014they are harmful agents\u2014or we will jeopardize our right to have the Spirit guide us and direct us and our ability to return to our Heavenly Father with honor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-return-with-honor.p32\" class=\"\">Sometimes choosing good friends is difficult, but the important choices we make in our lives are influenced by our friends.
