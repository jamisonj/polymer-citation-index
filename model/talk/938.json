Brother Condie and the choir\nhave won our hearts this morning.  There are many individuals in the Church and out of the\nChurch all over the world who greatly appreciate their beautiful music and the selections of\ntheir renditions.\n<\/p><p>\nWhile standing before you today, I pray that the Lord may sustain me and direct me, and I\nshall be grateful to each of you for an interest in your faith and prayers.  Truly, this is a\nhumbling experience.  I am sure it would be a humbling experience for you, too, but probably\nthat is as it should be because we are here this morning&mdash;this beautiful Sabbath Easter\nmorning&mdash;in true worship.  We acknowledge God as our Heavenly Father.  We accept Jesus\nChrist as the Savior and the Redeemer of the world.  We teach his birth in Bethlehem, his life\nin Galilee, and his sojourn in Jerusalem. We accept the mission of Jesus as\nthe Savior of the world. We recount that mission, his contribution, the trial of Jesus that\nPresident Clark so beautifully told us about yesterday, and finally the crucifixion of the Savior\non the hill of Calvary in Old Jerusalem.\n<\/p><p>\nA few years ago as I stood by the side of that tomb in Old Jerusalem I think I loved Jesus\nmore then than I have ever done before in my life. We accept the resurrection of Jesus as\ntrue, and we know he came forth from the tomb as the Resurrected Christ, thereby giving\neternal life, probably God's greatest gift to man.\n<\/p><p>\nWe teach and we recognize the appearance of God, the Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ, to\nthe Prophet Joseph in the Sacred Grove. There are some of our friends who can hardly accept\nthat as truth, but we would plead with them to study and pray, and that testimony will come\nto them.  We acknowledge Joseph Smith as a prophet of God. He was raised up, preserved,\nand divinely called. We teach and we believe in the revelations received by the Prophet\nJoseph.  These revelations are true, and this chosen prophet left to the world more doctrines\nof life and salvation than any other person who ever lived, save Christ himself\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13699\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13699)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13699)\">D&amp;C 135:3<\/a><\/span>). He was truly a\ndivinely called and inspired prophet, and sealed his testimony with his life and blood along\nwith his wonderful brother, Hyrum, who was  also martyred at Carthage Jail in Illinois.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, we accept these things as factual, and we know without a doubt that they are true; that\nthe Lord revealed his will to this prophet, and after the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith\nanother great prophet was raised up, preserved, and divinely called&mdash;the prophet and\nPresident Brigham Young, who had a great mission to perform in leading this people on that\nunknown journey.  After the death of the Prophet Brigham Young, other prophets were raised\nup and divinely called to lead the Church, each one in his time a true prophet of the Lord.  At\nthe present time one stands at the head of this Church and is the mouthpiece of God, our\nEternal Father.  President David O. McKay is a prophet of the Lord, just as were the prophets\nof old. I bear testimony to you that I know this to be true, and I know it by the power and\ngift of the Holy Ghost.  The Spirit of the Lord testifies to our spirits and we believe.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to address some of my remarks to a very large group of brethren whom I regard\nas fine men and of great potential power and strength and in whom I have great interest, the\nsenior members of the Aaronic Priesthood.  I know many of them, and I want to express to\nthem our love and our friendship.  We have only one desire, that we can share with them\nsome of the joys and blessings that we are privileged to enjoy.  When you stop to think of\nthis large group of men, if it were possible to assemble them, we would fill this tabernacle ten\ntimes as it is filled this morning.\n<\/p><p>\nWhere are they today, and what have we done about it?  We want to tell them that we love\nthem, and we welcome them back into activity in the Church.  We want to assure them of our\ninterest in their welfare.  We have been greatly impressed with the progress made by these\nwonderful men, and we would plead with all of our brethren of this group and other groups\nthat if for any reason you may have become inactive in the Church, we want you back\nbecause it will bring you greater joys and blessings than have ever come to you any other\nway in your life. We can promise you that the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ changes the\npattern and the attitude and the personality and the personal spiritual strength of men who will\naccept Christ and the teachings of the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I give you a quotation from Alma to express to you how we feel: \n<\/p><p>\nBehold, O Lord, their souls are precious, and many of them are our brethren; therefore, give\nunto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8988\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8988)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8988)\">Alma 31:35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn a recently completed survey, with 224 stakes reporting regarding the activity of their\nschools for senior members of the Aaronic Priesthood, we are pleasantly encouraged and\ngrateful to see what is taking place.  We have, for instance, at the present time, approximately\n367 schools now in session for the senior members of the Aaronic Priesthood\nand their wives, some of them on a ward and some on a stake basis. We have had enrolled in\nthese schools in the last year more than 17,000 of these wonderful men and their wives, and\nwe are learning of some glorious experiences that have come into the lives of these brethren.\n<\/p><p>\nJust yesterday I shook hands with a former senior member of the Aaronic Priesthood who\nnow is a stake president. It is not uncommon for us to shake hands with some who are now\nbishops.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I give you a few excerpts from some of the special survey sheets regarding these\nschools, the comments of which are from the senior members of the Aaronic Priesthood?\n<\/p><p>\nPerhaps the greatest benefit that I received from the school was the feeling that my\nChurch was still very much interested in me in spite of my inactivity for so many\nyears, and that I was still needed and wanted in the Church; that I still had a chance to\nmake up in a way for years of absence; that there was still time left, but that I must\nnot procrastinate longer.\n<\/p><p>\nAnother: \n<\/p><p>\nI have completed the first school, and I recommend that all the senior members of the\nAaronic Priesthood attend these schools. It is a great feeling to feel yourself grow as\nyou get interested again in the Church. This school seems to give us the spark that we\nneed for most of us to get started again, and I would recommend to every senior\nmember of the Aaronic Priesthood that you attend these schools.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was through this school that my wife and I received the spark of hope, and now we\nare working our way to the temple.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is wonderful to see how the lives of individuals may be changed, and the lives of sons and\ndaughters likewise are changed, because they are happy when their fathers and mothers make\nadjustments in their own lives.  To sons and daughters who come from a divided family&mdash;the\nfather a member of the Church or the mother a member of the Church&mdash;you can do so much\nfor your mother and your father. A girl, a while ago, sent this letter to her father and mother\nin answer to a letter that she had received.\n<\/p><p>\nDear Mother and Daddy: I received your letter, and I have never had such a pleasant\nand wonderful surprise in my life as when I read it, telling me that Dad was now\ngoing to join the Church.  I started to cry, and I cry every time I think of it because\nreally, I have never been so happy.  This is the blessing that I have been praying for\never since I was big enough to know how to pray.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung people, you, too, can do that for your fathers and your mothers.\n<\/p><p>\nDad, I know you will now be greatly blessed, and if you will live the commandments\nour Heavenly Father has given us, you will soon have the Holy Priesthood which will\ngive you the power to do the things that you have never dreamed of doing before. I\nthink it will be so wonderful if you will both live worthy of being married in the\ntemple some day.\n<\/p><p>\nI cannot think of a more glorious wedding gift for me than to be sealed to both my\nmother and father and my sweetheart, Jim, on the same day.  Another great thing will\nbe that now, Daddy, you will be able to assist in many ordinances of the Church, and\nsomeday assist in the blessings of my babies.  That will mean so much to me. Nothing\ncould have ever made me happier than this has made me.\n<\/p><p>\nI love you, and as your daughter, I am very proud of both of you. You have made me\nso happy, and I will always be what you expect me to be.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are humble and truly grateful for our membership in this Church.  We do not wish to\nappear arrogant or haughty, because we realize that we are not as good as we should be, but\nwe are thankful we are as good as we are, and are grateful to God for what we can yet\nbecome.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church offers us the opportunity to worship God and a chance to come into an awareness\nof him.  With him there is healing of sorrows, strength for the day, and peace at the last.  If\nwe have been at odds with ourselves or with God, our Father, and the universe, reconciliation\nwith the Master, with our fellows, and our soul can come.  That change will come about if we\nare humble, repentant, and seek the assistance of our Heavenly Father, but it can never take\nplace without communion with the Lord and a spiritual religious belief and faith.\n<\/p><p>\nThe understanding of God's goodness enables man to meet everyday needs,\nproblems, and troubles.  We can come to a reconciliation with God, with people, and with\nourselves.  Despair and discouragement can be transformed to confidence, guilt to forgiveness;\ncross purposes and uncertain goals can be changed to spiritual strength. Yes, one's real\npersonality heretofore utterly alone can take on a new character with true humility.  True\nreligion gives one strength to ask forgiveness of one's fellow men. If that be difficult, and\nsometimes it is, all we need to do is to become humble, and it gives us spiritual strength to\nask for God's forgiveness. If we can only accept and thoroughly recognize that God is our\nFather, if we will listen to his words, we will not be troubled.\n<\/p><p>\nThe gospel as taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will lift one higher\nthan any other philosophy on earth. It will give one a higher knowledge, more to live for and\nmore to die for than any other church on the earth, because it is the true Church of Jesus\nChrist.  The truths of the gospel are beautiful.  As a church and as a people, we are\nparticularly blessed with the scriptures of the Book of Mormon, and I would like to say to my\nfriends who may be inactive, or those not of the Church, the Lord has made all of us a very\ndefinite promise in the Book of Mormon (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38274\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38274)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38274)\">Moro. 10:3-5<\/a><\/span>), and I hope that every man\nwithin the sound of my voice who has never done so will read the following.  The Lord said: \n<\/p><p>\nBehold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that\nye should read them, that ye would remember bow merciful the Lord hath been unto the\nchildren of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive\nthese things, and ponder it in your hearts.<br \/>\nAnd when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the\nEternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a\nsincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you,\nby the power of the Holy Ghost.<br \/>\nAnd by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38275\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38275)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38275)\">Moro. 10:3-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nElder Orson F. Whitney has written the following concerning Mormonism: \n<\/p><p>\nMormonism's magnanimity&mdash;And yet \"Mormonism\" is said to be narrow, small and illiberal. \nNarrow, forsooth!  Then where will you find breadth? Where find justice, mercy,\nmagnanimity, if not in a religion that saves the living, redeems the dead . . . and glories all\nwho repent? \"Mormonism\" a small thing? It's the biggest thing in the universe!  It is the\nEverlasting Gospel, the mighty soul-ship of the dispensations, launched in the days of Adam\nupon the heaving ocean of the ages, and now on its last voyage over the stormy billows of\nTime to the beckoning coast of Eternity! (<i>Saturday Night Thoughts<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod can win strange victories in the hearts and lives of those who believe in him.  Too many\npeople have been trying to do without God, perhaps that is the reason for some of their\nfailures.\n<\/p><p>\nToo many people are trying to give irreligion the garb of respectability. They have acted as if\nwe could acquire education without acquiring a knowledge of religion, and wisdom without\nthe experience and practice of religion.\n<\/p><p>\nPerhaps we have not found peace within ourselves.  The lack of peace usually goes with the\nlack of belief in the Almighty God and a knowledge of the availability to us of his guidance.\nWe have not been able to establish peace among the nations of the world. With all our\nknowledge, we yet urgently need to gain sufficient understanding completely to recognize that\nthere is an inescapable cause and effect relationship between these mounting failures and our\ndiminishing faith.  Unless we are willing to prepare for a new dark age, we must soon\nacknowledge that as good as we think we are, we are not good enough to get along without\nthe God our forefathers found indispensable.\n<\/p><p>\nEvery person might follow the admonition of Alma: \n<\/p><p>\nCounsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest\ndown at night lie down into the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when\nthou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8991\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8991)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8991)\">Alma 37:37<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay I close with this thought: \n<\/p><p>\nWe expect to pass through this world but once; therefore, any good that we can do or\nany kindness that we can show to any living person, let us do it now. Let us not\ndefer it or neglect it, for we shall not pass this way again.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God favor us by granting to each of us the companionship and the association of his\nsweet, holy Spirit, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
