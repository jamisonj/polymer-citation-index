Even so, there is a breadth of it, some soft enough to be innocent and appealing to our youth, and that which is hard, and that is where the problem is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/inspiring-music-worthy-thoughts.p12\" class=\"\">One of the signs of apostasy in the Christian churches today is the willingness of their ministers to compromise and introduce into what had been, theretofore, the most sacred religious meetings the music of the drug and the hard rock culture.

We could hardly set up a roulette table in the Church amusement hall for gambling purposes, with the excuse that if we do not provide it the youth would go to a gambling hall to gamble. We can never really hold our youth thus. Our task is to help the home to plant better standards in the minds of the youth.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/inspiring-music-worthy-thoughts.p19\" class=\"\">And so we urge parents in the Church to show as much interest in the records and tapes their children purchase as they would the books and magazines they bring into the home. There are many parents who would not for one moment tolerate a pornographic magazine in their homes who unwittingly provide money for music, some of which in its influence can be quite as damaging.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/inspiring-music-worthy-thoughts.p20\" class=\"\">Someone said recently that no music could be degrading, that music in and of itself is harmless and innocent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/inspiring-music-worthy-thoughts.p21\" class=\"\">If that be true, then there should be some explanation for circumstances where local leaders have provided a building\u2014expansive, light, and inviting\u2014and have assembled a party of young people dressed modestly, well-groomed, with manners to match. Then overamplified sounds of hard music are introduced and an influence pours into the room that is repellent to the Spirit of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/inspiring-music-worthy-thoughts.p22\" class=\"\">The youth of the Church, by and large, have found a sensible and reasonable adjustment to the grooming and dress styles of our day. Our young men and women can dress with decency and modesty and yet not be unstylish or look all that different or odd.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/inspiring-music-worthy-thoughts.p23\" class=\"\">We have said a good deal through our youth organizations and at our Church schools about dress and grooming standards and have been successful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/inspiring-music-worthy-thoughts.p24\" class=\"\">By comparison, we have not given sufficient counsel and attention, I think, to the music that our young people consume. And \u201cconsume\u201d is a proper word. There is much of today\u2019s music that they may well enjoy, if they avoid the hard kind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/inspiring-music-worthy-thoughts.p25\" class=\"\">Parents and Church leaders who counsel young people in this area soon learn that they must move very wisely.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/inspiring-music-worthy-thoughts.p26\" class=\"\">If a little child picks up a sharp object, sometimes a foolish adult will grab for it, frightened for the safety of the child. Instinctively, the child will grip it more tightly and perhaps be injured. The wise parent will trade him for it\u2014some equally appealing, but harmless object, given in exchange, so that he lets go willingly and without tears.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/inspiring-music-worthy-thoughts.p27\" class=\"\">Keep that in mind when you have a problem with young people and their music.

However, the breach between the world and the extremes of its music and the Church is wider in our day than ever in generations past.

Get rid of the worst of it. Keep just the best of it. Be selective in what you consume and what you produce.
