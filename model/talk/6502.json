Popular books have been written in recent years on integrity, common sense, civility, and a host of other virtues, but apparently there is little market for humility. Obviously, in these coarsening times when we are taught the art of negotiating by intimidation, and <span class=\"emphasis\">assertiveness<\/span> has become a byword of the business world, those seeking to become humble will be a small and overlooked but critically important minority.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/to-walk-humbly-with-thy-god.p7\" class=\"\">Consciously trying to acquire humility is also problematic.

When His disciples approached Him and inquired, \u201cWho is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\u201d He responded by placing a little child in their midst and stating, \u201cWhosoever \u2026 shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-21905_000_005\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33619\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33619)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33619)\">Matt. 18:1, 4<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/to-walk-humbly-with-thy-god.p10\" class=\"\">In this passage the Savior teaches us that to become humble is to become as a child. How does a person become as a child, and what are the childlike qualities we ought to develop? King Benjamin, in his profound Book of Mormon sermon, provides guidance:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/to-walk-humbly-with-thy-god.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cFor the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-21905_000_005\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40066\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40066)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40066)\">Mosiah 3:19<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/to-walk-humbly-with-thy-god.p12\" class=\"\">King Benjamin seems to teach that becoming like a child is a gradual process of spiritual development in which we are aided by the Holy Ghost and our reliance on Christ\u2019s Atonement. Through this process, we will eventually acquire the childlike attributes of meekness, humility, patience, love, and spiritual submissiveness. True humility will inevitably lead us to say to God, \u201cThy will be done.\u201d And because what we <span class=\"emphasis\">are<\/span> does affect what we <span class=\"emphasis\">do,<\/span> our submissiveness will be reflected in our reverence, gratitude, and willingness to accept callings, counsel, and correction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/to-walk-humbly-with-thy-god.p13\" class=\"\">A story contained in the family lore of Brigham Young\u2019s descendants illustrates the submissive nature of humility. It recounts that in a public meeting the Prophet Joseph, possibly as a test, sternly rebuked Brigham Young for something he had done or something he was supposed to have done but hadn\u2019t\u2014the detail is unclear. When Joseph finished the rebuke, everyone in the room waited for Brigham Young\u2019s response. This powerful man, later known as the Lion of the Lord, in a voice everyone could tell was sincere, said simply and humbly, \u201cJoseph, what do you want me to do?\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-21905_000_005\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Truman G.

It reminds us that the greatest act of courage and love in the history of mankind\u2014Christ\u2019s atoning sacrifice\u2014was also the greatest act of humility and submissiveness. Some may wonder if those seeking to become humble must forever defer to the strongly held opinions and positions of others. Certainly the Savior\u2019s life evidences that true humility is anything but subservience, weakness, or servility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/to-walk-humbly-with-thy-god.p15\" class=\"\">Another helpful perspective on humility can be obtained by examining its antithesis\u2014pride. Just as humility leads to other virtues such as modesty, teachableness, and unpretentiousness, pride leads to many other vices. In Latter-day Saint theology, it was through pride that Satan became the adversary of all truth.

We say that people are proud of being rich, or clever, or good-looking, but they are not. They are proud of being richer, cleverer, or better-looking than others. If every one else became equally rich, or clever, or good-looking there would be nothing to be proud about. It is the comparison that makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest.

Surely this intolerance of others and their viewpoints is nothing less than the hubris the Greeks viewed and warned against as the suicidal sin.
