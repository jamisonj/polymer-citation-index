As they gathered, the father felt a negative spirit: some members of the family did not look very excited to participate. They had family prayer, and as they started to read the scriptures, the father noticed that one of the children did not have her personal set of scriptures with her. He invited her to go to her room and bring her scriptures. She reluctantly did so, and after a period of time that seemed like an eternity, she returned, sat down, and said, \u201cDo we really have to do this now?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p6\" class=\"\">The father thought to himself that the enemy of all righteousness wanted to create problems so that they would not study the scriptures. The father, trying to stay calm, said, \u201cYes, we have to do this now because this is what the Lord wants us to do.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p7\" class=\"\">She responded, \u201cI don\u2019t really want to do this now!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p8\" class=\"\">The father then lost his patience, raised his voice, and said, \u201cThis is my home, and we will always read the scriptures in my home!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p9\" class=\"\">The tone and volume of his words hurt his daughter, and with her scriptures in hand, she left the family circle, ran to her bedroom, and slammed the door. Thus ended the family scripture study\u2014no harmony and little love being felt at home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p10\" class=\"\">The father knew that he had done wrong, so he went to his own bedroom and knelt down to pray. He pleaded with the Lord for help, knowing that he had offended one of His children, a daughter whom he truly loved. He implored the Lord to restore the spirit of love and harmony at home and enable them to be able to continue studying the scriptures as a family. As he was praying, an idea came to his mind: \u201cGo and say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u201d He continued to pray earnestly, asking for the Spirit of the Lord to come back into his home. Once again the idea came: \u201cGo and say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p11\" class=\"\">He really wanted to be a good father and do the right thing, so he stood up and went to his daughter\u2019s bedroom. He gently knocked on the door several times, and there was no answer. So he slowly opened the door and found his girl sobbing and crying on her bed. He kneeled next to her and said with a soft and tender voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I apologize for what I did.\u201d He repeated, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I love you, and I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d And then from the mouth of a child came the lesson that the Lord wanted to teach him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p12\" class=\"\">She stopped crying, and after a brief silence, she took her scriptures into her hands and started to look up some verses. The father watched as those pure and delicate hands turned the pages of the scriptures, page after page. She came to the verses she sought and started to read very slowly with a soft voice: \u201cFor the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-09211_000_023\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120797\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120797)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120797)\">Mosiah 3:19<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p13\" class=\"\">While he was still kneeling next to her bed, humility overcame him as he thought to himself, \u201cThat scripture was written for me.

He opened his arms and embraced her. Love and harmony had been restored in this sweet moment of reconciliation born of the word of God and the Holy Ghost. That scripture, which his daughter remembered from her own personal scripture study, had touched his heart with the fire of the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p16\" class=\"\">My beloved brethren, our homes have to be places where the Holy Spirit may dwell. \u201cOnly the home can compare with the temple in sacredness.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-09211_000_023\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Bible Dictionary, \u201cTemple.\u201d]<\/span><\/sup> There is no place for the natural man in our homes.
