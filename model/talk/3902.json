It contains a record of God\u2019s dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. It is another testament of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/what-think-ye-of-the-book-of-mormon.p8\" class=\"\">It contains the fulness of the gospel, meaning that it is a record of the Lord\u2019s dealings with a people who had the fulness of the gospel, and meaning also that in it is found a summary and a recitation of what all men must believe and do to gain an inheritance in the heavenly kingdom reserved for the Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/what-think-ye-of-the-book-of-mormon.p9\" class=\"\">As the teachings and testimonies of Moses and Isaiah and Peter find place in the Bible, so the parallel preaching and the same Spirit-guided testimonies of Nephi and Alma and Moroni have come down to us in the Book of Mormon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/what-think-ye-of-the-book-of-mormon.p10\" class=\"\">This American witness of Christ was written upon gold plates which were delivered to Joseph Smith by an angelic ministrant. This ancient record was then translated by the gift and power of God and is now published to the world as the Book of Mormon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/what-think-ye-of-the-book-of-mormon.p11\" class=\"\">If this book is what it purports to be\u2014if the original record was revealed by a holy angel; if the translation was made by the power of God and not of man; if Joseph Smith was entertaining angels, seeing visions, and receiving revelations\u2014all of which is an established verity; if the Book of Mormon is true\u2014then the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon proves the truth of this great latter-day work in which we are engaged.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/what-think-ye-of-the-book-of-mormon.p12\" class=\"\">All of this I explained to my two Protestant friends. One of them, a congenial and decent sort of fellow, said somewhat casually that he would read the Book of Mormon. The other minister, manifesting a bitter spirit, said: \u201cI won\u2019t read it. We have experts who have read the Book of Mormon, and I have read what our experts have to say about it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/what-think-ye-of-the-book-of-mormon.p13\" class=\"\">This account dramatizes one of our problems in presenting the message of the Book of Mormon to the world. There are sincere and devout people everywhere who have heard what other people say about this volume of holy writ, and so they do not read it themselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/what-think-ye-of-the-book-of-mormon.p14\" class=\"\">Instead of drinking from that fountain from whence clear streams of living water flow, they prefer to go downstream and drink from the roily, muddy, poison-filled streams of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/what-think-ye-of-the-book-of-mormon.p15\" class=\"\">The plain fact is that salvation itself is at stake in this matter. If the Book of Mormon is true\u2014if it is a volume of holy scripture, if it contains the mind and will and voice of the Lord to all men, if it is a divine witness of the prophetic call of Joseph Smith\u2014then to accept it and believe its doctrines is to be saved, and to reject it and walk contrary to its teachings is to be damned.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/what-think-ye-of-the-book-of-mormon.p16\" class=\"\">Let this message be sounded in every ear with an angelic trump; let it roll round the earth in resounding claps of never-ending thunder; let it be whispered in every heart by the still, small voice. Those who believe the Book of Mormon and accept Joseph Smith as a prophet thereby open the door to salvation; those who reject the book outright or who simply fail to learn its message and believe its teachings never so much as begin to travel that course along the strait and narrow path that leads to eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/what-think-ye-of-the-book-of-mormon.p17\" class=\"\">Shortly after my experience with these two ministers, two other ministers from the same denomination came to another of our conferences to hear me preach.
