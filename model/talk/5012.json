When world peace was threatened, many countries found themselves engaged in war. The news media have shown vivid images of the ravages, suffering, and destruction of war and the turmoil it causes in individuals. It causes deep anxiety and disrupts families, employment, and schooling. It consumes resources that could be used to better advantage elsewhere. We are most grateful that the Gulf War ended more quickly and with fewer casualties than expected. Our hearts are filled with compassion for families on all sides who lost loved ones and for the innocent victims of war, especially the children. We pray now for a lasting peace when men \u201cshall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: \u2026 neither shall they learn war any more.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25681\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25681)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25681)\">Isa. 2:4<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace-within.p4\" class=\"\">In the scriptures, <span class=\"emphasis\">peace<\/span> means either freedom from strife, contention, conflict, or war, or an inner calm and comfort born of the Spirit that is a gift of God to all of his children, an assurance and serenity within a person\u2019s heart.

Even those incarcerated for lengthy periods of time as war prisoners can be at peace in their own minds.

Few, if any, blessings from God are more valuable to our spiritual health than the reward of peace within.

He has extended to us an invitation: \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

She lived in obedience to the commandments of God and had faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ. Then she developed the practice of doing everything within her power to solve problems and meet challenges, and then, when she felt that she could do nothing more, she would cast her burdens upon the Lord and place the outcome in his hands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace-within.p11\" class=\"\">President David O.

Peace does not come to the transgressor of law; peace comes by obedience to law, and it is that message which Jesus would have us proclaim among men.\u201d (in Conference Report, Oct. 1938, p. 133.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace-within.p12\" class=\"\">Earth life is a period of probation to provide an opportunity for choices. Two mighty forces are pulling in opposite directions. On the one hand is the power of Christ and his righteousness. On the other hand is Satan and the spirits who follow him. President Marion G.

The reward for following the other is the works of the flesh\u2014the antithesis of peace.\u201d Further, he said: \u201cThe price of peace is victory over Satan.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Oct. 1983, pp. 4\u20135.)

We sometimes refer to the Spirit of Christ as our conscience. If we follow its promptings, we can be free of sin and filled with peace. If we do not, but instead let our carnal appetites control us, we never will know true peace.
