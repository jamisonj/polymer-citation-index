It is available for all mankind if we desire it. Peace can be had. We must study and\nlearn of God's desires for us. We must pray about it. Indeed, we must live the law; then we\nhave a peace in our hearts and will truly be peacemakers, the children of God.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe in the scriptures as they have been restored. I believe that we can have peace in a\ntroubled world. I believe we can have peace in a troubled home. I believe we can have peace\nin a troubled life. It can be had for the price which I have stated; not for money nor for any\nmaterial amount.\n<\/p><p>\nI said we must study and do the things which will make for peace. Paul, the apostle, in his\nepistle to the Romans said: \"Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace,\nand things wherewith one may edify another.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For the kingdom of God is . . . righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42759\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42759)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42759)\">Rom. 14:17,19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPaul had an evidence of peace. Here was a man, yes, who had fought the Christ, who had\nfought the principles which will bring peace. Yet after he had received conviction of the\ntruthfulness of the Savior's message and of his divinity as the Son of God, he received a\npeace in his heart, and he could not be swayed from righteousness but used his energies, his\ntalents, in going forward to teach this great message of which he received a conviction. Yes,\nPaul did the things which will bring peace into the hearts of all mankind.\n<\/p><p>\nPeace can only come to individuals, communities, states, nations, and the world by the\nacceptance of the greatest story ever told, by acceptance of the greatest life that was ever\nlived, by acceptance of the greatest example that was ever shown, by acceptance of the\ngreatest Teacher who ever taught, the author of salvation and exaltation, the Prince of Peace,\nJesus the Christ, the Divine Son of God. This I know in every fiber of my being.\n<\/p><p>\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ has always been the gospel of peace, regardless of when there has\nbeen a dispensation of the gospel upon the earth. I recall the words of the Lord to the Prophet\nJoseph Smith which indicated that there is no change in the gospel of Jesus Christ, even in\nthis dispensation.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the midst of great persecution when the Saints were being persecuted in June of 1834 at\nZion's Camp on Fishing River, the Prophet Joseph received a revelation from the Lord which\nis recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants, \". . . lift up an ensign of peace, and make a\nproclamation of peace unto the ends of the earth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14202\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14202)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14202)\">D&amp;C 105:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe, here today, one hundred and twenty-eight years after this revelation was received, can\nvisualize what has been accomplished towards establishing peace in the earth. Think of it! We\nsee, as we look back over the span of time today, the thousands of missionaries who have\nbeen out in the world to carry this message of peace to all mankind, unselfishly postponing\ntheir schooling, leaving their homes and loved ones to deliver this message which will bring\npeace into the hearts of men. We visualize the erection of fourteen temples. We visualize 356\nstakes organized and over 3,000 wards and many branches, sixty-eight missions,\napproximately 12,000 missionaries out at the present time, delivering this message of peace,\nliterally to the ends of the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom study and from prayer, there comes great faith which motivates all who have a firm and\nsolid conviction of the truth. There is born a desire truly to be publishers of peace. I think of\na mother writing to a son in one of the missions which I have visited in the South Pacific. He\nhad indicated to her, knowing her circumstances, a widowed mother, the possibility that she\nwas having financial difficulties, and he earnestly wanted to stay to fill the\ntwo and one half years required in a foreign mission where a language has to be learned. He\nlet me read the letter she wrote him in return: \"Son, you will stay out on your mission even if\nI have to scrub floors to earn money sufficient to keep you there.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen I think of a husband and wife who had five sons go out into the mission field; the sixth\nson had reached the required age to go. Not having sufficient funds, they went to the bank\nand placed a mortgage on their home to assure him finances to fill his mission that he might\ncarry this message of peace to mankind. I am grateful for that kind of faith.\n<\/p><p>\nIn May we had a missionary conference on the island of Rarotonga in the Cook Islands. All\nthe missionaries had arrived but two. These two were nine days on the water, coming over\n640 miles in a small craft, being buffeted about the Pacific, and I want to tell you, you can be\nbuffeted about the Pacific in those small boats, inter-island boats. One of these young men\nhad been made the counselor in the mission presidency at the conference, and it would be\nunnecessary for him to return to the island from which he came, but he said, \"The work has\njust begun there, and we can see real fruits of our labors, and I would like to go back,\"\nthough he was going to be bounced about in the same type of craft for another eight or nine\ndays. This he did that he might deliver his message of peace to the island people.\nFaith-promoting stories like these could be multiplied thousands of times if time permitted.\nWhen peace comes into our souls, we have a desire to share it with others as Paul of old.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful for all the mission presidents of the South Pacific. I spent ten months down\nthere in the last year and three quarters. All the mission presidents of the South Pacific are\nopening up their homes, entertaining and teaching men of state, leaders of government,\nbusiness and civic groups, teaching this message of peace. It has been my privilege to attend\nmany such occasions.\n<\/p><p>\nWhile on one of the large ocean liners in the South Pacific recently, I visited with the captain.\nHe related that he had had many of our young missionaries on his ship over the years, and he\nsaid he had been deeply impressed with young men of such fine caliber. He had observed\nthey didn't drink tea, coffee, liquor, or use tobacco. Their language and conversation was clean\nand above board. They appeared to be morally clean. They did not take the name of the Lord\nin vain. He admired their integrity. He said, \"You have the greatest peace corps in the world.\"\nI sincerely thanked him for this truthful statement. Then I reflected, as I thought of this\nexperience; not only are the full-time missionaries a peace corps, but this peace corps extends,\nincluding all members of the Church: truly the greatest peace corps in the world with the full\nand true message of the Lord Jesus Christ if all members, individually, accept the\nresponsibility to teach this message of peace by example as well as by precept. In\ncontemplating this responsibility for the entire membership of the Church, I quote from a talk\ngiven by President David O. McKay: \"The Gospel of Peace should find its most fruitful\neffects in the homes of Church members. Children to be healthy and happy should have a\nfavorable mental, emotional and spiritual atmosphere in the home. It is inconsistent to go\nabroad to proclaim peace if we have not peace in our own lives and homes.\" Truly the home\nshould be the birthplace of peace.\n<\/p><p>\nThen we have a religion in action as we take advantage of all the opportunities within the\nChurch; through the priesthood quorums, the Sunday School Relief Society, MIA, Young\nMen's and Young Women's organizations, the Primary, genealogical organizations, institutes,\nseminaries, ward choirs, welfare, building projects, to mention some of the organizations\nwithin the Church which will help to keep this message of peace alive in our hearts. Hundreds\ntoday are witnessing these demonstrations for peace through the true Church of Jesus Christ\nthroughout the world.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that we in our hearts here and all members throughout the world will recognize the\nopportunity which is ours to serve individually and collectively as messengers of peace, truly\nchildren of our God. It is within our power; I pray that we will put aside any hostilities that\nthere may be individually or collectively towards the teachings of the Master,\nthat we will accept them fully and wholly, not in part, and do our utmost to show by example\nour true love for this great message of peace.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Joseph received a revelation from the Lord, Doctrine and Covenants, \". . . the\nvoice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall\nnot see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; for their iniquities shall be spoken\nupon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I\nhave chosen in these last days\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14065\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14065)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14065)\">D&amp;C 1:2-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay we appreciate more fully through the sessions of this conference, the great privilege\nwhich is ours to be partakers of this message of peace, that it may be in our hearts, in our\ncities, in our towns in our communities, in our states, in this nation, and in all nations, for I\ntestify that Jesus is the Christ. I know it in every fiber of my being, and I pray that we will\nremember his words: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28030\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28030)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28030)\">John 14:27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay this be with us all this day and all our mortal lives, I humbly pray in the name of the\nLord Jesus Christ, our Savior. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
