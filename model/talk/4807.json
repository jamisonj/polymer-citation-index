We will have power to do good and to resist evil, and our ability to solve problems will be expanded. Messages to help us in our day were foreseen by the Lord and were divinely placed on the pages of the scriptures to assist us and our families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>King Benjamin in the Book of Mormon set a wonderful example of how parents should teach their children from the scriptures, as found in Mosiah 1, beginning with verse 3.

Teach them to avoid the very appearance of evil, such as not saying even slang expressions which may lead to taking the Lord\u2019s name in vain; or dressing even a little immodestly which down the road may lead to improprieties; or partaking of substances that are not listed in the Word of Wisdom, yet are still harmful to the body; or holding back a little on tithes and offerings; or telling half-truths.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cKeep the commandments! In this there is safety; in this there is peace.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 303.) While there is little of safety and peace in many parts of the world, we can find it in our hearts and in our homes as we do the works of righteousness.

Surely their mothers taught them truths that preserved their very lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>We are commanded to teach our children to pray and to walk uprightly before the Lord. You may remember the story that Elder Robert L. Simpson told about a three-year-old boy who knelt down with his daddy to say his bedtime prayers. Eyes were closed, heads were bowed, but no words were spoken for several moments. Soon the little boy climbed into his bed. The daddy opened his eyes and said, \u201cBut what about prayers?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>And the boy answered, \u201cI said my prayers.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t hear you,\u201d said the daddy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Then followed the child\u2019s classic comment, \u201cBut Daddy, I wasn\u2019t talking to you.\u201d (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Proven Paths,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1974, p. 148.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sometimes children, being pure and holy, teach us something of our heavenly home.

But through disobedience they forgot, just like the Nephites forgot, and they reaped the consequences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In our day, we again have a chance to make covenants to keep us in remembrance that we are sons and daughters of God desiring to return to His presence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Teaching the importance of ordinances and covenants cannot be taken casually by Latter-day Saints. Elder Boyd K. Packer shared his insight when he said: \u201cOrdinances and covenants become our credentials for admission into His presence. To worthily receive them is the quest of a lifetime; to keep them thereafter is the challenge of mortality.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1987, p. 24.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>We have the privilege of making sacred covenants at baptism and in the holy temples, with an invitation to renew them often.

Also, returning to the temple as often as possible helps us remember the covenants we have made there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Keeping our covenants should make a difference in the way we live, the way we act, the way we speak, the way we dress, the way we treat each other.
