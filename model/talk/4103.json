The caller in Salt Lake City asked if I planned to attend general conference, which convened the next morning. To this I answered, \u201cNo,\u201d whereupon he asked if I could. I responded, \u201cI suppose I can if you want me to.\u201d The caller said, \u201cThe President of the Church would like to see you tomorrow morning at 8:00 in his office. Now have a good night\u2019s sleep because it will be your last.\u201d After some twenty-four years, it looks as though I may get that good night\u2019s sleep\u2014perhaps.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p4\" class=\"\">These years have been the most challenging and rewarding years of my life. I have had the indescribable blessing of being tutored every week, with few exceptions, by four Presidents of the Church and eight different Counselors in the First Presidency, and of course, for eleven years of that time, by a wonderful Presiding Bishop, John H. Vandenberg. It was a great blessing to serve with Elder Robert L. Simpson as Counselors to Bishop Vandenberg. Words cannot adequately express my love and my appreciation for my own faithful Counselors, Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone, Bishop H. Burke Peterson, and Bishop J. Richard Clarke, for their loyalty to me personally, and for their outstanding contribution to the Church during these thirteen years. We\u2019ve been abundantly blessed by men and women of great faith and commitment\u2014both here at home and from all over the world\u2014who joined with us in response to the assignment from the First Presidency to accomplish the temporal work of the kingdom in these latter days. I express my heartfelt appreciation and gratitude to all, wherever they may be, and thank them for the blessing of being associated with them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p5\" class=\"\">These associations have reinforced for me the basic principles learned in my youth. I should like to discuss two or three of them today. There are some things that are common to all mankind. Two of the most obvious are that we are born and we die. We take with us in death no more than we brought with us in birth, as far as material things are concerned. The closer I get to the time of departure from this life, the more concern I feel about what I will take with me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p6\" class=\"\">A common principle, perhaps one of the most important, is the gift of free agency. This great gift of God to all of his children was part of the plan of salvation explained in the councils in heaven. From the scriptures we read:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil, to act for themselves. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4127\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4127)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4127)\">2 Ne. 2:26\u201327<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p9\" class=\"\">As President Brigham Young said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cIf Brother Brigham shall take a wrong track, and be shut out of the Kingdom of heaven, no person will be to blame but Brother Brigham. I am the only being in heaven, earth, or hell, that can be blamed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cThis will equally apply to every Latter-day Saint. Salvation is an individual operation. I am the only person that can possibly save myself. When salvation is sent to me, I can reject or receive it. In receiving it, I yield implicit obedience and submission to its great Author throughout my life, and to those whom he shall appoint to instruct me; in rejecting it, I follow the dictates of my own will in preference to the will of my Creator.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> sel. John A. Widtsoe, [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1941], p. 390.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p12\" class=\"\">Thus we see that free agency goes hand in hand with responsibility, and that consequences, good or bad, are the result of our personal decisions resulting from the exercise of free agency. And this is another principle, obedience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p13\" class=\"\">The Lord, understanding our frailty as human beings and recognizing the influence that Satan would exert, gave us standards by which we can live our lives and know good from evil. These standards are found in the holy scriptures. I should like to refer to some of these scriptures which for me have increased meaning as I grow older. The first one, perhaps, would be the foundation upon which the others can rise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p14\" class=\"\">In the eighth chapter of John, the Savior says, \u201cI am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29245\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29245)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29245)\">John 8:12<\/a><\/span>.) If we accept this statement of the Lord, others will naturally fold into proper place. What does it mean to have the \u201clight of life\u201d and \u201cnot walk in darkness\u201d? A rich young ruler may have had this question in mind when he asked Jesus what he should do to inherit eternal life, which is the greatest gift of God to man. The Savior responded:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cThou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cNow when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cFor it is easier for a camel to go through a needle\u2019s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32218\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32218)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32218)\">Luke 18:20\u201325<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/agency-and-accountability.p21\" class=\"\">May I restate part of President Young\u2019s quotation: \u201cWhen salvation is sent to me, I can reject or receive it.
