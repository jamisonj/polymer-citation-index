Who\n  could have told whether the power of Simon, the sorcerer,<span class=\"footRef\">3<\/span> was of God or of the devil?<span class=\"footRef\">4<\/span><\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">There always did, in every age, seem to be a lack of intelligence pertaining to this subject.\n  Spirits of all kinds have been manifested,<span class=\"footRef\">5<\/span> in every age, and almost among all people. If we go\n  among the pagans, they have their spirits; the Mohammedans, the Jews, the Christians, the\n  Indians&mdash;all have their spirits, all have a supernatural agency, and all contend that their spirits are\n  of God. Who shall solve the mystery? &ldquo;Try the spirits,&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> says John, but who is to do it? The learned,\n  the eloquent, the philosopher, the sage, the divine&mdash;all are ignorant. The heathens will boast of their\n  gods, and of the great things that have been unfolded by their oracles. The Mussulman will boast\n  of his Koran, and of the divine communications that his progenitors have received. The Jews have\n  had numerous instances, both ancient and modern, among them of men who have professed to be\n  inspired,<span class=\"footRef\">7<\/span> and sent to bring about great events, and the Christian world has not been slow in making\n  up the number.<\/p>\n  <div class=\"topic \">Ignorance of the Nature of Spirits<\/div>\n  <p class=\"std\">&ldquo;Try the spirits,&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">8<\/span> but what by? Are we to try them by the creeds of men?<span class=\"footRef\">9<\/span> What preposterous\n  folly&mdash;what sheer ignorance&mdash;what madness!  Try the motions and actions of an eternal being<span class=\"footRef\">10<\/span> (for\n  I contend that all spirits are such) by a thing that was conceived in ignorance, and brought forth in\n  folly&mdash;a cobweb of yesterday!  Angels would hide their faces, and devils would be ashamed and\n  insulted, and would say, &ldquo;Paul we know, and Jesus we know, but who are ye?&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">11<\/span> Let each man of\n  society make a creed and try evil spirits by it, and the devil would shake his sides; it is all that he\n  would ask&mdash;all that he would desire. Yet many of them do this, and hence &ldquo;many spirits are abroad\n  in the world.&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">12<\/span><\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">One great evil is, that men are ignorant of the nature of spirits; their power, laws, government,\n  intelligence, etc., and imagine that when there is anything like power, revelation, or vision\n  manifested, that it must be of God. Hence the Methodists, Presbyterians, and others frequently\n  possess a spirit that will cause them to lie down, and during its operation, animation is frequently\n  entirely suspended; they consider it to be the power<\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"109568\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 109568)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(109568)\">1 Cor. 14:32<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">2. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110539\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110539)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110539)\">2 Pet. 1:21<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">3. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"109033\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 109033)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(109033)\">Acts 8:9<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">4. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112953\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112953)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112953)\">Moro. 7:14,17<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">5. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"113979\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 113979)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(113979)\">D&amp;C 50:31<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">6. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110611\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110611)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110611)\">1 Jn. 4:1<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">7. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"124511\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124511)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124511)\">Acts 5:36-37<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">8. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110612\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110612)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110612)\">1 Jn. 4:1<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">9. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"115891\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 115891)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(115891)\">D&amp;C 123:7<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">10. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"114520\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 114520)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(114520)\">D&amp;C 77:3<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">11. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"109165\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 109165)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(109165)\">Acts 19:15<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">12. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110613\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110613)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110613)\">1 Jn. 4:1<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
