And so it should be at Easter and at every other season of the year, for no doctrine in the Christian canon is more important to all mankind than the doctrine of the resurrection of the Son of God. Through him came the resurrection of all men, women, and children who have ever been\u2014or ever will be\u2014born into the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/he-is-risen.p4\" class=\"\">In spite of the great importance we place upon the Resurrection in our doctrine, perhaps many of us may not yet have fully glimpsed its spiritual significance and eternal grandeur. If we had, we would marvel at its beauty as did Jacob, the brother of Nephi, and we would shudder at the alternative we would have faced had we not received this divine gift. Jacob wrote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/he-is-risen.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cO the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace!
