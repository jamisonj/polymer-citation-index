As I have studied this subject, my thoughts have been drawn to some lines I read at BYU some twenty years ago. The first of these lines you will think strange as an illustration of the subject of education in the Church. They were written by Thomas Hobbes, the seventeenth century English political philosopher, in his greatest work, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Leviathan.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strive-for-excellence.p4\" class=\"\">In describing the nature of man, Hobbes wrote that \u201cthe life of man [is] solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\u201d This is a classic example of the philosophies of man. I am grateful that my education exposed me to that thought and others like it, because my familiarity with these thoughts has helped me to understand the world and its peoples and its problems.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strive-for-excellence.p5\" class=\"\">But most of all, I am grateful that my educational program was such that at the time I was exposed to this view of man, I was also being taught these lines:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strive-for-excellence.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cAdam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3860\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3860)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3860)\">2 Ne. 2:25<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strive-for-excellence.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cRemember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15693\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15693)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15693)\">D&amp;C 18:10<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strive-for-excellence.p8\" class=\"\">The worlds were created by the Only Begotten of the Father, \u201cand the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15761\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15761)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15761)\">D&amp;C 76:24<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strive-for-excellence.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cFor a wise and glorious purpose thou hast placed me here on earth. \u2026\u201d (\u201cO My Father,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns, <\/span>No. 138.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strive-for-excellence.p10\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7284\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7284)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7284)\">Abr. 3:26<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strive-for-excellence.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of God\u2014Wherefore, all things are theirs. \u2026\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15764\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15764)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15764)\">D&amp;C 76:58\u201359<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strive-for-excellence.p12\" class=\"\">My personal experience converts me to the wisdom of the educational philosophy that joins spiritual with secular instruction. At Brigham Young University and in the other institutions of the Church Educational System, we are concerned with teaching the fundaments of spiritual and secular knowledge and with bringing those teachings into harmony in the lives of men and women in order to prepare them for a balanced and full life of service to God and fellowman.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">From this philosophy I distill four thoughts that I offer for the special attention of the young men of the priesthood:<\/p>\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rigorous standards and high achievement in any field of learning are not at odds with faith and devotion to the gospel of Jesus Christ.

If you are not in a Church school\u2014BYU, Ricks, Church College of Hawaii\u2014make the institute or seminary or home study part of your program.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">4.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Most of all, live so that you can be guided and taught by the Spirit in all your activities, including all your efforts to learn and gain an education: honor your parents; be true to the teachings of the Church; be clean and faithful in all things; and be loyal to the leaders of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strive-for-excellence.p19\" class=\"\">I am grateful for my membership in the Church.
