The manicured lawns have discarded their drab winter color and now appear as a carpet of green accentuating the elegant flower beds with their brilliant blooms. It is a period of renewal, a time of gratitude, and a season for reflection.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/conference-is-here.p6\" class=\"\">The world has experienced sweeping changes since last we met. A wall in Berlin has crumbled. Families now may join together on either side and experience the joy they have long been deprived. In Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic, the bells of freedom have sounded, heralding a new day for our time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/conference-is-here.p7\" class=\"\">All of us remember, President Benson, that dark period following World War II when our members were near starvation and bordering on despair. Then you undertook your dramatic assignment to supervise the distribution of food, clothing, and medical supplies from the storehouse of the Church to the war-devastated families in Europe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/conference-is-here.p8\" class=\"\">Your words, President, echo loud and clear: \u201cWe must \u2018dedicate our strength to serving the needs, rather than the fears, of the world.\u2019 \u2026 I believe errands of mercy, such as the distribution of goods, housing, and clothing to those in need, are rendered most effectively when handled by private individuals and organizations such as the Church.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988, p. 261.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/conference-is-here.p9\" class=\"\">In the spirit of President Benson\u2019s counsel, we have a responsibility to extend help as well as hope to the hungry, to the homeless, and to the downtrodden both at home and abroad. Such assistance is being provided for the blessing of all. In a host of cities, where need has outdistanced help, lives have been lifted, hearts have been touched, and the frown of despair has been transformed to the smile of confidence, thanks to the generosity of the Church membership in the payment of their fast offerings as the Lord has commanded.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/conference-is-here.p10\" class=\"\">To the youth of the Church\u2014President Benson has long been your champion and advocate. On a previous occasion he summed up the feelings of all your leaders when he declared, \u201cBeloved youth, you will have your trials and temptations through which you must pass, but there are great moments of eternity which lie ahead. You have our love and our confidence. We pray that you will be prepared for the reins of leadership.

He rejoices in your achievements, he admires your strengths. He is your friend and your advocate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/conference-is-here.p12\" class=\"\">To the parents of the Church\u2014President Benson has long urged that a good example is the best teacher. I have heard him offer sublime prayers to our Heavenly Father. Simple supplication, generous gratitude mark these petitions. Children joining parents in prayer will tend to be united with their families and found following the teachings of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/conference-is-here.p13\" class=\"\">How President Benson and his beloved wife, Flora, enjoy attending the temple each week! His feeling for the temple is found in his statement: \u201cI love the temples of God.

Perhaps never in history has the need for cooperation, understanding, and goodwill among all people\u2014nations and individuals alike\u2014been so urgent as today. It is not only fitting\u2014it is imperative\u2014that we emphasize the ideal of brotherhood and the responsibility true brotherhood confers upon us all.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/conference-is-here.p15\" class=\"\">As Edwin Markham observed:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">There is a destiny that makes us brothers;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">None goes his way alone:<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">All that we send into the lives of others<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Comes back into our own.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/conference-is-here.p20\" class=\"\">Let us live the commandments of God.
