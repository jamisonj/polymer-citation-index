This beautiful temple serves more than 80,000 wonderful and excited members of the Church in Sacramento and surrounding areas. Over 168,000 visitors toured the temple during the open house. They were told that members can draw closer to the Savior Jesus Christ in these magnificent edifices than anywhere else in the world. Our members know that through Him they can find the peace and hope that will sustain them and their families in today\u2019s troubled world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-temple-is-about-families.p6\" class=\"\">When you come to the temple you will love your family with a deeper love than you have ever felt before. The temple is about families. As my wife, Karen, and I have increased our temple service, our love for each other and for our children has increased. And it doesn\u2019t stop there. It extends to parents, brothers and sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins, forebears, and especially our grandchildren! This is the Spirit of Elijah, which is the spirit of family history work; and when inspired by the Holy Ghost, it prompts the turning of the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers. Because of the priesthood, husbands and wives are sealed together, children are sealed to their parents for eternity so the family is eternal and will not be separated at death.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-temple-is-about-families.p7\" class=\"\">When my wife and I were young parents with little children at home, we challenged our children to memorize the Articles of Faith. The prize, or reward, for completing them was a night out with Dad. We were pleased that our three oldest completed the challenge. When our seven-year-old son first memorized all 13 Articles of Faith, we sat down to pick out a night and activity that we could do together. I was so busy with work, social activities, and Church responsibilities that I couldn\u2019t give my son a night out for about two weeks. He was sorely disappointed. However, I found that in the city where we lived there was an all-night bowling alley. We immediately picked a date and chose to start our activity at 5:00 in the morning. Our plan was to get up at 4:00, have breakfast, and then go downtown.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-temple-is-about-families.p8\" class=\"\">When that day arrived, I felt someone shaking my shoulder very early in the morning. As I tried to open my eyes I heard my son say, \u201cIs it time, Dad?\u201d I looked at my alarm clock; it was only 2:00 a.m.!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-temple-is-about-families.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cGo to sleep, Son,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not time yet.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-temple-is-about-families.p10\" class=\"\">An hour later the same thing happened. \u201cDad, Dad, is it time to go?\u201d After sending him to bed for a second time, I couldn\u2019t help but feel his excitement.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-temple-is-about-families.p11\" class=\"\">Then at 4:00 a.m. we got up, had something to eat, and left for the bowling alley. We had a wonderful time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-temple-is-about-families.p12\" class=\"\">I wish I could say I had regular and memorable activities like that with all my children, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m one of those parents who ofttimes wishes he could go back and do some things over.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-temple-is-about-families.p13\" class=\"\">Like you, I don\u2019t want to lose any of my children. I want to be together forever with all of my family. The temple gives all of us extra hope of continuing and improving these relationships, even after this life. Sealings bestowed in the temple promise additional blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-temple-is-about-families.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cThe Prophet Joseph Smith declared\u2014and he never taught more comforting doctrine\u2014that the eternal sealings of faithful parents and the divine promises made to them for valiant service in the Cause of Truth, would save not only themselves, but likewise their posterity. Though some of the sheep may wander, the eye of the Shepherd is upon them, and sooner or later they will feel the tentacles of Divine Providence reaching out after them and drawing them back to the fold. Either in this life or the life to come, they will return. They will have to pay their debt to justice; they will suffer for their sins; and may tread a thorny path; but if it leads them at last, like the penitent Prodigal, to a loving and forgiving father\u2019s heart and home, the painful experience will not have been in vain.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-26911_000_005\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Orson F.
