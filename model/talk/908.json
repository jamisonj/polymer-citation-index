Bennion<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Adam S. Bennion, <i>Conference Report<\/i> April 1957,  pp. 115-118<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nFour years have come and gone since I was called to this position, and they have been\ntremendous years: <i>Here with these devoted brethren, out in the stakes and wards with our<\/i>\n<i>wonderful people, in representative military camps from Canada to Germany<\/i>, and in the\nmission fields with the inspiring devotion of our young men and women and the\nheart-warming response of the Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nTogether with these assignments have come opportunities to attend stimulating Religious\nEmphasis Weeks at representative universities of America. It is an intriguing experience to be\ninvited to be a member of a team made up of a Catholic priest, an Episcopalian minister, a\nPresbyterian, a Methodist, a Baptist, a Seventh-Day Adventist, a Christian Scientist, a Jewish\nrabbi, and a Mormon elder.\n<\/p><p>\nTo meet with faculties of those institutions and with students and then to spend the evening in\njoint sessions of fraternity members and sorority girls, attempting to answer the questions\nwhich they ask&mdash;and I think I have never been asked so many questions in my life before,\nand I have never been so grateful for the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and so proud of the\nprogram which it carries forward.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the most meaningful questions ever put to me was this one in one of the universities:\n\"Mr. Bennion, what has your Church given to America that America didn't already have?\" I\nhave been thinking about that question ever since, and one day I hope to have a complete\nanswer.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen it was first put to me, I offered five simple answers. Today I should like to do\nsomething I have not done in a conference here before. You good people who sit out there by\nyour radios, I hope you have a pencil handy, because I am going to violate all the rules of\npsychology. The psychologists say we ought to limit ourselves to three ideas, or to five, at\nmost. I am going to take you to a score of them today, and I am sure you cannot remember\nthem all, but if you will jot them down, my thought is that it is a wonderful thing to get the\nwhole scope of the gospel, to run it through in its entirety as best we\ncan in these few minutes.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, I started out with my answer to \"What has your Church given to America that America\ndidn't already have?\" and I said, first of all <i>A Welfare Plan<\/i>. A plan to insure against want, an\nassurance that no man, woman, or child shall ever be left in distress, a plan which is not a\ndole, a plan which does not involve beggary, a plan involving honest work and mutual\nhelpfulness, a plan inspired of God for the blessing of his children.\n<\/p><p>\nWherever this welfare plan has been explained, men have said, \"Certainly that is a\ncontribution to America.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe second thing I named was <i>A Great Pioneer Story<\/i>. I love to live over again the heroic\nexperiences of our forebears when, driven out of their homes in Nauvoo in the dead of winter,\nthey trudged across three hundred miles of snow and mud and muck to Winter Quarters, then\nto launch another trek of a thousand miles through an uninhabited wilderness to a haven\ncharacterized significantly by their prophet leader, Brigham Young, when he said:\n<\/p><p>\nWe will go so far that our enemies will not choose to follow us and we will pick\nso unpromising a place that nobody will covet it. (Brigham Young to President\nJames K. Polk, August 9, 1846.)\n<\/p><p>\nWe love now to sing the song:\n<\/p><p>\nWe'll find the place which God for us prepared,<br \/>\nFar away in the West;<br \/>\nWhere none shall come to hurt or make afraid;<br \/>\nThere the Saints will be blessed.<br \/>\n<\/p><p>\n             \"Come, Come, Ye Saints.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn that story is a tale to match Plymouth, a tale reminiscent of Israel on her way to the\nPromised Land. There are courage and devotion and sacrifice and faith triumphant over\nhardship, and I submit to you, as I have submitted to the universities of this country&mdash;there is\na contribution.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the third place, and the men of these universities are impressed with it, we have given to\nthe world and to America <i>A Religious Literature<\/i>. Try naming a modern church which has\ngiven to America anything to match the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and\nthe Pearl of Great Price.\n<\/p><p>\nI love to read to inquirers after truth those masterful and moving and inspired messages such\nas are found in the Doctrine and Covenants. May I commend to you when you go home from\nthis conference, that you try in your family circle, reading aloud once more, sections 76\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13557\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13557)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13557)\">D&amp;C 76:1-119<\/a><\/span>) and\n84 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13562\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13562)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13562)\">D&amp;C 84:1-120<\/a><\/span>) and\n88 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13567\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13567)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13567)\">D&amp;C 88:1-141<\/a><\/span>) and\n93 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13573\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13573)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13573)\">D&amp;C 93:1-53<\/a><\/span>) and\n121 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13590\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13590)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13590)\">D&amp;C 121:1-46<\/a><\/span>) and\n130 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13593\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13593)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13593)\">D&amp;C 130:1-23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe fourth thing we have given to America is <i>A Wonderful Concept of Deity<\/i>. If you will read\nrepresentative descriptions of Deity popular a hundred and thirty-five years ago, with all their\nintangible vagaries, you will be grateful, as I am, for the Prophet Joseph Smith's forthright\nand simple declaration in his account of his glorious vision:\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory\ndefy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me,\ncalling me by name and said, pointing to the other&mdash;This is My Beloved Son.\nHear Him! (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30371\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30371)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30371)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt will stir you to read again his final testimony as recorded in section 76.\n<\/p><p>\nThe fifth thing that we have given to America is <i>The Priesthood<\/i>. It was similarly wonderful\nfor the Prophet Joseph not only to announce the personalities of God the Father and the Son,\nbut also to announce the return of John the Baptist to confer the Aaronic Priesthood, and the\nreturn of Peter, James, and John, bringing the Melchizedek Priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nWe declare to the world that the priesthood, long lost, has been restored in this the last great\ndispensation, the authority to act in the name of God given us through the laying on of hands\nby messengers out of heaven. And that is a contribution.\n<\/p><p>\nOther inquiries have prompted me to extend my analysis. Over and over again I have been\nasked throughout America and Europe to name the features that are distinctive of\nMormonism. I can only name them here but taken together they set out a pattern which\ndeserves the thoughtful consideration of men everywhere. I leave them with you in the  hope\nthat they might heighten your appreciation of a wonderful program. I\nhave given you five, and with a temerity that perhaps exceeds my good judgment, I want to\nadd the list up to twenty-odd. And you will appreciate the fact that all I can do is to name\nthem. You take them and fill them in. They make a wonderful study.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 6. <i>The Principle of Free Agency<\/i>. The glorious privilege of choosing what we shall\nbelieve, what we shall do, and what we shall become.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 7. <i>The Idea of Eternal Progression<\/i>. An everlasting becoming! As Professor Rugh once\nsaid: \"Life can become the achievement of a perpetual triumph.\" I think the poet Browning\nhad some such idea in mind when he penned the lines: \"A man's aim should exceed his\ngrasp&mdash;or what's a heaven for.\"\n<\/p><p>\nItem 8. <i>Tithing<\/i>. The key to the financing of the program of the Church, a returning to God of\none-tenth in appreciation for the nine-tenths he so generously gives to us his children.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 9. <i>Temples and Temple Ordinances<\/i>. Try to name the modern church that builds temples\nfor sacred ordinances, that teaches genealogical research, that does vicarious work for the\nhonored dead of other generations.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 10. <i>Ward Teaching<\/i>. This was stressed so beautifully and effectively last night in our\nGeneral Priesthood meeting by our beloved President. It is heartening to know that every\nfamily in the Church may receive an official call each month by a representative of a bishop\nto inquire in a friendly spirit into the health and well-being of the members of the family and\nto leave a stimulating gospel message for meditation during the month.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 11. <i>Lay Leadership<\/i>. Leadership inheres in the membership of the Church. Leaders are\nchosen from the ranks. The door is open for any worthy young man or young woman to enter\nupon the path that leads to presidency in the various organizations of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 12. <i>A Wonderful Organization<\/i>. The genius of that organization is reflected in the fact\nthat in a typical ward&mdash;and it is interesting to call the roll as we did in this one ward, a ward\nof 600 members&mdash;236 men and women are actually engaged in leadership responsibility, and\nthe channels of activity are perfectly clear.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 13. <i>A Work-a-Day Program<\/i>. Mormonism is not merely a system of belief&mdash;it is a gospel\nof activity. It is not confined to church worship on the Sabbath Day&mdash;it reaches into the daily\nlives of its members every day in the week. As someone said happily in Europe: \"The Church\ndoesn't work its members to death&mdash;it works them to life.\"\n<\/p><p>\nItem 14. <i>A Philosophy of Grace and Works<\/i>. So often in discussions men get lost as between\nfaith and grace and works. It is clear that our redemption is made possible by the grace of our\nLord and Savior, but it is inconceivable that the greatest gift of God to man can be realized\nwithout effort. Such an idea runs counter to the scripture and to every experience we have in\nlife. It squares with reason that when we have done all that we can in and of ourselves\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3617\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3617)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3617)\">2 Ne. 25:23<\/a><\/span>), then\nGod sublimates our efforts through his mercy.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 15. <i>The Word of Wisdom<\/i>. In the interest of health and spiritual power, it is good to\nknow that we have section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants for our guidance.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 16. <i>The Great Missionary System<\/i>. One of the finest evidences of the vitality and\nselflessness of Mormonism is the fact that regularly some 5,000 of her choice youth, at their\nown expense, go out into almost all the corners of the globe and for two years devote\nthemselves to proclaiming the truths of the restored gospel for the blessing of their fellow\nmen.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 17. <i>A Great Program for Youth<\/i>. A good friend of mine out of New York recently said\nhe wished he could have his own children to live in Utah, to come under the benedictions of\nour program for young folk. I feel sure there is no element of boasting in proclaiming that in\nthe matter of a well-rounded program for the development of the talent of youth through\nrecreation, scouting, dramatics, public speaking, athletics, social leadership, and religious\nstudy and contemplation, the Church offers some of the finest training in the world.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 18. <i>Continuing Revelation<\/i>. It seems so reasonable to believe that the God who\ncreated the world and all of us, should still reach out in love toward us and guide our\ndestinies. The thought of retirement for God seems repugnant to an intelligent evaluation of\nhis purposes. Certainly the world is in need of direction quite as much today as it was in the\ndays of Moses.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 19. <i>A Precious Fellowship through Service<\/i>. One of the most satisfying rewards for\nworking in the Church is the privilege of coming to know fully how wonderful a\ncompanionship grows out of the mutual devotion to volunteer service in the interest of our\nfellow men. There is a rare joy in joining hands with friends in the service of our Father in\nheaven.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 20. <i>Intellectual Liberty Coupled with Intellectual Responsibility<\/i>. The basic belief, \"the\nglory of God is intelligence\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13577\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13577)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13577)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span>),\n puts a premium on the search for truth. Men are encouraged to\nreach out for enlightenment wherever it is worthily to be found. But they are also charged\nwith the responsibility of proofreading their thinking against good common sense and against\nthe revealed word of God.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 21. (I marvel at your patience&mdash;I shall run out of numbers soon. But as I turn them\nthrough, the gospel seems so complete. I have wanted to do this once.) <i>Dedicated Home Membership<\/i>.\nLatter-day Saints honor the home as the foundation of civilization in keeping\nwith two great scriptural declarations:\n<\/p><p>\nLo, children are an heritage of the Lord . . .<br \/>\nAs arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.<br \/>\nHappy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but\nthey shall speak with the enemies in the gate\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41804\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41804)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41804)\">Ps. 127:3-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then that wonderful declaration to Latter-day Saint parents everywhere&mdash;Doctrine and\nCovenants 68:25 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13556\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13556)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13556)\">D&amp;C 68:25<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;on\nour responsibility in the training of children, coupled with the\nwonderful suggestions offered in this conference; we bid parents accept their full\nresponsibility to the spirits that have been entrusted to their keeping here in mortality.\n<\/p><p>\nItem 22. <i>The Anchor of Testimony<\/i>. The strength of the Church inheres in a mingling of two\ninfluences: revelation from God on high and individual testimonies in the hearts of men and\nwomen. Testimony is the stability of those people.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd finally, item 23. <i>The Assurance of Eternal Life and Exaltation<\/i>. Through keeping the faith\nand through keeping the commandments of God, confidence is born in the reality of a literal\nresurrection through the atoning sacrifice of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nIn humble gratitude I give you my witness that in these twenty-three distinctive features we\nhave the completest program for life&mdash;here and hereafter&mdash;that I have been able to discover.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord inspire us to live worthy of it, I pray in his name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
