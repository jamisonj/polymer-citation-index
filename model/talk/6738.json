We need you. Like Helaman\u2019s 2,000 stripling warriors, you also are the spirit sons of God, and you too can be endowed with power to build up and defend His kingdom.

Resolve to avoid pornography as you would avoid the most insidious disease, for that is precisely what it is. Resolve to completely abstain from tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs. Resolve to be honest. Resolve to be good citizens and to abide by the laws of the land in which you live.

Some young men have the mistaken idea that they can be involved in sinful behavior and then repent when they\u2019re 18 1\/2 so they can go on their mission at 19.

We know that the most profound influence on helping young men prepare for the Melchizedek Priesthood, marriage, and fatherhood is the family. If your sons understand the basic doctrines required to become a faithful father, they will surely be ready to serve as a full-time missionary. Unfortunately, far too many fathers abdicate this eternal responsibility. You may assume that the bishop and the seminary, Sunday School, and Young Men teachers and leaders are in a better position to motivate and inspire your sons than you are. That simply is not the case. While ecclesiastical leaders are important to your son\u2019s priesthood and missionary preparation, the Church exists as a resource to you. It is not a substitute for your inspired teaching, guidance, and correction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-greatest-generation-of-missionaries.p33\" class=\"\">Consequently, if we are \u201craising the bar\u201d for your sons to serve as missionaries, that means we are also \u201craising the bar\u201d for you. If we expect more of them, that means we expect more of you and your wife as well. Remember, Helaman\u2019s 2,000 stripling warriors were faithful because \u201cthey had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8758\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8758)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8758)\">Alma 53:21<\/a><\/span>)\u2014and that instruction came in their homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-greatest-generation-of-missionaries.p34\" class=\"\">Some fathers don\u2019t think they have the right to ask worthiness questions of their children. They think that is the purview of the bishop alone. Fathers, not only do you have the right to know the worthiness of your children, you have the responsibility. It is your duty to know how your children are doing with regards to their spiritual well-being and progression. You need to monitor carefully the issues and concerns they share with you. Ask specific questions of your children regarding their worthiness, and refuse to settle for anything less than specific answers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-greatest-generation-of-missionaries.p35\" class=\"\">Too often our bishops have to instruct youth to talk to their parents about problems they are having. That procedure should actually flow the other direction. Parents should be so intimately aware of what is going on in their children\u2019s lives that they know about the problems before the bishop does. They should be counseling with their children and going with them to their bishops if that becomes necessary for complete repentance. As divinely appointed judges in Israel, the bishop and the stake president determine worthiness and resolve concerns on behalf of the Church; but, fathers, you have an eternal responsibility for the spiritual welfare of your children. Please assume your rightful place as counselor, adviser, and priesthood leader in preparing your sons to bear the Melchizedek Priesthood and to serve as missionaries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-greatest-generation-of-missionaries.p36\" class=\"\">Now, a word to you bishops. I realize there are many young men who don\u2019t have a faithful father in their home. In these cases, use the resources of the Church to see that these Aaronic Priesthood holders are taught by Melchizedek Priesthood brethren who can help them to prepare for their future priesthood service. Upon you bishops and you stake presidents rests the responsibility to recommend only those young men and women whom you judge to be spiritually, physically, mentally, and emotionally prepared to face today\u2019s realities of missionary work. Brethren, judge wisely and remember: not every young man needs to be called to serve away from his home; some may best serve under your direction as ward missionaries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-greatest-generation-of-missionaries.p37\" class=\"\">To those of you who are currently serving as full-time missionaries, we thank you for your service.

You spent two years as a representative of the Lord Jesus Christ. We expect you to always look and act like one of His disciples. Look the part. Act the part. Don\u2019t follow worldly trends and fashions. You are better than that. If you have slipped, then do what is necessary to regain your spiritual balance. The rules for happiness and success after your mission are pretty much the same as they were during your mission: pray hard, work hard, and be obedient. Get busy now and find your eternal companion to enjoy life with.
