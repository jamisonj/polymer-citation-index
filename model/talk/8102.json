Near the top of their laborious climb, they discovered that a protruding ledge denied them their final few feet of ascent. They could not get over it, but neither could they now retreat from it. They were stranded. After careful maneuvering, John found enough footing to boost his younger brother to safety on top of the ledge. But there was no way to lift himself. The more he strained to find finger or foot leverage, the more his muscles began to cramp. Panic started to sweep over him, and he began to fear for his life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/where-justice-love-and-mercy-meet.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">Unable to hold on much longer, John decided his only option was to try to jump vertically in an effort to grab the top of the overhanging ledge. If successful, he might, by his considerable arm strength, pull himself to safety.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/where-justice-love-and-mercy-meet.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">In his own words, he said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/where-justice-love-and-mercy-meet.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">\u201cPrior to my jump I told Jimmy to go search for a tree branch strong enough to extend down to me, although I knew there was nothing of the kind on this rocky summit. It was only a desperate ruse. If my jump failed, the least I could do was make certain my little brother did not see me falling to my death.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/where-justice-love-and-mercy-meet.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">\u201cGiving him enough time to be out of sight, I said my last prayer\u2014that I wanted my family to know I loved them and that Jimmy could make it home safely on his own\u2014then I leapt. There was enough adrenaline in my spring that the jump extended my arms above the ledge almost to my elbows. But as I slapped my hands down on the surface, I felt nothing but loose sand on flat stone. I can still remember the gritty sensation of hanging there with nothing to hold on to\u2014no lip, no ridge, nothing to grab or grasp. I felt my fingers begin to recede slowly over the sandy surface. I knew my life was over.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/where-justice-love-and-mercy-meet.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">\u201cBut then suddenly, like a lightning strike in a summer storm, two hands shot out from somewhere above the edge of the cliff, grabbing my wrists with a strength and determination that belied their size. My faithful little brother had not gone looking for any fictitious tree branch. Guessing exactly what I was planning to do, he had never moved an inch. He had simply waited\u2014silently, almost breathlessly\u2014knowing full well I would be foolish enough to try to make that jump. When I did, he grabbed me, held me, and refused to let me fall. Those strong brotherly arms saved my life that day as I dangled helplessly above what would surely have been certain death.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-12455_000_039\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Correspondence in the possession of Jeffrey\u00a0R.

Although we should <span class=\"emphasis\">always<\/span> remember (we promise in our weekly sacramental prayers that we will), nevertheless this is the most sacred day of the year for special remembrance of brotherly hands and determined arms that reached into the abyss of death to save us from our fallings and our failings, from our sorrows and our sins. Against the background of this story reported by John and Jimmy\u2019s family, I express my gratitude for the Atonement and Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ and acknowledge events in the divine plan of God that led up to and give meaning to \u201cthe love Jesus offers [us].\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-12455_000_039\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cI Stand All Amazed,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 193.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/where-justice-love-and-mercy-meet.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">In our increasingly secular society, it is as uncommon as it is unfashionable to speak of Adam and Eve or the Garden of Eden or of a \u201cfortunate fall\u201d into mortality. Nevertheless, the simple truth is that we <span class=\"emphasis\">cannot<\/span> fully comprehend the Atonement and Resurrection of Christ and we <span class=\"emphasis\">will not<\/span> adequately appreciate the unique purpose of His birth or His death\u2014in other words, there is no way to truly celebrate Christmas <span class=\"emphasis\">or<\/span> Easter\u2014without understanding that there was an actual Adam and Eve who fell from an actual Eden, with all the consequences that fall carried with it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/where-justice-love-and-mercy-meet.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">I do not know the details of what happened on this planet before that, but I do know these two were created under the divine hand of God, that for a time they lived alone in a paradisiacal setting where there was neither human death nor future family, and that through a sequence of choices they transgressed a commandment of God which required that they leave their garden setting but which allowed them to have children before facing physical death.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-12455_000_039\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130761\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130761)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130761)\">2\u00a0Nephi 2:19\u201329<\/a><\/span>, especially <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130762\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130762)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130762)\">verses 20\u201323<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130763\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130763)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130763)\">Moses 5:10\u201311<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> To add further sorrow and complexity to their circumstance, their transgression had spiritual consequences as well, cutting them off from the presence of God forever. Because we were then born into that fallen world and because we too would transgress the laws of God, we also were sentenced to the same penalties that Adam and Eve faced.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/where-justice-love-and-mercy-meet.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">What a plight! The entire human race in free fall\u2014every man, woman, and child in it physically tumbling toward permanent death, spiritually plunging toward eternal anguish. Is that what life was meant to be? Is this the grand finale of the human experience? Are we all just hanging in a cold canyon somewhere in an indifferent universe, each of us searching for a toehold, each of us seeking for something to grip\u2014with nothing but the feeling of sand sliding under our fingers, nothing to save us, nothing to hold on to, much less anything to hold on to us? Is our only purpose in life an empty existential exercise\u2014simply to leap as high as we can, hang on for our prescribed three score years and ten, then fail and fall, and keep falling forever?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/where-justice-love-and-mercy-meet.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">The answer to those questions is an unequivocal and eternal no!
