In much the same way, modern-day prophets teach us by their daily example. The simple but powerful message is \u201cCome, follow me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p4\" class=\"\">May I share with you some of the teaching moments and lessons I have learned from a modern-day prophet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p5\" class=\"\">We can learn much from the courage shown by President Kimball as he has endured his many illnesses. He is a living testimony that, by overcoming pain and adversity, we can cleanse our souls and strengthen our faith and testimony in Jesus Christ. Indeed, in terms of the trials he has had to face, he is in many ways a modern-day Job.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p6\" class=\"\">The story of Job in the Old Testament relates three of the great tests we all should be prepared to face at some period in our lives. First, temporal setbacks. Job lost all he owned. Second, physical illness that will test our faith and testimony. And third, depression. Job said, \u201cWhy died I not from the womb?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26781\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26781)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26781)\">Job 3:11<\/a><\/span>.) \u201cMy soul is weary of my life.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26782\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26782)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26782)\">Job 10:1<\/a><\/span>.)

Too often when adversity strikes, we use it as a justification to commit sin and turn away from the teachings of Jesus Christ, the prophets who lead us, and our family and friends. Job maintained his testimony and was blessed for his unwavering faith that God lived and that he would dwell in God\u2019s presence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p7\" class=\"\">President Kimball, being a righteous man like Job, has endured many trials\u2014cancer of the throat, heart surgery, boils, cranial surgery, and numerous other afflictions. President Kimball\u2019s experiences serve as an example of how we should meet similar adversity and suffering in our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p8\" class=\"\">President Kimball has not sinned or charged God foolishly. He has kept his integrity and his testimony, and sung the praises of his Lord throughout his many physical trials. We have never heard him complain about his trials. On the contrary, his challenge has been, \u201cGive me this mountain\u201d to climb. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"30100\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30100)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30100)\">Josh. 14:12<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p9\" class=\"\">The courage and faith of President Kimball to overcome adversity are an example to all of us, to testify that we, too, can meet the challenges of life. Our aches and pains are but little hurts in comparison to his. After his throat operation, President Kimball had no voice. During a testimony meeting in the temple, President David O. McKay asked him to bear his testimony. He could not speak a word. He could only utter inaudible, breathy sounds. He wrote a note to President McKay afterwards and asked, \u201cWhy would you do that to me?\u201d The President answered, \u201cSpencer, you must get your voice back, for you still have a great mission to perform.\u201d (What a moving example of the love of one prophet for another.) President Kimball was obedient. He learned how to control air in his throat and to use the scar tissue that developed in his larynx and his remaining vocal cord. He regained his voice and carried on his great work. The accomplishment of President Kimball\u2019s prophetic mission will stand equal to any in this or any other dispensation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p10\" class=\"\">President Kimball\u2019s wife, Camilla, has devotedly and lovingly followed her husband every step of the way. I remember one night in Samoa when both President and Sister Kimball had temperatures of 104 degrees. Early the next morning they were the first ones on the bus. He conducted the meetings, and they fulfilled all their busy schedule throughout the day, not just enduring, but being gracious and considerate and thinking of the needs of everyone else around them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p11\" class=\"\">When President Kimball was called to the Council of the Twelve, he accepted his call with humble tears. He wondered if he was worthy of such a great calling. After he hung up the telephone, it was Camilla who assured him, \u201cYou can do it, Spencer. You can do it.\u201d Camilla is a perfect example of being one with her companion. When asked about her health, her reply was \u201cWhen he is well, I\u2019m well.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p12\" class=\"\">President Kimball taught me a lesson during my call to become a General Authority. He asked if I would come to Salt Lake City to serve as a General Authority for the rest of my life. I was overcome with emotion. My reply: \u201cPresident Kimball, I just don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d Then he said, \u201cI only want you to say yes.\u201d The lesson was clear; there is no need for an eloquent speech to express our commitment or our love and devotion when accepting a call from the prophet. He already knows these things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p13\" class=\"\">President Kimball always reaches out with love to touch the \u201cone.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p14\" class=\"\">We were preparing for an area conference briefing, and as I entered President Kimball\u2019s office, he was seated at a typewriter, his back toward the door. He finished typing and spun around in his chair to greet me. In one hand was a thirty-two-page letter from a young man who had read his bookThe Miracle of Forgiveness and, in the other, his personally typed reply to answer the special needs of a young man who wanted and needed his help to repent. The message was a clear one to me: No matter how busy you are, never forget those who need your help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p15\" class=\"\">He bears his missionary testimony as a special witness without the fear of man. I have observed it. At the Copenhagen Denmark Area Conference held August 3\u20135, 1976, President Kimball went to see Thorvaldsen\u2019s beautiful sculpture <span class=\"emphasis\">The Christus,<\/span> the resurrected Christ, which has been reproduced, as you know, for the visitors\u2019 centers in Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and New Zealand. After a few spiritual moments admiring <span class=\"emphasis\">The Christus,<\/span> President Kimball bore his testimony to the caretaker who stood nearby. As he turned to the statue of Peter and pointed to the large set of keys in Peter\u2019s right hand, he proclaimed: \u201cThe keys of priesthood authority which Peter held as President of the Church I now hold as President of the Church in this dispensation.\u201d Then he stated to the caretaker, \u201cYou work every day with Apostles in stone, but today you are in the presence of living Apostles.\u201d He then introduced President N. Eldon Tanner, Elder Thomas S. Monson, and Elder Boyd K. Packer. He presented the caretaker with a Book of Mormon in Danish, and bore his testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The caretaker was moved to tears in acknowledgment of the Spirit he felt in the presence of a prophet and Apostles. He acknowledged to me as we left the church, \u201cToday I have been in the presence of servants of God.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p16\" class=\"\">President Kimball works with loving diligence with all of his heart, might, mind, and strength. He does not demand or expect those around him to work at his pace, but at their pace. He is a man of action, demonstrated by the simple sign on his desk that says, \u201cDo It.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p17\" class=\"\">For those who work with him, his example eliminates phrases such as \u201cI\u2019ll try\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d His example and love motivate those who follow his example to achieve higher goals and lengthen their stride toward perfection. He has that rare ability to encourage each of us to do better than our best and to keep striving until we exceed our goals.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p18\" class=\"\">During the planning and preparation for the Mexico, Central and South America area conferences in February 1977, we were scheduled to hold meetings in La Paz, Bolivia, which is twelve thousand feet above sea level. Dr. Ernest L. Wilkinson and Dr. Russell M. Nelson advised us that President Kimball should have four to six hours\u2019 rest to acclimate his heart and blood pressure to the high altitude. President Kimball is very tightly scheduled during area conferences, and this allows little time for rest. (In reality, the doctors accompanied the General Authorities so that we could keep up with President Kimball.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p19\" class=\"\">I talked with President Tanner and President Romney to seek their assistance in getting President Kimball to rest in La Paz before the start of the area conference. They only smiled and said, \u201cYou can try.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p20\" class=\"\">Detailed plans were presented to the First Presidency for area conferences in Mexico, Central and South America. I saw President Kimball make two small red check marks next to La Paz, Bolivia, where there were two meetings that he was not scheduled to attend. \u201cWhat are these meetings? Why am I not attending?\u201d he asked. There was a pause; then I replied, \u201cThat\u2019s a rest period, President Kimball.\u201d And he remarked, \u201cAre you tired, Elder Hales?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p21\" class=\"\">We arrived in La Paz, and the first meeting was a cultural event. He would not rest. My head ached; it felt as though it would explode in adjusting to the altitude, and we breathed oxygen to attempt to speed up our being acclimated to the twelve-thousand-foot altitude; but President Kimball took no oxygen. He greeted, embraced, and shook hands with two thousand Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p22\" class=\"\">After the last meeting, he invited one thousand more of his beloved Lamanites, who had come down from the Altiplano, to come shake his hand. They came and embraced him and shook his hand vigorously. He wanted to show his love for the Lamanites.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p23\" class=\"\">Dr. Wilkinson was concerned with the President\u2019s vigorous activity at twelve thousand feet and approached him. He asked President Kimball if it would be possible for him to stop soon. President Kimball said, \u201cIf you knew what I knew, you wouldn\u2019t ask me that question.\u201d President Kimball is driven by the knowledge that we are preparing for the second coming of Jesus Christ. He knows that it is his responsibility, along with those who are chosen to work with him, to take the message to all nations in their own tongue and language.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p24\" class=\"\">President Kimball told the General Authorities, \u201cI am not afraid of death.
