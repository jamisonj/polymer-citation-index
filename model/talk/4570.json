I spent an hour quietly thumbing through the pages of photographs of my associates in our graduating class of sixty years ago.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/the-empty-tomb-bore-testimony.p7\" class=\"\">All of those faces were then young and bright and full of promise. I do not know what has become of all of them, but I know what has become of many of them. We have followed a myriad of interests in pursuit of our dreams. Some perished with honor in the terrible wars that have scourged the earth during these threescore years. Most of us have married, happily I am glad to say, and have already become the forebears of three generations of posterity. I know of no divorces among that large number.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/the-empty-tomb-bore-testimony.p8\" class=\"\">Once as lively students we shouted for victory for our basketball and football teams. Now, somewhat bent, we prefer to read and ponder and reflect. Once we danced and sang with noisy delight. We now enjoy peace and quiet and a comfortable chair. These of my peers have become educators, scientists, doctors, lawyers, civil servants, and have done well in many other honorable vocations. As I thumbed through the pages of that old book, I could not think of one who had been convicted of a serious crime. I think that remarkable. All who are alive are now in their late seventies. Many are gone, and we remember them with affection and appreciation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/the-empty-tomb-bore-testimony.p9\" class=\"\">In each case their passing has brought sorrow over the separation of friends. But in every case there have also been comfort and reassurance and certainty that death, though bitter to observe, is not the end, but is, rather, only another graduation from which we go on to a better life. For all of my classmates were of my faith, who believed as I believe. Along with English and chemistry, history and math, we were taught the things of God, just as hundreds of thousands of our youth today are taught through the great programs of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/the-empty-tomb-bore-testimony.p10\" class=\"\">The other day as I stood at the bier of my classmate and reflected on the things of eternity, I had peace in my heart and gratitude.

When the last of life\u2019s breath is drawn, there is a finality comparable to no other finality. When a father and mother lay the remains of a beloved child in the cold of the grave, there is grief almost inconsolable. When a husband buries the companion of his life, there is a loneliness that is poignant and unrelieved. When a wife closes the casket on the remains of her beloved husband, there are wounds that seem never to heal. When children are bereft of parents who loved and nurtured them, there is an abject destitution comparable to none other. Life is sacred, and death is somber. Life is buoyant and hopeful. Death is solemn and dark. It is awesome in its silence and certainty. Appropriately did Sir Walter Raleigh cry out, \u201cO eloquent, just and mighty death\u201d (in Alfred Noyes, <span class=\"emphasis\">Heath Readings in the Literature of England,<\/span> 1927, p. 1132).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/the-empty-tomb-bore-testimony.p16\" class=\"\">But death is not final.
