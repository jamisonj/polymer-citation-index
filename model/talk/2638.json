Those already in the household of faith may be pardoned a tremble or two as they read the graphic description of the challenging journey facing the serious disciple\u2014whom Helaman called, \u201cthe man of Christ.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24719\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24719)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24719)\">Hel. 3:29<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-man-of-christ.p4\" class=\"\">This is a brief attempt to describe just a few of the things the men and women of Christ will feel and see in the course of that adventurous journey.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-man-of-christ.p5\" class=\"\">Regarding events in the world, \u201cthe man of Christ\u201d sees trends around him \u201cabout which it is difficult to speak, but impossible to remain silent.\u201d Because he sees with \u201can eye of faith,\u201d he knows more than he can tell; but he need not always be fully articulate, for real Christianity is contagious.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-man-of-christ.p6\" class=\"\">He believes deeply in the Beatitudes, but also in those doctrines which tell him \u201cwho\u201d Jesus is. He does not divorce the Sermon on the Mount from the sermon at Capernaum with its hard teachings which caused many to walk \u201cno more with\u201d Jesus.

The disciple worships an unchanging God, and proclaims that the good tidings are brought anew; for the gospel is not merely a gospel for one age, for one people, or for one place\u2014it is a gospel for the galaxies!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-man-of-christ.p9\" class=\"\">He sees that only the gospel can really help us avoid the painful excesses in the tug-of-war between the need for liberty and the need for order. He knows, for instance, that true law enforcement depends on the policing of one\u2019s self. If the sentry of self fails, there are simply not enough other policemen to restrain those who will not restrain themselves, and beating the system will become the system.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-man-of-christ.p10\" class=\"\">He sees that those who worship at the altar of appetite are very intense. To be fully effective against their enveloping evil, there must exist a sin-resistant strain of souls for whom narcotics, prostitution, gambling, and alcohol hold no allure, for we bind the adversary and his mortal minions only as we bind our appetites.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-man-of-christ.p11\" class=\"\">The \u201cman of Christ\u201d knows that the collapse of systems is always preceded by the collapse of individuals.

Parents, therefore, should stay at their posts. If those at the front lines are persuaded to leave their posts to help the reserves build \u201cpromising\u201d fall-back fortifications, such parents simply guarantee that both the front lines, and all other lines of defense, will be savagely overrun. Parents, like a symphony conductor, lead those who actually produce the music; we would be dismayed, however, if an anxious conductor deserted his podium in mid-passage to become a flutist.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-man-of-christ.p13\" class=\"\">He sees that those who do too much <span class=\"emphasis\">for<\/span> their children will soon find they can do nothing <span class=\"emphasis\">with<\/span> their children.
