In fact, I\u2019ve seen it so often that it merges into one image, one picture. It\u2019s of a small boy, maybe nine or ten, in shorts, barefoot, and with a torn shirt. He\u2019s on a patch of dirt, alone, and he\u2019s looking down at a white-and-black-checkered ball. He takes a step toward it, his leg swings through, and the ball shoots off, about seven feet above the ground, where it might zip past a goalie into the net\u2014except there\u2019s no goalie and no net; there\u2019s just the boy and the ball. And then he runs to the ball, puts it in place with his foot, and kicks it. And he does it over and over again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p4\" class=\"\">You don\u2019t know where he lives, but you know that he\u2019ll take the ball home with him and that more than likely he keeps it near the place he sleeps. He sees it when he gets up and when he goes to bed. He may even dream about that ball shooting toward the goal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p5\" class=\"\">You know that because you\u2019ve done something like it yourself. It may have been a basketball. I can remember looking down at the ball in my hands on one freezing winter day and seeing my bloody fingerprints on the ball. I\u2019d been outside so long that the cold had cracked the skin on my fingertips, but my mind and my eye were on the orange rim. I can still remember it, including the chipped paint on the front edge of the rim where you\u2019d lock your eye and know the ball would fall just past that spot into the dirt-stained net. I can still remember the mark on the driveway I\u2019d dribble to and know I was at the top of the key. I\u2019d spin and jump for that last second shot, with the score tied. And I\u2019d do it again and again, sometimes for hours, feeling neither time nor the cold.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p6\" class=\"\">You may have learned endurance playing a trumpet, or throwing a football, or riding a bucking horse, or drawing a picture. But you learned what we all did. Effort only \u201cnow and then\u201d didn\u2019t take you far. The dreams that turned into reality stuck with you nearly all the time. You worked at them, either in fact or in your thoughts, every day and almost every hour.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p7\" class=\"\">It shouldn\u2019t surprise us, then, that the Lord has said to you and to me, \u201cWatch over the church always, and be with and strengthen them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18774\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18774)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18774)\">D&amp;C 20:53<\/a><\/span>). God loves us, and he intends for us to become like him. He doesn\u2019t ask us now to worry about all his children in all the world, as he does. Instead, he begins with a call to watch over just a few families, just a few people. But he knows that to visit thirty minutes every month with the same lesson for every family would never produce the progress he wants for us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p8\" class=\"\">And so he commands, \u201cWatch over [them] always, and be with and strengthen them.\u201d You can\u2019t be with them twenty-four hours a day. That would be \u201calways,\u201d wouldn\u2019t it? But they can be in your heart always. If you\u2019ll think about the families you visit, those of you who are blessed to be called home teachers, you know the help they need is beyond your casual effort.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p9\" class=\"\">In my experience, I\u2019ve been assigned to watch over people who struggled with divorce, with financial ruin, with children who would not respond to all that parents had done, or with disease that would not respond to all that faith and medicine could do. I\u2019ve gone to a home where little twin girls were sent to the screen door to tell us that Mommy and Daddy were sleeping and couldn\u2019t we come another time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p10\" class=\"\">I knew in my heart that effort \u201cnow and then\u201d wasn\u2019t enough, that \u201cgoing out home teaching\u201d or even \u201cgiving a good lesson\u201d wouldn\u2019t do it. God called us to watch over and help people in all their struggles for physical and spiritual well-being. He called us to help by the Spirit. He called us to teach by the Spirit. He called us to live what we teach. He called us to bear testimony. He called us to love them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p11\" class=\"\">Now, he didn\u2019t make it that hard just to test you. He gave you so high a calling because he loves you. He wants you home again, and to get there you have to become like him. So he gives you a calling that can only be done with persistence and endurance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p12\" class=\"\">Let\u2019s talk tonight as if you and I were companions. I know we may not have gotten together often to prepare, but let\u2019s do it tonight. Let\u2019s imagine that you and I are at my house. You\u2019ve come over for a few minutes, and we\u2019re sitting at my kitchen table.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p13\" class=\"\">We won\u2019t talk about home teaching visits or lessons first. We\u2019ll talk about our families for a while. We\u2019ll find that some of them are struggling. And that will humble us, knowing that the Lord is counting on us. We might talk about what we know the bishop and the Relief Society and some neighbors are doing to help. And we might talk about some things we have done and could do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p14\" class=\"\">Then, we\u2019ll get around to talking about one family and what we might teach them. I\u2019ll push the April <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> across the table to you, opened to the First Presidency message from President Benson. You look down and see the title, \u201cSeek the Spirit of the Lord.\u201d That looks like the perfect lesson, doesn\u2019t it? There\u2019s only the mom and dad at home. They worry about her health problems, wondering if they\u2019re doing all they can and should. On top of that, they probably aren\u2019t sleeping much because of their son. He\u2019s still in the same town, but he\u2019s living with his friends. He won\u2019t be there when we call, but he\u2019ll be in their minds, and what he\u2019s doing and not doing will be tearing at their hearts. They\u2019ll be wondering what they can do for him. If people ever wanted and needed the Spirit of the Lord, these folks do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p15\" class=\"\">Let\u2019s agree that we\u2019ll both prepare the lesson. But I think they have such respect for you that you ought to take the lead. We can\u2019t do them any good unless the Holy Ghost is with us, so I guess we\u2019d better do more than prepare the lesson. We\u2019d better prepare ourselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p16\" class=\"\">First, the Holy Ghost can\u2019t be with us unless we\u2019re clean. I admire the way you try to watch what you say and do, even what you think. I guess when the Lord tells us to watch over the Church, that means watching over ourselves too. Let\u2019s read this quotation from President George Q. Cannon I keep handy. And let\u2019s agree that we\u2019ll try to follow it:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cSome people have an idea that because they have entered the waters of baptism and repented of their sins then that is an end of it. What a mistake! We need to have this spirit of repentance continually; we need to pray to God to show us our conduct every day. Every night before we retire to rest we should review the thoughts, words, and acts of the day and then repent of everything we have done that is wrong or that has grieved the Holy Spirit. Live this way every day and endeavor to progress every day\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Truth,<\/span> Jerreld L. Newquist, ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1987, p. 129).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p18\" class=\"\">Second, let\u2019s pray both for forgiveness and to get answers about what to do for the family. It would help if, when we go, we tell them that the Holy Ghost can guide them; it has already guided us to do something for them. If we pray and then feel that prompting and act on it, what we do may be more important than anything we say. Maybe our finding out how to help them will lead them to find out what more they can do for their son.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p19\" class=\"\">Let\u2019s agree that we\u2019ll include both the parents and their children in our personal prayers, and we\u2019ll plead for the Holy Ghost to help us teach. You remember the promise, \u201cAnd the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18796\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18796)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18796)\">D&amp;C 42:14<\/a><\/span>). That really fits us, doesn\u2019t it?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p20\" class=\"\">Third, we\u2019re going to be teaching a gospel principle, so we\u2019d better study and ponder the scriptures. You remember that the Lord said, \u201cTeach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18795\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18795)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18795)\">D&amp;C 42:12<\/a><\/span>). I know you\u2019ve been reading the Book of Mormon regularly. So have I. Why don\u2019t we think about our family and the gifts of the Spirit while we read? If we do, I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ll understand and feel some things that are new to us. And we\u2019ll teach and bear testimony in their home with more power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p21\" class=\"\">It won\u2019t hurt to bear testimony from our own experience that we felt the Spirit while we read the scriptures. Then they may try reading and pondering. If they do, they\u2019ll get the prompting of the Holy Ghost for themselves. And that will help them more than just feeling it when we\u2019re there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p22\" class=\"\">Then we\u2019ll have a prayer together before you leave. In the next day or two we may stop by the house to do something for the family before we get there for a lesson.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p23\" class=\"\">The night we teach them, things will seem about as they have before, with a few exceptions. An idea and a scripture will come into your mind as you teach. You\u2019ll bear testimony of the Savior with more feeling. Perhaps we will both find our hearts drawn out to the people more. And they may linger at the door a little longer than usual as we go.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p24\" class=\"\">Maybe only some of that will happen. But that won\u2019t discourage us. We thought it would take repeated, steady effort. The desire of our hearts is to help others taste the fruit of the gospel. We know it won\u2019t come quickly or easily after a single effort, for them or for us. But in that visit, or in one that will come later, you will feel a warmth in your heart and truth will come into your mind. And that will bring you joy. It may go away, but you will remember it. Then you will be able to imagine what it would be like to have the Holy Ghost for your constant companion in this life and to feel the love and approval of the Savior and your Father in Heaven for eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p25\" class=\"\">Alma knew what having that desire in our hearts and visualizing it with faith would mean to us. It would keep us going when the going was hard. Here\u2019s what he said: \u201cAnd thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cBut if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9663\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9663)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9663)\">Alma 32:40\u201341<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p27\" class=\"\">By the power of the Holy Ghost and with the eye of faith, we have glimpsed and we can look forward to the fruit of the gospel.

I can\u2019t see a goalpost or a goalie. I can\u2019t hear the roar of the crowd. But in his mind, he can.

He has trusted us as watchmen of the souls of his children. He has given us a way to look forward to the fruit of the gospel by giving us a calling that requires our whole hearts. As the boy\u2019s dreams of kicking the winning goal draw him back to persistent practice with that ball, so our vision of the fruits of the gospel will draw us back to persistent repentance and prayer and study and service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p30\" class=\"\">I pray that the Lord may say of us, as Alma said of his son Shiblon: \u201cAnd now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the end\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9684\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9684)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9684)\">Alma 38:2<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/because-of-your-steadiness.p31\" class=\"\">I bear testimony that in time and in eternity God will bless our steadiness as we invite his children to come unto Christ.
