Hinckley<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Gordon B. Hinckley, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1962, pp. 72-74<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brethren, I have been asked to give a report of progress on the organization of the\ncoordinating program.\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Lee has made reference to Paul's analogy to the Church as a body whose various\nmembers have need one for another (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"352\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 352)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(352)\">1 Cor. 12:14-27<\/a><\/span>).\nIn furtherance of that analogy the correlation committee\nand its associated subdivisions might be likened to the nervous system whose responsibility is\nto keep the various aspects of the great teaching program of the Church operating\nharmoniously together.\n<\/p><p>\nFundamental to the very program of the Church is the teaching of the gospel to the\nmembership of the Church. In fulfillment of the obligation which was laid\nupon the Church in its inception, there has developed within the Church a system of great\nteaching organizations&mdash;the priesthood quorums, both Melchizedek and Aaronic, the far-flung\nchurch school system, and the auxiliaries: the Relief Society, the Sunday School, the Primary,\nand the MIA, all of which play so important a part in the education of our people.\n<\/p><p>\nIf it were possible, I would like to place before you on a chart the organization of the\ncorrelation program, but since we have outside the Tabernacle where only our voices reach\neight to ten men for every man who is here tonight, I shall have to present the mechanics of\nthe organization verbally. (See accompanying chart.)\n<\/p><p>\nI should like you to picture in your mind's eye the First Presidency at the top of an imagined\nchart and below that the Council of the Twelve, then beneath that is a subcommittee of the\ntwelve known as the church correlation committee, comprised of four members of the Council\nof the Twelve who have been given responsibility for this work.\n<\/p><p>\nAssociated with the correlation committee is an executive secretary, Brother Antone K.\nRomney. Associated with him are three other dedicated men. They, together with the heads of\nthe various teaching organizations, constitute the body found next, below the correlation\ncommittee on the chart I am trying to describe for you. This body is known as the all-church\ncoordinating council. It is comprised of the members of the correlation committee and their\nassociates (Brother Romney, Brother Reed Bradford, Brother Vaughn Hansen, and Brother B.\nWest Belnap), the Presiding Bishop of the Church, the chancellor of the Church School\nSystem, the general superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union, the president of the\nRelief Society, the president of the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association, the\ngeneral superintendent of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association, and the\npresident of the Primary Association, together with a secretary.\n<\/p><p>\nThis group, representing the great teaching organizations of the Church, stand together as the\nall-church coordinating council to bring about the harmony of which Brother Lee spoke.\n<\/p><p>\nOperating under the direction of the all-church coordinating council are three groups or\nsubdivisions which constitute what we have come to describe as executive planning\ncommittees, one for children, one for youth, and one for adults. One of the twelve serves as\nchairman of each of these committees, with a secretary in each&mdash;Brother Belnap for the\nchildren's committee, Brother Hansen for the youth group, and Brother Bradford for the adult\ncommittee. Associated on each of these committees are men and women of great ability,\nextensive experience in the Church, and proven devotion, who constitute respectively,\nplanning organization for children, for youth, and for adults.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, working with each of these executive planning committees are three other groups, one\ntied to each of the three. These are task committees, chosen from over the Church because of\ntheir experience, their devotion, and their ability. It is their assignment, and I think the word\n<i>task<\/i> fits the assignment, to review carefully the entire curriculum of the Church, past and\npresent, to become acquainted with all courses of study and activity programs used now and\nused in the past. This is a tremendous undertaking. This study will become the foundation\nupon which will be built a program of coordinated study and activity for the entire Church in\nall the world, including all age groups.\n<\/p><p>\nI hope I have made reasonably clear the mechanics of the all-church coordinating program\ndesigned to further harmony and orderly sequence in the teachings and activities of the\norganizations of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, let me quickly review it as we proceed from the top&mdash;the First Presidency, the Council\nof the Twelve, the correlation committee, the all-church coordinating council, three executive\nplanning committees each with a task committee of curriculum study, whose responsibility it\nis to dig and study and conduct research, out of which will come coordinated courses of study\nand programs of activities that will build testimony in the hearts of the\nLatter-day Saints from the day they are old enough to attend classes.\n<\/p><p>\nI desire in conclusion to say a word of appreciation for the magnificent service of those who\nhave been called to serve on the various committees. Many have been released from positions\nof great priesthood responsibility including those of stake president and bishop; men and\nwomen have been released from general boards to work quietly in the background to bring\nabout this great work of correlation which shall bless the lives of the Latter-day Saints\nthroughout the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless them in their labors and bless us with a sense of appreciation for their devotion, I\nask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
