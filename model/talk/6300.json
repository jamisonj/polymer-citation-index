His birth, as it has been popularly determined, marks the center point of the ages, the meridian of time recognized throughout the earth. As we use these dates we pay no attention to it. But if we pause to think, we must recognize that He is the one sublime figure in all the history of the world on which our measurement of time is based.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/at-the-summit-of-the-ages.p7\" class=\"\">In the centuries before He came to earth there was prophecy of His coming.

Its earlier centuries were a continuation of the former. It was a time fraught with fear and suffering. The great and deadly plague of the 14th century began in Asia. It spread to Europe and on up to England. Everywhere it went there was sudden death. Boccaccio said of its victims, \u201cAt noon [they] dined with their relatives and friends, and at night they supped with their ancestors in the next world!\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-99911_000_029\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">The Decameron of Giovanni Boccaccio,<\/span> trans.

These were men of great courage, some of whom suffered cruel deaths because of their beliefs. Protestantism was born with its cry for reformation. When that reformation was not realized, the reformers organized churches of their own. They did so without priesthood authority. Their one desire was to find a niche in which they might worship God as they felt He should be worshiped.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/at-the-summit-of-the-ages.p25\" class=\"\">While this great ferment was stirring across the Christian world, political forces were also at work. Then came the American Revolutionary War, resulting in the birth of a nation whose constitution declared that government should not reach its grasping hand into matters of religion. A new day had dawned, a glorious day. Here there was no longer a state church. No one faith was favored above another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/at-the-summit-of-the-ages.p26\" class=\"\">After centuries of darkness and pain and struggle, the time was ripe for the restoration of the gospel.
