I have sought humbly for his help, and I\nbelieve he will give me his Spirit.  If he gives you his Spirit, too, these few minutes will be\nworth your while and mine, and be to the glory of God.\n<\/p><p>\nI thought at first I would bore you with a written speech, but I believe I can do it without\none.  Moreover, as I give you the message I have for you, I want to look you straight in the\neye.\n<\/p><p>\nMy office is that of special witness \n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13408\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13408)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13408)\">D&amp;C 107:23<\/a><\/span>)\nof the Redeemer and of gospel.  I desire to have the spirit\nof that office and to testify to you of some eternal truths which are worthwhile to my\nbrethren and sisters in the Church who have fervent testimonies, to members of my own\nfamily, whom I love, to every one of you who is looking in on this conference from the\noutside, to every soul who hears my voice, and to all the ends of the earth.  What I have to\nsay I did not learn through my five senses. I have learned a lot about the truth through my\nnatural senses, the concepts I have came from what I have heard and read, but the truths to\nwhich I testify I have learned through revelation.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, do not misunderstand, I do not propose to give a startling account of an open vision.  I\nhave not seen one. Neither have I heard an audible voice. Revelation comes through three or\nfour channels.  One is the open vision; another is the audible voice; another is the witness of\nthe Spirit.  Enos spoke of this method&mdash;the witness of the Spirit&mdash;when he said that he\nheard the voice of God say unto him, \". . . thy sins are forgiven thee\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21479\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21479)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21479)\">Enos 1:5<\/a><\/span>). And then a\nlittle later, after he had prayed for his brethren, the Nephites, he said,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . the voice of the lord came into my mind again, saying: I will visit thy brethren\naccording to their diligence in keeping my commandments\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21480\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21480)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21480)\">Enos 1:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nRecently I heard a famous character say, \"What the world needs today is a prophet.\" That was\na wise statement, but it is not exactly correct.  The things the peoples of the world need today\nare ears to hear the living prophet, because we already have one.  He has been sent by\nAlmighty God, not only to the members of the Church, but also to you other good people\nwho are seeing and hearing this service by television and hearing it over the radio.  Most of\nthe last three quarters of an hour that prophet has been standing before you, if you have been\nwhere you could see into this session.  If you have not seen him, you have heard his voice. \nPresident David O. McKay is a prophet of the Living God.  If you are the type of person who\nwould have believed that Moses was a prophet, had you lived in his day, you know that President\nMcKay is a prophet.  If you would have accepted Elijah or even the Son of Man, you will\naccept President David O. McKay as a prophet of the Living God.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are other prophets who will talk to you during this conference.  Two I will mention,\nthe men who stand with President David O. McKay.  As James and John stood beside Peter\nafter the passing of the Redeemer, so President Stephen L Richards and President J. Reuben\nClark, Jr., stand with President McKay.  The three of them are prophets as much as any men\nwho ever lived upon the earth have been prophets.  I plead with you to hear their voices.\n<\/p><p>\nThere will be other men speak to you in the sessions of this conference who have been called\nwith the same calling as the Twelve Apostles in the days of the Savior.  These men will speak\nwords of eternal life (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27639\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27639)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27639)\">John 6:68<\/a><\/span>).\nThey will bear record of the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ which\nyou will need to accept and live by if you are to be true followers of Christ.  These men will\npreach and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ as he himself defined it.\n<\/p><p>\nThat there may be no misunderstanding as to what that gospel is, I want to read two or three\nverses from the statement of the Savior.  After he had told his disciples that if the Church was\nbuilt upon his gospel his Father would show forth his own works in it, but that if it was not\nbuilt upon his gospel, but upon the works of men or upon the works of the devil, they would\nhave joy in their works for a season, but by and by the end would come when they would be\nthrown down and cast into the fire, he said: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . this is the gospel which I have given unto you&mdash;that I came into the world to do\nthe will of my Father, because my Father sent me.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had\nbeen lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been\nlifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me to\nbe judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nAnd for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the\nFather I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5556\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5556)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5556)\">3 Ne. 27:13-15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then he added: \n<\/p><p>\nNow this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me\nand be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy\nGhost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.\n<\/p><p>\nVerily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel . . .\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5559\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5559)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5559)\">3 Ne. 27:20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn this short statement the Master named four eternal verities upon which all else in his gospel\nis founded: first, the relationship between himself and his Father; second, the fact of his\natonement; third, the universal resurrection; and fourth, the judgment.\n<\/p><p>\nAs to the relationship between himself and his Father, he said: \"I came into the world to do\nthe will of my father; because my father sent me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5555\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5555)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5555)\">3 Ne. 27:13<\/a><\/span>).\nThis verity, so simply put, is the\ncornerstone of his gospel.  A Christian brotherhood can no more be built without the\nacceptance of the fact that Jesus is the Son of God than the superstructure of this great\nbuilding can be supported without its foundation. The very burden of the Master's message\nduring all his life was that he is the Son of God, The Father himself, who seldom speaks on\nany other question, time after time bore witness that Jesus is his Son.  That fact is an essential\npart of the message of the restoration.\n<\/p><p>\nThat the atonement was a fact is as essential to the gospel of Jesus Christ as is the Sonship of\nJesus. We have the sacrament to remind us every week or his atonement.  The only purpose,\nor at least the main purpose, for which Jesus came into the world was to make the atonement.\nOthers could have been sent to preach the gospel.  As a matter of fact, others have been sent\nin every other dispensation&mdash;Abraham, Enoch, Moses, for example, and in this dispensation\nthe Prophet Joseph Smith. These great prophets taught the gospel of Jesus Christ as plainly as\ndid Jesus himself. But in the Meridian of Time Jesus came. He came not only to teach the\ngospel, but also to be the Redeemer of the world. He was the only one who qualified to be\nthe Redeemer, first, because he and he alone had life within himself&mdash;eternal life, which he\ninherited from his divine Father. He was the only one who ever lived a sinless life upon the\nearth, and he alone was foreordained to be the Redeemer.\n<\/p><p>\nThe resurrection is inherent in the atonement.  Jesus said he came to do the will of his Father,\nand that the will of his Father was that he should be lifted up upon the cross.  He further said\nthat the purpose for which he was to be lifted up upon the cross was that he might draw all\nmen to him.  That he does through the resurrection.\n<\/p><p>\nThe purpose for which men are to come before him after the resurrection is that they may be\njudged of the works which they have done in the flesh.\n<\/p><p>\nThese are the fundamentals of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as he put them in his own language. \nHaving stated them, he followed with the commandment,\n<\/p><p>\nRepent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that\nye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5558\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5558)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5558)\">3 Ne. 27:20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, all men who believe in Jesus and want to be his followers will have to accept those four\nverities.  They will also have to obey the commandment. When the commandment is obeyed,\nthey will receive the witness of the Holy Ghost.  Surely they will receive it.  It comes to\nevery man who will live for it.  As an example, I read to you a few lines from the testimony\nof a missionary in the field.  Six months ago today, he sat here in this building on his way to\nthe mission field.  After being in a foreign land for five months, learning a foreign language,\nhe wrote this to his parents: \n<\/p><p>\nWhen I first came over here and started in this missionary work, I did not know if I\nwas going to be able to last it out. It was really hard on me to go out from door to\ndoor and have the people laugh at me and not listen to me.  And for a while there I\nreally wondered if I did have a testimony of the gospel.  I knew that if I did not have\na very strong one that I would not be able to stick it out.  The devil was really\nworking on me, too, because I had a feeling of unrest and uncontentedness, and I did\nnot have the desire to go out and give the message to the people.\n<\/p><p>\nBut today there is nothing I would rather do.  The Lord has blessed me with a very\nstrong testimony of the gospel.  I know without any doubt that Jesus is the Christ, the\nSon of God, and that God lives and he has a body of flesh and bones.  I know that\nJoseph Smith, Jr. was and is a prophet of God, that he restored the gospel here on the\nearth in these latter days.  I know that the leaders of the Church today are prophets,\nseers, and revelators, and there is nothing I would rather do than tell these people we\ncome in contact with that I know that these things are true . . .\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that I may be a worthy representative of my family and my Church and the\nLord, and I bear you this testimony through the gift of the Holy Ghost and in the name\nof Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, there is a twenty-year-old lad who has that witness.  He knows, because he has been\ntouched through the sixth sense, if you will, the witness of the Spirit, that these eternal\nverities are true.\n<\/p><p>\nOh, my beloved brothers and sisters, my good friends whom I have never seen and who have\nnever seen me, I bear witness to you that there is revelation in this day, that there is a power\nfrom God which wants to come into our hearts and bring us peace, that peace which will be\nconducive to the peace of the world, of which our great living prophet spoke this morning.  I\nbear this witness to you in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
