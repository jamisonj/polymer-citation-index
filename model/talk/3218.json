You will recall that Parley P. Pratt, one of the Twelve sent to Great Britain by the Prophet Joseph Smith to assist in opening the work abroad, composed those words.

Tens of thousands are accepting the gospel of salvation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p9\" class=\"\">A few months ago we drove along the coast of Chile with President Lester Haymore\u2014then president of the Chile Osorno Mission\u2014and Sister Haymore. As we visited cities and drove from village to village, we saw the fruits of our missionary proselyting efforts. We met with many new members, and we were deeply impressed with their faith and humble desire to learn more about the gospel they have accepted. As we continued the journey, our concern centered on ways we could help prevent this growing number of new members from feeling like strangers or foreigners, and help them become fellow citizens with the Saints. How can we help in strengthening their faith so that they can hold on to the iron rod and continue to grow in knowledge?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p10\" class=\"\">We reflected on the many priesthood, Relief Society, and Sunday School classes where husbands and wives who have been trained in the gospel\u2014many with unusual talents\u2014were not now being fully used. Some stakes are crowded with mature couples fully prepared to accept a mission call, who could not only enthusiastically help in spreading the gospel but strengthen new members in areas of the world where we are growing so rapidly. The thousands of newly baptized members now in the Church, with its somewhat strange, unfamiliar ways, could be encouraged and trained by someone who today is sitting comfortably at home. We thought, if we could only transplant hundreds of our faithful, well-prepared couples out into one of the greatest chapters of their lives!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p11\" class=\"\">Amulek taught: \u201cAnd he shall come into the world to redeem his people\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9300\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9300)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9300)\">Alma 11:40<\/a><\/span>).

However, a new social pattern is emerging. The number of men and women retiring from active employment or from professions is continually increasing, at what President Kimball or Elder LeGrand Richards would consider a very early age.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p13\" class=\"\">Recently in the mail was a query from friends in California, now retiring from schoolteaching, who indicated a desire to return to Utah and who asked, \u201cWhat can we do for the Church when we return?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p14\" class=\"\">My answer was, \u201cDon\u2019t come to Utah. Your church experience is needed out in the world. Brush up on your Norwegian that you learned as a missionary years ago.\u201d I understand they will soon be on their way. He is thrilled with this opportunity to serve a second mission, and this time he will have an added blessing of keeping the same companion for his entire mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p15\" class=\"\">Many couples are prepared and waiting for the bishop to extend a mission call. Perhaps the bishop, busy with other duties, has overlooked them. Couples who have a desire to serve the Lord need not wait for the bishop, but should knock on his door and say, \u201cWe feel we are ready to go.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p16\" class=\"\">Recently in Mexico I had the opportunity of meeting a wonderful, mature missionary couple, Brother and Sister John Fossum, who commented, \u201cOur greatest need is for trained leadership. Married couples with years of experience in church work could literally work miracles. We have twenty-two scattered branches without, as yet, an organization to train the branch leaders. We are so new and growing so rapidly, and leaders with experience are not available.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p17\" class=\"\">The Fossums continued, \u201cMany blessings have come to us as a result of our mission\u2014blessings we always receive from the Lord whenever we serve without restraint.\u201d They added, \u201cPeople shrivel up and die in beds and rocking chairs. We didn\u2019t want that kind of retirement; the Lord knew we wanted to go on a mission, and we received the call.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p18\" class=\"\">Some couples, they continued, \u201cimagine they can\u2019t live without their families close by, and some fear for their own physical well-being. It was reassuring when our stake president set us apart, and he promised us that the Lord would look after our family and that we would have good health to the end of our mission.\u201d They continued, \u201cAt our age it is difficult to live up to missionary schedules, but we have found it is possible, and it has its rewards.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p19\" class=\"\">And then Brother Fossum said, \u201cFifty years ago I served a mission in Hawaii and learned to speak Hawaiian. It was difficult then, and it was difficult at our age to go through the Missionary Training Center and learn Spanish; but we did it and it has been a great learning experience. The spiritual treasures alone are worth the effort.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p20\" class=\"\">Sister Fossum said, \u201cIt\u2019s really hard on grandmas to be away from twenty-six grandchildren, but I\u2019m coming through with flying colors\u2014sometimes at half-mast, but they are flying!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p21\" class=\"\">This dedicated couple concluded: \u201cA mission for those of mature years is a rich, rewarding experience. It\u2019s for those who want to <span class=\"emphasis\">live out<\/span> their retirement and not just <span class=\"emphasis\">exist.<\/span>\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p22\" class=\"\">Now we need more\u2014many more\u2014couples like the Fossums who are willing, wondering and asking, \u201cWhat can I do for the Lord?\u201d and willing to use part of their golden years in this vital service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p23\" class=\"\">In the early days of the Church, the Lord\u2019s work urgently required sacrifice and the best efforts of the Saints. A company of brethren commanded to leave their families and go to Missouri in 1831 were admonished:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work.

Prepare for what may be the most rewarding experience of your life. Why not begin now to expand your horizons; plan to increase your knowledge and learn another language. You can start with Spanish or German. President Kimball is suggesting Mandarin Chinese.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p27\" class=\"\">My wife, Ruby, after a fifty-year lapse, is back at the university taking Spanish 101. Hard work? Of course! Long hours of study to keep up? Many! Who does the cooking? Sometimes I do. Rewarding? I\u2019m so proud of her when she bears a humble testimony that our members in Argentina or Mexico can understand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p28\" class=\"\">We are witnessing a continuing unfolding of the Lord\u2019s work in this, the last dispensation. Millions are waiting and want to improve their lives. President Kimball is asking for more mature couples. They are needed everywhere, particularly experienced members with family ties to other lands. A spiritual rebirth can be yours as you serve the Lord in total service. Prayer will have a deeper dimension, and the scriptures will be pondered and more deeply appreciated. The Holy Ghost will become more evident; your capacity to love will increase; your families at home will be blessed, and they will be proud of your selfless service to the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p29\" class=\"\">Moroni, the Book of Mormon prophet, taught of the careful attention given to the newly baptized then:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were <span class=\"emphasis\">numbered among the people<\/span> of the church of Christ; and <span class=\"emphasis\">their names were taken,<\/span> that <span class=\"emphasis\">they might be remembered<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">nourished<\/span> by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually watchful unto prayer\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38431\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38431)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38431)\">Moro. 6:4<\/a><\/span>; italics added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p31\" class=\"\">In many areas of the world we have converts that need to be remembered with care and love and encouraged and kept in the right way, as Moroni stated. But the couples with the experience who could assist are usually living elsewhere. We need the help of seasoned Church members who can provide the training, encouragement, and, above all, the compassionate concern.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p32\" class=\"\">To show what can be accomplished with such love and dedication, let me share with you again the words of the Fossums. They said, \u201cTo visit one of our branches we get up at 4:00 <span class=\"small\">A.M.<\/span> on Sunday to catch an early bus. Sister Fossum started a little music class with the sisters during the priesthood hour. She taught the basics of directing music and discovered a thirteen-year-old girl with a perfect sense of time, who now leads the singing in sacrament meeting. Now that branch has a chorister.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p33\" class=\"\">Brother Fossum said, \u201cI was invited to attend their branch presidency meeting to show how we do some things. A few months ago in this same branch, home teaching and visiting teaching were just words in a book. But now nine pairs of home teachers are making their visits, and they will soon have visiting teaching underway. These are incidental rewards. The great rewards come with the service we give and the love we feel for the humble new members that result in a change in their lives for the better\u2014then we, too, are enriched.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p34\" class=\"\">We appeal this day to you who have been prepared line upon line and precept upon precept\u2014to go forth into the world. Put your hand to the plow. Bless new members with your love and your faith, helping them to keep in the right way and teaching them to be watchful and prayerful and reliant upon Christ, the author of our faith.
