If I were to ask you what the Church teaches about strengthening families, I know that you would say things like \u201cspend time together, have family prayer, hold family home evening, and regular scripture study.\u201d In addition to these important things, I want to talk about building stronger families by building a stronger you\u2014strong in your faith of the Savior. <span class=\"emphasis\">That\u2019s<\/span> where strong families come from\u2014from strong individuals.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p6\" class=\"\">President Gordon B.

These are all facilities, desirable means to an end, but only auxiliary to that which is the true strength. The strength of this Church lies in the hearts of its people, in the individual testimony and conviction of the truth of this work.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-93911_000_037\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> July 1993, pp. 4\u20135.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p8\" class=\"\">All of us women have an image of the ideal family\u2014a marriage in the temple to an active priesthood holder, and children who are obedient and faithful.

Russell Ballard has already reminded us, there is great diversity in LDS homes. But all of these homes can be righteous homes where individuals love each other, love the Lord, and strengthen each other.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p10\" class=\"\">Let me give you an example. Here are two quilts. Both are handmade, beautiful, and delightful to snuggle down in or wrap around a grandchild. Now look at this quilt. It\u2019s a Hawaiian quilt with a strong, predictable pattern. We can look at half of the quilt and predict what the other half looks like. Sometimes our lives seem patterned, predictable in happy ways, in order.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p11\" class=\"\">Now look at this second quilt. This style is called a crazy quilt. Some pieces are the same color, but no two pieces are the same size. They\u2019re odd shapes. They come together at odd angles. This is an unpredictable quilt. Sometimes our lives are unpredictable, unpatterned, not neat or well-ordered.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p12\" class=\"\">Well, there\u2019s not one right way to be a quilt as long as the pieces are stitched together firmly. Both of these quilts will keep us warm and cozy. Both are beautiful and made with love. There\u2019s not just one right way to be a Mormon woman, either, as long as we are firmly grounded in faith in the Savior, make and keep covenants, live the commandments, and work together in charity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p13\" class=\"\">All of us face different family circumstances and home situations. All of us need strength in dealing with them. This strength comes from faith in the Savior\u2019s love and in the power of his atonement. If we trustingly put our hand in the Savior\u2019s, we can claim the promise of the sacramental prayer to always have his Spirit with us. All problems are manageable with that strength, and all other problems are secondary in urgency to maintaining a strong spiritual life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p14\" class=\"\">If we have faith, we will desire to pray often and sincerely, and his Spirit will teach us what to pray for (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"42966\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42966)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42966)\">Rom. 8:26\u201327<\/a><\/span>). We will have the sensitivity to serve compassionately. We will have the wisdom that we need for our Church callings. We can build a loving and respectful partnership with our husbands, children, parents, and friends. If we always have Christ\u2019s Spirit with us, we will have a wise consultant when we are perplexed by our children\u2019s needs. We will receive help in making correct decisions and strength in carrying them out. We will give and receive loyal friendship, and feel in ourselves when the advice we receive from others is truly suited to our needs. We will hold a clear vision of gospel ideals and aspire toward them even as we deal patiently with the limitations of reality. Through faith in the Savior, we can magnify our opportunities, cope with our problems, and keep both of them in perspective.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p15\" class=\"\">Strong families build strong individuals who, in turn, strengthen other family members. We take turns in lifting each other. I have seen this process at work in my own life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p16\" class=\"\">When my husband and I married, I was a Latter-day Saint and he was a Congregationalist. I was concerned about marrying a nonmember, but we shared a strong faith in the Savior, and I felt that Ed would continue to seek and accept truth. Ten months after our marriage, he was baptized. We were the only Latter-day Saints in our families, but we could strengthen each other.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p17\" class=\"\">When Ed was ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood, the concept of priesthood was a thrilling and exciting one for each of us. He was the first priesthood holder in the Okazaki family, and I, of course, had no relatives who were priesthood holders. Priesthood was something we talked about and worked to understand together. How grateful I was for Ed\u2019s goodness and the many opportunities that the Church gave him to bless others. Ed never took his priesthood for granted. It was always a privilege to him, one exercised with thanksgiving and humility. Supporting Ed in his callings and feeling his support for me in mine were part of the partnership of our marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p18\" class=\"\">In 1988, we were asked to an interview with the Missionary Committee. We suspected that a calling might be in the offing, so Ed, who had had a stroke about two years earlier that affected his heart, went to the doctor first so that he would know if he could accept an assignment. The doctor was absolutely firm that Ed must not leave the country. Thus, when Ed was asked if he could accept an overseas assignment, he was very disappointed to report the doctor\u2019s instructions. I would have supported Ed wholeheartedly in his calling, but it was not to be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p19\" class=\"\">Then, a few weeks later, I was called to serve on the Primary General Board, and a year and a half later, I was called to my present position in the Relief Society.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p20\" class=\"\">When I was being set apart, President Thomas S. Monson, who had known us for years, said, \u201cEddie, Chieko has supported you in your priesthood callings\u2014in the bishopric, as mission president, and as Regional Representative. Now it\u2019s your turn to support her.\u201d Ed smiled and agreed to do so. Of course, this was not a change for Ed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p21\" class=\"\">Ed and I loved growing in the gospel as a family. We were grateful we had the strength to care for our sons and grateful to see them grow up to become self-reliant people with the strength to help others. We rejoiced in the strength that an intelligent and sensitive daughter-in-law brought to our family. We delighted in seeing our grandsons born and begin to follow the cycle of family life themselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p22\" class=\"\">I never appreciated the strength of my sons more than last year, when my husband was dying. All three of us sustained each other and consulted with each other, but I saw Ken take the lead in working with the doctors and the hospital. Then when Ed died, Bob took the lead in making funeral arrangements and dealing with the legal procedures that had to be followed. In planning the funeral service, I took the lead. As each of us passed through different stages in our shock and grief, we had the others for support. When one of us needed to rise to an occasion, we could. When we needed to withdraw with our sorrow, we could because one of the others could step forward and be the leader.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p23\" class=\"\">I have used the example of my own family, because I have seen for myself that it is to our families that we first turn in such crises. But whatever your family circumstances, I believe the strength we need can always be there because it comes from the Savior and his love. Sometimes our own faith enables us to draw on that love. Sometimes it is the faith and love of others that strengthen us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/strength-in-the-savior.p24\" class=\"\">We do not know the challenges and adversities that life will give us.
