Wirthlin<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Presiding Bishop of the Church<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Joseph L. Wirthlin, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1959, pp. 65-68<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brethren and sisters, it has been a great source of inspiration to have the privilege of\nattending this wonderful conference. As I listened yesterday to our prophet, I felt that we\nwere receiving the same direction, the same inspiration, the same guidance, as did the\nmembers of the Church two thousand years ago when Peter and the apostles stood before\nthem periodically and taught them the gospel. Yesterday we had that Spirit here. We have had\nit today. It is the Spirit of the Lord. Each and every one of us can feel it as we listen to what\nis said by our Brethren.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a marvelous thing to belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and know\nthat there stands at the head, a prophet who receives from on high the guidance and the\ndirection that is necessary for the sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father, not only those\nhere, but those all over the world. Our President in the years gone by has traveled to many\nlands for the purpose of preaching to the people that they can understand the gospel of the\nLord Jesus Christ and have the privilege of living it and enjoying all the blessings therein.\n<\/p><p>\nI often think that I happen to be a member of the Church, not because I accepted it, but\nbecause I was born in the Church, and I assume most of you who are present this afternoon\nhave membership in the Church because you were born in it. On the other hand, we have\nquite a number of our brethren and sisters who are converts, those who had the privilege of\nreceiving the gospel from the missionaries in various parts of the country. You and I who\nwere born in the Church have received it, brethren and sisters, without any great demands on\nour part, except that we live the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and set the proper example to\nthose not of our faith.\n<\/p><p>\nI often think of my two grandfathers&mdash;one was born in England and the other was born in\nSwitzerland. The one in England at the age of twenty-one was very anxious to find the\nChurch of the Lord Jesus Christ. Yes, he belonged to another church, a great church, but he\nwas not satisfied. He could not understand the matter of baptism. He could not understand the\nmatter of authority. He could not find it.\n<\/p><p>\nOne Saturday evening on retiring to his bed, he made it a matter of prayer. He asked the Lord\nif the Church of Jesus Christ was upon the earth could he be directed to it. That night he had\na dream, and in the dream he saw not too far from where he lived a road, and at the end of it\nwas a little chapel. When he arose Sunday morning, he was so impressed with the dream he\nimmediately dressed and went down the road, and there was the little chapel. In it two men\nwere preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and who were they&mdash;two Mormon\nmissionaries! My grandfather immediately joined the Church. There was no question about it\nin his mind.\n<\/p><p>\nI am positively sure that over the world where individuals have a desire to find the true\nChurch, they can find it. They may find it in the way of a dream, or they may find it by the\nmissionaries who may come to their homes and teach them the gospel of the Lord Jesus\nChrist.\n<\/p><p>\nMy grandfather finally made the long trip to America and came into this area with his family\nof ten children of which my mother was the youngest. It was a difficult thing to find the right\nkind of work. He worked in a coal mine, an experience he had never had. He labored there\nfor some six months, then came to Salt Lake City to get his pay. He was paid for three\nmonths. He quit his job and finally settled on a little farm near Tooele, Utah, but there was\nno water and that created a problem. As I have read his history he had written day by day,\nthere was difficulty on every hand, but not once did I ever find my grandfather finding fault\nor condemning the Church. When general conference was held comparable to this one, he\nused to hitch up his old team, and it was an old team, and drive into Salt Lake City, and here\nhe remained for four days and attended all of the meetings. It is marvelous to read of the\ngreat inspiration he received hearing the Prophet Brigham Young at that time.\nWhen he attended conference, they were the best four days of the whole year, hearing the\ngospel of the Lord Jesus Christ taught by the prophet. Brigham Young was a prophet to him,\nand is it not a wonderful thing to know, brethren and sisters, that from the days of the\nProphet Joseph Smith until the present time, we have a prophet, seer, and revelator, so that\nthrough the direction of our Heavenly Father we will be guided and directed wherein we will\nreceive the blessings that we need.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Clark told of conditions that might exist in the world because there is a great nation\nand a government which does not teach or permit its people to believe that Jesus Christ\nactually lives and is the Son of God. As President Clark said, some day that may create\ndifficulties for us. Nevertheless, I hope and pray that each and every one of us will so live the\ngospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that when that day of difficulty comes, we through prayer,\nfaith, and divine direction from our Heavenly Father will be able to meet our problems and\nsolve them.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have a great responsibility of living the gospel because the world expects us to be a\ndifferent people, which brings to mind the statement of an individual who had the privilege of\nvisiting the Los Angeles Temple before it was dedicated. This individual said, \"The temple is\nbeautiful. It is a marvelous building, but the Mormons have something that is different.\" I do\nnot know exactly what that individual had in mind, whether she thought the temple in and of\nitself was beautiful or something that was different, whether she thought we have the\npriesthood of the Lord Jesus Christ, or whether or not she was giving consideration to the fact\nthat we are doing work for the dead. Nevertheless, an impression was made upon that\nindividual. So, in all of our lives, wherever we go, we are going to make an impression on\nthose with whom we come in contact. As a people, we are indeed a \"different\" people.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a wonderful thing to know that in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\nbrethren and sisters, the choice young men at the age of twelve may receive the Aaronic\nPriesthood&mdash;the Aaronic Priesthood, a divine gift which was bestowed upon the Prophet\nJoseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery by John the Baptist himself. I humbly pray that in your\nhomes where your sons hold the office of deacon, teacher, or priest, there is going to be\npositive assurance that these young men realize that they have the most divine gift of God to\nhis sons.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we have any difficulty at all in connection with the Aaronic Priesthood, where some of\nthem may become inactive and not as interested as they should be, I think it comes about\nmany times because fathers and mothers are not giving consideration to the fact that their sons\nhold the Aaronic Priesthood, the priesthood that was held by John the Baptist.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a wonderful thing to sit down with your son&mdash;he may be a deacon, a teacher, or a \npriest&mdash;and say to him, \"You hold the Aaronic Priesthood. John the Baptist held the Aaronic\nPriesthood. He was a priest. He baptized Jesus Christ.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIs it not wonderful to know that your son at the age of sixteen may have the same privilege\nof baptizing as did John the Baptist about two thousand years ago. It is so impressive,\nbrothers and sisters, that these young men will come to the conclusion that holding the\nAaronic Priesthood is the most important gift that God can bestow upon them at their\nparticular age. So teach them, inspire them, and direct them in connection with their\nassignments in the Aaronic Priesthood work, that when the day comes for them to receive the\nMelchizedek Priesthood, they are going to feel in their own souls, \"Now I hold the priesthood\nof the Lord Jesus Christ,\" for the Christ himself is the Great High Priest, and everyone of\nthese young men, if worthy, sooner or later is going to have the privilege of holding the\noffice of an elder or a seventy or a high priest.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is most inspiring and encouraging to me as I have the privilege of coming in contact with\nthese young men who have a desire to go out and preach the gospel, as they may have been\ncalled by the President of the Church in connection with the bishop of the ward. In\ninterviewing them, I always ask them the question, \"Can you bear testimony that Joseph\nSmith actually saw the Father and the Son? That is the statement you will have to make\nbecause we stand on that wonderful event as a Church, that Joseph Smith at\nthe age of fourteen actually saw the Father and the Son.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt is most thrilling and inspiring to know that these young men at the age of twenty can say,\n\"Yes, I can bear testimony that Joseph Smith actually saw the Father and the Son.\" They\nshould be able to do that, brothers and sisters, because they have held the Aaronic Priesthood\nfrom the age of twelve until the age of twenty when they receive the Melchizedek Priesthood.\nThey should have been taught and should have the knowledge that they can bear these\nwonderful testimonies which are so important.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the final analysis, this Church is the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ. That is the testimony,\nbrothers and sisters, that we ought to bear to our sons our daughters, and our grandchildren.\nThis is the Church which is preparing the way for the second coming of Christ. That is our\nresponsibility. It is one of the most important responsibilities that any group of people can\nhave.\n<\/p><p>\nNow with reference to these other nations that do not have the privilege of hearing or\nunderstanding the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, it is my feeling that some day they will\nhave that opportunity. They are going to have that privilege. Was it not said to whom the\ngospel was to be preached&mdash;to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. Whether or not we\nwill be able to send missionaries into Russia to preach the gospel, I do not know, but I do\nremember President Clark said something about two years ago, and I have never forgotten it.\nHe said that perhaps we will be able to preach the gospel to the people of Russia out of Salt\nLake City over television or radio or something else. That day will come when the Russian\npeople will hear and understand the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, not only the people of\nRussia, but also the millions in China and the millions in India. They are all the sons and\ndaughters of our Heavenly Father, and I am satisfied that Jesus Christ is just as anxious that\nthey hear the gospel and enjoy all the same privileges that we have. In some way and at some\nfuture time, these great events are going to take place.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have a great responsibility, and I think of the words of Peter when he said, speaking to\nthe people: \n<\/p><p>\n\"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye\nshould shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous\nlight\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2275\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2275)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2275)\">1 Pet. 2:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf we live the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, we are \"a chosen generation.\" We are a chosen\ngeneration because through the wonderful revelations that were given to the Prophet Joseph,\nwe have the commandments, we have the direction, we have the guidance that is necessary to\nso live the gospel that we indeed are going to be a chosen generation.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd \"a royal priesthood\"&mdash;the Aaronic and the Melchizedek&mdash;the Aaronic Priesthood coming,\nas I have already indicated, when John the Baptist appeared and bestowed it upon Joseph\nSmith and Oliver Cowdery. Then, Peter, James, and John, the apostles of old and the\nPresidency of the Church some eighteen hundred years before, appeared and bestowed upon\nJoseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Melchizedek Priesthood. Indeed, might we say, it is a\nroyal priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\n\"An holy nation,\" of course, an holy nation, as I understand it, is the Church of the Lord\nJesus Christ. This is an holy nation, and all of those who have membership in the Church of\nthe Lord Jesus Christ are in that holy nation as long as they live the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\n\"A peculiar people\"&mdash;a peculiar people because we accept without question Jesus Christ as the\nSon of God! A peculiar people because we declare to the world that God the Father and his\nSon Jesus Christ appeared to that fourteen-year-old young man and gave him the direction and\ninspiration whereby the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints could again be established\nupon the earth for the benefit, the direction, and the inspiration of all the sons and daughters\nof our Heavenly Father, and \". . . that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath\ncalled you out of darkness into his marvelous light\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2276\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2276)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2276)\">1 Pet. 2:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMy testimony to you is this: if my grandfather in Switzerland, if my grandfather in England\nhad not had the privilege of hearing and understanding the gospel, we as a\nfamily, without a doubt, would still be in the darkness of the world, but because they accepted\nthe gospel, it is possible now for all of us to go into the marvelous light of the Church, the\nmarvelous light of Jesus Christ himself.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have a great responsibility of so living the gospel that it will be a great source of\ninspiration and divine guidance to all of those with whom we come in contact.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the final analysis, as we live the gospel, it is a wonderful thing to think of the words of\nJesus Christ, \"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27845\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27845)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27845)\">John 8:32<\/a><\/span>).\nThat is the promise and the blessing that each and every one of us may live and \nunderstand&mdash;that we shall know the truth and the truth shall make us free.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord continue to inspire us in all of our endeavors, I humbly ask in the name of\nJesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
