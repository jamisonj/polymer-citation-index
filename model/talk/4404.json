Like Helaman\u2019s stripling warriors, \u201cthey stand fast in that liberty wherewith God has made them free; and they are strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day; yea, they do observe to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments continually; and their faith is strong in the prophecies concerning that which is to come\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9623\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9623)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9623)\">Alma 58:40<\/a><\/span>).

This should raise a question in our minds of eternal significance: We know that this is the true and living church institutionally, but am I a true and living member individually?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/am-i-a-living-member.p11\" class=\"\">This question may appear as a play on the words of the Lord when he said this is the true and living church. When I ask, \u201cAm I a true and living member?\u201d my question is, am I deeply and fully dedicated to keeping the covenants I have made with the Lord? Am I totally committed to live the gospel and be a doer of the word and not a hearer only? Do I live my religion? Will I remain true? Do I stand firm against Satan\u2019s temptations? He is seeking to cause us to lose our way in a storm of derision and a tide of sophistry. We can have victory, however, by responding to that inner voice calling \u201cstand firm!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/am-i-a-living-member.p12\" class=\"\">To answer affirmatively the question, \u201cAm I a living member?\u201d confirms our commitment. It means that we now and always will love God and our neighbors as ourselves. It means our actions will reflect who we are and what we believe. It means that we are every day Christians, walking as Christ would have us walk.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/am-i-a-living-member.p13\" class=\"\">Living members are those who strive to have a total commitment.

They are baptized as a first step of their living journey. It is a sign to God, to angels, and to heaven that they will follow God\u2019s will. We especially welcome those of you throughout the world who have recently taken upon yourselves these covenants. We express our love for you and want you to know of our concern for you and all members everywhere. We welcome you into the brotherhood and sisterhood of the Latter-day Saints. The word <span class=\"emphasis\">saint<\/span> does not mean that any of us is perfect.

That keeps him on a true course. If, however, he happens to look back to see where he has been, his chances of straying are increased. The results are crooked and irregular furrows. We invite those of you who are new members to fix your attention on your new goal and never look back on your earlier problems or transgressions except as a reminder of your growth and your worth and your blessings from God. If our energies are focused not behind us but ahead of us\u2014on eternal life and the joy of salvation\u2014we assuredly will obtain it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/am-i-a-living-member.p21\" class=\"\">Living members give heed to the Spirit, which quickens the inner life. They constantly seek its direction. They pray for strength and overcome difficulties. Their hearts are not set upon the things of this world but upon the infinite. Spiritual renewal is not sacrificed for physical gratification.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/am-i-a-living-member.p22\" class=\"\">Living members put Christ first in their lives, knowing from what source their lives and progress come. There is a tendency for man to put himself in the center of the universe and expect others to conform to his wants and needs and desires. Yet nature does not honor that erroneous assumption. The central role in life belongs to God. Instead of asking him to do our bidding, we should seek to bring ourselves in harmony with his will, and thus continue our progress as a living member.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/am-i-a-living-member.p23\" class=\"\">The first great commandment is to \u201clove the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37165\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37165)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37165)\">Matt. 22:37<\/a><\/span>).

They are anxious to share their joy with others, and they never lose this desire. Patrick Henry said at the closing scene of his life: \u201cI have now disposed of all my property to my family. \u2026 There is one thing more I wish I could give them, and that is the Christian religion. \u2026 If they had that, and I had not given them one shilling, they would have been rich, and if they had not that, and I had given them all the world, they would be poor\u201d (as quoted in Tryon Edwards, comp., <span class=\"emphasis\">The New Dictionary of Thoughts,<\/span> Garden City, New York: Standard Book Co., 1961, p. 561).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/am-i-a-living-member.p25\" class=\"\">Living members recognize the need to put into action their beliefs. These Saints are anxiously engaged in bringing to pass many good and noble works of their own free will and accord. President Heber J. Grant once observed that \u201cthe power is in us wherein we are agents unto ourselves, and that we should not wait to be commanded in all things, and he that is compelled in all things is a slothful and not a wise servant. We should have the ambition, we should have the desire, we should make up our minds that, so far as the Lord Almighty has given to us talent, we will do our full share in the battle of life. It should be a matter of pride that no man shall do more than you will do, in proportion to your ability, in forwarding the work of God here upon the earth\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era,<\/span> Oct. 1939, p. 585).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/am-i-a-living-member.p26\" class=\"\">Living members love one another.
