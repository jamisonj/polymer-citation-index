Yet we find practically nothing of the things he taught during the forty days he instructed his disciples following his resurrection. What did he teach them?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/neither-cryptic-nor-hidden.p9\" class=\"\">We have much of what Jesus taught during the three years of his earth ministry.

Those doctrines are given in a guarded fashion by his apostles as they wrote the saints. Not everyone would understand their writings, but certainly those to whom they wrote would understand. An example is given in John\u2019s first letter, chapter 2, verse 20:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/neither-cryptic-nor-hidden.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cBut ye have an unction [or anointing] from the Holy One, and ye know all things\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1120\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1120)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1120)\">1 Jn. 2:20<\/a><\/span>].<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/neither-cryptic-nor-hidden.p12\" class=\"\">Which church today understands and uses an anointing to teach its members all things as further explained in verse 27?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/neither-cryptic-nor-hidden.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cBut the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1121\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1121)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1121)\">1 Jn. 2:27<\/a><\/span>].<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/neither-cryptic-nor-hidden.p14\" class=\"\">Now this statement, its meaning hidden from the present Christian world, must have had important meaning for those to whom John wrote.

This same sealing power restored by Elijah the prophet was later given by Jesus to all his apostles as recorded in Matthew 18, verse 18:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/neither-cryptic-nor-hidden.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cVerily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36533\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36533)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36533)\">Matt. 18:18<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/neither-cryptic-nor-hidden.p20\" class=\"\">The instructions and teachings of Jesus following his crucifixion were so sacred that they were not reduced to writing. Nevertheless, hints were given to faithful members of the early church as the apostles urged them to be more faithful in the discharge of their Christian duties.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/neither-cryptic-nor-hidden.p21\" class=\"\">What did Jesus do between his death and his resurrection? We know, for example, that he did not immediately return to his Heavenly Father.

There he organized the preaching of the gospel to the spirits in prison.

Some were born at times and places where it was impossible for them to hear the message of salvation. To condemn them without an opportunity to accept the gospel while living would be unfair. Salvation for the dead was one of those concepts taught during the forty days following the resurrection of Jesus.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/neither-cryptic-nor-hidden.p31\" class=\"\">Peter explained that the reason Jesus went to those spirits in prison was to bring them the gospel.

The work of salvation for the dead was such a common practice that Paul even used it as a proof that resurrection would come to all.

Wise men were not able to restore these practices during the Reformation or since. These doctrines came from heaven by a restoration of the gospel.
