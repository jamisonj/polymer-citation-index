Perhaps some of us will continue to say that there is a tomorrow when\nwe will repent and lead a finer life, but we all know that as far as each one of us is concerned\nthe time comes when for us there is no tomorrow. The Lord has also said that today is the\ntime to repent.\n<\/p><p>\nYou remember that the Lord told His prophet, Noah, that he should go out and warn the\npeople and tell them of the coming destruction\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23459\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23459)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23459)\">Gen. 6:13<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11832\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11832)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11832)\">D&amp;C 138:41<\/a><\/span>).\nBut the people, seemingly because they\nthought there would always be a tomorrow and because the floods did not come that day or\nthe next day, thought they would never come; therefore, they ridiculed the prophets and went\ntheir way. But the floods came and they were destroyed, because they would not listen to the\nprophets of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember hearing a story of a man who had just lost his oldest son. The father was not a\nvery religious man. In fact, he had disregarded most of the Lord's commandments. Because of\nhis son's being called to the other side, a good man went into the house to talk with the father\nand to the family. The son had been unfaithful in every way. He had been disobedient unto\nhis parents, to his country, to his God. As the good man talked with the father and the family,\nthe father said, \"I think that this is a time for prayer.\" Perhaps we all think that only when the\nemergency comes to us it is the time to pray. The efficiency of a prayer is dependent on the\ntype of life we have lived and the way we have made progress upon the earth. When the time\ncomes for the summons, to ourselves or to our family, if we have not repented, if we have\nnot done the things that should have been done, the praying comes rather late.\n<\/p><p>\nI trust, brethren, that as we continue traveling along the way of life, we will try to do the\nthings that God through His servants wants us to do. The time is short and there is no telling\nwhen it might be too late for us to repent and do the things that we ought to do. It is very\neasy in an emergency, such as we have in war today, to build big buildings and to make steel\nand to make airplanes and to build hospitals, Perhaps we can do these things in a material\nway, but we cannot all of a sudden build character, build decent homes, or have a family who\nhave such confidence in us that they will listen to our words and listen to the words of the\nservants of the Lord. \n<\/p><p>\nMay we be humble as we live upon the earth. May we repent of our sins. May we take this\nmessage seriously as it comes to us today, and live better and finer than we have ever lived\nbefore, I humbly pray in Jesus' name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
