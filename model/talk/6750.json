I was baptized in the month of August 1959, shortly after my 19th birthday. As I ponder the events that preceded my conversion, my thoughts go back to a childhood experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p5\" class=\"\">Close to the home where I lived as a child was a large house. It was located on beautiful grounds enclosed by what was to me a towering fence made of wood paneling, probably six feet in height. I recall peeping through holes in the panels where knots of wood had dropped out. It was like looking through a telescope into a different world. The beautifully manicured lawns, the well-kept flower gardens, and a small orchard provided an idyllic setting for the distinctive dwelling. Unfortunately, the opportunity to enjoy the view was always brief due to the vigilant British bulldog that patrolled the gardens and was immediately attracted to anyone standing close to the exterior of the fencing. Even though the fierce dog was confined in the garden, the sound of his sniffing as he approached the fence caused me to retreat in fear as my vivid imagination conjured up a variety of possibilities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p6\" class=\"\">Mr. and Mrs. Lyons, who lived in the home, were schoolteachers. They had a dignified demeanor and seemed to enjoy the privacy that the house setting afforded them. To add to the intrigue, Mr. Lyons had no right hand, using instead a steel hook that protruded below the cuff of his jacket. In my boyish mind, I could imagine Mr. Lyons pursuing me, catching me by the collar with the hook, and taking me captive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p7\" class=\"\">I recall an August morning when I was 10 or 11 years old, following a night of unusually strong winds, being greeted by friends as I left my home. They were obviously excited by something and inquired, \u201cDid you hear the wind last night?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p8\" class=\"\">When I said that I had, they proceeded to tell me what they had discovered\u2014the wind had blown down sections of the fencing surrounding the Lyonses\u2019 home. I could not understand why this would cause so much excitement and asked them to explain the significance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p9\" class=\"\">They responded with even greater enthusiasm: \u201cWe have access to the apple trees!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p10\" class=\"\">I was still very cautious and asked, \u201cBut what about Mr. Lyons?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cMr. and Mrs. Lyons are not at home; they are away visiting relatives.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cWhere is the dog?\u201d I probed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cThe family has placed him in boarding kennels,\u201d came the reply.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p14\" class=\"\">My friends had certainly carried out detailed research. So, reassured by their words, we headed for our target with all haste. Entering the grounds we climbed trees and hurriedly plucked fruit, filling our pockets and also the space between our shirts and our bodies. My heart was pounding and my pulse racing since I feared that any moment the dog or Mr. Lyons, or both, would appear in the garden and apprehend us. We ran from the scene of our trespass to a secluded place in a nearby wooded area and, after regaining our composure, began to consume the apples.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p15\" class=\"\">It was August, and the apples were not yet ripe enough to eat. In fact, they had a very bitter taste, but the tartness of these green apples did not deter us as we enthusiastically consumed our spoils, acting out of a compulsion I cannot now explain. After devouring a significant number, I contented myself with taking a bite out of each remaining apple and throwing the remnants of the fruit into the nearby bushes. The frivolity diminished as our bodies began to gradually react to the invasion they had experienced. The chemical reaction between my gastric juices and the unripe apples caused me to experience stomach cramps and to feel nauseated. As I sat regretting what I had done, I realized that a feeling within me was producing even more discomfort than the unripe apples.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p16\" class=\"\">The greater discomfort resulted from the realization that what I had done was wrong.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p17\" class=\"\">When my friends had proposed that we invade the garden, I had felt uncomfortable but lacked the courage to say no and so suppressed my feelings. Now, after the deed had been accomplished, I was filled with remorse. To my regret, I had ignored the promptings warning me of the error of my actions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p18\" class=\"\">Physical barriers and external forces may prevent us from pursuing deviant paths, but there is also a feeling within each of us, sometimes described as a still, small voice,<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-22911_000_029\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See George Q.

As I approached them, they were huddled together. I saw smoke rising in the air above them and recognized the aroma of burning tobacco. One of them had obtained a packet of cigarettes, and they were smoking. They invited me to join them, but I declined. They persisted, suggesting that my reluctance to participate was a sign of weakness. Their taunts turned to ridicule, combined with condescending remarks. But nothing they could say or do could persuade me to change my mind. I had not been raised with a knowledge of the restored gospel and knew nothing of the Word of Wisdom, but I was restrained by a feeling within that I should not participate with them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p24\" class=\"\">As I walked home reflecting on the decision I had made, I felt good inside.
