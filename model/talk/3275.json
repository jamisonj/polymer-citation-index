Let us observe it strictly in our homes and in our families. Let us refrain from all unnecessary labors. Sunday is not a day for hunting or fishing, nor for swimming, picnicking, boating, or engaging in any other sports. The stores in areas where we are more numerous would not long remain open on Sunday if the Saints refrained from shopping on that day. Remember, the Lord has said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/we-need-a-listening-ear.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/we-need-a-listening-ear.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cFor verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17204\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17204)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17204)\">D&amp;C 59:9\u201310<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/we-need-a-listening-ear.p9\" class=\"\">And then comes the glorious promise:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/we-need-a-listening-ear.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd inasmuch as ye do these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and countenances, not with much laughter, for this is sin, but with a glad heart and a cheerful countenance\u2014<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/we-need-a-listening-ear.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cVerily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the fulness of the earth is yours\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17205\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17205)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17205)\">D&amp;C 59:15\u201316<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/we-need-a-listening-ear.p12\" class=\"\">Once again I express pleasure with the response that has come from our urging the planting of fruit trees and gardens.

Prayer is such a privilege\u2014to speak to our Father in Heaven. It was a prayer, a very special prayer, which opened this whole dispensation! It began with a young man\u2019s first vocal prayer. I hope that not too many of our prayers are silent, even though when we cannot pray vocally, it is good to offer a silent prayer in our hearts and in our minds.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/we-need-a-listening-ear.p15\" class=\"\">Never hesitate to gather your family around you for your prayers, especially in those times when more than morning and evening family prayer is needed.

The echoing of \u201camen\u201d by the listeners is evidence of their accord and approval. Of course, the setting of prayers needs to be taken into account. This is one reason why public prayers, or even family prayers, cannot be the whole of our praying.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/we-need-a-listening-ear.p18\" class=\"\">Some things are best prayed over only in private, where time and confidentiality are not considerations. If in these special moments of prayer we hold back from the Lord, it may mean that some blessings may be withheld from us. After all, we pray as petitioners before an all-wise Heavenly Father, so why should we ever think to hold back feelings or thoughts which bear upon our needs and our blessings? We hope that our people will have very bounteous prayers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/we-need-a-listening-ear.p19\" class=\"\">It would not hurt us, either, if we paused at the end of our prayers to do some intense listening\u2014even for a moment or two\u2014always praying, as the Savior did, \u201cnot my will, but thine, be done\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32036\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32036)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32036)\">Luke 22:42<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/we-need-a-listening-ear.p20\" class=\"\">I love the wisdom of Benjamin Franklin when he said, \u201cWork as if you were to live a hundred years, pray as if you were to die tomorrow\u201d (John Bartlett, comp., <span class=\"emphasis\">Familiar Quotations,<\/span> Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1968, p. 422).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/we-need-a-listening-ear.p21\" class=\"\">And when the day is done, as well as when it begins, let us not forget to pray, for as George Herbert observed, \u201c[He] who goes to bed and does not pray, maketh two nights to every day\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Familiar Quotations,<\/span> p. 323).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/we-need-a-listening-ear.p22\" class=\"\">I always have very tender feelings about prayers and the power and blessings of prayer.

I renew that admonition. We may think there is little of interest or importance in what we personally say or do\u2014but it is remarkable how many of our families, as we pass on down the line, are interested in all that we do and all that we say. Each of us is important to those who are near and dear to us\u2014and as our posterity read of our life\u2019s experiences, they, too, will come to know and love us.
