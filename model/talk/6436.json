All eight of my great-grandparents came into the Church as early converts. Six of the eight immigrated to the United States from Europe, where I am now serving.

Jesus Christ ministers to, and loves us all, one by one.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/one-by-one.p16\" class=\"\">As we reflect on our Savior\u2019s way of loving, we sustain you dedicated stake and ward leaders, men and women of great faith. We gratefully recognize the many efforts of those of you working with the youth. And we express great appreciation to our caring Primary leaders and teachers for your Christlike service. We consider each of your one-by-one ministries and say thank you and please, please continue. Perhaps never in the history of mankind do we need to be serving on a one-by-one basis more than we do now.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/one-by-one.p17\" class=\"\">During the final months of our mission last year, we experienced an event that taught once again this profound principle that each of us is known and loved by God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/one-by-one.p18\" class=\"\">Elder Neal A. Maxwell was coming to New York City for some Church business, and we were informed that he would also like to have a mission conference. We were so pleased to have this opportunity to hear from one of the Lord\u2019s chosen servants. I was asked to select one of our missionaries to provide the opening prayer for the meeting. I might have randomly picked one of the missionaries to pray, but felt to ponder and prayerfully select one whom the Lord would have me ask. In going through the missionary roster, a name boldly stood out to me: Elder Joseph Appiah of Accra, Ghana. He was the one I felt the Lord wanted to pray at the meeting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/one-by-one.p19\" class=\"\">Prior to the mission conference, I was having a regularly scheduled interview with Elder Appiah and told him of the prompting that I had received for him to pray. With amazement and humility in his eyes, he began to weep deeply. Somewhat surprised by his reaction, I started to tell him that it was all right and he wouldn\u2019t have to pray, when he informed me he would love to offer the prayer, that his emotion was caused by the love he has for Elder Maxwell. He told me that this Apostle is very special to the Saints in Ghana and to his own family. Elder Maxwell had called his father to be the district president in Accra and had sealed his mother and father in the Salt Lake Temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/one-by-one.p20\" class=\"\">Now, I didn\u2019t know any of what I just related about this missionary or his family, but the Lord did and inspired a mission president on behalf of <span class=\"emphasis\">one<\/span> missionary to provide a lifelong memory and testimony-building experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/one-by-one.p21\" class=\"\">At the meeting, Elder Appiah offered a wonderful prayer and made a humble contribution to a meeting where Elder Maxwell taught the missionaries of the attributes of Jesus Christ. All who were there will never forget the feelings of love they experienced for their Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/one-by-one.p22\" class=\"\">I have a testimony in my heart, brothers and sisters, that God, our Heavenly Father, and Jesus Christ know and love us individually. I\u2019m not sure I fully understand how, I just know and have experienced that They do. I urge all of us in our own ministries, to our families and to our fellowman, to embrace the Savior\u2019s warm invitation to come unto Him, one by one, and be perfected in Him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/one-by-one.p23\" class=\"\">I share this witness and hope, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
