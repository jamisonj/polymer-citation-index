In a very serious talk with his parents, the young soldier asked if they loved America. He asked how they felt about this great and glorious nation. Both mother and father got a little teary-eyed and said that they loved this country dearly, that it was more precious to them than their own life. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that when I was growing up?\u201d he said. \u201cI never heard you once say that you loved America. You never taught me to love it. I can\u2019t tell you what an ungrateful pup I have been. I had to go to Vietnam to find out what the United States of America is all about.

I doubt we will ever have enough money to travel outside of Arizona. I was a soldier in World War II and was taken prisoner.
