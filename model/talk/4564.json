We did not have the Cub Scout program then, and a boy had to be twelve to be a Scout. This was 1922, only nine years after the Church adopted the Scout program. I lived in a very large ward by today\u2019s standards. There were more than eleven hundred people in that ward. We had a large troop, and we met in the cultural hall of the old First Ward. We made a lot of noise. The floors were of hardwood; the walls were hard and smooth, and the sound bounced around them. Our Scoutmaster had a whistle which he blew frequently to get order.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-a-gift-from-god.p6\" class=\"\">I filled out an application and paid the fifty-cent registration fee, which seemed like a lot of money at the time. I learned the Scout motto: \u201cBe Prepared.\u201d I learned the Scout slogan: \u201cDo a Good Turn Daily.\u201d I learned the Scout Oath: \u201cOn my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-a-gift-from-god.p7\" class=\"\">I learned the Scout Law: \u201cA Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, reverent.\u201d (We said it just about that fast.) And when we recited the law, one of the boys always added, \u201cA Scout is hungry.\u201d I think it was literally true. He came from a very large family, and getting enough to eat was always a challenge.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-a-gift-from-god.p8\" class=\"\">When I was twelve, I also became a deacon in the Aaronic Priesthood. My name was presented to the entire congregation of our ward. Everyone was asked to sustain me if they felt me worthy of the office. All hands in the large congregation went up. I was honored to think that all of the members of my ward raised their hands in my behalf.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-a-gift-from-god.p9\" class=\"\">Then two men, good and true and faithful\u2014one of them my father\u2014placed their hands upon my head and conferred upon me the Aaronic Priesthood and ordained me to the office of deacon. I did not have any oath, slogan, motto, or law to memorize in connection with this. But I did memorize section 13 of the Doctrine and Covenants, and I have remembered it ever since. These are the words of an angel. They are the words of John the Baptist when he conferred the Aaronic Priesthood upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery on May 15, 1829:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-a-gift-from-god.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cUpon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18750\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18750)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18750)\">D&amp;C 13<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-a-gift-from-god.p11\" class=\"\">Unlike Scouting, we did not have one large deacons quorum that met in the cultural hall.

I later learned that this number had been wisely designated by the Lord in revelation.

And in 1829 it was this same John who had come and given the priesthood to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. He spoke to them. He placed his hands upon their heads. They heard his voice and they felt his hands. This meant that he had to have been resurrected. That was a wonderful thing and a very impressive thing to me. Here was living evidence of the reality of the Resurrection, which had come through the divine power of the Lord Jesus Christ\u2014the same who earlier had been baptized by John in the river Jordan.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-a-gift-from-god.p16\" class=\"\">John told Joseph and Oliver that he was acting under the direction of Peter, James, and John, the Apostles who had been ordained by the Lord and who held what we call the Melchizedek, or the higher, Priesthood, as distinguished from the Aaronic, or the lesser, Priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-a-gift-from-god.p17\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith was then twenty-three and a half years of age. Oliver Cowdery was about the same. They were young men, and I thought when I was ordained a deacon what a wonderful thing it was that John the Baptist, who was a great man in the New Testament and who lived nearly two thousand years earlier, had come as a resurrected being and that he should address Joseph and Oliver as \u201cmy fellow servants.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/the-aaronic-priesthood-a-gift-from-god.p18\" class=\"\">Even though he came as a servant of God and acted under the direction of Peter, James, and John, he did not place himself above Joseph and Oliver.
