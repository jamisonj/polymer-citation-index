Hunter, <i>Conference Report<\/i> October 1960, pp. 107-109<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nIn the nineteenth chapter of John we read the story of an influential man who was secretly a\ndisciple of Christ, but because of fear, was not openly a disciple. Those who declared\nthemselves as followers of Christ were not popular in Jerusalem during this period of\ncontroversy. Joseph of Arimathea was secretly a disciple, but his fear of what others might\nthink or do prevented him from declaring his allegiance until after the crucifixion of the\nMaster.\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph of Arimathea was a man of wealth and station in Jerusalem. We can assume that he\nhad a wide acquaintance and was a man of influence. He was a member of the Sanhedrin, the\nassembly of seventy-one men constituting the supreme council of the aristocracy which\nadministered the Jewish law. It was because of his membership in this tribunal that he was\nreferred to as \"counsellor.\" Mark refers to him as \"... an honourable counsellor, which\nalso waited for the kingdom of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33130\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33130)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33130)\">Mark 15:43<\/a><\/span>). He waited in\nthe background, doing nothing to support or sustain the Master. No doubt he had heard Jesus\nand listened to his teachings, for we are told that he was a secret disciple of the Savior.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the council was called into session early in the morning, following the Last Supper and\nthe betrayal, Joseph either absented himself from the council or refused to vote. He took no\npart in the proceedings, hoping no doubt to save his own conscience. He would not lift a\nfinger to condemn the Savior, nor would he defend him openly.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many like Joseph of Arimathea, who do not declare loyalty to the Lord Jesus\nChrist, but merely \"wait for the kingdom.\" Like Joseph they are secret followers of Jesus and\nhalfhearted, lukewarm Christians. Secret disciples of Christ are almost in the same category as\nthose who are antagonistic. They are much the same as persons among us today who have\nonly a halfhearted interest in our great democratic way of life and are as dangerous to the\nfuture freedom of the world as those who are openly avowed to destroy democracy.\n<\/p><p>\nWe would have greater respect for Joseph, if he had taken a strong position in the council and\ndefended Jesus. We cannot assume that this would have changed the judgment or saved him\nfrom the cross, because he stated at the supper that he would shortly leave them. Nevertheless,\nwe have respect for one who stands upon moral convictions and upholds the right.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have more respect for one who honestly doubts than for one who fears to declare loyalty.\nThomas doubted. He traveled the path from faith through the valley of doubt to new heights\nof faith. This is the course that many follow in life. As children we accepted as fact the things\nwhich were told to us by our parents or our teachers because of the confidence that we had in\nthem. A little boy will jump from a high place without fear if his father tells him that he will\ncatch him. The little fellow has faith that his father will not let him fall. As children grow\nolder, they commence to think for themselves, to question and have doubts about those things\nwhich are not subject to tangible proof.\n<\/p><p>\nI have sympathy for young men and young women when honest doubts enter their minds and\nthey engage in the great conflict of resolving doubts. These doubts can be resolved, if they\nhave an honest desire to know the truth, by exercising moral, spiritual, and mental effort.\nThey will emerge from the conflict into a firmer, stronger, larger faith because of the\nstruggle. They have gone from a simple, trusting faith, through doubt and conflict, into a solid\nsubstantial faith which ripens into testimony. The Bible is replete with such examples. We\nthink of Abraham in the Old Testament and Thomas in Christ's time.\n<\/p><p>\nNow to return to Joseph of Arimathea, the record does not indicate to us that he doubted as\ndid Thomas. We are told he was \"... a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27941\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27941)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27941)\">John 19:38<\/a><\/span>).\nHe believed secretly because he was afraid of public opinion. Among our own people, in our\ncommunities, in our nation and throughout the world, there are secret followers of Jesus and\nhalf-hearted Christians&mdash;onlookers who have a noncommittal attitude. Why is it that so many\nwill not commit themselves?\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph of Arimathea was only a secret disciple because of what others would think of him.\nHe would not risk his social position nor the respect of his associates. It is fear that causes\nmen to be noncommittal. They are afraid to declare their loyalty and assume active\nresponsibility. The easy way is to let someone else be the leader and assume the\nresponsibility. The world needs men who are willing to step forward and declare themselves.\nThe world needs men who will lift the load of responsibility to their shoulders and carry it\nhigh under the banner of Jesus Christ&mdash;men who are willing to defend the right openly. I am\nalways impressed by the missionaries of this Church. They are willing to accept the call to\nserve two years or more at their own expense and give freely of their time without monetary\ncompensation, to cry repentance and declare that Jesus is the Christ. This is the type of\ndevotion to principle that is needed in the world today.\n<\/p><p>\nHow can men of conscience ignore the teachings of the Master in their daily affairs, in\nbusiness, or in government? We stand by and wink at many things [p. 109]\nbecause we fear to do anything about them. We may be against crime or communism, but\nwhat do we do about it? We may be against corruption in government or against juvenile\ndelinquency, but what do we do about it? We may have a belief in the gospel of Jesus Christ,\nbut what are we doing about it? We need to push fear into the background and come forward\nwith a definite, positive declaration, and assume responsibility.\n<\/p><p>\nThe pathway to exaltation is well defined. We are told to have faith&mdash;faith in the Lord Jesus\nChrist, and repent of those things which are not according to his teachings. After this change\nof mental attitude, and with firm resolution, we must declare ourselves by going into the\nwaters of baptism, thereby making a covenant with the Lord to keep his commandments. Can\nwe thereafter be a secret disciple? Can we stand on the sidelines and merely observe? This is\na day for action. This is the time for decision, not tomorrow, not next week. This is the time\nto make our covenant with the Lord. Now is the time for those who have been noncommittal\nor who have had a halfhearted interest to come out boldly and declare belief in Christ and be\nwilling to demonstrate faith by works.\n<\/p><p>\nWe acquire more regard for Joseph of Arimathea as we continue to read. Although he was \"a\ndisciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27942\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27942)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27942)\">John 19:38<\/a><\/span>)\nand although he was one who \"waited for the\nkingdom of God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33131\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33131)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33131)\">Mark 15:43<\/a><\/span>),\nyet he was finally moved to action. The account continues:\n<\/p><p>\n\"He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be\ndelivered.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,\n<\/p><p>\n\"And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great\nstone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35081\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35081)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35081)\">Matt. 27:58-60<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI wonder if there was not a tear in Joseph's eye as he placed the body of Jesus in the tomb.\nSurely he thought of the events which had taken place earlier on that day, when as a member\nof the Council he had failed to come to the defense of the Master. Should we not search our\nown souls and inquire of ourselves if we are loyal? Are we, too, only secret disciples of\nChrist?\n<\/p><p>\nThis same Jesus who died on the cross and whose body was placed in the tomb came forth on\nthe third day thereafter. He was resurrected and lives today&mdash;the Savior of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is my witness. He stands before us with arms outstretched to our vision, and those same\nwords spoken to the disciples in Jerusalem should ring in our ears:\n<\/p><p>\n\"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake\nshall find it\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35051\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35051)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35051)\">Matt. 16:24-25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay we be his disciples openly, fearlessly, and with devotion, I humbly pray in his name.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
