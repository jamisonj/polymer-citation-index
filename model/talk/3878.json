Thirty to forty times each year we find ourselves staying in the home of a different stake president.

I was assigned to a stake conference to release the stake president, who had served for many, many years. It was a difficult stake to administer. The stake had been losing population. It was located near one of our major city centers. Industry had moved in. With the growth of industry, many of the members had moved out to the more suburban areas. Because of his assignment, he had stayed in the area to shepherd the flock. He had not found it to be a hopeless situation. Through his energy, effort, and great enthusiasm, the stake started to grow once again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/our-father-which-art-in-heaven.p5\" class=\"\">As the weekend progressed, his children came by auto and air, returning home to pay tribute to their father for his years of faithful service.

As the family gathered around the table, the father requested that we kneel in family prayer. Kneeling in prayer, I discovered their strength. This family understood their relationship to God, their Eternal Father. They understood their relationship to their earthly father and mother, to their brothers and sisters. The brotherhood and sisterhood existing in this family unit made it easy for them to stretch beyond their borders to friends and neighbors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/our-father-which-art-in-heaven.p8\" class=\"\">Being a guest in so many different homes over the last few years has certainly convinced me that a special spirit is clearly evident when a family prays together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/our-father-which-art-in-heaven.p9\" class=\"\">Our prophets have admonished us repeatedly to make family prayer a regular part of our daily worship.

I listen to so many people offering prayers, and I wonder who they are addressing. The salutation is so complicated I find it difficult to comprehend the being to which the prayer is being directed. I am reminded of the occasion when the first Congress was trying to determine how to address the president of our country. The suggestion was given that he could be called \u201cHis Highness, President of the United States and Protector of the Liberties of the Same.\u201d Washington\u2019s request was to just call him Mr. President.

My heart is especially filled with gratitude at this season of the harvest when I go out to dig a hill of potatoes and there find manyfold over the small piece I planted a few months before, or pull off an ear of corn and see how those two or three kernels placed in the earth now yield a hundredfold. As I travel and see the beauty of His creations\u2014the mountains, the fertile plains, the sparkling streams, or the mighty oceans\u2014how grateful I am for His blessings to me.
