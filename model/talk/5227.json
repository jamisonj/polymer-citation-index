The prophet Mormon tells us that \u201cby the power of [the Lord\u2019s] word did they cause prisons to tumble.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38099\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38099)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38099)\">Morm. 8:24<\/a><\/span>.) In recent weeks, I have reread the stories of Jean Valjean in Victor Hugo\u2019s brilliant novel <span class=\"emphasis\">Les Miserables<\/span> and of Bob Merrick in the novel <span class=\"emphasis\">Magnificent Obsession<\/span> by Lloyd C. Douglas. These two stories, though widely different in time, circumstances, and affluence, have touched my heart in many ways.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p4\" class=\"\">I have agonized as I have thought about the ordeal of Jean Valjean\u2014the nineteen years in prison and the things done to him for the small transgression of stealing a loaf of bread to feed a starving family. He suffered so many indignities, even after he was finally released from the physical prison.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p5\" class=\"\">Some of the same feelings flood my mind as I reflect upon the self-inflicted sufferings of Bob Merrick. The life of a prominent surgeon was lost and the sight of another because of Bob Merrick\u2019s wayward activities, selfishness, ego, and disdain for others. He suffered in a prison of his own making.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p6\" class=\"\">Yes, I realize these masterfully crafted episodes are fictional, but they cause me to think about the various types of prisons Satan leads us into building for ourselves and others, or that others build for us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p7\" class=\"\">Haven\u2019t we all been delivered from various forms of captivity?

I was verbally and physically abused. I felt I would never see my family or my country again. I assure you that while I was held captive, the blood coursed through my veins like adrenaline. Though the captivity lasted less than a day, it seemed like an eternity. And when I was put on another train and sent back to safety, my gratitude to the Lord knew no bounds. I was <span class=\"emphasis\">free!<\/span> As I talked to the train conductor, I learned that hundreds had not been so lucky.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p9\" class=\"\">I then was led to think of Him who really delivers us from various types of prisons into forgiveness, a newness of life, of spirit, of change, and of opportunity, and how the souls of men find such relief, fulfillment, and safety when this occurs. I thought of the Son of God and His greatest freewill offering to each of us, given at the expense of His own life and under excruciating pain. I thought of how our Father in Heaven loves each one of us. And though we sometimes walk into prisons of our own making, He is there with keys to unlock the doors that bind us. I thought of those who help along the way, who share in turning those keys which deliver others, and who care so deeply sometimes that they rebuild the trust of others\u2014like the two men of God in the novels helped to free Jean Valjean and Bob Merrick from their prisons into magnificent, new freedoms promised by the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p10\" class=\"\">As difficult as a physical captivity or prison is, there are other captivities or prisons even more devastating. They are very subtle and take various forms in life, like (1) taking advantage of another; (2) bearing false witness to get gain; (3) knowing things to be true and not defending them; (4) stealing the morality of another; (5) destroying the innocence of a little child; (6) being captive to alcohol or drugs; (7) or financially digging a pit for another, causing hardship and destroying his ability to take care of his needs and so on. There are many prisons which come from our sins or the sins of others \u201caccording to the captivity and power of the devil\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4454\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4454)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4454)\">2 Ne. 2:27<\/a><\/span>) who leads us away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p11\" class=\"\">Let me take an example to illustrate the point of these prisons.

He had worked long, hard hours for many years to develop the skills, reputation, and expertise necessary to build his business and provide for the needs of his young family. He loved his work, and every morning he anxiously began each new project with creativity and opportunity. His was a great life, filled with much hope and many projects. Then one major project was completed and finalized. Rather large payments were anticipated, but a shrewd businessman found that oral approvals, given to my friend to make many necessary alterations in the project, could easily be broken and not honored. After all, there was no written record of the changes requested. It was just \u201cgood business\u201d to get it as cheap as possible, even after commitments were made. And so verbal commitments were not honored. The money due, which was considerable, was not paid.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p13\" class=\"\">At this point we have several prisons that are now in place: the prison of deceit of the \u201cshrewd\u201d businessman, and the prison of the deceived, who could not now honor his own commitments. To this day the one deceived, through further industry and much hardship, is still trying to get out of the prison created by another. And he has lost confidence in others, and he and his family have lost opportunities and his business because of another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p14\" class=\"\">Did not the Savior teach through the prophet Moses, \u201cIf a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man\u2019s field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution\u201d?

He would leave work, buy his alcohol, drive into the countryside, and drink until he could barely find his way home. He truly was under the captive spirit of the devil and lived in hell. A faithful home teacher loved this brother, saw him often, taught him to pray for help, and prayed for him often. One day while he was driving his pickup truck into the countryside to begin his daily alcohol ritual, he felt a powerful influence to stop his truck, walk out into a field, fall to his knees, and plead for help from his Father in Heaven. Later, he tearfully testified that as he arose from his knees, the desire to drink alcohol had completely left him. He had been delivered from a twenty-year prison. God heard his prayer, felt the desire of his heart, and opened the prison doors that bound him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p20\" class=\"\">Beloved friends, it is Jesus who has unlocked and will unlock the doors of our personal prisons.
