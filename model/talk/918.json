That was a shock to me and I think\nto thousands of others, many thousands throughout this land, for it seemed to be so unusual\nand a trend that boded only evil for this country.  We have been troubled even in our own\ncity, and this trouble has existed in all parts of the land, with vandalism, the wanton\ndestruction of property, crimes by children and teenagers, which show a tendency that will\nlead only to serious trouble within the borders of our country in years to come.\n<\/p><p>\nSo I appeal to you, my dear brethren and sisters, husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, to\ntake advantage of every opportunity the Church affords to have your children trained in the\nvarious organizations provided for them by the revelations of the Lord: the Primary, the\nSunday School, the Mutual Improvement organizations, and the quorums of the Lesser\nPriesthood under the direction of our bishoprics.\n<\/p><p>\nI hope that you are teaching your children in your homes to pray. I hope that you are having\nfamily prayers, morning and evening, that your children are taught by example and by precept\nto observe the commandments that are so precious and so sacred and mean so much to our\nsalvation in the kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord said in a revelation given to the Church in 1831: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are\norganized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the\nSon of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the\nhands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.<br \/>\nFor this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her stakes\nwhich are organized (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13640\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13640)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13640)\">D&amp;C 68:25-26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I think I could add with equal truth in any branch of the Church in any mission or any\nother place outside of the stakes of Zion.  The Lord requires this at our hands. I am reminded\nof a statement that was made in a discourse by President Brigham Young one time which I\nam not able to quote correctly, but the substance of it is this: \n<\/p><p>\nYou say this is my wife.  You say these are my children.  That all depends upon your\nkeeping the commandments of God.\n<\/p><p>\nThat is the substance of it.  In other words, the Lord can take away from you this wife.  He\ncan take away from you these children.  He has not relinquished his claim upon any of the\nchildren that have been entrusted to our care.\n<\/p><p>\nSo I make this appeal because the tendency in this country today, as you all know who read\nthe papers, is towards nuclear energy, traveling to the moon, getting off the earth, and going\nsomewhere else.  But people have forgotten God. We cannot afford to do that.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us as members of the Church, no matter what else we may think about space travel, keep\nour feet on the ground, spiritually and in the home.\n<\/p><p>\nOne thing, too, that I would like to call attention to&mdash;young people, when they marry, are\nnot satisfied to begin with a little and humbly, but they want to receive just about as much as\ntheir parents have at the time they, the children, get married.  They must have an automobile;\nthey have to have a television set, a radio, all kinds of conveniences, many of which, of\ncourse, are very helpful.  But they want to start out with every convenience under the sun to\nmake them comfortable.  I think this is a mistake.  I think they should begin humbly, putting\ntheir faith in the Lord, building here a little and there a little as they can, accumulating\npiecemeal, until they can reach a position of prosperity such as they wish to have.\n<\/p><p>\nNow this condition of wanting everything leads to this great trouble: Both the mother and the\nfather find employment.  That means that children are left either to run the streets or\nsomebody has to be called in to take care of them in the absence of the parents, and\ngenerally, it is my opinion that these children are left to wander the streets, to get into\nmischief, and they do not have the proper attention that ought to be given to them by the\nmother in the home.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, let us try humbly to keep our families intact, to keep them under the influence of the\nSpirit of the Lord, trained in the principles of the gospel that they may grow up in\nrighteousness and truth.  I think the Lord requires that at our hands.  He has said, as I have\nread to you here, that he will hold the parents responsible for the acts of the children and they\nare given unto us that we might train them in the ways of life, eternal life, that they might\ncome back again into the presence of God, their Father.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, some may think I am a little extreme but I think that the training of the children, the\nwatching care over the children in the home by the mother, is worth far more than to have\nher seek employment, even if it is a matter of pinching a little in order to keep going in the\nhome.\n<\/p><p>\nAgain, we have throughout the Church, wherever it is possible for us to have this opportunity,\nseminaries and institutes which our children who are old enough to go to the public schools or\neven to the colleges may attend. Brethren and sisters, send your children to these seminaries.\nThose who are going to college will be old enough, if they have the proper training in their\nyouth, to attend the institutes of the Church.  They are old enough to take care of themselves. \nBut help your children in every way you can to grow up with a knowledge of the gospel of\nJesus Christ.  Teach them to pray.  Teach them to observe the Word of Wisdom, to walk\nfaithfully and humbly before the Lord so that when they grow up to manhood and\nwomanhood they can thank you for what you have done for them and look back over their\nlives with grateful hearts and with love for their parents for the manner in which those parents\ncared for them and trained them in the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
