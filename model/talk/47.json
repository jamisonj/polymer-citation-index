Widtsoe, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1942, pp. 73-76<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nDear Brethren and Fellow Workers:\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the time allotted me I should like to call to mind some fundamentals of leadership.\nNearly every member of the Church, at one time or another, is called to some official Church\nposition; but here are assembled the present Priesthood leadership of the Church. In our\nhands, with the willing cooperation of the membership the Latter-day Saints, lies, in large\nmeasure, the future of the Church. We may retard or accelerate its progress. The Lord has\ngiven us a great trust.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church of Jesus Christ in these latter days has had great leaders. From Joseph Smith to\nHeber J. Grant they have been mighty men. In their day they may have suffered persecution\nand derision; but with the process of the years they have come to stand as gigantic figures,\nworthy of the acclaim of all who love righteousness. They are fruits of the spirit of the gospel\nof Jesus Christ. To follow the examples of these great leaders is to make our own leadership\nmore worthy and powerful.\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph Smith, under Jesus Christ is the head of this dispensation of the gospel. To him we\nbore tender and touching tribute yesterday. He was indeed a leader worthy of our emulation.\nHis leadership began with a consuming love of truth. Indeed no man can be a safe leader who\ndoes not love truth above all else. The words truth and light appear and reappear as the\nfoundations of his teachings. He would not walk in darkness. He knew that the light of truth\nwould banish the night of error. Truth was his measuring rod, therefore he would not and\ncould not support any cause, political, social, or commercial, which did not square with truth.\nThere is never a possible compromise with untruth. Truth must ever be obeyed, or leadership\nleads downward. What a different world we should have today if the leaders of nations had\nmade truth their first love and had surrendered to it. The Prophet declared his passion for\ntruth, and the power of truth, in a glorious answer to a correspondent:\n<\/p><p>\nI combat the errors of ages; I meet the violence of mobs; I cope with illegal proceedings from\nexecutive authority; I cut the Gordian knot of powers; and I solve the mathematical problems\nof the universities with truth&mdash;diamond truth (<i>DHC<\/i> 6:78).\n<\/p><p>\nLove of truth by all members of the Church, from 1830 to 1942, has made the Church\nmighty; and love of truth and obedience to it will enable us to establish on earth the kingdom\nof God. By truth we shall achieve the world's leadership.\n<\/p><p>\nThe history of Joseph Smith reveals further a man who did not pretend to know everything.\nHe was not opinionated. He was not sufficient unto himself. He knew the limitations of man\nwho is born to die. That is another mark of his leadership. In his eager boyhood; when he\nlonged for the truth of religion he went to the Lord for help. As he grew in age and power,\nhe continued to seek help from the Creator of earth and man. He was prayerful. In the record\nof his life we read again and again, \"I enquired of the Lord.\" There was in his life a constant\noutreaching for divine help. He knew the source of truth, and sought refreshment at the\nfountain head. Personal opinions and even the apparently needed help of living men were set\naside when the Lord spoke. James Arlington Bennett, recently, baptized into the Church, but\nwithout the spirit of the gospel, desired to help the Prophet out of the difficulties of the day.\nHe offered to be the Prophet's \"right hand man.\" Like a flash from the sky came the\nProphet's thunderous reply: \"God is my right hand man.\" We can not attain leadership unless\nwe seek help from the Lord, unless we cultivate the spirit of prayer. Again, let me ask, would\nthe world he in its present state of bloody confusion, if its leaders had sought counsel from\nthe Lord?\n<\/p><p>\nThe truth that Joseph Smith promulgated, the instructions he received from heaven, were\napplied in the, spirit of love for humanity. That was a further mark of his leadership. He\nrecognized that all are children of the Eternal Father, and to that extent divine. He was ready\nto afford all men equal rights on the way to salvation. He did not lift himself above his\nbrethren. He had seen the Lord and had conversed with Him; he was a prophet; he was the\npresident of the Church&mdash;nevertheless he was but as one with his brethren&mdash;a member of the\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, striving and struggling for salvation. In him\ndestroying pride was, swallowed up in life-giving humility. Arrogance was absent from his\nprivate or official actions. Such forgetfulness of self such love of his fellow men made him a\npowerful leader. If we who battle for the cause for which he gave his life desire to become\nsuccessful leaders, we must love our brethren and sisters, be courteous and gentle with them,\nmust be one with them. The Prophet records in his diary that he told some new arrivals in\nNauvoo:\n<\/p><p>\nI was but a man, and they must not expect me to be perfect; if they expected perfection from\nme, I should expect it from them; but if they would bear with my infirmities and the\ninfirmities of the brethren, I would likewise bear with their infirmities (<i>DHC<\/i> 5:181).\n<\/p><p>\nSuch an attitude creates leadership. The resulting love quiets \"the restless pulse of care\" in our\nhuman relationships.\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph the Prophet met the final test of the leader, that of fidelity. He was true to the cause\nwhich he represented. He gave of himself for it. Almost every day of the fourteen years he\npresided over the Church was one of toil, often of pain and sorrow. But, he continued to be\ndiligent, dependable, ever considerate of the welfare of the people. In the needs of the Church\nhe forgot himself. Opposition to the Church was usually visited upon his head. Fifty times he\nwas charged with offenses, falsely as the record shows, for he was never found guilty. He\nspent months in a foul jail. He was driven from place to place and robbed of his material\npossessions. His name became known for \"good and evil\" the world over\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30211\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30211)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30211)\">JS&mdash;H 1:33<\/a><\/span>). But he did not\nfalter. He built cities and temples; he fought the battles of the Church; he surrendered his own\ncomforts for the benefit of the people; he taught them everlasting truth. When at long last the\nenemy threatened to take vengeance upon his people, if he would not yield himself to men of\nthe law who were untrue to the law, and because some of his own people were seized by fear,\nhe said, \"If my life is of no value to my friends it is of none to myself.\" And when he\naccepted arrest he said to the company who were with him:\n<\/p><p>\nI am going like a lamb to the slaughter, but I am calm as a summer's morning. I have a\nconscience void of offense toward God and toward all men\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11831\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11831)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11831)\">D&amp;C 135:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe words of a worthy leader!\n<\/p><p>\nHe suffered a martyr's death. He was true even unto death.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord does not require that we give our lives in this manner for the cause of truth. Yet,\nevery man to be true to his calling in this Church must possess the spirit of devotion and\nsacrifice, of diligence and dependability, of love of man and God, which enabled the Prophet\nto seal his testimony with his blood. Humanity in its present utter travail and sorrow is calling\nfor leaders, who, rising above human diplomacy and self-interest, are true to the cause of\ntruth, at any cost.\n<\/p><p>\nLeaders who follow the example of Joseph Smith receive great rewards. They find daily joy\nin life. The visions of heaven are theirs. And they win disciples. Others, witnessing their lives,\nseek to follow them. Brigham Young bore incessant testimony to the joy of being a disciple\nof Joseph Smith; and his dying words were, \"Joseph, Joseph!\" John Taylor, with Hyrum\nSmith and Willard Richards, dared death in Carthage Jail to be with their leader and brother.\nThe lives of Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, Joseph F. Smith, and Heber J. Grant, judged\nby the marks of leadership, conform to the Prophet's life. Love of truth, of God, and of their\nfellow men, and an unquestioned, unselfish devotion to the latter-day work of the Lord have\ncharacterized the actions of these men. To follow the examples of these men is to achieve\nleadership.\n<\/p><p>\nIn our respective callings, in stake or ward or in the Priesthood quorum, the signs of\nleadership which have marked the great leaders of the whole Church, will mark us as\nsuccessful leaders. Leadership is in essence the same wherever applied.\n<\/p><p>\nThat which makes a Church official a leader may be used by any and every member of the\nChurch in winning joy in life. It is equally important for the whole membership of the\nChurch, if we are to be as a light upon a hill for the guidance of the nations, to love truth, to\ngo to the Lord for help, to recognize the divine kinship of all men, and to be obedient and\ndependable, true citizens of the Kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have a great destiny. We are commissioned to bring peace and happiness to the earth, to\nlead the world from error to truth, from darkness into light. In that sense we have been called\nto be world leaders. For that calling let us prepare; let us build the Church with courage and\nfaith toward perfection, until the time when the reign of righteousness shall be ushered in, I\npray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
