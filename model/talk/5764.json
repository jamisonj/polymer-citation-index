How he wanted to visit the temple! How he desired to receive his spiritual blessings! Request after request to journey to the temple in Switzerland had been denied, and he almost despaired. Then his home teacher visited. Brother Walter Krause went from the northeastern portion of Germany all the way to Hungary. He had said to his home teaching companion, \u201cWould you like to go home teaching with me this week?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/duty-calls.p65\" class=\"\">His companion said, \u201cWhen will we leave?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/duty-calls.p66\" class=\"\">\u201cTomorrow,\u201d replied Brother Krause.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/duty-calls.p67\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen will we come back?\u201d asked the companion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/duty-calls.p68\" class=\"\">\u201cOh, in about a week\u2014if we get back then!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/duty-calls.p69\" class=\"\">And away they went to visit Brother Denndorfer. He had not had home teachers since before the war. Now, when he saw the servants of the Lord, he was overwhelmed. He did not shake hands with them; rather, he went to his bedroom and took from a secret hiding place his tithing that he had saved from the day he became a member of the Church and returned to Hungary. He presented the tithing to his home teachers and said: \u201cNow I am current with the Lord. Now I feel worthy to shake the hands of servants of the Lord!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/duty-calls.p70\" class=\"\">Brother Krause asked him about his desire to attend the temple in Switzerland.

At the conclusion of the blessing, he said to Brother Denndorfer, \u201cApproach the government again about going to Switzerland.\u201d And Brother Denndorfer submitted the request once again to the authorities. This time approval came, and with joy Brother Denndorfer went to the Swiss Temple and stayed a month. He received his own endowment, his deceased wife was sealed to him, and he was able to accomplish the work for hundreds of his ancestors. He returned to his home renewed in body and in spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/duty-calls.p72\" class=\"\">And what about the home teachers who undertook this historic and inspired visit to their brother, Johann Denndorfer?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/duty-calls.p73\" class=\"\">Knowing personally each member of this human drama, I wouldn\u2019t be a bit surprised to learn that on the way from Debrecen, Hungary, to their home in East Germany, they sang aloud: \u201cDangers may gather\u2014why should we fear?
