It pleases me greatly to notice that at each succeeding\nconference there is a larger sprinkling of Japanese and Chinese brothers and sisters; of\nHawaiians and other islanders; of Indians, Mexicans, Spanish-Americans and others. It makes\nme very happy indeed, and I wish to address my remarks this morning in behalf of those\nminorities.\n<\/p><p>\nRecently there came to my desk a letter, anonymously written.  Generally the wastebasket\nreceives all such messages, written by people who have not the courage to sign their\nstatements. But this time I saved it.  It reads in part as follows: \n<\/p><p>\nI never dreamed I would live to see the day when the Church would invite an Indian buck to\ntalk in the Salt Lake Tabernacle&mdash;an Indian buck appointed a bishop&mdash;an Indian squaw to\ntalk in the Ogden Tabernacle&mdash;Indians to go through the Salt Lake Temple&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nThe sacred places desecrated by the invasion of everything that is forced on the white race. . .\n<\/p><p>\nThis letter now goes into the fire also, but it gives me the theme for the words I wish to say\ntoday.\n<\/p><p>\nIf Mrs. Anonymous were the only one who felt that way! However, from many places and\ndifferent directions I hear intolerant expressions.  While there is an ever-increasing number of\npeople who are kind and willing to accept the minority groups as they come into the Church,\nthere are still many who speak in disparaging terms, who priest-like and Levite-like pass by\non the other side of the street\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31369\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31369)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31369)\">Luke 10:31-32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt would be a delightful step forward if our newspapers and periodicals and our writers and\nspeakers would discontinue the term <i>buck<\/i> and <i>squaw<\/i> and substitute &ldquo;Indian men and women&rdquo;\nor &ldquo;Lamanite brethren and sisters.&rdquo;\n<\/p><p>\nTheir ancestors and ancient prophets foresaw this day and knew that this people would be reviled and\ndisparaged.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the letter quoted, there is the suggestion of a superior race!  From the dawn of history we\nhave seen so-called superior races go down from the heights to the depths in a long parade of\nexits. Among them were the Assyrians, the Egyptians, the Babylonians, the Persians, the\nGreeks, and the Romans. They, with more modern nations, have been defeated in battle,\nhumiliated and crushed in economic life.  Is the implication of Mrs. Anonymous justified that\nthe white race or the American people is superior?  John the Baptist, in forceful terms,\nrebuked a similar self-styled superior group: \n<\/p><p>\nO generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?\n<\/p><p>\nBring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you,\nthat God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34609\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34609)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34609)\">Matt. 3:7-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord would have eliminated bigotry and class distinction.

Punctilious Peter expressed his\nlifelong prejudices and habits in saying, &ldquo;Not so, Lord; for I have never\neaten any thing that is common or unclean.&rdquo; Then the heavenly voice made clear that the\nprogram was for all.  &ldquo;What God hath cleansed,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;that call not thou common.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s\nlong-sustained prejudices gave way finally under the power of the thrice repeated command. \nWhen the devout Gentile Cornelius immediately thereafter appealed to him for the gospel, the\nfull meaning of the vision burst upon Peter and he exclaimed, &ldquo;God hath shewed me that I\nshould not call any man common or unclean&rdquo; (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7722\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7722)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7722)\">Acts 10:11-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd when those of the circumcised complained, Peter, now very sure, rehearsed the whole\nstory and concluded with these memorable words: \n<\/p><p>\nMen and brethren, ye know that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the\nGentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as\nhe did unto us; \n<\/p><p>\nAnd put no difference between us and them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7729\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7729)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7729)\">Acts 15:7-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n&ldquo;What was I that I could withstand God,&rdquo; he said in defense\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7728\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7728)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7728)\">Acts 11:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe gospel had been brought to the Jew or Israel, and now was to be taken to the Gentile.

Have you felt the magnanimity of the\nSavior, his kindness, his mercy, his love?\n<\/p><p>\nIf the Lord were to acknowledge a superior race, would it not be Israel, the very people\nwhom you would spurn and deprive?  Do you carry in your veins as pure Israelitish blood as\nthose whom you criticize?  Do you find any scriptures, my critic, which would show that the\nChrist would exclude the Lamanite Israelites from the waters of baptism, from the priesthood,\nfrom the pulpit, or from the temple?  Did not the Lord remove the Amalekites, Midianites,\nCanaanites to make place for the chosen Israel, and when centuries later he saw the\nimpending destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, and when it was imminent that Judah and\nIsrael were to be captured and exiled, did not the Lord send a righteous few, under Lehi, to\nfind and colonize this American land, this choicest land under heaven?  Did he not lead and\nteach and punish and forgive this same people through a thousand hectic years of varied\nexperience and did he not reiterate frequently his willingness to forgive and his eagerness to\nbless this very people?  Did not the Lord show special and preferred interest in his Israel? \nDid he not reserve for them alone his personal visits and ministrations?  And did he not\nhimself make a personal visit of many days to his Lehite people and say to them: \n<\/p><p>\nYe are my disciples . . .\n<\/p><p>\nAnd behold, this is the land of your inheritance; and the Father hath given it unto you.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd they [the Jews] understood me not that I said they [the Lehites] shall hear my\nvoice; and they understood me not that the Gentiles should not at any time\nhear my voice&mdash;that I should not manifest myself unto them save it were by the Holy Ghost.\n<\/p><p>\nBut behold, ye have both heard my voice, and seen me; and ye are my sheep, and ye are\nnumbered among those whom the Father hath given me\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5542\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5542)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5542)\">3 Ne. 15:12-13,23-24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWould those who scorn the Indian and deprive him of the blessings remember how the Lord\nloves his Lamanites and how he told his first leaders in this dispensation to\n<\/p><p>\n. . . journey among the Lamanites.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it shall be given thee . . . what thou shalt do\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13232\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13232)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13232)\">D&amp;C 28:14-15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nRemember how he authorized them to build up his Church &ldquo;among the Lamanites&rdquo;\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13233\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13233)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13233)\">D&amp;C 30:6<\/a><\/span>)\nand from the later Prophet, John Taylor, who said: &ldquo;And now we must instruct them\nfurther and organize them into churches with proper presidencies, attach them to our stakes\nand organizations&rdquo; (<i>The Gospel Kingdom<\/i>, p. 247).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the days immediately preceding the coming of the Lord, even the Lamanite Prophet\nSamuel felt the sting and smart of the caustic discriminations when he said: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, because I am a Lamanite, and have spoken unto you the words which the Lord\ncommanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are angry with me and do seek to\ndestroy me, and have cast me out from among you\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24683\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24683)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24683)\">Hel. 14:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf Mrs. Anonymous would exclude the Indian from the temple, how could she justify the\nLord&rsquo;s provision that they would assist in the building of the New Jerusalem with its temple?\n<\/p><p>\nO intolerance, thou art an ugly creature!

Their sufferings have been sore, their humiliation complete, their\npunishment severe and long, their heartaches many, and their opportunities reduced.  Has he\nnot now forgiven them and accepted them?  Can we not now forgive and accept them? \nAncient Israel was given forty years.

It means prejudging.  How many of us are guilty of it?  Often\nwe think ourselves free of its destructive force, but we need only to test ourselves.  Our\nexpressions, our voice tones, our movements, our thoughts betray us.  We are often so willing\nthat others make the contacts, do the proselyting, have the associations.  Until we project\nourselves into the very situation, we little realize our bias and our prejudice.\n<\/p><p>\nWhy will we, the prospered, the blessed, hiss?

Has our own nation ever exceeded a quarter century without war and\ncommotion?\n<\/p><p>\nLet us not spurn these Nephite-Lamanites until we are assured that we, too, have the love of\nthe Savior as did their people when the Lord stood in their midst and ordained them with his\nown hands, blessed them with his own voice, forgave them with his own great heart, broke\nthe bread, poured the wine, and gave the sacrament himself to these upright folk; until we\nshall have the privilege of feeling the prints of the nails in his hands and feet, and the spear\nwound in his side.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd in these living descendants are all the seeds of faith and growth and development, of\nhonor and integrity and greatness.  They wait but for opportunity, encouragement, and\nbrotherliness; and these will be redeemed, will rise and will become a blessed people. God\nhas said it.\n<\/p><p>\nI love the Lamanites, the Indians, and all their cousins.  I expect to see them rise and fulfil\ntheir destiny. I know that the prophecies concerning them will all be fulfilled.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless the Lamanite-Nephite peoples, stir their hearts; bless the missionaries that are\nsent unto them; and help us, their nursing parents. And may God speed the day of their total\ndeliverance.  This I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
