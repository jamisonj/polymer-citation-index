It was alleged that the baby\u2019s crying had so infuriated him that he had broken one of the child\u2019s limbs and several ribs. Alarming was the report of growing gang violence, with the number of gang-related killings having risen sharply. Another story that night involved the shooting of a woman by her estranged husband, who was reportedly in a jealous rage after finding her with another man. Then, of course, there was the usual coverage of wars and conflicts throughout the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/school-thy-feelings-o-my-brother.p6\" class=\"\">I thought of the words of the Psalmist: \u201cCease from anger, and forsake wrath.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-04211_000_023\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"119205\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 119205)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(119205)\">Psalm 37:8<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/school-thy-feelings-o-my-brother.p7\" class=\"\">Many years ago, a young couple called my office and asked if they could come in for counseling. They indicated they had suffered a tragedy in their lives and that their marriage was in serious jeopardy. An appointment was arranged.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/school-thy-feelings-o-my-brother.p8\" class=\"\">The tension between this husband and wife was apparent as they entered my office. Their story unfolded slowly at first as the husband spoke haltingly and the wife cried quietly and participated very little in the conversation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/school-thy-feelings-o-my-brother.p9\" class=\"\">The young man had returned from serving a mission and was accepted to a prestigious university in the eastern part of the United States. It was there, in a university ward, that he had met his future wife. She was also a student at the university. After a year of dating, they journeyed to Utah and were married in the Salt Lake Temple, returning east shortly afterward to finish their schooling.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/school-thy-feelings-o-my-brother.p10\" class=\"\">By the time they graduated and returned to their home state, they were expecting their first child and the husband had employment in his chosen field. The wife gave birth to a baby boy. Life was good.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/school-thy-feelings-o-my-brother.p11\" class=\"\">When their son was about 18 months old, they decided to take a short vacation to visit family members who lived a few hundred miles away. This was at a time when car seats for children and seat belts for adults were scarcely heard of, let alone used. The three members of the family all rode in the front seat with the toddler in the middle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/school-thy-feelings-o-my-brother.p12\" class=\"\">Sometime during the trip, the husband and wife had a disagreement. After all these years, I cannot recall what caused it. But I do remember that their argument escalated and became so heated that they were eventually yelling at one another. Understandably, this caused their young son to begin crying, which the husband said only added to his anger. Losing total control of his temper, he picked up a toy the child had dropped on the seat and flung it in the direction of his wife.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/school-thy-feelings-o-my-brother.p13\" class=\"\">He missed hitting his wife.

I counseled and encouraged them. We talked of commitment and responsibility, of acceptance and forgiveness. We spoke of the affection and respect which needed to return to their family. We read words of comfort from the scriptures. We prayed together. Though I have not heard from them since that day so long ago, they were smiling through their tears as they left my office. All these years I\u2019ve hoped they made the decision to remain together, comforted and blessed by the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/school-thy-feelings-o-my-brother.p15\" class=\"\">I think of them whenever I read the words: \u201cAnger doesn\u2019t solve anything.

To be certain all was done fairly, they agreed that they should not save what were called the strippings, but that the milk and strippings should all go together. Strippings came at the end of the milking and were richer in cream.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/school-thy-feelings-o-my-brother.p30\" class=\"\">Sister Harris was faithful to the agreement, but Sister Marsh, desiring to make some especially delicious cheese, saved a pint of strippings from each cow and sent Sister Harris the milk without the strippings. This caused the two women to quarrel. When they could not settle their differences, the matter was referred to the home teachers to settle. They found Elizabeth Marsh guilty of failure to keep her agreement. She and her husband were upset with the decision, and the matter was then referred to the bishop for a Church trial. The bishop\u2019s court decided that the strippings were wrongfully saved and that Sister Marsh had violated her covenant with Sister Harris.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/school-thy-feelings-o-my-brother.p31\" class=\"\">Thomas Marsh appealed to the high council, and the men comprising this council confirmed the bishop\u2019s decision.

His affidavit led to\u2014or at least was a factor in\u2014Governor Lilburn Boggs\u2019s cruel extermination order, which resulted in over 15,000 Saints being driven from their homes, with all the terrible suffering and consequent death that followed.
