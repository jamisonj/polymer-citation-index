To stand before you in this capacity is a most serious and sacred responsibility. I claim no special talent. I hope that all of you realize that I am not here of my own choice. I did not seek this responsibility. It was placed upon me by the prophet of the Lord. It is one from which I cannot shrink.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p5\" class=\"\">I am driven by two resolutions. The first is to serve the Lord to the very best of my ability. I think I understand, in some small measure at least, what that means. The second is to serve His chosen prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball, and lift from his shoulders every burden that I legitimately can. I consider these to be sacred and binding obligations and more important than all other considerations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p6\" class=\"\">I am profoundly grateful to my Brethren of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, who consistently and without exception have met every request and every assignment given them. They have been most supportive. The same holds true for the members of the First Quorum of the Seventy and the Presiding Bishopric. I repeat what I have said before at this pulpit, that there is perfect unity among the Brethren. They are not yes-men. Each is a man of understanding, of conviction, of great proven ability. Each is also a man of humility, with a willingness to subdue all personal considerations and place first the work of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p7\" class=\"\">My constant association with these able and dedicated Brethren is for me a constantly unfolding miracle. We deal with many problems of a serious nature, with many forces impacting on the solution to those problems. Each man is encouraged and is free to give his opinion and express his judgment. It is a most remarkable and wonderful thing to witness how, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, there is a gradual melding of judgment, which invariably leads to a united decision.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p8\" class=\"\">No policy of importance, no action of consequence, is taken without consideration in the highest councils of the Church and without unanimity of feeling on the decisions reached. No such action is taken without earnest and sincere prayer and without a plea to the Almighty for guidance and revelation, and, further, without the approval of the President of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p9\" class=\"\">Some wonder about who is directing the Church. I give you my solemn testimony that inspiration from on high is received and that it is our Father in Heaven and His Beloved Son, the Redeemer of the world, who are guiding and directing this church to bring to pass their eternal purposes in behalf of the sons and daughters of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p10\" class=\"\">These are important and vital days in the work of the Lord. For instance, we are living in one of the most significant and important epochs in the history of the Church and in the history of God\u2019s work among His people. We are living in the greatest era of temple building ever witnessed, and of that I wish to speak for a few minutes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p11\" class=\"\">I sing with conviction our great Latter-day Saint hymn, \u201cWe thank thee, O God, for a prophet, to guide us in these latter days\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 19.) I sing it in appreciation for and tribute to the Prophet Joseph Smith, through whom the foundation of this work was revealed in this the dispensation of the fulness of times. I sing it in appreciation for and tribute to him whom we today honor as our prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p12\" class=\"\">Temple building and the dedication of temples have gone on at such a pace in the last few years that some pay little attention and feel it is of small significance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p13\" class=\"\">But the adversary has not been unmindful of it. The building and dedication of these sacred edifices have been accompanied by a surge of opposition from a few enemies of the Church as well as criticism from a few within. This has brought to mind a statement of Brigham Young in 1861 while the Salt Lake Temple was under construction. Evidently when someone with previous experience was asked to work on the Salt Lake Temple, he responded, \u201cI do not like to do it, for we never began to build a Temple without the bells of hell beginning to ring.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p14\" class=\"\">To which Brigham Young replied, \u201cI want to hear them ring again. All the tribes of hell will be on the move, if we uncover the walls of this Temple. But what do you think it will amount to? You have all the time seen what it has amounted to.\u201d (In <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 8:355\u201356.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p15\" class=\"\">Yes, in these recent times we have felt much of opposition, but we have also noted the frustration of those who have tried to stop this work. We have been strengthened, and we have moved forward under the promise of the Lord, who said: \u201cI will not suffer that they [the enemy] shall destroy my work; yea, I will show unto them that my wisdom is greater than the cunning of the devil.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18231\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18231)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18231)\">D&amp;C 10:43<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p16\" class=\"\">In little more than two and a half years we have dedicated sixteen new temples and rededicated the restored Manti Temple. Before the end of the year, we shall dedicate at least one more, so that we will have dedicated six in 1983, six in 1984, and six in 1985. This great impetus in temple building was given by President Kimball under revelation from the Lord, whose work this is. The sacred and important work that goes on in temples must be accelerated, and for this to happen, it is necessary that temples be taken closer to the people rather than having the people travel so far to temples.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p17\" class=\"\">I wish that anyone who has any doubt concerning the strength and power of this cause could have had the experiences that I have had in recent months in these dedicatory services in the United States, in Asia and Australia, in Mexico, Central America, and South America, in Europe and Africa. I have looked into the faces of tens of thousands of Latter-day Saints. Their skins are of varying colors and hues. But their hearts beat as one with testimony and conviction concerning the truth of this great restored work of God. I have heard their testimonies spoken with sincerity. I have listened to their prayers. I have heard them lift their voices in anthems of praise. I have seen their tears of gratitude. I have known of their sacrifices made in appreciation for the blessings that have come to them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p18\" class=\"\">Their languages have been many, but they have spoken as with one voice in testimony of divine and eternal truth restored to earth. These are men and women who love the Lord, who understand His eternal plan, who are imbued with a selflessness that prompts dedicated service without expectation of thanks or reward. It has been the same everywhere we have been. I wish there were time to speak of experiences in each of these many temple dedication services. I can touch only lightly on three or four.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p19\" class=\"\">I have been to Mexico a number of times extending over a period of many years.

They were clean, their faces bright and smiling, their clothes neat and attractive. They bore every mark of education and refinement. There was something of greatness apparent in them. Most of them have the blood of Lehi in their veins. The shackles of darkness have fallen from their eyes, as promised by the prophets of the Book of Mormon. They have become \u201ca pure and a delightsome people.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4147\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4147)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4147)\">2 Ne. 30:6<\/a><\/span>.)

It was my privilege to participate in the opening of missionary work in that land in 1961. At that time we did not have a building of any kind, and we had only one native member of the Church of whom we were aware. In 1984, only twenty-three years later, it was our privilege to dedicate a beautiful temple of the Lord in a choice area of the great metropolis of Manila. I looked into the faces of those thousands of enlightened and faithful Latter-day Saints on whom the Lord is pouring out His blessings in a marvelous and wonderful way. In less than a quarter of a century, from the one native member we found in 1961, the Church has grown to well over a hundred thousand. These are my friends, the people I love, among whom I have worked and to whom I have taught the gospel. The opening of the temple represented the fulness of gospel opportunity for them, the longed-for fruition of their dreams.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p22\" class=\"\">In Freiberg, Germany, this past August we dedicated another beautiful and sacred house of God. Before the dedication, when the building was open for public viewing, only a few less than ninety thousand came to enter its precincts. Many stood in the rain for hours.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p23\" class=\"\">The faithful Saints sacrificed their money, their jewelry, their comfort to assist in building that temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p24\" class=\"\">One of their number who attended the dedication wrote: \u201cThere was a solemn stillness, and there was not a dry eye. The sun was shining after a long time. \u2026 You could sense gladness and enthusiasm and the wish for a never-ending harmony. \u2026 Tears, laughter, and gladness; everything was present.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p25\" class=\"\">While recognizing the different political philosophies under which we live, I express sincere appreciation to the officials of the government of that nation for their help in making possible this sacred edifice for the blessing of our brethren and sisters in that land.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p26\" class=\"\">We recently returned from Johannesburg, South Africa. Here in the United States we see in the public press and on television much of conflict in that area.

Mingling together as brethren and sisters, bound by eternal covenants with the Almighty, were people with different roots. Among them were those descended from the Dutch who long ago went to that land, those who descended from the British who had fought the Dutch, and also those who came of the native peoples of Africa. There was fellowship, there was love, there was unity and mutual respect among all assembled in the house of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p27\" class=\"\">We experienced much of rejoicing on these sacred occasions, not only in the temples I have named, but in every other as well. Following the dedication of each of these temples, the ordinance work was begun, and it has gone forward without let or hindrance to the blessing of thousands on this side of the veil and tens of thousands on the other side of the veil. If there is any work in all the world that demonstrates the universality of God\u2019s love, it is the selfless work that goes on in these sacred houses.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/rejoice-in-this-great-era-of-temple-building.p28\" class=\"\">Jesus Christ, the Son of God, gave His life on Calvary\u2019s cross as an atonement for the sins of mankind.

And beyond this, through the keys of the holy priesthood conferred upon the Twelve by the Lord when He walked among them, which keys were restored in this dispensation by those who held them anciently\u2014through these have come great added blessings, including those unique and remarkable ordinances administered in the house of the Lord.
