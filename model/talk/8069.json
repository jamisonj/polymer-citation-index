We believe the same Church founded by the Savior anciently has been reestablished on the earth by Him in the latter days.

As members of the Church, we do not receive prizes or bonus points in a heavenly contest. We are not seeking simply to increase the numerical size of the Church. And most importantly, we are not attempting to coerce you to believe as we do. We are inviting you to hear the restored truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ so you can study, ponder, pray, and come to know for yourself if the things we are sharing with you are true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">Some of you may respond, \u201cBut I already believe in Jesus and follow His teachings,\u201d or \u201cI am not sure if God really exists.\u201d Our invitations to you are not an attempt to diminish your religious tradition or life experience.

Rather, our desire to share the restored gospel of Jesus Christ with you is a reflection of how important these truths are to us. I believe I can best describe why we are so forthright in seeking to explain our beliefs to you through an experience my wife and I had many years ago with two of our sons.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">One evening Susan and I stood near a window in our home and watched two of our little boys playing outside. During the course of their adventures, the younger of the two boys was injured slightly in a small accident. We quickly recognized that he was not seriously hurt, and we decided not to provide immediate assistance. We wanted to observe and see if any of our family discussions about brotherly kindness had sunk in. What happened next was both interesting and instructive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">The older brother consoled and carefully helped the younger brother back into the house. Susan and I had positioned ourselves near the kitchen so we could see what next took place, and we were prepared to intervene immediately if additional bodily harm seemed likely or a serious accident was imminent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">The older brother dragged a chair to the kitchen sink. He climbed up on the chair, assisted his brother onto the chair, turned on the water, and proceeded to pour a large quantity of dishwashing soap onto the scratched arm of his little brother. He did his best to gently wash away the dirt. The reaction of the little brother to this procedure can only be described accurately using language from the holy scriptures: \u201cAnd they shall have cause to howl, and weep, and wail, and gnash their teeth\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130428\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130428)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130428)\">Mosiah 16:2<\/a><\/span>). And did that little boy howl!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">After the scrubbing was finished, the arm was carefully dried with a towel. Eventually the screaming stopped. The older brother next climbed up onto the kitchen counter, opened a cabinet, and found a new tube of medicated ointment. Though the scratches on his little brother were not large or extensive, the older brother applied almost all of the ointment in the tube to the entire injured arm. The screaming did not resume, as the little brother clearly liked the soothing effect of the ointment much more than he appreciated the cleansing effect of the dishwashing soap.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p22\" class=\"\" id=\"p22\">The older brother returned again to the cabinet in which he had found the ointment and located a new box of sterile bandages. He then unwrapped and put bandages all up and down his brother\u2019s arm\u2014from the wrist to the elbow. With the emergency resolved, and with soap bubbles, ointment, and wrappers all over the kitchen, the two little boys hopped down from the chair with bright smiles and happy faces.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">What happened next is most important. The injured brother gathered up the remaining bandages and the almost empty tube of ointment, and he went back outside. He quickly sought out his friends and began to put ointment and bandages on their arms. Susan and I both were struck by the sincerity, enthusiasm, and rapidity of his response.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p24\" class=\"\" id=\"p24\">Why did that little boy do what he did? Please note that he immediately and intuitively wanted to give to his friends the very thing that had helped him when he was hurt. That little boy did not have to be urged, challenged, prompted, or goaded to act. His desire to share was the natural consequence of a most helpful and beneficial personal experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p25\" class=\"\" id=\"p25\">Many of us as adults behave in precisely the same way when we find a treatment or medication that alleviates pain with which we have long suffered, or we receive counsel that enables us to face challenges with courage and perplexities with patience. Sharing with other people things that are most meaningful to us or have helped us is not unusual at all.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p26\" class=\"\" id=\"p26\">This same pattern is especially evident in matters of great spiritual importance and consequence. For example, an account in a volume of scripture known as the Book of Mormon highlights a dream received by an ancient prophet-leader named Lehi. The central feature in Lehi\u2019s dream is the tree of life\u2014which is a representation of \u201cthe love of God\u201d that is \u201cmost desirable above all things\u201d and \u201cmost joyous to the soul\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130429\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130429)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130429)\">1\u00a0Nephi 11:22\u201323<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130430\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130430)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130430)\">1\u00a0Nephi 8:12, 15<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p27\" class=\"\" id=\"p27\">Lehi explained:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p28\" class=\"\" id=\"p28\">\u201cAnd it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I ever before tasted.

Thus, as he turned to Christ, he also turned outward in love and service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p32\" class=\"\" id=\"p32\">Another important episode in the Book of Mormon describes what happened to a man named Enos after his earnest and pleading prayer was heard and answered by God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p33\" class=\"\" id=\"p33\">He said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p34\" class=\"\" id=\"p34\">\u201cAnd my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p35\" class=\"\" id=\"p35\">\u201cAnd there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p36\" class=\"\" id=\"p36\">\u201cAnd I, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt was swept away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p37\" class=\"\" id=\"p37\">\u201cAnd I said: Lord, how is it done?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p38\" class=\"\" id=\"p38\">\u201cAnd he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen. \u2026 Wherefore, go to, thy faith hath made thee whole.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p39\" class=\"\" id=\"p39\">\u201cNow, it came to pass that <span class=\"emphasis\">when I had heard these words I began to feel a desire for the welfare of my brethren, the Nephites; wherefore, I did pour out my whole soul unto God for them<\/span>\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130432\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130432)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130432)\">Enos 1:4\u20139<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p40\" class=\"\" id=\"p40\">As Enos turned to the Lord \u201cwith full purpose of heart\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130433\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130433)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130433)\">2\u00a0Nephi 31:13<\/a><\/span>), his concern for the welfare of his family, friends, and associates increased simultaneously.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/come-and-see.p41\" class=\"\" id=\"p41\">The enduring lesson we learn from these two episodes is the importance of experiencing in our personal lives the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ as a prerequisite to heartfelt and authentic service that stretches far beyond merely \u201cgoing through the motions.\u201d Much like Lehi, Enos, and our little boy in the story I recounted, we as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have felt the anguish associated with spiritual uncertainty and sin.
