Someone, perhaps a mother, a Primary teacher, a neighbor, or even a song like \u201cI Am a Child of God,\u201d has made this little boy realize he is someone. He knew he wasn\u2019t junk.

They are the victims of poor monetary habits and often have no idea of the importance of proper money management. They misuse credit, especially credit cards, and don\u2019t live within budgets or wise operational guidelines. For many of us, credit is like a magic carpet on which we can fly to places we couldn\u2019t ordinarily get to. We ride free at first, but forget that a little later we will have to pay for the magic carpet.

One who really understands and practices empathy doesn\u2019t solve another\u2019s problems, doesn\u2019t argue, doesn\u2019t top his story, make accusations, or take away free agency.

His principles are consistent and never changing. Practices may be altered as situations warrant, but the Lord\u2019s principles are ever stable. The success of welfare services depends on obedience to the basic gospel laws upon which it is built. There is room for innovation and use of free agency when we look for wise ways to serve as long as we stay within the framework of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">May I, in conclusion, suggest some basic goals as we participate in welfare services:<\/p>\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Build self-respect by building self-reliance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Give help and service in the Lord\u2019s own way, which is a balance of agency and accountability.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Realize the proper sequence of sources of help is (1) the individual, (2) the family, and (3) the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">4.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Be aware that to feed His sheep, one must know who and where they are.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">5.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Proper assisting requires love, empathy, and the restoration of dignity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">6.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Finally, welfare services requires planning, obedience to basic gospel principles, and above all the willingness to serve as our prophet serves, with unconditional love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/give-with-wisdom-that-they-may-receive-with-dignity.p52\" class=\"\">May God help us to give of ourselves with wisdom that they may receive with dignity. Truly, \u201cGod makes no junk.\u201d We are His children. He loves us and wants us to love ourselves, our families, and our neighbors in a meaningful way. I am pleased with this great arm of the Church. It is an inspired way of life. It is the implementation of eternal principles for the welfare and benefit of all mankind. It is welfare services. To this I leave my witness, testimony, and love in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
