If, however, we have no desire to improve, if we have no intention of following the guidance of the Spirit, we must ask: Are we worthy to partake, or are we making a mockery of the very purpose of the sacrament, which is to act as a catalyst for personal repentance and improvement? If we remember the Savior and all he has done and will do for us, we will improve our actions and thus come closer to him, which keeps us on the road to eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-beauty-and-importance-of-the-sacrament.p18\" class=\"\">If, however, we refuse to repent and improve, if we do not remember him and keep his commandments, then we have stopped our growth, and that is damnation to our souls.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-beauty-and-importance-of-the-sacrament.p19\" class=\"\">The sacrament is an intensely personal experience, and we are the ones who knowingly are worthy or otherwise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-beauty-and-importance-of-the-sacrament.p20\" class=\"\">Do you remember the feeling you had when you were baptized\u2014that sweet, clean feeling of a pure soul, having been forgiven, washed clean through the merits of the Savior? If we partake of the sacrament worthily, we can feel that way regularly, for we renew that covenant, which includes his forgiveness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-beauty-and-importance-of-the-sacrament.p21\" class=\"\">Those who would deny themselves the blessing of the sacrament by not attending sacrament meeting or by not thinking of the Savior during the services surely must not understand the great opportunity to be forgiven, to have his Spirit to guide and comfort them!

For example, if we aren\u2019t paying our tithing, we simply determine to start doing so. But for some problems, we must see our bishop\u2014the Spirit will let us know which. Doing what the Spirit dictates always results in blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-beauty-and-importance-of-the-sacrament.p24\" class=\"\">Let me give an example. Some years ago, a young couple we will call the Joneses visited with their bishop about a problem the wife had. The details are not important, but through the direction of the Spirit, the bishop\u2019s decision was that, among other things, Sister Jones would not partake of the sacrament for a period of time while she worked out some attitudes and problems.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-beauty-and-importance-of-the-sacrament.p25\" class=\"\">With lots of love and support, she continued to attend meetings with her family, and few but her husband and the bishop were aware of the situation or even noticed that week after week she did not partake of the sacrament. At first she didn\u2019t feel much difference; but as time went on, she became more and more desirous to be worthy to partake of the sacrament. She thought she had repented before, but as the real soul-searching deepened and as her desire to worthily partake of the sacrament increased, true fundamental changes began to take place in her life and in her actions and in her thinking.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-beauty-and-importance-of-the-sacrament.p26\" class=\"\">More time passed. Finally, during one sacrament meeting, the Spirit bore witness to the bishop and to Brother and Sister Jones that the time had come for her to again partake of the sacrament. \u201cNext Sunday,\u201d the bishop said.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-beauty-and-importance-of-the-sacrament.p27\" class=\"\">Next Sunday came, and Sister Jones sat again with her family, nervous, yet excited and full of anticipation. \u201cAm I really worthy? How I want to be!\u201d she thought. The sacrament hymn was more meaningful than ever. She sang with such feeling that it was difficult to hold back the tears. And the sacrament prayers\u2014how profound! She listened so intently that every word sank deep into her soul\u2014to take his name, always remember him, keep his commandments, always have his Spirit.

As one young deacon got closer and closer to her row, her heart began to pound harder and harder. Then the tray was coming down her very row. Now her husband was holding the tray in front of her! Tears streamed down her face. There was a barely audible sob of joy, \u201cOh!\u201d as she reached for the emblem of the Lord\u2019s love for her. The congregation did not hear the sob, but they did notice the tears in the bishop\u2019s eyes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-beauty-and-importance-of-the-sacrament.p29\" class=\"\">Life and hope and forgiveness and spiritual strength had been given and received.
