She sensed the boy\u2019s embarrassment and feared he would live up to his reputation, so she wrote a note and slipped it to him as she passed his desk. It said, \u201cEarl, I think the principal was mistaken about your being a bad boy. I trust you, and know that you are going to help me make this room the best in the school.\u201d Earl not only became a paragon of scholastic virtue but also one of the town\u2019s most important people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/judge-not-that-ye-be-not-judged.p24\" class=\"\">I should like to give you another example. One of our most respected community-minded citizens began to act as though his feelings had been hurt and to stay away from socials where, in the past, he had gone and taken a most active part. People started accusing him of being a sorehead, a poor sport, antisocial, etc., and even evaded him whenever possible. Later, a medical diagnosis showed he was suffering from a brain tumor, which had been the cause of his lack of interest in activities that he had previously attended and even sponsored.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/judge-not-that-ye-be-not-judged.p25\" class=\"\">Let me give you another example or two of what I would call unrighteous judgment. First, a bishop who needs additional officers sees a member of his ward who, though not active, seems to have ability, but he says to himself, \u201cOh, he wouldn\u2019t be interested. He wouldn\u2019t want to accept a position.\u201d So he does not approach him, and the man remains inactive for years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/judge-not-that-ye-be-not-judged.p26\" class=\"\">A new bishop is called to the ward, asks the man if he would be willing to accept a position, and finds that he is really ready and anxious to work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/judge-not-that-ye-be-not-judged.p27\" class=\"\">Don\u2019t prejudge, but give the person an opportunity.

You would think he would know better.\u201d Here he is judging the bishop without the facts, which, if known to him, would be full justification for the action taken.

By referring to Samuel\u2019s experience while choosing a king, we may get a better understanding of the fact that man is not qualified to judge. The Lord had rejected Saul as king of Israel and instructed the prophet Samuel to choose a new king. He told him to go to the house of Jesse, who had eight sons, and that while there the anointed one would pass before him and Samuel would know who was to be chosen. When the first son, Eliab, came before him, Samuel thought he was the chosen one, but the Lord refused him and then gave the prophet Samuel the key as to how to judge:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/judge-not-that-ye-be-not-judged.p36\" class=\"\">\u201cLook not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2594\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2594)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2594)\">1 Sam. 16:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/judge-not-that-ye-be-not-judged.p37\" class=\"\">Each of the seven sons then passed before Samuel and was rejected.

Because of a different environment, unequal opportunity, and many other things, people are not in the same position. One may start at the top and the other at the bottom, and they may meet as they are going in opposite directions. Someone has said that it is not where you are but the direction in which you are going that counts; not how close you are to failure or success but which way you are headed. How can we, with all our weaknesses and frailties, dare to arrogate to ourselves the position of a judge? At best, man can judge only what he sees; he cannot judge the heart or the intention, or begin to judge the potential of his neighbor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/judge-not-that-ye-be-not-judged.p40\" class=\"\">When we try to judge people, which we should not do, we have a great tendency to look for and take pride in finding weaknesses and faults, such as vanity, dishonesty, immorality, and intrigue.
