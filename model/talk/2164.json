Christiansen is concerned, God lives, and he is a compassionate, understanding Father; and his Son, Jesus Christ, came to earth, as the Bible tells us, and offered himself and actually gave his life that we might be redeemed from the grave and might have eternal life, salvation, which to us means exaltation in the celestial world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p4\" class=\"\">I testify that Joseph Smith was selected by God and Jesus Christ to restore the gospel in this day and that Joseph Fielding Smith, whom we appreciate, is one of a succession of modern-day prophets, seers, and revelators.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p5\" class=\"\">Now, this is a world in difficulty and trouble, but we shouldn\u2019t merely bemoan the fact. We should, as far as our powers can help us, be anxiously engaged in rectifying it. Just before we sang, I wrote this down: If you and I are to help restore this sick world to its spiritual health, we must begin at the proper place\u2014that is, with ourselves and with our families. This we can do!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p6\" class=\"\">One of the most rewarding of all human undertakings is that of making a success of marriage and of rearing children in a manner acceptable to the Lord. It calls for the best in all of us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p7\" class=\"\">While many, both in and out of the Church, are eminently successful in rearing their families, it is clearly evident that there are fathers and mothers who are divesting themselves of their sacred obligation to counsel their children and to give them the parental warmth and interest that they deserve. Some parents are quite willing to let others tend, and teach, and train their most precious possessions\u2014their children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p8\" class=\"\">Did you hear the timely admonition of our president and prophet this morning, pleading for fathers to take their rightful places at the head of their households in righteousness?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p9\" class=\"\">An authenticated study shows that two million children in America live in homes where serious trouble exists between parents. Six and a half million children live with only one parent, and another million have been \u201cfarmed out\u201d to relatives or friends or institutions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p10\" class=\"\">Some worthy institutions have been developed to help improve the home and family life. But helpful as these agencies may be, I am convinced, and I believe you will agree, that there is not and never will be a better institution for improving the home than the home itself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p11\" class=\"\">Parents cannot, without regrettable consequences, shirk the responsibility of teaching and showing their children through their example the attributes of character that lead them unhesitatingly to appreciate and accept the good, the decent, the beautiful, and help them to develop the desire and the courage to turn from that which is coarse or crude or wrong.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p12\" class=\"\">To help us develop desirable qualities in our children, we are provided with divinely given programs such as the family home evenings, and for the life of me I cannot understand why every single family in the Church doesn\u2019t grasp the opportunities provided through family home evening\u2014it costs nothing; it isn\u2019t necessary to leave home; and yet it is one of the most effective ways of cementing the unity of our families that has ever come to us, and when consistently used, it has proven to be a marvelous means of making family life secure and meaningful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p13\" class=\"\">Parenthood is a sacred trust.

But suddenly it became necessary for his wife to enter the hospital for surgery. He and the children felt sorry for her because she was in the hospital. At the same time she was sad, thinking that her husband and the children would be disappointed. But when she read the little note that came with a bouquet of flowers, she felt better, for it read: \u201cSweetheart, ten years with you have seemed like ten days, but ten days without you have seemed like ten years.\u201d Signed, \u201cBill.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p29\" class=\"\">Another essential in successful parenthood is for fathers and mothers to avoid disputations. Such situations may seem harmless to the parents, but in the eyes of their children, the two most important people in the world are in conflict, and from their limited perspective, the whole world is in trouble. Situations thus created are an indication of immaturity and weakness on the part of those involved. Someone has said that one of the most important things a father can do for his children is to love and respect their mother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p30\" class=\"\">I plead with parents to rise above pettiness and to spare their children the inglorious and painful insecurity of having to endure petty disputations and offensive situations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p31\" class=\"\">It is important also to keep the avenues of communication open. It is wonderful when a father or a mother will sit down with a son or a daughter and discuss a personal problem (and they have their problems, which, if we are wise, we will not minimize). There are pressures, and enticements, and even unjust accusations against which our sons and daughters need to be fortified. It is even more wonderful when, because of the love and closeness that exists, children feel no hesitancy in taking their problems to their parents.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p32\" class=\"\">In such heart-to-heart talks, parents will help to set objectives for their children, such as:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/successful-parenthood-a-noteworthy-accomplishment.p33\" class=\"\">1.
