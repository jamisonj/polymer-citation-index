What a magnificent sight and how gently, softly, tenderly our hearts respond to the strong, pure voices of this rising generation. These daughters of God that you have heard sing represent almost three hundred thousand young women\u2014our valiant, younger sisters on whom so much depends, standing as guardians on the frontier of the kingdom of God. How appropriate that their testimonies, borne through music, are part of this historic occasion. Miles separate; the spirit unites. We come to receive counsel from a prophet of God. As one eminent international editor observed, \u201cIf there is an answer to the moral decadence of the world today, it will come through the Mormon Church which claims continuous revelation.\u201d To this fact I bear fervent testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p5\" class=\"\">This evening our prophet speaks specifically to us\u2014female members of the Lord\u2019s church. But his message is for all the women of the earth who have ears to hear and hearts to understand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p6\" class=\"\">The one whose name this church bears has equal and unconditional love for each of his children\u2014both those who know him and those who do not know him so well. Whatever your current situation, my sisters, he reaches out to you. And so does his earthly mouthpiece. Come, let us listen to a prophet\u2019s voice. How blessed I have been to be called to serve in various general capacities these past thirty-one years through and under the inspired leadership of four prophets, men of God\u2019s choice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p7\" class=\"\">But tonight I come without the mantle of a calling or the official voice of an organization. I come as a woman, as a wife, as a mother, as a handmaiden of the Lord, but most important of all, as a daughter of God and a member of his church\u2014an identity I share with nearly all within the sound of my voice. I have pleaded with my Heavenly Father to guide me in preparing for the awesome responsibility I face. May his love make us one, though we span the globe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p8\" class=\"\">I have prayed fervently to know which, of all that could be said, should be said. I have been prompted to share with you a sacred personal experience. It so graphically demonstrates the reality, the nearness, the infinite love of Jesus Christ, that several times in the past I had thought to tell of it publicly. Always I was led not to do so. This evening, the Spirit whispers yes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p9\" class=\"\">May it help you to feel an expanded awareness of the Savior\u2019s deep personal involvement in each individual life. He is real. He is near, and he loves more than we can comprehend.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p10\" class=\"\">Our first two children were beautiful little girls. During my third pregnancy, a critical situation developed. It was soon recognized to be life-threatening. Medical experts advised us that there were two alternatives\u2014my probable death, or therapeutic abortion of the child growing within me. The Holy Ghost testified there was no option\u2014I would continue to carry our unborn child. Others in similar situations may well receive a different witness from him. This was personal revelation and was accepted. Anguishing months followed, months of pleading with the Lord that those near to me would have the same conviction, months of applying the power of the priesthood through my husband\u2019s administrations. At last a healthy child was born\u2014our first and only son. My life was spared. This is background for the incident that I feel prompted to share with you this evening.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p11\" class=\"\">It occurred when this most treasured, little son was nearly three years old. One day, suddenly and without warning, he stopped breathing and fell to the floor, apparently lifeless. My husband was not home, and I called my ten-year-old daughter, Nancy, to get help as I carried him to the bedroom. As I worked to revive him, I literally, cried out unto the Lord. I begged him to spare our only son. I promised that I would dedicate myself to training him up to be an instrument in the hands of God if he would be spared. The police arrived with their emergency equipment. I continued in fervent, vocal prayer to the Lord, petitioning him to restore our little boy. The doctor arrived. Just as a stimulant was to be injected directly into his heart as a final emergency measure, he cried. My prayers had been answered, but I was to receive further testimony of this in a most unexpected way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p12\" class=\"\">The next morning, our son climbed on his daddy\u2019s knee. \u201cI was sitting on the lap of Jesus,\u201d he said. Then he went on, \u201cHe looked into my eyes. I was so happy. I wanted to stay there with him, but he told me I had to go back home to you.\u201d Even now, twenty-four years later, our son remembers vividly the reciprocal love he experienced during his brief \u201cstep out of time.\u201d He is vigorous and well, living with his lovely wife and a little son of his own as he continues to serve the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p13\" class=\"\">Just as this child, for that one brief moment, knew and felt the love of the Savior, may we, as women of all ages, as daughters of God, as wives, as mothers, as contributing members of society whose identities are being challenged, seek to know him well enough to love him, well enough to serve him. Seek his face. Reciprocate his love. Reflect it to others. Consider this sobering thought as expressed by C. S. Lewis: \u201cIt is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and godesses\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Weight of Glory, <\/span>Grand Rapids, Mich: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1965, pp. 14\u201315.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p14\" class=\"\">Jesus Christ is our Savior, our brother, our friend. He is as near as we allow him to be. Our only ultimate joy and happiness is predicated upon our relationship with him. Our only peace, through disappointments, sorrow, and challenges, will come as we draw nearer unto him. With such love for our Redeemer, every difficult experience may be met with courage, acceptance, and even gratitude. His love for us is a gift beyond price. What does he ask in return? \u201cLove one another; as I have loved you.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28960\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28960)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28960)\">John 13:34<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p15\" class=\"\">To these truths I bear solemn witness, for I know this is God\u2019s church. I know God lives, as does his Beloved Son, our Savior Jesus Christ; and the Lord\u2019s word will go forth this night through his chosen mouthpiece, President Spencer W. Kimball. May we listen to a prophet\u2019s voice, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
