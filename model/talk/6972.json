Her mothering influence has been felt by many hundreds, perhaps thousands of people, and she has refined the role of nurturer to an art form. Her testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and strong sense of identity and purpose have guided her life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/a-mother-heart.p5\" class=\"\">She took longer than most women to find her husband, but during her single years she had devoted her life to progress. Though it was uncommon at the time, she was university educated and advancing in a career. Following her marriage, children arrived in quick succession; and in a short span of years, she was the mother of a large family. All the knowledge she had acquired, all her natural abilities and gifts, all her skills were channeled into an organization that had no earthly bounds. As a covenant-keeping daughter of God, she had prepared all her life for motherhood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/a-mother-heart.p6\" class=\"\">What is a mother heart and how is one acquired?

A woman with a mother heart has a testimony of the restored gospel, and she teaches the principles of the gospel without equivocation. She is keeping sacred covenants made in holy temples. Her talents and skills are shared unselfishly. She gains as much education as her circumstances will allow, improving her mind and spirit with the desire to teach what she learns to the generations who follow her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/a-mother-heart.p7\" class=\"\">If she has children, she is a \u201cgoodly parent\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43376\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43376)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43376)\">1 Ne. 1:1<\/a><\/span>) who lives and teaches standards of behavior exactly in line with the teachings of living prophets.
