These reporters were somewhat informed and appeared amazed about the Church\u2019s growth and progress as measured by the increase of converts. I said to them, \u201cWe\u2019re grateful for this rapid growth in numbers. But we are even more grateful for the growth in faith and spirituality.\u201d I then quoted some statistics in support of that statement. When I first came into the Council of the Twelve in 1943, I said, the average attendance at sacrament meeting\u2014our Sunday preaching service\u2014was about 20 percent. Today worldwide attendance is about 41 percent. Youth attendance is 46 percent, and attendance in the Primary\u2014our young children\u2014is 67 percent.
