I have received the sweet assurance also and the comforting assurance that there is no untimely passing of a prophet of God. President Lee\u2019s impressive earthly service is finished. He has been called to further important work in the great program of the Lord, which moves forward on both sides of the veil. He was a man with deep spiritual insight, with Christlike attributes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/missionary-work-a-major-responsibility.p6\" class=\"\">His great objective has been to help save the souls of the children of men.

There is no richer program anywhere in the world for the building of men and women and providing the answers to the problems that face parents, families, and individuals.

He had been set apart by his brother, the Prophet Joseph. This great missionary traveled 25 miles that first day without disposing of a single copy of the new and strange book which he carried on his back. Seeking lodging for the night, faint and hungry, he was turned away, after briefly explaining his mission, with the words: \u201cYou liar, get out of my house. You shan\u2019t stay one minute with your books.\u201d Continuing his journey, discouraged and with heavy heart, he slept that first night under an apple tree.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/missionary-work-a-major-responsibility.p13\" class=\"\">So began, in the most inauspicious way, the missionary work of this dispensation through the restored church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/missionary-work-a-major-responsibility.p14\" class=\"\">One hundred and forty-four years have come and gone since that first humble missionary set out to carry the message of salvation to a confused world. In fulfillment of the all-important, God-given mandate, this great work has gone forward through the years unabated. It is a dramatic chapter in the history of a \u201cpeculiar people.\u201d But in all the annals of Christendom there is no greater evidence of courage, willingness to sacrifice, and unbounded devotion to duty. Men, women, and children all have joined in this heroic effort with no hope of material reward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/missionary-work-a-major-responsibility.p15\" class=\"\">These ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ, as they firmly believe themselves to be, have trudged through mud and snow, swum rivers, and gone without the common necessities of food, shelter, and clothing in response to a call. Voluntarily fathers and sons have left homes, families, and jobs to go to all parts of the world, enduring great physical hardship and unrelenting persecution. Families have been left behind, often in dire straits, willingly laboring the harder to provide means for \u201ctheir missionary.\u201d And through it all there has been a joy and satisfaction which has caused families at home to express gratitude for special blessings received and missionaries to refer to this period as \u201cthe happiest time of my life.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/missionary-work-a-major-responsibility.p16\" class=\"\">It has been conservatively estimated that between 140,000 and 150,000 full-time missionaries have served the Church since 1830, to say nothing of the thousands of local men and women who have performed valiant missionary services at home, numbering currently more than 20,000. These faithful emissaries, who have gone abroad, have expended from 98 to 105 million days of missionary effort at a cost, through loss of personal income and expense for living, of more than $420 to $450 million, and this does not include any costs of transportation to and from, or in the field, costs of administration at home or abroad, or expense of local missionary service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/missionary-work-a-major-responsibility.p17\" class=\"\">Probably no group of people of comparable size in all the world has made such a free-will offering to the spreading of righteousness, and this from people who are not wealthy and who, in addition, are expected to contribute one-tenth of their interest annually to \u201cthe work of the Lord,\u201d according to the ancient-modern law of the tithe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/missionary-work-a-major-responsibility.p18\" class=\"\">Why?

Yes, without doubt, it is the personal testimony of the divinity of this great latter-day work, faith in the commands of the Almighty, and our responsibility as his covenant children, the knowledge that God lives and loves his children, and the conviction that it is our mission to build and save men everywhere.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/missionary-work-a-major-responsibility.p20\" class=\"\">From the days of Father Adam to the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his successors, whenever the priesthood has been on the earth, a major responsibility has been the preaching of the saving, eternal principles of the gospel\u2014the plan of salvation.
