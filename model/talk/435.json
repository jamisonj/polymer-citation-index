Brother Ivins tells the story of a deacon who\nwas called, extemporaneously, to speak in one of our stakes. He stood up a minute and\nswitched from one foot to the other and said, \"Brothers and sisters, I am just stalling for\ntime.\" Then he preached a nice sermon on the Word of Wisdom. He then looked at them and\nsaid, \"I have surely put myself on the spot, haven't I?\"\n<\/p><p>\nDOES THE GOSPEL FIT?\n<\/p><p>\nNow brethren, I am happy to be here; I am happy in my work in the Church; I love the\nbrethren, and I love the Saints. I have the privilege of interviewing a good many missionaries\nas I travel from stake to stake, and I always ask them how they feel about going on a mission\nand how the gospel fits them. I say, \"When you go into a store to buy a suit of clothes, it\neither fits or it does not fit. Does the gospel fit you? How do you feel when you hear the\nProphet Joseph Smith's story of having gone into the woods to pray, and having seen the\nFather and the Son and what transpired there? Can you accept all of that; do you believe it?\nDo you believe that John the Baptist came and conferred the Aaronic Priesthood upon Joseph\nand Oliver and that Peter, James, and John conferred the Melchizedek Priesthood? And that\nElijah, Elias, and Moses brought the keys of their dispensations; does all that fit?\" When they\nsay it does, then I say: \"Then you know that we do not have just another Church&mdash;we have\nthe only true Church.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI feel that the most important thing in our teaching in this Church is\nto try to impress upon our people the truth of the gospel, and I want to tell you from my\nexperience that I do not think they have to be old men and old women to know the gospel is\ntrue. I have more young people at our conferences tell me they know the gospel is true, than\nthe older ones, and I believe them.\n<\/p><p>\nOn the day of Pentecost, Peter called the people to repentance and they were pricked in their\nhearts and said, \"Men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, repent and\nbe baptized, everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye\nshall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children,\nand to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7603\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7603)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7603)\">Acts 2:37-39<\/a><\/span>). And I know the\npromise is unto our children, and they can know the truth of the gospel through the gift of the\nHoly Ghost. I am not quite so much worried, sometimes, about the children as I am about the\nolder folk.\n<\/p><p>\nEZEKIEL'S CONTRIBUTION\n<\/p><p>\nI attended a Sunday School class not very long ago, and they were considering the life and\nmission of the prophet, Ezekiel, and the brother in charge of the class proceeded to say that\nwe did not know very much about Ezekiel. Then he told a little about the condition of the\nworld at the time Ezekiel lived, but said nothing about his teachings or prophecies. He was\nabout to close the class. I very seldom say anything in a Sunday School class when I am\nthere, but I said, \"Brother So-and-so, were you going to close right at that point?\" He said, \"I\nthought so, is there anything you would like to add?\" I told the class that Ezekiel had made\none contribution to this great Latter-day cause thousands of years ago, that no other prophet\nhad made, for it was he who gave us the knowledge that there were two records to be kept,\nnot only one of Judah and his posterity, but one of Joseph and his posterity\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23105\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23105)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23105)\">Ezek. 37:15-20<\/a><\/span>), and save for\nEzekiel we would not know that there was to be another volume of scripture, and I said that it\nseems to me we ought to capitalize on what Ezekiel left us.\n<\/p><p>\nMISSIONARY EXPERIENCES\n<\/p><p>\nIt reminded me of when I was in the mission field in the Eastern States. Into one home I\nwent, the man was not a member of the Church, and every time I would leave he would say,\n\"I believe I have been a Mormon all my life, but did not know it;\" but I could not get his\nwife to come in and listen to me. She would go into the next room and iron. You know\nironing is a quiet job. I do not need to tell you that I usually take my \"loud-speaker\" along\nwith me, just in case, and I made sure she heard all I had to say. The last visit I made there I\nsaid, \"Mrs. McDonald, you would surely honor me if you would come in today and listen to\nme.\" She finally consented. I said, \"You may never see me again in this world.\" We had just\nstarted our discussion and in walked her son from Harvard College. She said, \"My boy, you\nare just in time. You take this book,\" because I had her take the Bible to follow me, \"and you\nshow us how this man is trying to lead us astray.\" I took one hour\nand a half and I closed my Bible. The discussion that day was on the House of Israel, the new\nland the Lord had promised to Joseph, the ultimate final gathering in the latter days, and the\ntwo records to be kept; and I turned to her son from Harvard and said, \"You tell your mother\nhow I am trying to lead you astray, will you please?\" He said, \"Mother, this man is not trying\nto lead you astray, he is teaching you the truth.\" Before I left she said, \"Mr. Richards, even if\nI do not believe all you say, there is something about you I cannot help but like. Will you\npray with us before you go?\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn that same city we were holding a street meeting, and the Gospel Hall people were holding\na convention a short distance away. They adjourned their meeting to come and try and break\nup ours. I said, \"You men would like to be gentlemen, wouldn't you?\" As I recall, there were\nabout sixteen ministers there that night. I said, \"You give us twenty minutes to finish our\nmeeting and then we will stay thirty minutes and listen to you.\" I said to the crowd, \"Won't\nwe?\" There were between two and three hundred there, and they indicated they would. During\ntheir thirty minutes they painted the Prophet Joseph as black as anybody could. \"Why,\" they\nsaid, \"if you would let them, the Mormons would bind the Book of Mormon in the same\ncover with the Bible and ask us to take it and like it.\" I did not like to see that meeting close\nright at that point, so I stepped up to this minister and said, \"You would not mind if I made\nan announcement before the meeting closes, would you?\" He said, \"No, go ahead.\" So I\nturned to the crowd and said, \"If you will come back next Tuesday night at 7:30 we will tell\nyou why we bind the Book of Mormon in the same cover with the Bible and ask you to take\nit and like it.\" And I said, \"Bring your Bibles along with you because you will not need them\nafter next Tuesday night if you are not willing to accept the companion volume of scripture,\nEzekiel said the Lord would bring forth the record of Joseph which He would join to the\nrecord of the Jews and the two should become one in His hand\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23106\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23106)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23106)\">Ezek. 37:15-20<\/a><\/span>). When they came that night,\nand the crowd was larger than the previous one, I said, \"How can any of us stay the hand of\nGod from bringing forth the record He has promised?\" As I remember we sold sixteen copies\nof the Book of Mormon that night.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, I have had so many experiences that I cannot understand why we cannot plant the truth\nin the hearts of our people until no outside thing or movement in the world can have any\ninfluence with them. We have so much more to offer than any other church in the world.\n<\/p><p>\nI was out tracting in that city one day and I had been to a particular house several times when\nthe lady of the house said, \"Mr. Richards, what are you trying to do anyway, are you trying to\nmake Mormons out of all of us?\" \"Well,\" I said, \"I will tell you one thing,\nI will never ask you to join the Mormon Church,\" and that seemed to\nput her mind at ease. Then I said, \"If I could show you where you could trade a dollar for\nfive dollars, I would not have to ask you to do it, would I?\" After I had been home a few\nmonths I received a letter from her calling me \"Brother Richards.\" She said, \"I decided to\ntrade the dollar for five dollars. I was baptized a member of the Church last Friday night.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI think that any elder in Israel who cannot make Mormonism look better than five to one had\nbetter get hold of the scriptures and go to work and study the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nI was in The Hague, Holland, and was invited into the home of the owner of a large furniture\nstore. His associates were all business men. I cannot take the time to tell you how I got there,\nbut I was there by invitation, and I was there to discuss a certain subject of the gospel&mdash;the\nuniversal salvation of man, including the work for the dead. This happened to be a Bible class\nand they spent a night each week studying together. They all had their Bibles and they turned\nthe class over to me. After having discussed this subject for about an hour and a half, I closed\nmy Bible and there wasn't anything said for a few minutes. Finally the daughter of the house\nturned to her father and said. \"Father, I cannot understand; you always have the last word to\nsay on everything and tonight you have not said a word.\" He said, \"My daughter, there isn't\nanything to say. This man is teaching us things we have never heard of before and he is\nteaching them to us out of our own Bibles.\" And he did not have anything to say.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, why don't we teach these things to our children until they become like the Rock of\nGibraltar, founded upon a faith that cannot be moved?\n<\/p><p>\nETERNAL MARRIAGE\n<\/p><p>\nYou take our principle of eternal marriage and the eternal duration of the marriage covenant. I\nhave had similar experiences in teaching this principle. I spoke on this subject in Quitman,\nGeorgia, and I took the statement from Brother Rulon Howells' book, \"Do Men Believe What\nTheir Church Prescribes?\" and read what other churches prescribe on this subject. There is no\nchurch I have ever heard of that believes the marriage tie or the family unit will endure\nbeyond the grave. We cannot imagine anybody being satisfied with a religion like that unless\nhe is like the lady I met back in New Bedford. I tried to teach her this principle and she said,\n\"I'll tell you, Mr. Richards, if there is any marriage relationship beyond the grave, I'll take\nchances on getting something better than I have now.\" (Laughter.) \"If I live with my husband\nuntil I die, I think I will have done pretty well.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAs I say, I spoke on this subject in Quitman, Georgia, and at the close of the meeting a\nBaptist minister came up and introduced himself and told me who he was. I said, \"Did I\nmisquote you,\" because I had read of the belief of the Baptist Church on this subject. He said,\n\"No, Mr. Richards, it is just like you say, we do not all believe all the\nthings our churches prescribe.\" I said, \"You do not believe it either. Why do you not go home\nand teach your people the truth. They will be glad to receive it from you, and they are not yet\nready to accept it from the Mormon elders.\" That was all I could get out of him. He said, \"I\nwill see you again.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe next time I went to Quitman my picture appeared in the paper, because I was president of\nthe mission, and when I went up to that little church he was waiting for me. I said, \"I would\nbe glad to know what you thought of my last sermon.\" He said, \"Mr. Richards, I have been\nthinking about it ever since and I believe every word you said, only I would like to have\nheard the rest of it.\" You know I never quite get finished on a subject, the clock travels too\nfast. This principle is not difficult for even ministers to accept when you explain it to them.\n<\/p><p>\nI was at the Manti Temple recently with my father, and President Anderson, who is here\ntonight, told of a minister who had visited the temple grounds a few weeks ago. When he\nheard our story of our belief in eternal marriage and the eternal duration of the family unit he\nsaid, \"You know, I had two of my young people come to me recently, and they wanted me to\nmarry them for time and all eternity,\" and he said, \"I did it. I thought that was the kind of\nmarriage we all ought to have, but they do not teach it in their churches.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI spent an hour and a half in the study of one of the most prominent ministers in the United\nStates. He died a few weeks ago, and at the time of his death he was chaplain of the United\nStates Senate. While I was in his study we discussed this subject. He said, \"Mr. Richards, our\nchurch does not give us any hope that there will be a continuation of the marriage tie or the\nfamily unit beyond this life, but in my heart I find stubborn objections.\" Then he used this\nillustration, and it was better than I could have given him. I have used it since, myself. He\nsaid, \"When you take the kitten away from the cat, in a few days the cat has forgotten all\nabout the kitten, and when you take the calf away from the cow, in a few days the cow has\nforgotten about its calf; but when you take the child away from its mother's bosom, though\nshe lives to be a hundred years old, she never forgets the child of her bosom. I find it difficult\nto believe that God created love like that to perish in the grave.\" But he could not tell his\npeople that from the pulpit because he could not hold his job and teach them Mormonism.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to tell you that we have so much more than any other church that five to one does not\nbegin to show it. Why do we not get into the hearts of our boys and girls and our men and\nwomen so that no power under heaven will have the power to take them away from this\nChurch.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you in the great work you are doing, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
