Petersen, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1950, pp. 152-153<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nAs I have listened to these beautiful sermons on repentance, I have thought over and\nover again about one of the commandments given by the Savior in the Sermon on the Mount.\nIn it he said,\n<\/p><p>\nBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34336\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34336)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34336)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPERFECTING OF THE SAINTS\n<\/p><p>\nPaul tells us that the Church organization was given to us, among other reasons, for the\nperfecting of the Saints (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21645\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21645)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21645)\">Eph. 4:12<\/a><\/span>).\nIn spite of this commandment, and in spite of this statement of Paul,\nthere are some people who believe that it is impossible for us to become perfect. Perfection is\nnot for this life, they say, and so why try?\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to say that I believe with all my heart that if the Lord had any idea that we could\nnot begin in mortality on the march toward perfection, he would never have given us that\ncommandment: neither would he have given us a Church organization for the perfecting of\nthe Saints.\n<\/p><p>\n100% PERFECT\n<\/p><p>\nI believe that in many ways, here and now in mortality, we can begin to perfect ourselves. A\ncertain degree of perfection is attainable in this life. I believe that we can be one hundred\npercent perfect, for instance, in abstaining from the use of tea and coffee. We can be one\nhundred percent perfect in abstaining from liquor and tobacco. We can be one hundred\npercent perfect in paying a full and honest tithing. We can be one hundred percent perfect in\nabstaining from eating two meals on fast day and giving to the bishop as fast offering the\nvalue of those two meals from which we abstain.\n<\/p><p>\nWe can be one hundred percent perfect in keeping the commandment which says that we shall\nnot profane the name of God. We can be perfect in keeping the commandment which says,\n\"Thou shalt not commit adultery\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22610\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22610)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22610)\">Ex. 20:14<\/a><\/span>).\nWe can be perfect in keeping the\ncommandment which says, \"Thou shalt not steal\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22611\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22611)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22611)\">Ex. 20:15<\/a><\/span>). We can become perfect in\nkeeping various others of the commandments that the Lord has given us.\n<\/p><p>\nI am confident that one of the great desires of the Lord our God is that we shall keep that\ngreat commandment which says, \"Be ye therefore perfect\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34337\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34337)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34337)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>), and that we may\ndo so is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
