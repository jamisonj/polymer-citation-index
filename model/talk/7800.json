I walked away from the door feeling that that [woman], with \u2026 bitterness in [her heart] toward man and God, [was] in no position to receive the message of the gospel. [She was] in need of temporal help, and there was no organization, so far as I could learn, in Stirling that could give it to [her].\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-09605_000_031\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Cherished Experiences from the Writings of President David\u00a0O.
