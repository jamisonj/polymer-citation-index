He established it nearly 2,000 years ago.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p9\" class=\"\">At the priesthood session of conference, I am always impressed with the number of young men of Aaronic Priesthood age who are here, many with their fathers, some with grandfathers, others with priesthood leaders. You young men bring with you the special, vibrant, enthusiastic spirit of the youth of our time. So I would like to direct my remarks to you for the next few minutes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p10\" class=\"\">First, an experience that I had as a youth which helped to teach me an important lesson. It occurred when I was quite young\u2014to be more specific, a boy of 10 or 11. I was herding our flock of sheep in the mountains of northern Utah to the east of East Garland. My grandfather had entrusted me with the sheep as we were moving them up the mountain to the summer range. I had just watered them in a small mountain stream and bedded them down for a short rest before going on.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p11\" class=\"\">While they were settled, I went about to explore the terrain and check the route ahead. I was a couple of hundred yards up the canyon when I heard a sound that chilled me to the bone. Once you have heard a rattlesnake, a very poisonous reptile, you\u2019ll never forget the sound.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p12\" class=\"\">Cautiously, I moved toward that sound. To my surprise I observed not one but three rattlers just a few yards away. They were on a rocky knoll that had been warmed by the spring sun. While the sight of three rattlers in a bunch intrigued me, because you seldom see more than one at a time, it also concerned me since the sheep would need to pass this way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p13\" class=\"\">Before long the sheep roused and started moving up the canyon. As they came closer, the snakes seemed to sense the intruders and slithered down the incline toward the creek.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p14\" class=\"\">Fearing the danger, I immediately turned my sheep up the hill away from the direction the snakes were moving. I was successful for a time, but then a couple of sheep broke away from the flock. As they did so, the entire flock seemed determined to follow those two errant old ewes, and there was no stopping them. You may have heard the characterization, \u201cThey all followed like a bunch of sheep.\u201d Well, that\u2019s what happened here. To make matters worse, they were moving directly toward the location of the rattlers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p15\" class=\"\">I had hoped that the natural instinct of the sheep would keep them at a safe distance. But some of the flock were pushed directly into the path of the snakes. And there was no escape for the unfortunate ones that sustained the strikes of those disturbed reptiles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p16\" class=\"\">It was a sad young shepherd who had to report to his grandfather a short time later the loss of two of his prized ewes. The experience of that day provided a very forceful illustration to me of what can happen when the sheep ignore their shepherd.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p17\" class=\"\">I was there as the shepherd. I perceived the danger and was trying my best to protect my sheep. But as a few started to go in the wrong direction, others were determined to follow. Though only two of the flock were lost, it was a loss that need not have been.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p18\" class=\"\">Unfortunately, in life we all too often see the results of those who ignore the attempts of spiritual shepherds to guide their paths past hazards and dangers that may be unperceived at the time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p19\" class=\"\">Parents, bishops, grandparents, Scoutmasters, advisers, and genuine friends often can provide spiritual shepherding. Note that I refer to genuine friends in the category of spiritual shepherds. Notice also that I did not include peers in that group. I readily acknowledge that peers in some cases can be and are an influence for good.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p20\" class=\"\">A genuine friend who has another\u2019s best interest at heart may often be the one who encourages or provides the strength in a weak moment to prevent that person from making a serious mistake. In so doing, he or she helps prevent the sorrow and sadness, the embarrassment, and loss of self-respect that nearly always accompany sin. But unfortunately, so many times there are situations where peer influence has a definite negative effect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p21\" class=\"\">We read and hear of so many surveys and interviews where youth disclose that it was the influence and pressure of peers that led them to immoral and foolish behavior. Satan knows this. He is an expert at deceit. I suppose he should be; he\u2019s had plenty of practice. He is aware of the tremendous influence a group of peers can have on an individual.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p22\" class=\"\">There is a compelling desire to belong\u2014to be one of the group. If he can get just one person to influence others to choose the wrong way for whatever reason, Satan wins. Often the easiest and simplest nudging is that \u201ceveryone is doing it\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s the cool thing\u201d or \u201chow do you know it\u2019s bad if you haven\u2019t tried it?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p23\" class=\"\">Don\u2019t be deceived. Don\u2019t be influenced with this kind of enticement. Keep your eyes above the crowd. Be your own person. You have been taught correct principles. Stick with those principles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p24\" class=\"\">There is no neutral area between good and evil. If you are on the devil\u2019s turf, get off it as fast as you can. As strong as Nephi was, I can\u2019t forget his humble prayer: \u201cO Lord, wilt thou \u2026 make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4642\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4642)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4642)\">2 Ne. 4:31<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p25\" class=\"\">Some foolishly try and justify conduct they know is wrong with, \u201cIt\u2019s such a little sin; it won\u2019t matter.\u201d While it may be true that the particular conduct is not at the top of the scale, the more dangerous part is the road that it puts you on. \u201cLittle wrongs\u201d just seem to have a way of leading into \u201cbigger wrongs.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p26\" class=\"\">The words of the American clergyman Harry Emerson Fosdick provide further instruction here: \u201cThe tragic evils of our life are so commonly unintentional. We did not start out for that poor, cheap goal. That aim was not in our minds at all. \u2026 Look to the road you are walking on! He who picks up one end of a stick picks up the other. He who chooses the beginning of a road chooses the place it leads to\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Living under Tension<\/span> [1941], 110\u201311).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/spiritual-shepherds.p27\" class=\"\">Now, my young brethren, you know what is right. You have been taught well. You have the Holy Ghost. Your challenge is to remain strong and faithful. Keep your bodies and minds clean and pure.

He has provided a pattern for you to follow (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20544\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20544)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20544)\">D&amp;C 52:14<\/a><\/span>).
