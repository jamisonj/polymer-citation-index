He began by telling about a man who accidentally fell into the waters of the Niagara River some distance above the falls. As he was carried downstream by the current, he called out repeatedly, \u201cWhich way to shore? Which way to shore?\u201d There were people along the banks on both sides of the river who saw and heard this man but they were slow to act. They noticed that he could swim and was keeping himself afloat, so they concluded that he was engaged in some kind of a publicity stunt and gave him no further attention. However, when he reached the point where he was precariously close to the falls some of the people along the banks went into action and tried to get ropes to him to pull him from the water. But they had waited too long and he went over the brink of the falls and was killed. When his body was recovered and identification made, the horizons of those along the banks of the river were pushed back and their understandings improved and increased. Yes, the man could swim, but he could not swim with purpose or direction because he was blind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/which-way-to-shore.p4\" class=\"\">That illustration used by a home teacher to motivate the members of his stake to become more actively engaged in discharging their responsibilities in doing missionary work with their nonmember friends and neighbors had a missionary thrust; but I found many other messages there also. There are many people in the world today who are in distress, and who, in their hearts, are calling out, \u201cWhich way to shore?\u201d All too often those of us who are around them do not even hear them, or if we do, we do not respond because we allow ourselves to become so busy doing this, that, or the other, that we are not tuned in properly, or perhaps it is because we just don\u2019t want to get involved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/which-way-to-shore.p5\" class=\"\">Let me say, my brothers and sisters, that if we want to save individuals, to save the souls of our Father\u2019s children, we must be willing to get involved and to help others get involved in meaningful ways also.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/which-way-to-shore.p6\" class=\"\">Some of those who are calling out for help are the honest in heart who are earnestly seeking the truth, but they do not know where to find it. They fit into the category referred to in the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 123, verse 12, which reads as follows:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/which-way-to-shore.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cFor there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16206\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16206)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16206)\">D&amp;C 123:12<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/which-way-to-shore.p8\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has the truth, the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, restored to the earth in these the last days through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Furthermore, this Church has received a charge from the Lord to proclaim the restored gospel message to all the world. Obedient to that charge the Church is carrying out a vigorous missionary program in many countries of the world. In addition, the members of the Church everywhere have been challenged to do missionary work with their nonmember friends and neighbors, and to do a better job of living the gospel, so that their lives are shining examples of the gospel of Jesus Christ in action. This will open the doors of the honest in heart and the teaching of the precepts can then be done most effectively.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/which-way-to-shore.p9\" class=\"\">We say to the honest in heart everywhere: Listen to our message; give it prayerful, careful consideration, and then seek a witness from on high through the power of the Holy Ghost that our message is true. There is just too much at stake to do otherwise. We make some strong claims in our Church; we do not apologize for that. We have that responsibility. We have the truth. We are proclaiming the truth. Give it careful, prayerful consideration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/which-way-to-shore.p10\" class=\"\">Some of those who are calling out for help are confused and disturbed by this complex, somewhat contradictory world in which we live, a world that has many crosswinds and crosscurrents, and even some eddies and whirlpools that can entrap and destroy. Let us remember that. Many of these people are yearning for the inner peace and joy that really can come only through love of God and love of fellowmen and from keeping God\u2019s commandments. We have been promised in Deuteronomy, in chapter 4, verse 29, that if we seek the Lord diligently we shall surely find him, and these are the words:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/which-way-to-shore.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cBut if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21294\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21294)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21294)\">Deut. 4:29<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/which-way-to-shore.p12\" class=\"\">Remember that, you, the honest in heart, wherever you may be and listen to our message.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/which-way-to-shore.p13\" class=\"\">In some cases those who are seeking help are young people who are the products of broken homes or who have been raised under conditions where force has been used instead of love and where there is contention and strife and bickering and quarreling, instead of unity and harmony. It has been my privilege to work with young people all my life, and I know that ofttimes young people who are raised under such conditions frequently lack purpose and direction in their living.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/which-way-to-shore.p14\" class=\"\">Some who need help are in bondage to sin and seemingly cannot break those bonds without help from others. Many of them are crying out in their hearts for assistance. Some of them haven\u2019t yet reached the stage where they have truly repented, and they need assistance in that, too. Others are having difficulty reconciling science and religion, perhaps because they have pulled the horizons in too close, and haven\u2019t brought into the picture all they should bring into the picture in order to see relationships clearly, to interpret correctly, and draw sound conclusions; and perhaps because they have used man\u2019s measuring sticks instead of God\u2019s measuring sticks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/which-way-to-shore.p15\" class=\"\">Some who need help are disillusioned because they have been taken advantage of by dishonest individuals. Then there are those who do not have loved ones or friends, and who are lonely and discouraged, and need the hand of fellowship extended to them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/which-way-to-shore.p16\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, how fortunate we are to have the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness, and the marvelous programs of this Church, and a living prophet, a true prophet of God to guide us and direct us in these troubled times. I say to you, my brothers and sisters, that <span class=\"emphasis\">the gospel of Jesus Christ is the way to shore and to safety, to happiness in this life and to eternal life and eternal joy in the life to come. <\/span>It can light the way for all who will open their eyes, their ears, and their hearts. But it isn\u2019t enough for us to just look and listen. We must listen and apply. We must act.
