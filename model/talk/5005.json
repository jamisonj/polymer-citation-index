Many people were rushed out into the street for safety. They watched their living quarters and other earthly possessions go up in fire and smoke. One elderly gentleman who had escaped the holocaust was interviewed. When he was asked, \u201cWhat were you able to save?\u201d he responded with, \u201cOnly the things that you see, my clothing.\u201d His next comment was touching and significant.
