My experience teaches that the highest goodness attainable is a life of unselfish service to mankind. The Master said, \u201cHe that is greatest among you shall be your servant.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37024\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37024)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37024)\">Matt. 23:11<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-joy-of-service.p5\" class=\"\">It has been wisely said, \u201cService is the rent we pay for our own room on earth.\u201d We should know that the rent is due on a daily basis and know that the receipt is never stamped \u201cpaid in full,\u201d because the rent, service in God\u2019s kingdom, is again due today and due tomorrow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-joy-of-service.p6\" class=\"\">Some mistakenly think that a commitment to service comes <span class=\"emphasis\">after<\/span> a great spiritual experience.

McConkie has so eloquently taught us that service is essential to salvation. I have been impressed with the <span class=\"emphasis\">urgency<\/span> of doing. Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do. Progress is not created by contented people. It is up to us, you and me, to be uncomfortable in complacency, to refrain from being spectators, and to be players in the game of life. The Lord has chosen His people to perform a mighty work. Our home teaching, our visiting teaching should be more than <span class=\"emphasis\">going;<\/span> it should be <span class=\"emphasis\">doing<\/span> with Christian love. It can be done; you can each do your portion of the work because you desire it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-joy-of-service.p10\" class=\"\">Fathers and mothers, with your strength of example you will influence your sons and daughters for eternity with examples of loving, uncomplaining service far more convincingly by <span class=\"emphasis\">doing<\/span> than only by saying. Show your children a life of love for them by a life of love and service to the Church and to our Father\u2019s children in spiritual need.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-joy-of-service.p11\" class=\"\">I recall King Benjamin\u2019s instruction to parents as they were counseled in teaching their children:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-joy-of-service.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cBut ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40544\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40544)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40544)\">Mosiah 4:15<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-joy-of-service.p13\" class=\"\">As wisely stated, \u201cUntil a man learns to think, he is not an educated man, no matter how many degrees he has.\u201d I would also add that a thinking man will want to serve. The greater your service, the closer your access to God. One who serves and sacrifices goes to bed at night with peace of mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-joy-of-service.p14\" class=\"\">I think of a dear sister who has crippling arthritis in her hands but faithfully each week, upon entering the genealogical name extraction center in Denver, finds the joints of her fingers limber enough to type the names with efficiency and rapidity\u2014the blessings of unselfish service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-joy-of-service.p15\" class=\"\">Jesus washed the feet of his disciples, feet that were hot, sweaty, and soiled with dust and dirt. He washed not their hands or face; he washed their feet. He who is the greatest shall be the least\u2014he it is who learns to serve.

As we drove to and from the seminar, as arranged by the Regional Representative, we set out to meet our leaders in western Europe. We drove an hour each way into a small village to bless a leader and his family. We went to their homes. In each home we met a lovely wife and handsome children. We ate at their tables, slept as invited, and in each case knelt in prayer and blessed their homes, their families, their callings, and the area for successful missionary service. I now know our leaders there. I felt a genuine love for them, and I felt the same response from them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-joy-of-service.p17\" class=\"\">You have those feelings of approaching in some small degree the indescribable joy of the celestial glory.

As the least of the Brethren, I invite all to lengthen and strengthen their service in God\u2019s kingdom. I bear witness to the divinity of this work.
