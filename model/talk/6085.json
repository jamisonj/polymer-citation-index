This left me the oldest at home to take care of the house, my grieving father, and two younger brothers ages 12 and 13.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/how-near-to-the-angels.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cFor the next two and a half years, I took care of the house, did all the laundry, bought groceries and fixed the meals. \u2026 Can you imagine letting a 17-year-old be in charge of the grocery budget? This sweet father of mine never said an unkind word. He never complained when I turned all his white shirts pink in the laundry or when dinner miserably failed. All my friends in high school were planning for their after-graduation lives. Some were going to Utah State University. \u2026 I had considered going to Ricks College, but in light of the family circumstances I chose to stay at home and continue to help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/how-near-to-the-angels.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cTwo years after Mother\u2019s passing, I started dating a return[ed] missionary, Garry.

As we talked about it later, we determined that the reason was that I had come into the marriage with homemaking skills. \u2026 I didn\u2019t have the stress of experimenting with and\/or burning dinner, ruining laundry, or budgeting grocery money. I\u2019d done all that experimenting on a sensitive, patient, wise father. Now Garry and I could concentrate on just our relationship, and it was wonderful.
