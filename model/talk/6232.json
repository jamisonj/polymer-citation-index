This light comes all wrapped up in love, the Lord\u2019s love for every one of His children, and especially for young people. The Lord knows that you face challenges and temptations, and He provides the light that brightens your hearts, your minds, and your spirits.

She is living in a strange new land with a new language and a new family. School was hard and she had no friends to eat with or talk with or go to school activities with. She said: \u201cI felt so miserable. Then I started thinking about praying. I had not thought about praying for help to Heavenly Father and for comfort and faith in myself. Then I began to read the Book of Mormon every morning and pray before I went to school. School began to be much easier. I was so surprised that I could understand better! I felt like someone was helping me while I was studying\u201d (letter in possession of Young Women office).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-light-in-the-wilderness.p9\" class=\"\">You know, don\u2019t you, that prayer turns on the light? When you make prayer a regular part of your life, you begin walking in the light, in the straight and narrow way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-light-in-the-wilderness.p10\" class=\"\">When I was about your age, I learned the importance of a straight and narrow path and how difficult it was to be focused and stay on it. I grew up in a very small town in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies. My dad was a farmer, and I learned to work! Every summer I drove the tractor for him, mowing and raking hay, hauling hay bales, and plowing fields. I remember when I first started to learn to plow and cultivate a field. Dad explained the importance of plowing a straight furrow or a straight line. If you went crooked, there would be spots missed in the field and the weeds would take over. He said: \u201cIf you will keep your eye focused on the fence post across the field and let that be your goal, you will plow a straight furrow. Don\u2019t let the bumpy terrain throw you off. It\u2019s when you start looking at the end of the tractor that the holes and bumps take you off course and you begin to go crooked.\u201d Then he left me to do the job.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-light-in-the-wilderness.p11\" class=\"\">I remembered about the fence post across the field for several rounds, then I started singing songs to make the time pass. I sang every song and hymn I knew, and those I didn\u2019t know I made up. I was singing at the top of my lungs and having a good time when I noticed my dad walking through the field towards me. I stopped the tractor and he said, \u201cCan you tell what has happened to the straight lines?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-light-in-the-wilderness.p12\" class=\"\">I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-light-in-the-wilderness.p13\" class=\"\">He said: \u201cLook at the line. Your first few rounds are straight, but evidently you quit paying attention to where you were plowing. You must have quit looking at the fence post across the field\u2014your goal. Can you see that gradually each time you\u2019ve gone around, you\u2019ve just gone a little crooked until now there are big spots in the field?\u201d He got on the tractor and drove a few rotations to straighten out the lines. As he got off to let me try again, he said, \u201cSharon, always pay attention to where you are going.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-light-in-the-wilderness.p14\" class=\"\">When the pressures of the world seem to overwhelm us and we are tempted to give up what we want most for what we want now, it is difficult to pay attention, to look beyond the moment, beyond the end of the tractor. The holes and bumpy terrain, persuasion from friends who may seem to be having such a good time, can throw us off course. But the light that will help us stay on the straight path is like the goal across the field. If there are times we become distracted and tempted, the Lord will be there to help us straighten out our course. You can walk away from the darkness and come into the light\u2014His light.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-light-in-the-wilderness.p15\" class=\"\">A young friend who did not understand the importance of having the light, having the Spirit, was trying to explain to me why he thought it was important to see some of the vulgar and violent movies on the market today. He said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t see these things, you will be naive and uninformed and the world will take advantage of you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-light-in-the-wilderness.p16\" class=\"\">I asked my young friend, \u201cWould you rather expose yourself to what the world has to offer to be informed and then left on your own to make decisions, or would you choose to be guided by the Lord and live your life to be filled with so much light and truth and goodness that there is no room for darkness?\u201d You can\u2019t be in the light and the dark at the same time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-light-in-the-wilderness.p17\" class=\"\">This light is symbolized in the Young Women torch. That torch you wear with your profile in the flame can fuel your desire to stand for truth and righteousness. It is a reminder that Christ is your light and He will show you the way through the happy times and the mists of darkness. You <span class=\"emphasis\">never<\/span> need to feel alone or forsaken.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-light-in-the-wilderness.p18\" class=\"\">Emily, a Laurel class president wanting to know the Lord\u2019s will for one of her counselors, describes how this light feels. She said: \u201cI prayed about a certain girl, and I had such a strong revelation\u2014it\u2019s like when your heart and mind make connection and everything is so clear. So I knew without a doubt that she was to be my counselor\u201d (letter in possession of Young Women office). Prayer is what makes the connection with God\u2019s power, which leads to loving and serving, sacrificing, and enlarging your own capacities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-light-in-the-wilderness.p19\" class=\"\">The brother of Jared in the Book of Mormon knew about this process. He had built eight barges, or ships, under the direction of the Lord, but they had no light in them. He called upon the Lord for help (and that\u2019s our opportunity too). But the answer did not come in the way he was expecting. The Lord could have easily put light in those barges, but He wanted the light\u2014the light of the Spirit\u2014in the brother of Jared.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-light-in-the-wilderness.p20\" class=\"\">What do you think the brother of Jared was doing from the time he realized the Lord was not going to give him a flashlight to the time he carved out 16 stones and asked the Lord to touch them and give them light? I think he must have done a great deal of what Sunny Kim and Emily did\u2014fasting and praying and pondering and reading his scriptures and serving and loving and forgiving and just trying to be obedient so he would have the Spirit, the light, to direct him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-light-in-the-wilderness.p21\" class=\"\">While the brother of Jared was doing everything he knew to do, was working hard and using every resource available\u2014especially faith in the Lord\u2014he went to the Lord again with his idea, and his efforts were enough.
