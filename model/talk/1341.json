The resurrection, we testify, is a reality. Every testimony-bearing member of\nthis Church gives this witness.\n<\/p><p>\nToday, I should like to speak about a reality yet to come&mdash;the second coming of Jesus\nChrist. The signs and events preceding his second coming are clearly taught in the scriptures\nand furthermore are being fulfilled now.\n<\/p><p>\nBy way of review, while the Savior was upon the earth on one occasion he met with:\n<\/p><p>\n\"The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew\nthem a sign from heaven.\n<\/p><p>\n\"He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the\nsky is red.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye\nhypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35370\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35370)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35370)\">Matt. 16:1-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI well remember as a boy in England hearing this statement many times, \"Red sky at night,\nsailors take delight. Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning.\"\n<\/p><p>\nLater, the Savior sat upon the Mount of Olives; the disciples came unto him privately, saying:\n\". . . Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the\nend of the world?\n<\/p><p>\n\"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these\nthings must come to pass, but the end is not yet.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines,\nand pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all\nnations; and then shall the end come\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35390\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35390)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35390)\">Matt. 24:3-7,10-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Evidence<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThink of the signs and events of the past several weeks&mdash;worldwide, bearing on these\npredictions. We note, then, as the time approached for the Savior's departure from his\ndisciples, he gave them instructions as to their mission, to carry the gospel to all the world. He\nalso instructed them in relation to conditions which would prevail on the earth preceding his\nsecond coming. Peoples of the earth would reject him and his mission.\n<\/p><p>\nFalse doctrines would arise and there would be wars and rumors of wars because of the\ndifficulties that would arise in the hearts of men. Nation would rise against nation. Peace\nwould be taken from the earth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14358\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14358)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14358)\">D&amp;C 1:35<\/a><\/span>),\nbut his disciples should endeavor to remain faithful and true to\ntheir covenants to the end.\n<\/p><p>\nAs we review the happenings of the past few years, we realize the most dreadful wars of all\ntime have been fought in this dispensation, and the end is not yet. There are uprisings in\nmany, many countries today. We have signs in the heavens and in the earth. Have they\nbecome so common we fail to recognize them? In recent years, around the world, we have had\nsome of the most destructive earthquakes of history. Distress in and among nations is\nincreasing daily. Will anyone say that men's hearts are not failing them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31630\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31630)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31630)\">Luke 21:26<\/a><\/span>)? Today, millions of\npeople sit and tremble in fear of what may happen. The wickedness of the world increases.\nNations are preparing more earnestly than ever before for the final great struggle.\n<\/p><p>\nAmong the wonderful signs which would be given to indicate the near approach of his advent,\nthere would not only be wars but also earthquakes in divers places, distress among nations,\nelements in commotion in tornados and hurricanes, the sea heaving itself beyond its bounds.\nThere would be signs in the heavens as well as in the earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14387\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14387)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14387)\">D&amp;C 45:40<\/a><\/span>) of unusual proportions. To\nimpress his disciples that these events would surely come, the Savior said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father\nonly\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35397\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35397)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35397)\">Matt. 24:35-36<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nToday weapons are being made more dreadful than ever known before, and fear enters into\nthe hearts of all people. Is it so that we are able to see that the sky is red in the morning or in\nthe evening and yet fail to see the signs in the heavens or in the earth? Surely there will be\nsigns among the heavenly bodies before the end shall come. The earth will reel, the sun be\ndarkened, the moon not give its light\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35395\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35395)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35395)\">Matt. 24:29<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14432\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14432)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14432)\">D&amp;C 88:87<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIs the airplane flying in the skies from one country to another a sign? The heavens are filled\nwith them, and people are fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah 60:8. \"Who are these that fly as a\ncloud, and as the doves to their windows?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25264\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25264)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25264)\">Isa. 60:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMoreover are not the missiles which are shot into the outer space and which revolve around\nthe earth signs? Will anyone say that these do not, in a large measure, come under the\nprediction made by the Lord on the Mount of Olives almost 2000 years ago? Surely they are\nsigns in the heavens, and there will yet come other signs as the Lord has promised.\n<\/p><p>\nIt appears that the trouble brewing in this world in which the hearts of men are failing them is\nhere, and other even greater manifestations of the near approach of the Lord are yet to come.\nWill we be in a category of the people in the days of Noah as recorded in Luke? \"And as it\nwas in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.\n<\/p><p>\n\"They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that\nNoe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold,\nthey planted, they builded;\n<\/p><p>\n\"But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone\nfrom heaven, and destroyed them all.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31627\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31627)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31627)\">Luke 17:26-30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOr as Peter predicted in 2 Peter 3:3-4: \"Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last\ndays scoffers, walking after their own lusts,\n<\/p><p>\n\"And saying, Where is the promise of his coming?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4880\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4880)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4880)\">2 Pet. 3:3-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Time Not Known to Man<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTrue, the precise time of Christ's coming has not been made known to man. Yet I have no\nfear in my heart. Neither has anyone with a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. By\nlearning to comprehend the signs of the times, by watching the development of the work of\nGod among the nations, and by noting the rapid fulfillment of significant prophecies, we may\nperceive the progressive evidence of the approaching event; but the hour or the day, no man\nknoweth, neither the angels in heaven nor shall they know until he comes. His coming will be\na surprise to those who have ignored his warnings and who have failed to watch. Watch,\ntherefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35400\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35400)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35400)\">Matt. 25:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLikewise, Peter predicted the Saints also shall hardly escape\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14406\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14406)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14406)\">D&amp;C 63:34<\/a><\/span>). Nevertheless I, the Lord, am\nwith them (see (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2299\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2299)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2299)\">1 Pet. 4:18<\/a><\/span>).\nThis is a great promise to those who will keep their covenants.\nAnother sure sign to take place before his second coming was the restoration of the gospel\nand kingdom here on earth of the Lord Jesus Christ. This we testify took place 134 years ago.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Scriptural Evidence<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe scriptures are replete with testimonies pertaining to the second coming of Jesus Christ. I\nwould have you note Job and the Prophet Daniel, also the words of the Apostles after the\ncrucifixion of Jesus: \". . . this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so\ncome in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7924\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7924)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7924)\">Acts 1:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTimothy had this to say: \". . . and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second\ntime\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24322\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24322)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24322)\">Heb. 9:28<\/a><\/span>).\nLikewise the Apostle Paul had this firm conviction when he said: \"For\nthe Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and\nwith the trump of God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2738\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2738)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2738)\">1 Thes. 4:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBut the crowning testimony of all is from the Savior of the world himself: \". . . I am Jesus\nChrist, who cometh quickly, in an hour you think not\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14391\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14391)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14391)\">D&amp;C 51:20<\/a><\/span>), given by revelation\nfrom the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith in May 1831.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we be in the category predicted by the Savior: \"But know this, that if the goodman of\nthe house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would\nnot have suffered his house to be broken up.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35399\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35399)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35399)\">Matt. 24:43-44<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI bear witness that the messages of this conference have been to warn, advise, counsel, and\nencourage everyone to prepare and be ready to meet the Master, whether we are still living in\nmortality or have completed our missions here.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we then observe the signs which are so evident and have the desire to labor and watch\nand so live as if the Savior were going to come today, is my prayer in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
