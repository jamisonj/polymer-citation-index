Her husband, Orson Spencer, was a sensitive, well-educated man. She had been reared in Boston and was cultured and refined. She had six children. Her delicate health declined from exposure and from the hardships encountered after leaving Nauvoo. Elder Spencer wrote to her parents and asked if she could return to live with them while he established a home for her in the West.

Women of Relief Society, you truly are angels of mercy. This is demonstrated on a grand scale through the humanitarian outreach to the cold, the hungry, and to suffering wherever it is found. Your labors are also very much in evidence in our wards and in our stakes and missions. Every bishop in the Church could testify of this truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p31\" class=\"\">I remember when, as a young deacon, I would cover a portion of the ward on fast Sunday morning, giving the small envelope to each family, waiting while a contribution was placed in the envelope and then returning it to the bishop. On one such occasion, an elderly member, Brother Wright, who lived alone, welcomed me at the door and, with aged hands, fumbled at the tie of the envelope and placed within it a small sum. His eyes fairly glistened as he made his contribution. He invited me to sit down and then told me of a time many years before when his cupboard had been empty of food. In his hunger, he had prayed to Heavenly Father for food to eat. Not long thereafter, he gazed out his front window and beheld someone approaching his door, pulling behind her a red-colored wagon. It was Sister Balmforth, the Relief Society president, who had pulled that wagon almost half a mile over the railroad tracks and to his door. The wagon overflowed with food collected from the sisters of the ward Relief Society, with which Sister Balmforth filled the empty shelves in Brother Wright\u2019s kitchen. He described her to me as \u201can angel sent from heaven.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p32\" class=\"\">Sisters, you are the epitome of love. You brighten your homes, you lead with kindness your children; and while your husbands may be head of the home, you surely are the heart of the home. Together, through respect for each other and sharing of responsibilities, you make an unbeatable team.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p33\" class=\"\">To me it is significant that when children need care and loving attention, they turn to you\u2014their mothers. Even the wayward son or neglectful daughter, when he or she recognizes the need to return to the embrace of family, almost inevitably comes to Mother, who has never given up on her child.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p34\" class=\"\">Mother\u2019s love brings out the best in a child.

I testify that your hearts are filled with love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p36\" class=\"\">To the third part of our formula\u2014namely, <span class=\"emphasis\">fill your life with service<\/span>\u2014I mention two separate examples. One features a teacher and the profound influence she has had in the lives of those whom she taught, while the other pertains to a missionary couple whose service helped to bring the light of the gospel to those who had lived in spiritual darkness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p37\" class=\"\">Many years ago there was a young woman, Baur Dee Sheffield, who taught in Mutual. She had no children of her own, though she and her husband dearly longed for children. Her love was expressed through devotion to her special young women as each week she taught them eternal truths and lessons of life. Then came illness, followed by death. She was but 27.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p38\" class=\"\">Each year, on Memorial Day, her Mutual girls made a pilgrimage of prayer to the graveside of their teacher, always leaving flowers and a little card signed \u201cTo Baur Dee, from your girls.\u201d First there were 10 girls who went, then five, then two, and eventually just one, who continues to visit each Memorial Day, always placing on the grave a bouquet of flowers and a card, inscribed as always, \u201cTo Baur Dee, from your girls.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p39\" class=\"\">One year, nearly 25 years after Baur Dee\u2019s death, the only one of \u201cher girls\u201d who continued to visit the grave realized she would be away on Memorial Day and decided to visit her teacher\u2019s grave a few days early. She had gathered flowers, tied them with a ribbon, attached a card, and was putting on her jacket to leave when her doorbell rang. She opened the door and was greeted by one of her visiting teachers, Colleen Fuller, who said she had experienced difficulty getting together with her visiting teaching partner and so had decided to come alone and unannounced in an effort to complete her visiting teaching before the end of the month. As Colleen was invited in, she noticed the jacket and flowers and apologized for obviously interrupting whatever had been planned.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p40\" class=\"\">\u201cOh, no problem,\u201d came the response. \u201cI\u2019m just on my way to the cemetery to put flowers on the grave of the woman who was my Mutual teacher, who had a profound influence on me and the other girls she taught. Originally about 10 of us visited her grave each year to express our love and thanks to her, but now I represent the group.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p41\" class=\"\">Colleen asked, \u201cCould your teacher\u2019s name have been Baur Dee?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p42\" class=\"\">\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d came the answer. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p43\" class=\"\">With a catch in her voice, Colleen said, \u201cBaur Dee was my aunt\u2014my mother\u2019s sister. Every Memorial Day since she died, my family has found on her grave a bouquet of flowers and a card inscribed from Baur Dee\u2019s girls. They\u2019ve always wanted to know who these girls were so they could thank them for remembering Baur Dee. Now I can let them know.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p44\" class=\"\">Said American author Thornton Wilder, \u201cThe highest tribute to the dead is not grief but gratitude.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p45\" class=\"\">The second example of lives filled with service, with which I shall conclude, is the missionary experience of Juliusz and Dorothy Fussek, who were called to fill an 18-month mission in Poland. Brother Fussek was born in Poland. He spoke the language. He loved the people. Sister Fussek was born in England and knew little of Poland and nothing of its people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p46\" class=\"\">Trusting in the Lord, they embarked on their assignment. The living conditions were primitive, the work lonely, their task immense. A mission had not at that time been fully established in Poland. The assignment given the Fusseks was to prepare the way so that the mission could be expanded and gain permanence, that other missionaries be called to serve, people taught, converts baptized, branches established, and chapels erected.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p47\" class=\"\">Did Elder and Sister Fussek despair because of the enormity of their assignment? Not for a moment. They knew their calling was from God, they prayed for His divine help, and they devoted themselves wholeheartedly to their work. They remained in Poland not 18 months, but rather served for five years. All of the foregoing objectives were realized. Such came about following an earlier meeting where Elders Russell M. Nelson, Hans B. Ringger, and I, accompanied by Elder Fussek, met with Minister Adam Wopatka of the Polish government, and we heard him say, \u201cYour church is welcome here. You may build your buildings, you may send your missionaries. You are welcome in Poland. This man,\u201d pointing to Juliusz Fussek, \u201chas served your church well, as has his wife.
