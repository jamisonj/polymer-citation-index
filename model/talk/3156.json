The history of these general conferences is filled with discourses from the Brethren reminding us of this sacred obligation. I have been impressed to add my voice to that record today with the hope that we can be motivated to place the calling of home teachers in its proper priority in our lives. Let me remind you of three essential ingredients for a successful home teaching program.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/home-teaching-a-sacred-calling.p50\" class=\"\">First, the family is the basic unit in the Church organization. The home teacher is the first line of defense to watch over and strengthen that basic unit. In our priority of time commitments we ought to first watch over and strengthen our own families, and then be good, consistent, conscientious home teachers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/home-teaching-a-sacred-calling.p51\" class=\"\">President Joseph F. Smith said in the general conference of April 1915: \u201cI don\u2019t know of any duty that is more sacred, or more necessary, if it is carried out as it should be, than the duties of the teachers who visit the homes of the people, who pray with them, who admonish them to virtue and honor, to unity, to love, and to faith in and fidelity to the cause of Zion.\u201d (In Conference Report, Apr. 1915, p. 140.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/home-teaching-a-sacred-calling.p52\" class=\"\">Home teachers, it is your responsibility to see that the unbaptized are baptized, the unordained are ordained, the inactive are brought into activity, the lost members are found.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/home-teaching-a-sacred-calling.p53\" class=\"\">Second, just as Moses was not able to care for the needs of all the children of Israel alone, so a home teacher should not be given a workload beyond his ability to perform. The history of ward teaching and home teaching has witnessed a change in the recommended number of families assigned to a teacher, being reduced from ten to eight to the present level of five or fewer as the Church has enlarged its borders and the distance to travel for visits has increased. Nothing will destroy the spirit of a home teacher more than to give him an assignment beyond his ability to have the thrill of success in his performance. Stake presidents, bishops, and quorum leaders, there is no program in the Church which will give you greater relief from the administrative burdens you carry than having a well-organized, efficiently operated, successful home teaching program.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/home-teaching-a-sacred-calling.p54\" class=\"\">Third, the preparation of a home teacher. Elder Matthias F. Cowley reported in the general conference of April 1902 that \u201cthe teachers who go out to visit the saints from family to family ought to be men endowed with the spirit of revelation from God. They ought to study the principles of the Gospel, and to so live that they may enjoy the inspiration of the Holy Ghost in their instructions, so that their instructions may be understood and be attractive to the children; that they should not go simply to carry out a routine, to ask certain questions, just to be able to say that they have made their monthly visit. They ought to be men inspired with the spirit of revelation from God, that they may touch the hearts of the families.\u201d (In Conference Report, Apr. 1902, p. 38.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/home-teaching-a-sacred-calling.p55\" class=\"\">If our home teaching assignments are to be given their proper priority, then our preparation for those visits must be careful and complete, tailored to the individual needs of fathers and mothers and their families. As home teachers, should not this basic program receive our earnest effort to seek inspiration and guidance of the Lord in this most sacred obligation?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/home-teaching-a-sacred-calling.p56\" class=\"\">God grant us the vision to see the potential of our home teaching assignments, and the desire to do his will to watch over and strengthen those whom we have been called to serve with a special spirit of interest, concern, and love, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
