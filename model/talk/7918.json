There are special experiences in the lives of all of us that touch our souls and make things different forever. One such experience happened in my youth. This experience transformed my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/blessings-of-the-sacrament.p6\" class=\"\">I was always active in the Church and progressed through the Aaronic Priesthood. When I was a teenager, Brother Jacob, my teacher, asked that I write down on a card what I had thought about during the sacrament. I took my card and began to write. First on the list was a basketball game we had won the night before. And then came a date after the game, and so went the list. Far removed and certainly not in bold letters was the name of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/blessings-of-the-sacrament.p7\" class=\"\">Each Sunday the card was filled out. For a young Aaronic Priesthood holder, the sacrament and sacrament meeting took on a new, expanded, and spiritual meaning. I anxiously looked forward to Sundays and to the opportunity to partake of the sacrament, as understanding the Savior\u2019s Atonement was changing me. Every Sunday to this day, as I partake of the sacrament, I can see my card and review my list. Always on my list now, first of all, is the Savior of mankind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/blessings-of-the-sacrament.p8\" class=\"\">In the New Testament we read of the time that the Savior and His Apostles met in an upper room for the Feast of the Passover.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/blessings-of-the-sacrament.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: <span class=\"emphasis\">this do in remembrance of me.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/blessings-of-the-sacrament.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cLikewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, <span class=\"emphasis\">which is shed for you.<\/span>\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10411_000_040\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"123652\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123652)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123652)\">Luke 22:19\u201320<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/blessings-of-the-sacrament.p11\" class=\"\">Jesus also instituted the ordinance of the sacrament during His visit to the Nephites.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-10411_000_040\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"123653\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123653)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123653)\">3\u00a0Nephi 18<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> I have come to know the importance of these two events.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/blessings-of-the-sacrament.p12\" class=\"\">President David\u00a0O.

McKay, in Conference Report, Oct. 1929, 11.]<\/span><\/sup> If we properly prepare for the sacrament, we can transform our lives. I would like to suggest five principles that can bless our lives as we partake of the sacrament worthily.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>I. Have a Feeling of Gratitude for the Atonement of Jesus Christ<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/blessings-of-the-sacrament.p14\" class=\"\">The first principle is to have a feeling of gratitude to Heavenly Father during the sacrament for the Atonement of His Son. The following story is told about passing the sacrament:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/blessings-of-the-sacrament.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cThe sacrament never really meant much to me until the Sunday I was ordained a deacon. That afternoon I passed the sacrament for the first time. Prior to the meeting, one of the deacons warned me, \u2018Look out for Brother Schmidt. You may have to wake him up!\u2019 Finally the time came for me to participate in the passing of the sacrament. I handled the first six rows quite well. Children and adults partook of the bread with no noticeable thought or problem. Then I got to row seven, the row where Brother Schmidt always sat. But I was surprised. Instead of being asleep he was wide awake. Unlike many of the others I had served, he took the bread with what seemed to be great thought and reverence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/blessings-of-the-sacrament.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cA few minutes later I found myself again approaching row seven with the water. This time my friend was right. Brother Schmidt sat with his head bowed and his big German eyes shut. He was evidently sound asleep. What could I do or say? I looked for a moment at his brow, wrinkled and worn from years of toil and hardship. He had joined the Church as a teenager and had experienced much persecution in his small German town. I had heard the story many times in testimony meeting. I decided finally to gently nudge his shoulder in hopes of waking him. As I reached to do so, his head slowly lifted. There were tears streaming down his cheeks and as I looked into his eyes I saw love and joy. He quietly reached up and took the water. Even though I was only twelve then, I can still remember vividly the feeling I had as I watched this rugged old man partake of the sacrament. I knew without a doubt that he was feeling something about the sacrament that I had never felt. I determined then that I wanted to feel those same feelings.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-10411_000_040\">4<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Book of Mormon Student Manual<\/span> (Church Educational System manual, 1979), 417.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/blessings-of-the-sacrament.p17\" class=\"\">Brother Schmidt had communicated with heaven, and heaven had communicated with him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>II.

When we partake of the sacrament, we renew our commitment to live up to these covenants. I believe it would be appropriate to memorize the sacramental prayers in our minds and in our hearts. This will help us focus on renewing our baptismal covenants. Whether we were 8 or 80 years old when we were baptized, I hope we will never forget that day and the covenants we made.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>III.

If we have spent time before sacrament meeting repenting of our sins, we can leave sacrament meeting feeling clean and pure. President Boyd\u00a0K. Packer said: \u201cThe sacrament renews the process of forgiveness. Every Sunday when the sacrament is served, that is a ceremony to renew the process of forgiveness. \u2026 Every Sunday you cleanse yourself so that, in due time, when you die your spirit will be clean.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-10411_000_040\">8<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Boyd\u00a0K.

When I was a mission president in Bolivia, my wife, Mary Anne, and I had the blessing of attending a mission presidents\u2019 seminar with President Henry\u00a0B. Eyring. In that meeting he taught that there are three important ways to prepare to benefit from a meeting.

We must come prepared, be willing to listen, and not be distracted. In the scriptures we read, \u201cBut, behold, I say unto you, that you must <span class=\"emphasis\">study it out<\/span> in your mind; then you must <span class=\"emphasis\">ask me if it be right,<\/span> and if it is right I will cause that your <span class=\"emphasis\">bosom shall burn<\/span> within you; therefore, <span class=\"emphasis\">you shall feel that it is right.<\/span>\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote10-10411_000_040\">10<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"123658\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123658)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123658)\">Doctrine and Covenants 9:8<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added.]<\/span><\/sup> We can know what we should do to solve our problems.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>V.
