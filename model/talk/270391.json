I have a right to expect\n  protection at least from you; for, independent of law, you have pledged your faith,<span class=\"footRef\">1<\/span> and that of the\n  State, for my protection, and I wish to go to Nauvoo.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\"><i>Gov<\/i>.&mdash;And you shall have protection, General Smith. I did not make this promise without\n  consulting my officers, who all pledged their honor to its fulfillment. I do not know that I shall go\n  tomorrow to Nauvoo, but if I do, I will take you along.

We\n  hear this morning that the Governor will not go down with his troops today to Nauvoo, as we\n  anticipated last evening; but if he does come down with his troops you will be protected; and I want\n  you to tell Brother Dunham to instruct the people to stay at home and attend to their own business,\n  and let there be no groups or gathering together, unless by permission of the Governor, they are\n  called together to receive communications from the Governor, which would please our people, but\n  let the Governor direct.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">Brother Dunham of course will obey the orders of the government officers, and render them the\n  assistance they require. There is no danger of any extermination order. Should there be a mutiny\n  among the troops (which we do not anticipate, excitement is abating) a part will remain loyal and\n  stand for the defense of the state and our rights.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">There is one principle which is eternal; it is the duty of all men to protect their lives and the\n  lives of the household,<span class=\"footRef\">2<\/span> whenever necessity requires, and no power has a right to forbid it, should\n  the last extreme arrive, but I anticipate no such extreme, but caution is the parent of safety.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"right\">JOSEPH SMITH.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">P.S.&mdash;Dear Emma, I am very much resigned to my lot, knowing I am justified, and have done\n  the best that could be done. Give my love to the children<span class=\"footRef\">3<\/span> and all my friends, Mr. Brewer, and all\n  who inquire after me: and as for treason, I know that I have not committed any, and they cannot\n  prove<\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"116569\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 116569)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(116569)\">D&amp;C 135:7<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">2. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110024\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110024)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110024)\">1 Tim. 5:8<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112340\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112340)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112340)\">Alma 46:12<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">3. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108596\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108596)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108596)\">Luke 23:28<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110100\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110100)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110100)\">Titus 2:4<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110629\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110629)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110629)\">2 Jn. 1:1<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"111387\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 111387)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(111387)\">Jacob 3:7<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
