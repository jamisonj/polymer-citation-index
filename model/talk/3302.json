Is there anyone who doesn\u2019t know the great missionary he has been? When I was a member of the stake presidency in Arizona, Brother Richards came to our stake; and after all the thousands of good things he had to give us, I remember so very well that he and I both went down to Miami, Arizona, to conclude our conferences, and we sat there and talked about the gospel most of the evening. I don\u2019t know whether he will remember that or not, but it was very impressive to me. The First Presidency recently went with some of the General Authorities down to an area conference in New Mexico and we got caught with a plane breakdown. They had to send back to Denver to get some parts. While the rest of us were sitting around waiting, Brother Richards started talking to the pilot and the stewardess, and he taught them the gospel. That\u2019s the kind of missionary he is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p4\" class=\"\">I think he mentioned 28,000 missionaries, and I think we now have 29,000 plus. Anyway, we are very, very grateful to Brother Richards and all the other Brethren who have been as faithful as he explained to us in his sermon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p5\" class=\"\">It\u2019s been a wonderful conference! It has been good for all of us to be here. I\u2019ve been grateful for the remarks of the Brethren who have spoken. The Lord has answered their prayers for divine help in the preparation and delivery of their sermons.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p6\" class=\"\">I express appreciation to all of you who have traveled so far to come here, some of you at great sacrifice and inconvenience. We are grateful for your devotion and ask the Lord to bless you with a capacity to be touched in your hearts by the messages you have heard, long after we have sung the songs and long after we have said our last amen. We realize so much depends on what you as leaders do as you return to your homes to work again with those in your stakes and wards and individual homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p7\" class=\"\">I should like to refer to the great story of the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt to the promised land. In that story there is an account of one special man that moves and motivates and inspires me. His name was Caleb.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p8\" class=\"\">Shortly after Moses led Israel out of bondage from Egypt, he sent twelve men to search out the promised land and to bring back word about living conditions there. Caleb and Joshua were among the group. After spending forty days on their mission, the twelve men returned. They brought back figs and pomegranates and a cluster of grapes so large it took two men to carry it between them on a pole.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p9\" class=\"\">The majority of the search party gave a very discouraging report on the promised land and its inhabitants. Although they found a land that was beautiful and desirable and flowing with milk and honey, they also found that the cities were walled and formidable and that the people, the \u201csons of Anak,\u201d looked like giants. The Israelite scouts said that they felt like grasshoppers in comparison. Caleb, however, saw things a little differently, with what the Lord called \u201canother spirit,\u201d and his account of the journey and their challenges was quite different. He said, \u201cLet us go up at once, and possess [their land]; for we are well able to overcome it\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41122\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41122)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41122)\">Num. 13:30<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p10\" class=\"\">Joshua and Caleb were men of great faith, and they joined in urging that the Israelites go <span class=\"emphasis\">immediately,<\/span> to the promised land, saying:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cIf the Lord delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cOnly rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the people of the land; for \u2026 the Lord is with us: fear them not\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41123\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41123)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41123)\">Num. 14:8\u20139<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p13\" class=\"\">But the faint-hearted Israelites, remembering the security of their Egyptian slavery and lacking faith in God, rejected Caleb and Joshua and sought even to stone them to death.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p14\" class=\"\">Because of their lack of faith, the children of Israel were required to spend the next forty years wandering about and eating the dust of the desert, when they might have feasted on milk and honey.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p15\" class=\"\">The Lord decreed that before Israel could enter the land of Canaan, all of the faithless generation who had been freed from bondage must pass away\u2014all go into eternity\u2014all except Joshua and Caleb. For <span class=\"emphasis\">their<\/span> faith, <span class=\"emphasis\">they<\/span> were promised that they and their children would live to inhabit the promised land.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p16\" class=\"\">Forty-five years after the twelve men returned from their exploration of the land of promise, when the new generation of Israel, under the leadership of Joshua, was completing its conquest of Canaan, Caleb spoke to Joshua:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cForty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me \u2026 to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cNevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the Lord my God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now, behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cAs yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me [at least in the spirit of the gospel and its call and needs]: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, \u2026 both to go out, and to come in\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30092\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30092)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30092)\">Josh. 14:7\u20138, 10\u201311<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p21\" class=\"\">From Caleb\u2019s example we learn very important lessons. Just as Caleb had to struggle and remain true and faithful to gain his inheritance, so we must remember that, while the Lord has promised us a place in his kingdom, we must ever strive constantly and faithfully so as to be worthy to receive the reward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p22\" class=\"\">Caleb concluded his moving declaration with a request and a challenge with which my heart finds full sympathy. The Anakims, the giants, were still inhabiting the promised land, and they had to be overcome. Said Caleb, now at 85 years, \u201cGive me this mountain\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30093\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30093)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30093)\">Josh. 14:12<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/give-me-this-mountain.p23\" class=\"\">This is my feeling for the work at this moment.
