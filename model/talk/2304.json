But it is a great thing to believe in the living prophets. Our salvation is contingent upon our belief in a living prophet and adherence to his word. He alone has the right to revelation for the whole Church. His words, above those of any other man, ought to be esteemed and considered by the Church as well as by the world.

Adam\u2019s revelation did not instruct Noah to build his ark; nor did Noah\u2019s revelation tell Lot to forsake Sodom; nor did either of these speak of the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt.
