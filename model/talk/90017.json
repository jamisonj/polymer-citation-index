I am happy for the privilege of meeting with you, and can say, according to the best of my knowledge, that there is a great improvement in the midst of the Saints: they are increasing in understanding. The little apparent difficulty you seem to have here is no difficulty at all. In the rise of this Church, and for years afterwards, if four men had been appointed to live in the capacity of a neighborhood, there would have been more real difficulty in one month than there has been in this Ward since brother Miller has been its Bishop. This proves that the people are learning to let things alone that they do not know to be right, and wait until they know what right is. This is a great lesson to learn. It is also a precious gift, that some people seem to be possessed of, to have knowledge enough not to talk until they can say something to advantage and benefit to themselves, or others, or both. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v9n424\"> The instructions some of you need here I presume would be good for all.

People do not seem to understand fully their position and the duties they are called upon to perform; but when a person comes to understanding, he will not go amiss. There are so many traits in the lives of the people possessing the Priesthood, that, touch it where you will, you cannot touch it amiss; and if you know and understand it, it is to you a source of great satisfaction, while those who do not understand are still left in the dark. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v9n425\"> When brother Miller was at the Seventies' meeting in the city, a week ago last Saturday, I made some remarks on the items of doctrine before us, and the clerk wrote down a few of them. I took, I think, the purport of these remarks, and published them in the last week's <span class=\"italic\">News<\/span>. I then and there stated that a Bishop, in his Bishopric, cannot try any individual for error in doctrine. In reflecting upon this, let me ask, how do we understand doctrine? By revelation. What are the privileges of a Bishop? Has he the privilege of the administration of angels?<span class=\"citation\" id=\"83987\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 83987)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(83987)\">D&amp;C 13:1<\/a><\/span> Yes; this belongs to the lesser Priesthood.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"90198\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 90198)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(90198)\">D&amp;C 107:20<\/a><\/span> Has he the privilege of using the Urim and Thummim?

He should be ordained an Apostle of Jesus Christ. That office puts him in possession of every key, every power, every authority, communication, benefit, blessing, glory, and kingdom that was ever revealed to man. That pertains to the office of an Apostle of Jesus Christ. In the last week's <span class=\"italic\">News<\/span> I published a portion of a revelation, showing the authority of the First Presidency of the Church, composed at first of Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"90081\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 90081)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(90081)\">D&amp;C 107:1-100<\/a><\/span> When this revelation was given, the two last-named brethren were Joseph Smith's counselors, and this First Presidency possessed the power and authority of building up the kingdom of God upon all the earth, and of setting the Church in order in its perfection.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"90206\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 90206)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(90206)\">D&amp;C 107:22<\/a><\/span> You read in the revelation alluded to that when the Twelve were called and ordained, they possessed the same power and authority as the three First Presidents;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"90223\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 90223)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(90223)\">D&amp;C 107:23-24<\/a><\/span> and in reading further you find that there must needs be appendages and helps growing out of this Priesthood.

They possess precisely the same Priesthood that the Seventies and the Twelve and the First Presidency possess; but are they ordained to officiate in all the authority, powers, and keys of this Priesthood? No, they are not. Still, they are High Priests of God; and if they magnify their Priesthood, they will receive at some time all the authority and power that it is possible for man to receive. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v9n430\"> Suppose that Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams had been taken away or had apostatized, as one of them did soon after the revelation I have referred to was given, and there had been only Joseph Smith left of the First Presidency, would he alone have had authority to set in order the kingdom of God on the earth? Yes. Again: Suppose that eleven of the Twelve had been taken away by the power of the Adversary, that one Apostle has the same power that Joseph had, and could preach, baptize, and set in order the whole kingdom of God upon the earth, as much so as the Twelve, were they all together. Again: If in the providence of God he should permit the Enemy to destroy these two first Quorums, and then destroy the Quorum of Seventy, all but one man, what is his power? It would be to go and preach, baptize, confirm, lay on hands, ordain, set in order, build up, and establish the whole kingdom of God as it is now. Can we go any further? Yes; and I think you will see the reason of it, and how easy it is to be understood, and see the propriety of it. I really believe, and it is my doctrine, that if I speak to the brethren by the power of the Spirit of my calling, the evidences are commended to those who hear, and the reasons they see in the spirit of the remarks I make. Suppose the Enemy had power to <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"88b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD09\/JoD09_0088.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;88b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/3824\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> destroy all but one of the High Priests from the face of the earth, what would that one possess in the power of his Priesthood? He would have power and authority to go and preach, baptize, confirm, ordain, and set in order the kingdom of God in all its perfection on the earth. Could he do this without revelation? No. Could the Seventies? No. Could the Twelve? No. And we ask, Could Joseph Smith or the First Presidency do this without revelation? No; not one of them could do such a work without revelation direct from God. I can go still further. Whoever is ordained to the office of an Elder to a certain degree possesses the keys of the Melchizedek Priesthood; and suppose only one Elder should be left on the earth, could he go and set in order the kingdom of God? Yes, by revelation. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v9n431\"> How came these Apostles, these Seventies, these High Priests, and all this organization we now enjoy? It came by revelation. Father Cahoon,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"86035\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 86035)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(86035)\">D&amp;C 52:30<\/a><\/span> who lately died in your neighborhood, was one of the first men ordained to the office of High Priest in this kingdom. In the year 1831, the Prophet Joseph went to Ohio. He left the State of New York on the last of April, if my memory serves me, and arrived in Kirtland sometime in May. They held a General Conference, which was the first General Conference ever called or held in Ohio. Joseph then received a revelation, and ordained High Priests. You read in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants how he received the Priesthood in the first place. It is there stated how Joseph received the Aaronic Priesthood. John the Baptist came to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"83988\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 83988)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(83988)\">D&amp;C 13:1<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"129356\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129356)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129356)\">D&amp;C 27:8<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"125406\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125406)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125406)\">JS&mdash;H 1:68-73<\/a><\/span> When a person passes behind the veil, he can only officiate in the spirit world; but when he is resurrected he officiates  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"89a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD09\/JoD09_0089.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;89a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/3823\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>as a resurrected being, and not as a mortal being.

These were the first that were ordained to this office in the Church. I relate this to show you how Joseph proceeded step by step in organizing the Church. At that time there were no Seventies nor Twelve Apostles. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v9n433\"> Twenty-seven years ago, on the 5th of this month, in the year 1834, a company started from Kirtland to redeem the land of Zion.

He then opened the subject of the Twelve and Seventies for the first time I ever thought of it.

I think we will get together, by-and-by, and select Twelve Apostles, and select a Quorum of Seventies from those who have been up to Zion, out of the camp boys.&#x201D; In 1835, the last of January or in February, or about that time, we held our meetings from day to day, and brother Joseph called out Twelve Apostles at that time. He had a revelation when we were singing to him. Those who were acquainted with him knew when the spirit of revelation was upon him, for his countenance wore an expression peculiar to himself while under that influence. He preached by the Spirit of revelation, and taught in his council by it, and those who were acquainted with him could discover it at once, for at such times there was a peculiar clearness and transparency in his face. He followed up that revelation until he organized the Church, and so along until the baptism of the dead was revealed. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v9n435\"> I relate these circumstances to show you that a person who is ordained to the office of an Elder in this kingdom has the same Priesthood that the High Priests, that the Twelve Apostles, that the Seventies, and that the First Presidency hold; but all are not called to be one of the Twelve Apostles, nor are all called to be one of the First Presidency, nor to be one of the First Presidents of all the Seventies, nor to be one of the Presidents of a Quorum of Seventies,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"90385\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 90385)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(90385)\">D&amp;C 107:93-95<\/a><\/span> nor to preside over the High Priests' Quorum; but every man in his order and place, possessing a portion of the same Priesthood, according to the gifts and callings to each.

Some of the High Priests may be ordained to officiate in callings pertaining to the Church in Ward capacities.

He has no such right&#x2014;he has no right to neglect this Ward one minute for the sake of such meeting. That is not his right and calling when his services are required here as Bishop. There is a poor widow, a sick family, business is going at random here and there, and he has no right to believe that he has the privilege of leaving all his Ward to look out for themselves, and say, &#x201C;If you do well, it is well: and if you do ill, I cannot help it, I am going to my Quorum meeting.&#x201D; It is his duty to devote his time, from New Year's morning to New Year's morning again, for the benefit of his ward. He is placed to preside over it, and he will dictate all in his Ward. If he sees a Seventy or a High Priest squandering his property, or if he sees any getting drunk, gambling, or loafing about, wasting their time, he has a perfect right to call them to account. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v9n444\"> We have mass Quorums of Seven<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"92b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD09\/JoD09_0092.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;92b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/3820\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>ties in most of the settlements in the Territory; and I have frequently thought, if the brethren did not improve pretty fast, the title would have to be altered a little; but as they have improved, we do not see any necessity for making the application and calling them muss Quorums. Joseph Smith never would permit the Seventies to get together and believe themselves a separate body from the rest of the Church. I never cared much about this, for I was not a particle afraid that they would get any power that truly does not belong to them; for, if they did, I was always satisfied that is would be blown to the four winds. I want to inform the Seventies living in Bishop Miller's Ward (and what I now say applies to all the other Wards and Bishops), if he calls on them to act as Teachers, it is their imperative duty to act as Teachers, seeking to benefit and bless the people by enlarging their understandings, that they may prove themselves before God and one another. There is a world of intelligence to impart, and the Priesthood (in its various callings, appointments, helps, and governments), is the means, through its ministers, of imparting it to the people. It is not the duty of a Seventy or High Priest, who is appointed a Teacher or a Bishop, to neglect the duties of those callings to attend a Seventies' or High Priests' meeting. Attend to the wishes of your Bishop, and never ask who has the most power. The man who has the most power with God will wield it, and earth and hell cannot hinder it. Talk about power, and &#x201C;I want you to give me influence!&#x201D; There are but few things that offend me more than to have men come to me and say, &#x201C;Brother Brigham, give me influence, for I am a great man in this kingdom.&#x201D; And what would he do with it? He would take himself and all who would follow him to the Devil.  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"93a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD09\/JoD09_0093.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;93a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/3819\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>Every man who has true influence has obtained it before God through faithfulness, and in all such cases there is not the least danger but what he will have it before the Saints.

When a Bishop calls upon a man to officiate as an assistant to him, he does not call upon him as a Seventy or as a High Priest, but as one of his own family&#x2014;as a member of his Ward. You know what the Spirit of the Lord teaches me, to see that the widows go not hungry, that the orphans are clothed, and every able-bodied man is judiciously and profitably employed, and that every man is doing his duty&#x2014;to see that the cattle and wagons are got together when they are wanted; and it is as much the duty of the Seventies to look after these matters as it is the duty of <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"93b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD09\/JoD09_0093.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;93b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/3819\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> any of their brethren.
