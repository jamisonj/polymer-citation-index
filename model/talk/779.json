Evans, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1955, pp. 112-114<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI cherish the privilege of sitting by Brother Adam S. Bennion, but not of following him as a\nspeaker. He makes this task doubly difficult.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat I should least like to do today would be to detract in any way from the glorious quality\nand content and spirit of the messages which we have heard here these past four or five\ndays&mdash;beginning with President McKay's message of Sunday morning on peace in the world\nand the influence of the home; going back before that to President Richards' remarks in the\npriesthood meeting on Saturday evening, as concerning the counsel that we should not\noverextend ourselves in debt (which reminded me of the counsel given to Joseph Smith not to\nrun faster nor labor more than we have strength and means); then the glorious talks&mdash;two of\nthem&mdash;by President J. Reuben Clark on fundamentals, including the counsel to keep all of\nthe commandments; and President Smith's remarks at the missionary meeting, reminding us of\nour inescapable obligations to bear witness to the world.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so we have been edified and encouraged and strengthened by the messages of all the\nbrethren, on the home, on the teaching of children, on the example we must set before them,\nof the divinity of our Savior, Jesus the Christ, on glorious reality and divine calling of Joseph\nthe Prophet, of the reality of the appearance to him of the Father and the Son.  Right down to\nthe present, to the immediately previous talk, it has been a glorious, inspiring, and solid and\nsatisfying general conference.\n<\/p><p>\nI think at this point we could well ask the question, or questions: What is the ultimate\nmeaning and purpose of these conferences; what is the real meaning of this miscellany of\nmessages (or seeming miscellany to those who are not quite aware of the wholeness of the\ngospel)?  Why do all this? Why come together?  Why so exert ourselves and so concern\nourselves?  Why not just relax and be comfortable and complacent?  Why is it all important? \nI suppose we are busier, per capita, than any other people that I know of, and if there were\nnot some great far-reaching, basic importance to all this effort we go to, and all this gathering\nwe do, all this activity, and all this instructing and edifying of one another, it would save us a\nlot of time and trouble if we knew that it were not important.\n<\/p><p>\nThese things would not be so important except for the reality of everlasting life, but the most\nmeaningful things in life are everlasting, and what we do is important because we are\neverlasting&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nFor whosoever will save his life shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his life for my\nsake shall find it (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34713\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34713)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34713)\">Matt. 16:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow Brother Bennion has already pursued a theme that I might have pursued; and some\ncomments that I might have made on happiness he has transcended with his on joy.  But the\nmeaning of all this that we do, and the reason for all of it, is because men are immortal;\nbecause the object of life is happiness, peace, eternal life, and everlasting progress; and these\nare sufficient indeed to justify all we do, and much more.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to read into the record, in witness of the truth of this statement, a sentence from\nJoseph Smith concerning the aim and object of life: \n<\/p><p>\nHappiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we\npursue the path that leads to it; and this path\nis virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God\n(<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>, pp. 255-256).\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Bennion has ably brought before us some of the things that have in them the makings\nof joy and of happiness.  There is a long list of other things. We could extend ourselves into\nthe recital of them for a long time to come; among them: obedience; freedom, freedom to\nthink, a kind of freedom in which we keep ourselves from the enslavement of habits that are\ndetrimental to happiness; an open mind to truth; love; a sense of belonging; a conviction of\npurpose, purpose in time and in eternity; cleanliness; the peace that comes with a quiet\nconscience; patience; repentance&mdash;these are all indispensable elements of happiness.\n<\/p><p>\nAnother I have not named is family unity.  Not many days ago my lovely wife, the mother of\nour four sons, and I, with our sons, were all together&mdash;the six of us&mdash;in a car going to the same\nplace with a common purpose and a common destination in mind; and sharply the thought\ncame to me, how much less it would mean if we were not together, and if we were divided in\nour objectives; if their mother were trying to tell them to go one place or to believe one thing,\nand I were trying to tell them to go another place or to believe another thing; if she were\nsetting before them a certain set of ideals or objectives, and I were setting before hem a\ndifferent set of ideals and objectives.  This would not be fair to a home. It would not be fair\nto children.  It would not be fair to the future.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the greatest elements of joy and peace and effectiveness in life is the unity of parents\nin a home; and with my young friends who are contemplating entering into this most\nimportant of all relationships, that of marriage, I would plead this day to think of this: No\nmarriage has a right to be made, which, at its making, has less than the prospect of lasting\neverlastingly.  No marriage at its making, has the right to impose the penalty upon a home of\npulling children two ways at once.  It is not fair to the children.  It is not fair to the\ncommunity.  It is not fair to the future.  It is difficult enough to teach children when both\nparents are pulling in the same direction, but when the two people that children have the most\nright to look to for guidance are each telling them something basically different, and are each\npersuading them on a different course in a different way, it has in it the seeds of trouble and\ndiscontent and frustration and unhappiness and ineffectiveness in life.\n<\/p><p>\nI would leave this with you as one of the greatest elements, one of the indispensable elements\nof happiness: unity in the home.\n<\/p><p>\nWe could mention many more. There is humility, always an indispensable. I like to recall a\nsentence from Owen Meredith which rings in my heart: \"O be sure that no man learn anything\nat all unless he first learn humility.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOf course, there is faith, the first of the first principles of the gospel.  What a glorious thing\nfaith is!  Faith!  All of us would like to know a lot of answers we do not know.  All of us\nshall some day.  But it was meant that men should live in part by faith.  It is a glorious thing\nto have it, to meet the unanswered questions, to meet the fears of life, to carry us over all\ndifficulties&mdash;the glorious principle of faith, the first of the first principles of the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants I would recall these elements of joy\nand happiness, of peace, and of purpose in life: \n<\/p><p>\nRemember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness,\ngodliness, charity, humility, diligence.\n<\/p><p>\nAsk, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13350\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13350)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13350)\">D&amp;C 4:6-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI haven't the language to express to you the love I feel for these, my brethren, for their\nfatherly and brotherly affection, confidence, and encouragement. I haven't the words to\nexpress to you the gratitude I feel for my fellowship with you and my membership in this\nChurch, in this choice and cherished fellowship; and I am grateful for the love and affection I\nfeel in my heart for all men, all of my Father's children, and for the things we have in\ncommon.\n<\/p><p>\nI think I know something of the weight of responsibility that comes with influencing the lives\nof others.  I believe I sense something of the responsibility of bearing witness; and yet to you\nwho are here, and to all who may listen within and outside membership in this Church, I\nwould leave with you the witness of my soul as to the divinity the Lord Jesus Christ; as to the\nFatherhood of God, who made us in his image: as to the divine reality of the mission and\nmessage of Joseph Smith, and the appearance of the Father and the Son unto him, not just in\na manner of speaking, but in very fact; as to the inspired and authorized leadership of this\nChurch in this day; the prophetic calling of President McKay; as to the glorious destiny of all\nmen, if they will follow the promises, the purposes, the commandments, and go all the way in\nkeeping them&mdash;not just part way.\n<\/p><p>\nGod lives.  His purposes are eternal. Truth will triumph.  Injustice will be righted.  Men are\nimmortal. There are happiness, peace, everlasting life, eternal progress for all of us on the\nterms on which our Father offers them to us.\n<\/p><p>\nTo my beloved young friends of this glorious young generation that we have in the Church\ntoday: May I plead with you to be patient, to search the scriptures, to keep your lives\nbalanced, and to reserve judgment, to keep faith, to keep clean, to go forth and rise to the\nhigh destiny that is yours, and to live your lives and make your homes with unity of purpose\nwith your companions so that you may realize that joy and effectiveness and peace and\nundivided purpose in life which will lead to limitless possibilities here and hereafter.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you and give you every needed thing in life, I pray in Jesus' name.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
