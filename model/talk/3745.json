Perhaps to comfort Joshua, who now had the responsibility for the children of Israel, who didn\u2019t yet have a homeland, and perhaps to comfort that large body of people who had just lost their leader of more than forty years, the Lord spoke to Joshua and said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/commitment-to-god.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cAs I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/commitment-to-god.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cBe strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30102\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30102)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30102)\">Josh. 1:5\u20136<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/commitment-to-god.p9\" class=\"\">The Lord then continues to speak to Joshua by way of commandment:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/commitment-to-god.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cOnly be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30103\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30103)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30103)\">Josh. 1:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/commitment-to-god.p11\" class=\"\">Then speaking about the law only to Moses, the Lord adds:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/commitment-to-god.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cObserve to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30104\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30104)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30104)\">Josh. 1:8<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/commitment-to-god.p13\" class=\"\">Finally, we have this last reiteration by the Lord of what he had previously said, to comfort and to remind Joshua of the relationship between the blessings of heaven and obedience to divine law:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/commitment-to-god.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cHave not I commanded thee?

With faith in the Lord, Joshua could now go forward, knowing that the Lord would direct him in the way he should go. Joshua knew that his obedience would bring success, and although he did not know exactly how he would succeed, he now had confidence in the result.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/commitment-to-god.p16\" class=\"\">The record tells us that the tribes of Israel moved to the Jordan River and encamped for three days, preparing to cross at a point near the city of Jericho.

Not knowing the means, but assured as to the end, Joshua carried out the instructions he had been given by a messenger of the Lord. His commitment was to complete obedience. His concern was to do precisely as he was instructed, that the promise of the Lord would be fulfilled. The instructions no doubt seemed strange, but his faith in the outcome urged him on. The result, of course, was another in a long series of miracles experienced by the Israelites as they were led over many years by Moses, by Joshua, and by many other prophets who were committed to follow the commandments and the directives of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/commitment-to-god.p20\" class=\"\">As Joshua and his people approached Jericho, the instructions of the Lord were followed precisely, and according to the scriptural account, \u201cthe waIl fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30109\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30109)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30109)\">Josh. 6:20<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/commitment-to-god.p21\" class=\"\">The record states that after Israel had rested from the wars with their enemies, Joshua, who was now very old, called all Israel together.

He was saying that his decision to serve the Lord was independent of whatever they decided; that their actions would not affect his; that his commitment to do the Lord\u2019s will would not be altered by anything they or anyone else would do.
