As we walked through the Old Pioneer Cemetery searching for the grave of an ancestor, Zina Baker Huntington, I was touched by the peaceful solitude and spirit I felt. I walked through the trees and read the names on the gravestones, many of them children and families. I wept as my heart was turned to our forefathers, many of whom had joined the Church and come to Nauvoo. In my mind I asked many questions: Why did they leave their comfortable homes and families? Why did they suffer persecution, sickness, even death? Why did they sacrifice all that they had to come to this place and build a temple? They hardly had shelter, and yet they were building a temple! Why did they do it? And when the temple was nearly completed, how could they leave it behind? As I sat silently contemplating this scene, the answer came forcefully yet softly to my mind and heart: \u201cWe did this for you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/we-did-this-for-you.p5\" class=\"\">Those words, \u201cWe did this for you,\u201d reminded me that our ancestors, along with many other faithful Saints, sacrificed everything because of their testimonies and faith in Jesus Christ. They knew that the gospel had been restored to the earth once more and that they were led by a prophet of God. They knew that the Book of Mormon was true and understood its message and witness. They knew that through the restoration of priesthood keys, families could be sealed together for eternity through holy priesthood ordinances available only in a temple. They knew that temple work was the key to the salvation and exaltation of the human family. They knew the importance of this work, and they were willing to give all that they had in order to provide a house acceptable to the Lord wherein this holy work could be performed. They sacrificed everything so that past and future generations would have access to the eternal blessings of the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/we-did-this-for-you.p6\" class=\"\">Prior to coming to Nauvoo, the Saints sacrificed greatly to build the first temple of this dispensation in Kirtland, Ohio. It was there that the Lord Himself appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. Three other heavenly messengers also appeared there. One of these was Elijah the prophet, who restored, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, keys pertaining to the restoration of the priesthood and the \u201cgreat work to be done in the temples of the Lord.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-24911_000_030\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44033\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44033)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44033)\">D&amp;C 138:48<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43926\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43926)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43926)\">D&amp;C 27:9<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44007\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44007)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44007)\">D&amp;C 110:14\u201316<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44023\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44023)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44023)\">D&amp;C 128:17<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44032\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44032)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44032)\">D&amp;C 138:47<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> This happened in accordance with the promise that is recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants wherein the Lord said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/we-did-this-for-you.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/we-did-this-for-you.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/we-did-this-for-you.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cIf it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-24911_000_030\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43911\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43911)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43911)\">D&amp;C 2:1\u20133<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/we-did-this-for-you.p10\" class=\"\">The early Saints understood what this scripture meant, and on that beautiful morning in the old cemetery in Nauvoo, I understood also.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/we-did-this-for-you.p11\" class=\"\">How can the promises made to the fathers be planted in the hearts of the children?
