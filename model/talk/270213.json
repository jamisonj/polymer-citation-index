What is the matter here? Did not the Apostle speak the truth? Certainly he did&mdash;but\n  he spoke to a people who were under the penalty of death, the moment they embraced Christianity;\n  and no one without a knowledge of the fact would confess it, and expose themselves to death, and\n  this was consequently given as a criterion to the church or churches to which John wrote.
