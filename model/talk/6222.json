Come one, come all, the Lord has invited. The gospel of Jesus Christ is for every man and woman, boy and girl. He doesn\u2019t change the rules for the rich or the poor, the married or unmarried, the Portuguese or the Chinese. The gospel is for <span class=\"emphasis\">every one<\/span> of us, and the spiritual requirements and rewards are universal.

The Lord\u2019s motives stand in stark contrast to those of Lucifer, who is obsessed with attempting to make us feel less than who we are as sons and daughters of God. He despises a consecrated people and delights at obscuring our vision and enticing us away from the path that leads back to our heavenly home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/our-only-chance.p6\" class=\"\">As a young BYU student I learned a little something about staying on course when heading home. One Christmas Eve my brother and I left to drive home to Kansas. But early in our journey we learned that a huge snowstorm was heading our way, so we pulled out a map, identified a detour that would skirt the edge of the storm, and headed into parts unknown. Our creative navigating proved dangerous. Our new route was unfamiliar, and we still ran right into the blizzard. To make matters worse, late that night as we were creeping along in blinding snow on an obscure highway, our old Ford quit. We were stranded. And we had absolutely no idea where we were.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/our-only-chance.p7\" class=\"\">Eventually we caught a ride to the nearest town, where we found that we were still hours from home and marooned in Last Chance, Colorado. At that point there was only one thing to do. We called home for help. In the middle of the night our father left to come and rescue us. By the next afternoon we were all safely home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/our-only-chance.p8\" class=\"\">I\u2019ll never forget Christmas Eve in Last Chance, where we were immobilized by a problem largely of our own making and one we were unequipped to solve. That day our father did for us what we could not do for ourselves. Now, each one of us is on the path towards our eternal home. And for various reasons we all need rescue\u2014rescue from loneliness and heartache, from despair and disillusionment, from the consequences of innocent mistakes and blatant sin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/our-only-chance.p9\" class=\"\">Where do we turn for help? \u201cIn the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more excellent way\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22461\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22461)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22461)\">Ether 12:11<\/a><\/span>). The Savior isn\u2019t our last chance; He is our only chance. Our only chance to overcome self-doubt and catch a vision of who we may become. Our only chance to repent and have our sins washed clean. Our only chance to purify our hearts, subdue our weaknesses, and avoid the adversary. Our only chance to obtain redemption and exaltation. Our only chance to find peace and happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/our-only-chance.p10\" class=\"\">Left to his own devices, the natural man inevitably succumbs to Satan (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"41039\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41039)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41039)\">Mosiah 3:19<\/a><\/span>), who abandons his prey once he lures them from the straight and narrow path. But the Savior will guide those who follow Him <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> the way home. Lehi\u2019s family endured an intense wilderness experience designed to teach, test, and sanctify them. Likewise, the path from our former home to eternal life runs right through this earthly wilderness, where we may expect similar challenges and difficulties. But in our journey we are not alone, for the Lord\u2019s promise to Lehi is the same to us: \u201cI will prepare the way before you [and] inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land. \u2026 After ye have arrived \u2026 ye shall know that \u2026 I, the Lord, did deliver you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2179\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2179)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2179)\">1 Ne. 17:13\u201314<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/our-only-chance.p11\" class=\"\">The Lord knows the way because He <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> the way and is our only chance for successfully negotiating mortality.
