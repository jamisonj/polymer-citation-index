This event has been celebrated each spring for more than 1,900 years. We are reminded, when the day comes, that the cold, dark winter has drawn to a close, and all nature is ready to come to life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p4\" class=\"\">After the snows have melted away, trees and shrubs put forth new shoots, buds commence to burst, and all the earth becomes a symphony of warmth and color, assuring us of new life. The change of nature from the chill of winter to the beauty of spring, as nature comes to life each year recalls the change from the gloom and despair of Gethsemane to the glorious event of the resurrection. The stone was rolled away and the announcement made: \u201cHe is not here, but is risen.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31941\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31941)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31941)\">Luke 24:6<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p5\" class=\"\">The reality of the event of the resurrection had profound meaning to every person who has the courage to believe. Is it true? Is Jesus Christ a reality? Did he actually come to earth, proclaim his gospel, and give his life for mankind? Is it true that he was resurrected from the tomb to make it possible for you and me to live again after death and have life everlasting? What evidence is there of these things? How do we gain a knowledge of the truth of them if we do not know?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p6\" class=\"\">I want to tell you that I believe these things with all my heart. I know they are true. I know that God lives and is literally our Heavenly Father; that Jesus Christ is his Son, the Redeemer of the world, and that through his atoning sacrifice every man who lives upon the earth, or who has lived or will live upon the earth, will be resurrected after death to live again. My belief in this regard has come in the same way as it has to others who believe. All persons could have this understanding by following the simple scriptural admonition:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cAsk, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cFor every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36374\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36374)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36374)\">Matt. 7:7\u20138<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p9\" class=\"\">In his letter to Israel, James cast the admonition in words with similar meaning:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cBut let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.

Of course, those who lack the desire to know and are \u201cdriven by the wind and tossed\u201d will never understand the things pertaining to God and his divine plan. A prophet has made this meaningful statement:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cThe things of God are of deep import; and time, and experience, and careful and ponderous and solemn thoughts can only find them out.

To know whether or not Jesus Christ is a reality, or if it is true that he is the Son of God and came to earth to proclaim his gospel, give his life, and accomplish the resurrection that all men may live again, there must arise within one\u2019s soul a genuine desire to gain a knowledge of the truth. When such a desire becomes strong enough, we are persuaded to examine the evidence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p24\" class=\"\">There is no tangible, concrete evidence of the existence of God or the divinity of the Master in the legal sense, but not all inquiry for truth results in proof by real or demonstrative evidence. It is fallacious to argue that because there is no demonstrative evidence of the existence of God he does not in fact exist. In the absence of evidence often thought necessary by the scientific world for positive proof, our search may take is into the realm of circumstantial evidence. We could spend hours describing the wonders of the universe, of the earth, of nature, of the human body the exactness of the laws of physics, and a thousand things, all of which dictate to the conscience of a truth seeker that there is a creator and one who rules over the universe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p25\" class=\"\">What would be the situation if the existence of God could be proven by demonstrative evidence? What would happen to the element of faith as the first step or principle of the gospel? One of the burdens of the teachings of the Master was to emphasize the importance of faith. Faith is the element that builds the bridge in the absence of concrete evidence. This is exactly what the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews was talking about when he referred to faith as \u201cthe substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24443\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24443)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24443)\">Heb. 11:1<\/a><\/span>.) In other words, faith is the assurance of the existence of a truth even though it is not evident or cannot be proved by positive evidence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p26\" class=\"\">Suppose that all things could be proven by demonstrative evidence. What then would become of the element of faith? There would be no need for faith and it would be eliminated, giving rise then to this query: If faith is the first step or principle of the gospel and is eliminated, what happens to the gospel plan? The very foundation will crumble. I submit that there is a divine reason why all things cannot be proven by concrete evidence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p27\" class=\"\">Those who doubt are prone to ask for proof or a sign that they might believe. The prophet Alma spoke to his people on this very subject and said to them, \u201cYea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cNow I ask, is this faith?

The desire for fruit caused the seed to be planted, and the planter had faith that it would sprout and grow. Alma continues to describe this seed of faith:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/faith-the-first-step.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cAs the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us.
