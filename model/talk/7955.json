The men who joined Him did not know that this meal would someday be called the Last Supper. Had they known this and what it meant, they would have wept.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/beautiful-mornings.p6\" class=\"\">Their Master, however, perfectly understood that the ordeal of Gethsemane and of Golgotha would shortly begin. The darkest hours in the history of the world were imminent; nevertheless, Jesus said to them, \u201cIn the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124308\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124308)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124308)\">John 16:33<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/beautiful-mornings.p7\" class=\"\">We live today in an era of turbulence and uncertainty, a time the Lord prophesied to Enoch would be marked by \u201cdays of wickedness and vengeance\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124309\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124309)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124309)\">Moses 7:60<\/a><\/span>).

Packer once spoke of his grandchildren and the increasingly troubled world in which they live. He said: \u201cThey will see many events transpire in the course of their lifetime. Some of these shall tax their courage and extend their faith.

He repeated that counsel many times during His ministry. To His Saints in our day, the Savior has said, \u201cBe of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124311\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124311)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124311)\">D&amp;C 68:6<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/beautiful-mornings.p11\" class=\"\">The Lord will stand by His Church and people and keep them in safety until His coming.

President Brigham Young said of that time: \u201cWhen surrounded by mobs, with death and destruction threatening on every hand, I am not aware but that I felt just as joyful [and] well in my spirits, as I do now. Prospects might appear dull and very dark, but I have never seen a time in this Gospel but what I knew that the result would be beneficial to the cause of truth\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Brigham Young<\/span> [1997], 357).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/beautiful-mornings.p16\" class=\"\">My missionary companion, Paul, was someone who always radiated good cheer. As a young father, he was stricken with multiple sclerosis. Yet despite the adversity that followed, he continued serving others with joy and good humor. He once entered my office seated in his first wheelchair and declared, \u201cLife begins with a motorized wheelchair!\u201d I will always remember him, a few years before he died, holding high the Olympic torch while riding in his wheelchair as hundreds cheered. Like that ever-burning flame, Paul\u2019s faith never dimmed in the storm of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/beautiful-mornings.p17\" class=\"\">When I was a student at Brigham Young University, I lived in a house with several young men. My roommate, Bruce, was the most optimistic person I have ever known. We never once heard him say anything negative about any person or any circumstance, and it was impossible not to feel buoyed up in his presence. His good cheer flowed from an abiding trust in the Savior and in His gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/beautiful-mornings.p18\" class=\"\">One cold, wintry day, another friend of mine, Tom, was walking across the university campus. It was only 7:00 in the morning, and the campus was deserted and dark. Heavy snow was falling, with a brisk wind. \u201cWhat miserable weather,\u201d Tom thought. He walked farther, and out in the darkness and snow, he heard someone singing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/beautiful-mornings.p19\" class=\"\">Sure enough, through the driving snow came our ever-optimistic friend, Bruce. With his arms outstretched to the sky, he was singing a number from the Broadway musical <span class=\"emphasis\">Oklahoma:<\/span> \u201cOh, what a beautiful morning! Oh, what a beautiful day! I\u2019ve got a beautiful feeling, everything\u2019s going my way\u201d (see Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein\u00a0II, \u201cOh, What a Beautiful Mornin\u2019\u201d [1943]).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/beautiful-mornings.p20\" class=\"\">In the intervening years, that bright voice in a dark storm has become for me a symbol of what faith and hope are all about. Even in a darkening world, we as Latter-day Saints may sing with joy, knowing that the powers of heaven are with God\u2019s Church and people. We may rejoice in the knowledge that a beautiful morning lies ahead\u2014the dawn of the millennial day, when the Son of God shall rise in the East and reign again on the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/beautiful-mornings.p21\" class=\"\">I think also of two other beautiful mornings in the history of the world. In the spring of 1820, on the morning of a beautiful, clear day in Palmyra, New York, a young man named Joseph Smith entered a grove of trees and knelt in prayer. The answer to that prayer, the appearance of the Father and the Son, ushered in the dispensation of the fulness of times and the Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ to the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/beautiful-mornings.p22\" class=\"\">And yet another beautiful morning dawned nearly 2,000 years ago just outside the city wall of Jerusalem. The sun no doubt shone with exceptional radiance that Easter morning. A small company of women had come to visit a garden tomb, hoping to anoint the body of their crucified Lord. Two angels met them and declared: \u201cWhy seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124316\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124316)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124316)\">Luke 24:5\u20136<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/beautiful-mornings.p23\" class=\"\">Of the triumph of Jesus Christ over sin and death, I bear witness. Of the merciful plan of our Eternal Father and His everlasting love, I testify. As we rise up each morning, may we look to heaven in faith and say, \u201cOh, what a beautiful morning,\u201d I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
