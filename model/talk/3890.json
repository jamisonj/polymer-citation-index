One was a formal invitation to attend the swearing-in ceremony in Washington, D.C., of the newest and youngest member of the United States Tax Court\u2014an appointment made by the President of the United States, and a very prestigious honor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/become-a-star-thrower.p6\" class=\"\">Within hours of receiving that invitation, I had a visit from a law enforcement officer inquiring if I knew a certain young man. I replied, \u201cOf course I know him. Why do you ask?\u201d This young man had indicated to the officer that he knew me. A sordid story was then related to me of drugs, immorality, stealing to satisfy the high cost of drugs, buying illicit sexual favors, and cheap rooming house living. When I expressed a desire to see and help this young man, the officer suggested I not see him at this time because of his emotional condition.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/become-a-star-thrower.p7\" class=\"\">The families of these two young men are well known to me.

Going to top-rated private schools overshadowed interest in a mission. He never married, associated with the wrong people, has now become a ridiculer of gospel principles because they differ from his life-style, and is virtually an outcast from family, society, and from the word of God. His family\u2019s life-style failed to encourage him spiritually by its lack of interest in the scriptures, family home evenings, family and personal prayer, and hearing in their home testimonies of religious belief.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/become-a-star-thrower.p10\" class=\"\">The Honorable Judge Stephen Swift is settling his family in Washington, D.C., and learning to feel comfortable in the robes of a federal judge.
