As President Monson shared the wonderful news of five new temples, I thought how across the world, on every continent, in large cities and in small villages, we are a great family of believers.

Part of our victory as disciples of Christ is what we do when these feelings come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/you-know-enough.p7\" class=\"\">Nearly 40 years ago as I contemplated the challenge of a mission, I felt very inadequate and unprepared. I remember praying, \u201cHeavenly Father, how can I serve a mission when I know so little?\u201d I believed in the Church, but I felt my spiritual knowledge was very limited. As I prayed, the feeling came: \u201cYou don\u2019t know everything, but you know enough!\u201d That reassurance gave me the courage to take the next step into the mission field.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/you-know-enough.p8\" class=\"\">Our spiritual journey is the process of a lifetime. We do not know everything in the beginning or even along the way. Our conversion comes step-by-step, line upon line. We first build a foundation of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We treasure the principles and ordinances of repentance, baptism, and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. We include a continuing commitment to prayer, a willingness to be obedient, and an ongoing witness of the Book of Mormon. (The Book of Mormon is powerful spiritual nourishment.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/you-know-enough.p9\" class=\"\">We then remain steady and patient as we progress through mortality. At times, the Lord\u2019s answer will be, \u201cYou don\u2019t know everything, but you know enough\u201d\u2014enough to keep the commandments and to do what is right. Remember Nephi\u2019s words: \u201cI know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-02211_000_006\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117399\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117399)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117399)\">1\u00a0Nephi 11:17<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/you-know-enough.p10\" class=\"\">I once visited a mission in southern Europe.

The missionary told me about his challenging childhood, of learning disorders, of moving from one family to another. He spoke sincerely of his inability to learn a new language and adapt to a new culture. Then he added, \u201cBrother Andersen, I don\u2019t even know if God loves me.\u201d As he said those words, I felt a sure and forceful feeling come into my spirit: \u201cHe does know I love him. He knows it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/you-know-enough.p12\" class=\"\">I let him continue for a few more minutes, and then I said, \u201cElder, I\u2019m sympathetic to much of what you\u2019ve said, but I must correct you on one thing: you do know God loves you. You know He does.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/you-know-enough.p13\" class=\"\">As I said those words to him, the same Spirit that had spoken to me spoke to him. He bowed his head and began to cry. He apologized. \u201cBrother Andersen,\u201d he said, \u201cI do know God loves me; I do know it.\u201d He didn\u2019t know everything, but he knew enough. He knew God loved him. That priceless piece of spiritual knowledge was sufficient for his doubt to be replaced with faith.

Hopes and dreams were shattered. My friend felt unbearable sorrow. He began to question what he had been taught and what he had taught as a missionary. The mother of my friend wrote me a letter and asked if I would give him a blessing. As I laid my hands upon his head, I felt to tell him something that I had not thought about in exactly the same way before. The impression that came to me was: Faith is not only a feeling; it is a decision. He would need to choose faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/you-know-enough.p16\" class=\"\">My friend did not know everything, but he knew enough.

A short time ago I received a letter from his son who is now serving a mission. It was full of conviction and testimony.
