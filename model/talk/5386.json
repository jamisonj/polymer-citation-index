As far as I was able to determine this morning, the vote of thanks was unanimous in the affirmative. For this I express my gratitude to all of you who were present here.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/service-and-happiness.p4\" class=\"\">When I was called to the Quorum of the Seventy in April 1976, Elder LeGrand Richards, who, as many of you will recall, was a Dutchman by adoption, used to call me the \u201cHappy Dutchman.\u201d After seventeen and a half years, I want you to know that I am still the Happy Dutchman, and I will tell you why. Because these years of service in the Quorum have brought great joy and countless blessings to my life and the life of Bea, my eternal companion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/service-and-happiness.p5\" class=\"\">I had the privilege to be assigned to stakes from Punta Arenas in South America to Anchorage, Alaska; and from Hobart, Australia, to Japan. I worked closely with faithful regional representatives and dedicated stake presidencies\u2014always teaching them correct principles so that they would learn to govern themselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/service-and-happiness.p6\" class=\"\">What a blessing it was to visit missions of the Church in many parts of the world and teach the missionaries what missionary work is really all about: transferring sacred knowledge by the Spirit to people who live in ignorance but who all are entitled to hear the message of the restored gospel. This message enables them to learn that the most important part of their lives is making sacred covenants that will bring them back to their Father in Heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/service-and-happiness.p7\" class=\"\">I am still as happy as when I was called to the Quorum, and, in good western American tradition, I will now ride off into the sunset.

I really would not mind at all to quickly go back to the hymnbooks again, because I can truly testify that this is a church of workers and <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> a museum of Saints. Those who think differently have not fully understood the real purpose of the divine organization to which we all belong.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"preamble\">Yes, I have maintained a cheerful disposition and I will gladly share with you some positive ideas:<\/p>\n    <ul class=\"bullet\"><li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Learn to <span class=\"emphasis\">love<\/span> the calling that you have in the Church.

He shared with us some thoughts from an author about growing old.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/service-and-happiness.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cNobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old only by deserting their ideals, their faith. There is always the love of wonder, a childlike appetite for what is next, and the joy of your life. You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; as young as your self-confidence, as old as your fear or despair.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/service-and-happiness.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cIn the center of our heart is a recording chamber, and so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer, courage, and faith, so long are we young\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1983, p. 25).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/service-and-happiness.p20\" class=\"\">How blessed are we to be part of a rapidly expanding church that teaches beauty, hope, cheer, courage, faith, and happiness that enable us to stay young at heart through faithful service in whatever calling we may have.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/service-and-happiness.p21\" class=\"\">President Thomas S. Monson\u2019s First Presidency message entitled \u201cHappiness, the Universal Quest\u201d in the October 1993 issue of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> magazine, shares five important ways to obtain lasting happiness in this life and the life to come, based on the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/service-and-happiness.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cHappiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it\u201d (p. 2).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/service-and-happiness.p23\" class=\"\">Therefore, let us all walk in these clearly defined paths to increase our happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/service-and-happiness.p24\" class=\"\">In closing, I bear solemn witness that God, our Eternal Father, lives; that Jesus is the Christ, the Only Begotten Son of the Father born in the flesh, the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind; that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God; and that every man who has succeeded him as President of the Church has been a living prophet, including President Ezra Taft Benson in our day and time.
