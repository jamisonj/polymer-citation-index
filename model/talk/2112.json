We have the agency to make that choice as we react to the conditions in which we find ourselves during our life span. We must make choices, as we are surrounded by the elements and resources of the earth as well as by the people with whom we associate.

There are, of course, some who would have us believe that there is no such thing as good or evil, but this philosophy runs counter to the natural laws of opposites that exist, such as heat and cold, light and dark, gravitation and vacuum, and many others. We need to use our eyes that we may see, our ears that we may hear, and our minds that we may be able to think and make our own decisions as we sift out the chaff of all we see and hear, so that we may know the truth of that which we feel in our hearts, as it is affirmed by the Holy Spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/turn-heavenward-our-eyes.p41\" class=\"\">Faith in God is a prerequisite to the influence of the Holy Spirit.

He said: \u201cIt is glorious when you can lie down at night with a clear conscience that you have done your best not to offend anyone and have injured no one. \u2026 These and countless other virtues and conditions are all wrapped up in the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Man May Know for Himself<\/span> [Deseret Book Co., 1967], p. 458.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/turn-heavenward-our-eyes.p88\" class=\"\">Some other conditions that make for happiness are the ability to follow that which you know to be true, to control your appetites and passions, to be able to make your own decisions, to feel no envy of another, to be able to commune with God in prayer, and to be free from bonds, and to be master of yourself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/turn-heavenward-our-eyes.p89\" class=\"\">The second appeal of the child to his parents\u2014train me to be a blessing to the world\u2014is companion to happiness, for it calls for action by the individual in an expression of service, of losing himself in helping his fellowman.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/turn-heavenward-our-eyes.p90\" class=\"\">You\u2019ve heard that statement that each of us is either a part of the problem or a part of the answer, with the understanding that this world is beset with problems. If you are a part of the answer, then you are a blessing to the world and can train your children to follow in your footsteps. Those who are a blessing to the world will try to do these things: (1) lend a helping hand, (2) refrain from infringing upon the rights of others, (3) obey God\u2019s laws and the laws of the land, (4) stand up for the right and fight against evil, and (5) share the truth with others, remembering, and remembering well, that the greatest gift of God is his plan of salvation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/turn-heavenward-our-eyes.p91\" class=\"\">May we guide our lives and those of our children in this direction, I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ.
