Everywhere I go, there is a great outpouring of love and kindness, and for that I am humbly thankful. It is manna to my soul. Your prayers and your love sustain me. The Lord hears your prayers and blesses me and my Brethren with health and strength and directs us in the affairs of his kingdom here upon the earth. For this all of us are deeply grateful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/an-eternal-hope-in-christ.p65\" class=\"\">In return, I extend to you my love and grateful thanks. As you return to your wards and stakes, your missions, and to your individual homes around the world, I pray our Heavenly Father to bless you and your families. Let the messages and spirit of this conference radiate and find expression in all that you do henceforth\u2014in your homes, in your work, in your meetings, and in all your comings and goings. Let us be better Latter-day Saints now than we have ever been before. I pray the Lord to bless you; and as his servant, I bless you and bid you a fond farewell.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/an-eternal-hope-in-christ.p66\" class=\"\">In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
