There are variations in our trials but no immunities. Thus, the scriptures cite the fiery furnace and fiery trials (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"10822\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10822)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10822)\">Dan. 3:6\u201326<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"2456\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2456)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2456)\">1 Pet. 4:12<\/a><\/span>).

Even so, brothers and sisters, such emerging individuals do not rush to line up in front of another fiery furnace in order to get an extra turn! However, since the mortal school is of such short duration, our tutoring Lord can be the Schoolmaster of the compressed curriculum.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/from-whom-all-blessings-flow.p10\" class=\"\">The redeeming presence of our loving Father-God in the universe is the grand fact pertaining to the human condition. It is the supernal truth which, along with His plan of happiness, reigns preeminent and imperial over all other realities. Other truths, by comparison, are merely fleeting factoids about which we may be \u201cever learning\u201d without coming to a knowledge of the grand truths (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5305\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5305)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5305)\">2 Tim. 3:7<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/from-whom-all-blessings-flow.p11\" class=\"\">Mortal experience points evermore to the Atonement of Jesus Christ as the central act of all human history.

Whether illness or aloneness, injustice or rejection, etc., our comparatively small-scale sufferings, if we are meek, will sink into the very marrow of the soul. We then better appreciate not only Jesus\u2019 sufferings for us, but also His matchless character, moving us to greater adoration and even emulation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/from-whom-all-blessings-flow.p13\" class=\"\">Alma revealed that Jesus knows how to succor us in the midst of our griefs and sicknesses precisely because Jesus has already borne our griefs and sicknesses (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"10227\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10227)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10227)\">Alma 7:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>).
