That light came when other Christian churches taught that death irrevocably, eternally, determined the destiny of the soul. The baptized were rewarded with endless joy. All others faced eternal torment, without hope of redemption. The Lord\u2019s revelation that baptism could be performed vicariously for the dead, through proper priesthood authority, preserved the justice of His statement: \u201cExcept a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29466\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29466)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29466)\">John 3:5<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/redemption-the-harvest-of-love.p4\" class=\"\">Vicarious baptism also mercifully provides this ordinance for all worthy deceased who have not received it through proper priesthood authority.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/redemption-the-harvest-of-love.p5\" class=\"\">This glorious doctrine is another witness of the all-encompassing nature of the atonement of Jesus Christ. He has made salvation available to every repentant soul. His was a vicarious atonement that conquered death. He permits the worthy deceased to receive all ordinances of salvation vicariously.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/redemption-the-harvest-of-love.p6\" class=\"\">In that epistle, written one hundred and fifty years ago, Joseph Smith stated: \u201cThe Saints have the privilege of being baptized for \u2026 their relatives who are dead \u2026 who have received the Gospel in the spirit \u2026 through \u2026 those who have been commissioned to preach to them. \u2026 Those saints who neglect it in behalf of their deceased relatives, <span class=\"emphasis\">do it at the peril of their own salvation.<\/span>\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 4:231; italics added.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/redemption-the-harvest-of-love.p7\" class=\"\">The prophet Elijah committed the keys for vicarious work to Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"19314\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19314)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19314)\">D&amp;C 110:13\u201316<\/a><\/span>) to fulfill the Lord\u2019s promise that \u201che shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19150\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19150)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19150)\">D&amp;C 2:2<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32900\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32900)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32900)\">Mal. 4:6<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/redemption-the-harvest-of-love.p8\" class=\"\">Through further revelation to Joseph Smith and subsequent prophets, there has come an understanding of and provision for temple work and the family history effort that supports it.

To overcome this feeling, the Church has greatly simplified finding our ancestors and clearing their names for temple work. For example, with the generous cooperation of the original record holders, we have gathered information on approximately two billion of the estimated seven billion individuals for whom records are thought to exist. That resource increases by many millions of names each year.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/redemption-the-harvest-of-love.p15\" class=\"\">Also, fifteen hundred family history centers operate worldwide to permit access to our vast record resources.

Through research guides, telefax, and correspondence, these centers are fortified by the impressive capabilities of the Salt Lake City Family History Library.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/redemption-the-harvest-of-love.p16\" class=\"\">Modern technology has greatly simplified the prior complex rules and regulations for this work. These streamlined steps are clearly explained in the pamphlet <span class=\"emphasis\">Come unto Christ through Temple Ordinances and Covenants.<\/span> It is available in the principal languages from priesthood leaders throughout the world. This booklet provides a summary of the doctrinal basis for family history and temple service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/redemption-the-harvest-of-love.p17\" class=\"\">Also, where they have been called, ward or branch family history consultants are available to help you succeed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/redemption-the-harvest-of-love.p18\" class=\"\">Many brilliant minds and sensitive hearts have harnessed advanced technology to provide personal computer helps to simplify family history work. Under the descriptive title of <span class=\"strong\">FamilySearch,\u2122<\/span> these powerful computer-aided resources are now available in family history centers in the United States and Canada. (Request them if they are not there. They are within policy.)

She labored without any doctrinal understanding or the abundant resources we have. Following impressions of the heart, her persistence and extensive correspondence produced a 16,000 lineage-linked treasury of information about our Talbot family. My mother obtained this record. A descendant, Cathy Frost, with two preschool children and expecting another, is computerizing those names. My wife, Jeanene, and I will personally clear them for temple work using the simplified helps I\u2019ve described today. Our family will go to the temple for these ancestors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/redemption-the-harvest-of-love.p35\" class=\"\">At present you may find it difficult to go to the temple personally, but you can submit ancestors\u2019 names for temple work. You may live where resources are very limited. Begin with ancestors that are closest to you. Search beyond your surname, following all lines of ancestry.

Resolve to bless the lives of those who are dependent upon you\u2014and in so doing, bless your own life profoundly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/redemption-the-harvest-of-love.p36\" class=\"\">I don\u2019t need to tell you the details of where to go and who to see.
