These moves took them to various parts of the country. In each place the climate and soil conditions were different, but they determined they would follow the prophet\u2019s advice and have a garden. Their first attempts at gardening were pathetic. The weeds grew much better than the vegetables. The gardens were \u201cobedience gardens.\u201d However, with continued effort, each year the gardens improved. They learned new techniques and developed skills. As children came to their family, each was taught to work and take responsibility in those \u201cobedience gardens.\u201d Now their gardens are attractive, worthwhile \u201csurvival\u201d projects, as the family enjoys and shares the produce. They preserve the excess for later use. Besides the practical lessons they learned, they found peace and assurance in keeping the commandments. Surely the promise was fulfilled for them: the prophet\u2019s advice had been for their good always.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/draw-near-unto-me-through-obedience.p10\" class=\"\">Sometimes we think that because our circumstances are difficult, it is not practical to keep all the Lord\u2019s commandments. There are those, for instance, who feel they cannot afford to pay tithing.

In order to do so, she gave all the money she had in her home to the bishop in the middle of the month, then wondered what would become of her, her husband, and their three-year-old daughter during the remaining fifteen days.

My friend and counselor Joy F. Evans tells of such a time in her life. She had four young children and was expecting her fifth child. The much-anticipated day of birth arrived\u2014about six weeks early. They had expected to have \u201ca\u201d baby, but they had twins instead\u2014Michael and Amy, premature and very small.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/draw-near-unto-me-through-obedience.p19\" class=\"\">They had already lost one child earlier, and Joy, being a nurse, felt certain those babies were also going to die. She was even afraid that her own lack of faith would contribute to their dying, and she wanted desperately for them to live!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/draw-near-unto-me-through-obedience.p20\" class=\"\">In her words, \u201cI think it was the first time I couldn\u2019t say \u2018Thy will be done.\u2019 I just couldn\u2019t say it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/draw-near-unto-me-through-obedience.p21\" class=\"\">When her husband went home the second day after the babies\u2019 birth, he prayed, not for the babies, but for his wife, their mother. Then a sweet assurance came to her that everything was all right: whatever happened was the Lord\u2019s will. The babies did die, one after two days, and the other after three; but Joy still had her feeling of peace. She could draw from the wonderful reservoir of strength she had developed by keeping the commandments through the years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/draw-near-unto-me-through-obedience.p22\" class=\"\">Having the babies dressed appropriately for burial was very important to their mother, but they were so tiny that clothes could not be found small enough to fit them. When the Relief Society president came after the second baby died, she sensed Joy\u2019s disappointment in not being able to dress the babies as she would like. The president went home and sewed busily that night. When she came back the next morning, the day of the graveside service, she had a darling little white suit for Michael and a dainty little white dress for Amy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/draw-near-unto-me-through-obedience.p23\" class=\"\">Peace can come to both the giver and the receiver as we follow the promptings of the Spirit to serve one another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/draw-near-unto-me-through-obedience.p24\" class=\"\">The Lord said, \u201cKeep my commandments, and <span class=\"emphasis\">assist<\/span> to bring forth my work.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18233\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18233)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18233)\">D&amp;C 11:9<\/a><\/span>; italics added.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/draw-near-unto-me-through-obedience.p25\" class=\"\">Sisters, as women in the Church, each of us has an important role to fill in building His kingdom on earth. The way to do this is clear. We have been commanded to sanctify ourselves that our minds may become single to God so that we can stand firm in the faith, without wavering, until our work is completed. As we keep a time for regular scripture study and quiet time for prayers, we receive knowledge and inspiration. Then, through obedience, we put that information into action. We are sanctifying ourselves one step at a time as we accept personal responsibility for our actions and honor the covenants we make at baptism, in the temple, and as we take the sacrament each Sunday. We progress by living worthy to receive the blessings available to us, responding to those promptings to serve others, by loving one another, and by trying to obey the prophet\u2019s voice in all things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/draw-near-unto-me-through-obedience.p26\" class=\"\">Elder Heber J.
