You discover that this is truly a world conference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p4\" class=\"\">Even though some speak a different language, there is another way to communicate, for quickly you discover, as you shake a hand, look into the eye of someone from a different land, there is a common bond, there is a brotherhood and a sisterhood which knows no national boundaries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p5\" class=\"\">We have frequently addressed ourselves in this conference to the country in which the headquarters of this church is located. When this occurs, I watch with interest the faces of those who hear this message through an interpreter. I have detected more than just a courteous attention. There is a genuine interest and understanding. And I guess this is right, for as I study history, there appears to be a common theme, which is played over and over.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p6\" class=\"\">We love our great country and we love yours\u2014because it is your home. I have been given an exciting assignment to assist in planning the United States of America\u2019s bicentennial celebration. I have never had an assignment which has given me a clearer vision of history and an opportunity to observe the operations of government.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p7\" class=\"\">Some months ago I was asked to assist in inviting many of the religious leaders of America to a special meeting for the purpose of increasing the participation of religious congregations in our nation\u2019s bicentennial celebration. About 400 of us assembled in Washington, D.C., and spent two days together discussing ways in which we could make a contribution to this exciting celebration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p8\" class=\"\">While I found myself having a deep respect and admiration for many of the religious leaders in attendance, I also found myself having some grave concerns over a number whom I guess you would describe as the liberal element.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p9\" class=\"\">Part of the program covering this two-day period was to divide ourselves into small discussion groups of about twenty in number to examine the role the churches would play during this celebration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p10\" class=\"\">As we concluded the first day I discussed the possibility, with a bright young colleague I had invited to attend this assembly with me, of preparing a declaration for the churches of this land to jointly proclaim to our countrymen, a reaffirmation of our need for divine guidance, an expression of gratitude for the Lord\u2019s hand in directing the formation of the government of the United States of America. I don\u2019t know how late this young man stayed up that night but when I met him for breakfast the following morning he had an excellent draft of the proposed declaration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p11\" class=\"\">I was excited with the possibility of presenting it to our small discussion group as we assembled together that morning. However, my enthusiasm rapidly dissipated. We soon discovered it was the consensus of this small group of religious leaders that any declaration referring to the Lord our God would not be acceptable. They reasoned such a declaration would be offensive to the atheist. After all, they stated, the atheist has a right to his belief, also. Of course, I completely agree that all men must have their right of free agency but I argued vigorously against locking up our own firm convictions just because they could not be accepted by everyone. The more we argued, the more the opposition united against us. We were not able to get ours or any other declaration out of committee.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p12\" class=\"\">I was so shocked with the outcome and obvious futility of our efforts that I had to seek out the religious leader who opposed our declaration. In talking to him I found myself suffering from even a greater shock. Here was a man with divinity degrees listed in a long string of letters behind his name, a leader of a Christian congregation, giving these kinds of answers to my questions:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p13\" class=\"\">Question: \u201cDo you not believe that God inspired the early leaders of this country in the formation of this great nation?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p14\" class=\"\">Answer: \u201cI find no evidence in my studies of God\u2019s hand directing the affairs of mankind in any age.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p15\" class=\"\">Question: \u201cWith such a philosophy, how do you stand in front of your congregation each week and teach Christian doctrine?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p16\" class=\"\">Answer: \u201cOh, it is not difficult. I gather together a representative group of the congregation and whatever is the consensus of this group, this is what I preach.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p17\" class=\"\">Once again, I repeat that while in Washington, D.C., attending this gathering I met many devout and wonderful church leaders, but I must say as I returned home from this trip I had a growing concern that from the pulpits of many of our churches in this land as well as in the world in general there is an increasing tendency to teach the doctrines of man rather than that which God has directed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p18\" class=\"\">As the meeting concluded I had great disappointment that a declaration of gratitude to our Eternal Father had not been pronounced or produced by this great body of religious leaders. However, I came away with the firm resolve that I would at least let my voice be heard on two issues during this bicentennial year.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p19\" class=\"\">First, I will develop within me the courage to stand up and defend that which I believe to be right. I will declare my personal witness that the heavens are not closed. The Lord continues to guide and direct all of his children on earth if they will but heed his voice. I will teach my firm conviction that the foundation of any righteous government is the law that has been received from the Lord to guide and direct man\u2019s efforts. Righteous government receives direction from the Lord. The scripture President Tanner quoted bears this out, in our country, in the establishment of this government. \u201cAnd for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16553\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16553)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16553)\">D&amp;C 101:80<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p20\" class=\"\">I have resolved to do all that is within my power to keep alive the same faith which existed in the hearts and souls of our early founding fathers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p21\" class=\"\">It was George Washington who declared, \u201cThe people know it is impossible to rightly govern without God and the Bible.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p22\" class=\"\">Again from Andrew Jackson the declaration: \u201cThe Bible is the rock on which this Republic rests.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p23\" class=\"\">I reaffirm before you here today of my faith that the Lord God continues to govern the affairs of his children.

A quotation from a recent publication, which is just one of many I have recently received from concerned citizens, is as follows:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cOn the basis of this and other such evidence, some observers suggest that the institution of marriage which had necessarily been changed over the centuries to accommodate the needs of a changing society now faces a future in which it may gradually become obsolete. In their judgment, marriage will ultimately manifest itself, not as a religious sacrament or a legal certification but simply as a sociological fact.\u201d (William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Pleasure Bond,<\/span> Toronto and Boston, Little, Brown and Co., p. 179.) They are calling for a new Christian approach to marriage. They state that dogmatism is being forced to yield to humanism no matter how slowly or how grudgingly. They call attention to studies they claim are on the verge of revealing with assurance that having extramarital relations may serve as a vehicle to faithfulness to God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p27\" class=\"\">I find that such teachings are absolutely contrary to the instructions of the Lord to mankind. As I examine the physical order in the Lord\u2019s divine plan, I find no evidence that he has ever found it necessary to make a correction. The earth continues to rotate in the same direction. The angle of its axis is unchanged. The circulation of moisture continues from sea to cloud to earth to river to sea with its same beneficial effect without alteration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-the-time-will-come-when-they-will-not-endure-sound-doctrine.p28\" class=\"\">I find the same consistency in the divine law he has established for mankind.
