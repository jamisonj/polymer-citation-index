Recently, the doctor scheduled an intensive examination to determine the soundness of the pregnancy. My daughter approached the exam with much anxiety. As the appointed day drew near, she found that her husband could not accompany her, and she asked if I would go with her. She said, \u201cMom, after all we\u2019ve been through, if anything is wrong, I am going to need someone with me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/stand-firm.p7\" class=\"\">I was delighted to get a preview peek at someone I am going to love and treasure through eternity.

His first words were, \u201cI wish every baby could look this perfect!\u201d I could hardly contain myself. As we got to our car, I could not hold back my feelings any longer and I began to cry. So many feelings just came spilling out. I wept, wishing every expectant mother could hear those words. I cried for every woman who wanted to have a baby but couldn\u2019t. Tears flowed for all the women who want children but have not found a husband. Finally, I shed tears of gratitude with an overwhelming desire that our family will provide a home worthy of this baby.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/stand-firm.p9\" class=\"\">The English poet Wordsworth captured some of my feelings about this grandchild and home when he reminded us that:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting \u2026 <\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\"> \u2026 trailing clouds of glory do we come<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">From God, who is our home.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/stand-firm.p13\" class=\"\">(William Wordsworth, \u201cOde: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood\u201d)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/stand-firm.p14\" class=\"\">Our homes here are sacred because of their connection to our Heavenly Father and our heavenly home. My experience with my daughter brought into clear focus once again the priority and vital importance of home and family. It also reminded me that as women with natural tendencies to love, nurture, and teach, we are called to protect and bless all who comprise our family. As He sends babies to this earth, the Lord needs us, whatever our circumstance may be, to stand strong and unwavering and to continue to create homes that are a fortress against a rising tide of evil.

What is now known as the Battle of Waterloo ranks as a great turning point in modern history and brought about drastic changes in political boundaries and the power balance in Europe. At a critical moment in this great battle between the forces of the French emperor, Napoleon, and the allied forces under the command of the British general Arthur Wellesley, better known as the Duke of Wellington, an anxious officer dashed into the office of the duke with the message that unless the troops were immediately withdrawn, they must yield before the larger French army.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/stand-firm.p18\" class=\"\">The duke ordered, \u201cStand firm!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/stand-firm.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cBut we shall all perish,\u201d replied the officer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/stand-firm.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cStand firm!\u201d again was the answer of the duke.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/stand-firm.p21\" class=\"\">(See Howard W.

Today, sisters, we are engaged in a fierce battle for the minds, hearts, and even the souls of our children, grandchildren, and other family members. But in this fight we have much more powerful weaponry and armor than did the Duke of Wellington\u2019s troops. For we have available to us the strength that comes from faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and the power of the gospel\u2019s ordinances.

In your own homes, give your children and loved ones the spiritual armor they will need as they leave you each day and venture away from the safe fortress of your home. Teach your loved ones how to draw upon the powers of heaven through fasting and prayer. Teach them that keeping the Sabbath day holy will insulate them from the world. Teach them to be obedient. Teach them to seek God\u2019s approval, not man\u2019s. Teach them that the only route back to our heavenly home is by loving and following the Savior and by making and keeping sacred covenants and commandments.
