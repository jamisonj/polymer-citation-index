The tide of crime is matched by the deluge of dishonesty on the part of politicians who promise what they know they cannot deliver and who try to deceive the people into believing that projects can always be paid for out of somebody else\u2019s pocket. Wherever one looks a narrow concern for self-advantage seems to prevail over any thought of the well-being of the society. Principles seem to be overwhelmed by expediency. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/we-believe-in-being-honest.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cThe act of \u2018ratting\u2019 \u2026 in too many places is now regarded as more offensive than the act of cheating. In many places the honor system, which was once a manifestation of honorable people working together, has been discarded. The old concept of honor based on integrity has \u2026 yielded to a new code of honor based on dishonesty\u2014also known as honor among thieves, which is, in fact, the source of the term <span class=\"emphasis\">ratting.<\/span>\u201d (President John A.

He has revealed to us in these latter days the principles by which we may prosper, by which we may perfect ourselves, by which we may rise from the fallen condition in which we are to the condition we must reach in preparation for the return of the Redeemer to the world. I bear my witness to these truths and to the truths of the gospel as it has been revealed and as we teach it, and I do it humbly in the name of Jesus Christ our Redeemer.
