He told them of wars and rumors of wars, of terrible \ncalamities that would befall nations, kingdoms, and peoples before the Son of Man would\ncome in clouds of great power and glory (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35742\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35742)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35742)\">Matt. 24:30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnother statement Mark attributes to the Savior on this same occasion took\non new meaning for me.  He said: \"And the gospel must first be published among all\nnations\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33203\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33203)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33203)\">Mark 13:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Assignment to increase communication of gospel to the world<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nApproximately two years ago, the First Presidency of the Church directed the Presiding\nBishopric to establish a translation, publishing, and distribution organization, with the charge\nthat Spanish-speaking members of the Church in Mexico, Central America, and South\nAmerica were to receive the literature and materials of the Church in their own language and\nthat they were to receive them at the same time they were received by the members of the\nChurch in the center stakes.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Translating increases<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nShortly thereafter, Portuguese and the languages of western Europe&mdash;Finnish, Swedish,\nNorwegian, Danish, Dutch, German, French, and Italian&mdash;were included. And now in recent\ndays, Samoan, Tahitian, and Tongan have been added.\n<\/p><p>\nBishop Vandenberg asked that I represent the Presiding Bishopric in carrying out this\nassignment. During these past two years, many faith-promoting and inspiring events have\ntaken place. May I share some with you.\n<\/p><p>\nIn approaching such an assignment, one first begins by developing an organization. This\ninvolves people. It is my conviction that the Lord has touched the hearts and the lives of men\nand women in many lands who&mdash;have been preparing for such a work, and then he has led\nus to them.\n<\/p><p>\nAs Brother J. Thomas Fyans, the director of the overall organization, and I have traveled over\nthe world, carrying out our assignment, we have marveled at what has taken place.\n<\/p><p>\nWe traveled to one distant land, not having an idea as to the course of action that would be\nnecessary. Within two or three hours after meeting with the mission presidents involved, our\ncourse of action was as clear as though we had spent weeks of analysis. We were able to\nappoint a manager and initiate the work within a matter of hours after our arrival.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the mission presidents said, \"We are ready for a stake in our mission, but it cannot be\naccomplished in our mission until your program is in operation.\" The program is in operation.\nThe first stake in South America was organized under the direction of Elders Spencer W.\nKimball and Franklin D. Richards, May 1, 1966, in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n<\/p><p>\nWithin the last few weeks, a similar experience has taken place in another area of the world.\nSeveral weeks ago, as we traveled to New Zealand to meet with the mission presidents of the\nSouth Pacific, we had no idea as to the means for the solution to the literature problems of\nthe Church in the non-English languages of the South Sea islands. After meeting only a few\nhours with Elder Thomas S. Monson, Elder Paul H. Dunn, and the mission presidents, again\nthe course was clear. Now we have a manager in this area and a building has been leased.\nThe preparatory work to translate the Church literature into Samoan, Tongan and Tahitian is\nmoving forward at full speed. Of course, all of this is under the direction of the First\nPresidency and those members of the Twelve responsible for these areas of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nAs we have met with the translation personnel in the various countries, I have marveled at\ntheir unusual talents translating is a very exacting work, requiring considerable training and\nmuch concentration. Just because someone is familiar with a particular language does not\nmean he can translate into that language. Each translation applicant is given a thorough test,\nwhich he must pass before he can begin to work with us. Many who would like to do this\nwork cannot because they are not sufficiently well trained. There are many words and terms\nin English that cannot be translated directly into other languages. The translator must have the\nability to transfer the author's meaning from one language and culture to another with an\nabsolute minimum of distortion. This is most difficult. It is even difficult sometimes\nto be sure one understands the author's intent in English. Take, for instance,\nthe translator who received a Relief Society lesson for translation. In the lesson was a recipe\ncalling for \"Chicken of the Sea.\" Every Relief Society sister knows that \"Chicken of the Sea\"\nis a brand of tuna fish&mdash;that is, every sister in the United States. The translator checked her\nencyclopedia and other reference books. She checked the library and university. Finally, in\ndesperation, she translated \"Chicken of the Sea\" as \"hen of the ocean.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHere is what one of our wonderful Danish translators has to say about translating work in the\nChurch: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I should like to tell you just a fraction of what you ought to know when asked to translate\nMIA books. You have to be a dancing master, beauty specialist, choir director, and you have\nto know something about sports and athletics. You should be a chemist or a druggist. You\nshould be an educated musician. You ought to know something about baking, cooking,\ngardening, arranging of flowers; something about singing, acting, first aid, and puppet shows.\n<\/p><p>\n\"You have to know as much as possible of Church organizations and of how the different\nauxiliaries are organized and how they work. In some cases, you will have to call the ministry\nof education, the airport, the fire service a domestic science college, the Olympic games\ncommittee, and the inspector of business. You have to know about weights and measures and\nof the different expressions used by lawyers, and so forth.\n<\/p><p>\n\"You must know the scriptures, and it is good if you know Shakespeare's works almost by\nheart, because you will often find quotations or citations without any references. You must be\nable to know where to find a quotation, if it belongs to the Bible, the Book of Mormon,\nDoctrine and Covenants or Pearl of Great Price, and also if it is written by Matthew, John, or\nPaul.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnother of our translators received the songbook <i>The Children Sing<\/i> to be translated into\nGerman. Music is most difficult to translate, and <i>The Children Sing<\/i> is no exception. In this\ncase, however, the translator could not write fast enough to keep up with the flow of words as\nthey came to her.\n<\/p><p>\nThere was no doubt in her mind as to the source of her inspiration.\n<\/p><p>\nOne example of devotion was manifest in the life of a lovely sister who recently passed away.\nShe had just completed translating the book <i>Jesus the Christ<\/i> into Swedish, her native tongue.\nHer manuscript was typewritten. This does not seem unusual until we are made aware of the\nfact that she was almost totally paralyzed and was so crippled that she pressed one key at a\ntime with a rubber-pointed stick. You can imagine the thousands of times this stick held in\nher gnarled hand had to be depressed on a typewriter key to record the teachings of this book\nin her native language.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many other stories, some humorous, some serious, all examples of devotion and\nfaith.\n<\/p><p>\nIt might be well to indicate in general the materials to be translated. Of course, the\nstandard works have been translated into many languages. They will be done in others as the\nFirst Presidency directs. Other approved books will be translated. Material to appear in the\nJuly monthly unified magazine is being worked on today.\n<\/p><p>\nThe programs that have been\ncorrelated for the English-speaking Saints, such as home teaching, family home evening,\nMelchizedek Priesthood, Aaronic Priesthood, and the Relief Society lessons, will be available\nin the Latin American and European languages on September 1, 1967, which is the date they\nwill also be introduced in the English language.\n<\/p><p>\nOnce these materials have been translated, they must be printed and distributed to the officers,\nteachers, and members of the Church. Six printing and distribution centers have been\nestablished to accomplish this phase of the work.\n<\/p><p>\nIn Copenhagen, Denmark, we are now prepared to serve Finland, Sweden, Norway, and\nDenmark. In Liege, Belgium, service is being provided for all French- and Dutch-speaking\nmembers of the Church. Frankfurt, Germany, is providing service to the\nGerman and Italian members; Sao Paulo, Brazil, to the Portuguese: Mexico City, to the\nSpanish. Auckland, New Zealand, will soon be in operation, providing services to Samoa,\nTonga, and Tahiti.\n<\/p><p>\nIn each case, we are convinced that special men, with particular training  abilities, have been\ncalled. Time after time, I have heard such comments as this: \"Now, we finally know why we\nmoved here,\" or, \"I know my training over the years has been to prepare to accomplish this\nwork.\" These and many other comments have come have come from our associates. Most of\nthem have been members of the Church for less than five years.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Aided by correlation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAll of this work is being accomplished under the direction of the First Presidency and the\nCouncil of the Twelve. It is possible today because of the great correlation program that is in\nthe Church. I think it would be almost impossible without correlation.\n<\/p><p>\nOur associates, both at home and abroad, are motivated by the desire to be anxiously engaged\nin this great cause as we contemplate the 90th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, 11th\nverse, we realize the Lord is speaking of our day. He says: \"For it shall come to pass in that\nday, that every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own\nlanguage\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15011\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15011)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15011)\">D&amp;C 90:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe feel this work is a literal fulfillment of prophecy. We are deeply grateful for the great\nprivilege of being a small part in making it possible for many thousands to hear the fullness\nof the gospel in their own language. If I interpret the scriptures correctly, all of this is to the\nend \"that his kingdom may go forth upon the earth, that the inhabitants thereof may receive it\nand be prepared for the days to come, in the which the Son of Man shall come down in\nheaven, clothed in the brightness of his glory, to meet the kingdom of God which is set up on\nthe earth\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14965\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14965)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14965)\">D&amp;C 65:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my witness, my brothers and sisters, that God lives, that Jesus Christ will come again,\nand that there is much to be done before he comes. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
