The Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, and ancient apostles and prophets have visited and communicated with \u201cchosen vessels of the Lord\u201d\u2014modern prophets\u2014and have restored and reaffirmed these truths and all the rest of the pure and simple principles, ordinances, and teachings of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/the-worth-of-souls.p65\" class=\"\">The priesthood of God\u2014the authority to administer the ordinances of the gospel\u2014has been committed again unto men. Christ has reestablished his church in the earth. It is here with full power to do for us, you and me, all that needs to be done in mortality, which we ourselves cannot do to bring to pass our eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/the-worth-of-souls.p66\" class=\"\">We love you; we recognize you as our brothers and sisters in the family of God, our Heavenly Father.

To this service we are dedicated; to it we have been divinely called, for we bear the same responsibility as did Christ\u2019s ancient disciples, for unto us also the Lord Jesus has said, \u201cGo ye into all the world, preach the gospel to every creature\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17051\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17051)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17051)\">D&amp;C 68:8<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/the-worth-of-souls.p68\" class=\"\">I give you my personal witness to the truth of these things.

That it may be so I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ.
