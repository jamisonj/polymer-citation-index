Let me tell you about two such experiences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/was-it-worth-it.p16\" class=\"\">Dave Orchard grew up in Salt Lake City, where most of his friends were members of the Church. They were a great influence on him. In addition, Church leaders in his neighborhood constantly invited him to activities. His friends did the same. Even though he didn\u2019t join the Church at that time, his growing-up years were blessed by the influence of good LDS friends and Church-sponsored activities. After he entered college, he moved away from his home, and most of his friends left on missions. He missed their influence in his life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/was-it-worth-it.p17\" class=\"\">One of Dave\u2019s high school friends was still home. This friend was meeting every week with his bishop in an effort to put his life in order and be able to serve as a missionary. He and Dave became roommates, and as would be both natural and normal, they talked about why he wasn\u2019t then serving as a missionary and why he was meeting frequently with the bishop. The friend expressed his gratitude and respect for his bishop and the opportunity to repent and serve. He then asked Dave whether he would like to come to the next interview. What an invitation! But in the context of their friendship and circumstances, it was both natural and normal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/was-it-worth-it.p18\" class=\"\">Dave agreed and was soon meeting with the bishop himself. This led to Dave\u2019s decision to meet with the missionaries. He received a testimony that the gospel is true, and a date for his baptism was set. Dave was baptized by his bishop, and a year later, Dave Orchard and Katherine Evans were married in the temple. They have five beautiful children. Katherine is my little sister. I will be forever grateful to this good friend who, together with a good bishop, brought Dave into the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/was-it-worth-it.p19\" class=\"\">As Dave spoke of his conversion and bore his testimony regarding these events, he asked the question, \u201cSo, was it worth it? Was all the effort of friends and youth leaders and my bishop, over all the years, worth the effort to have just one boy be baptized?\u201d Pointing to Katherine and his five children, he said, \u201cWell, at least for my wife and our five children, the answer is yes.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/was-it-worth-it.p20\" class=\"\">Whenever the gospel is shared, it is never \u201cjust one boy.\u201d Whenever conversion happens or someone returns to the Lord, it is a family that is saved. As Dave and Katherine\u2019s children have grown, they have all embraced the gospel. One daughter and two sons have served as missionaries, and one just received his call to serve in the Alpine German-Speaking Mission. The two oldest have married in the temple, and the youngest is now in high school, faithful in every way. Was it worth it? Oh yes, it was worth it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/was-it-worth-it.p21\" class=\"\">Sister Eileen Waite attended the same stake conference where Dave Orchard told of his conversion experience. Throughout the conference, all she could think of was her own family and particularly her sister, Michelle, who had long been away from the Church. Michelle was divorced and trying to raise four children. Eileen felt impressed to send her a copy of Elder M.\u00a0Russell Ballard\u2019s book <span class=\"emphasis\">Our Search for Happiness,<\/span> together with her testimony, which she did. The very next week a friend told Eileen that she too had felt that she should contact Michelle. This friend also wrote Michelle a note, sharing her testimony and expressing her love. Isn\u2019t it interesting how often the Spirit works on several people to help one in need?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/was-it-worth-it.p22\" class=\"\">Time passed. Michelle called Eileen and thanked her for the book. She said that she was beginning to recognize the spiritual void in her life. Eileen told her that she knew that the peace she was seeking could be found in the gospel. She told her that she loved her and wanted her to be happy. Michelle began to make changes in her life. Soon she met a wonderful man who was active in the Church. They married and a year later were sealed in the Ogden Utah Temple. Recently her 24-year-old son was baptized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/was-it-worth-it.p23\" class=\"\">To the others in Michelle\u2019s family and all others who do not yet know that this Church is true, I invite you to prayerfully consider whether the Church is true. Allow your family and friends and missionaries to help. When you know that it is true, and it is, come join with us by taking the same step in your life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/was-it-worth-it.p24\" class=\"\">The end of this story has not yet been written, but blessings have been given to this wonderful woman and her family as those who love her acted on a prompting and in a natural and normal way shared their testimony and invited her to come back.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/was-it-worth-it.p25\" class=\"\">I have thought a lot about these two experiences. One young man who was working to put his own life in order helped another young man who was seeking the truth. One woman shared her testimony and her faith with her sister who had been away from the Church for 20 years. If we will pray and ask Heavenly Father who we can help and promise to act on the promptings He gives us letting us know how we can help, He will answer our prayers and we will become instruments in His hands to do His work.
