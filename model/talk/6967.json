Alexander, finding the defeated Darius on the point of death, laid his hands upon his head to heal him, commanding him to arise and resume his kingly power, concluding, \u201cI swear unto thee, Darius, by all the gods that I do these things truly and without faking.\u201d Darius replied with a gentle rebuke: \u201cAlexander my boy \u2026 do you think you can touch heaven with those hands of yours?\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote11-24905_000_023\">11<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Adapted from Hugh Nibley, <span class=\"emphasis\">Abraham in Egypt<\/span> (1981), 192.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/the-call-for-courage.p49\" class=\"\">Brethren, as we learn our duty and magnify the callings which have come to us, the Lord will guide our efforts and touch the hearts of those whom we serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/the-call-for-courage.p50\" class=\"\">Many years ago, I would visit an older widow named Mattie, whom I had known for many years and whose bishop I had been. My heart grieved at her utter loneliness. A precious son of hers lived many miles away, and for years he had not visited his mother. Mattie spent long hours in a lonely vigil at her front window. Behind a frayed and frequently opened curtain, the disappointed mother would say to herself, \u201cDick will come; Dick will come.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/the-call-for-courage.p51\" class=\"\">But Dick didn\u2019t come. The years passed by one after another. Then, like a ray of sunshine, Church activity came into the life of Dick, one of my former Aaronic Priesthood boys, who now lived in Houston, Texas, far away from his mother. He journeyed to Salt Lake to visit with me. He telephoned upon his arrival and, with excitement, reported the change in his life. He asked if I had time to see him if he were to come directly to my office. My response was one of gladness. However, I said, \u201cDick, first visit your mother, and then come to see me.\u201d He gladly complied with my request.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/the-call-for-courage.p52\" class=\"\">Before he could get to my office, there came a phone call from Mattie, his mother.

I saw him coming through the window.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/the-call-for-courage.p53\" class=\"\">Not many years later at Mattie\u2019s funeral, Dick and I spoke tenderly of that experience.

Duty keeps cadence with that march. Duty does not dim nor diminish. Catastrophic conflicts come and go, but the war waged for the souls of men continues without abatement.
