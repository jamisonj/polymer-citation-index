Those familiar words are powerful, poetic verses.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p6\" class=\"\">Then, interestingly, the bishop said, \u201cSister Breinholt, the Savior cannot personally be in our ward every Sunday.

We are calling you to serve as a Primary teacher!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p7\" class=\"\">When I heard that extraordinary experience, I wanted to study those verses again to understand better what the Savior did with the Nephite children and what he would do for our children if he were here. The Savior\u2019s example and the bishop\u2019s admonition apply to all of us\u2014whether we love and serve children in our families, as neighbors or friends, or at church.

And notice what verse 11 <span class=\"emphasis\">doesn\u2019t <\/span>say. It doesn\u2019t say never mind the little ones because they aren\u2019t accountable yet. It doesn\u2019t say the children were to be taken elsewhere so they wouldn\u2019t disrupt the proceedings. And it doesn\u2019t imply that the children won\u2019t understand. But it <span class=\"emphasis\">does<\/span> teach that children need to learn the significant things of the kingdom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p10\" class=\"\">God\u2019s children share with all of us the divine right to spiritual enlightenment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cSo they brought their little children and set them down upon the ground round about him, and Jesus stood in the midst.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6255\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6255)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6255)\">3 Ne. 17:12<\/a><\/span>.) Do any of us ever consider serving children to be beneath us? Clearly the Savior felt that the Nephite children were worthy not only to be in his presence, but they were also worthy of his time and his attention. The children needed <span class=\"emphasis\">him,<\/span> and he stood right in their midst.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p12\" class=\"\">Verse 12 also indicates that Jesus waited \u201ctill they had <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> been brought to him.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6256\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6256)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6256)\">3 Ne. 17:12<\/a><\/span>] He wasn\u2019t looking for a representative sample, and he wasn\u2019t content with just some of the children.

And the children were there! They heard that prayer; they saw that event, and they were affected by it.

Jesus was ministering to a group of about 2,500 men, women, and children. Consider how much time it must have taken for him to bless and pray over each child, \u201cone by one.\u201d He must have held many of them in his arms or on his lap.

Jesus specifically directed the attention of the multitude to the children. To me, the word <span class=\"emphasis\">behold<\/span> is significant. It implies more than just \u201clook and see.\u201d When the Lord instructed the Nephites to <span class=\"emphasis\">behold <\/span>their little ones, I believe he told them to give attention to their children, to contemplate them, to look beyond the present and see their eternal possibilities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd as they looked to behold \u2026 they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and encircled those little ones about, and they were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6262\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6262)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6262)\">3 Ne. 17:24<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p17\" class=\"\">I can\u2019t help but wonder what would have happened if the multitude had just looked and not<span class=\"emphasis\"> beheld <\/span>with spiritual eyes. Would they have seen the angels descend? Could they have watched their children encircled about with fire? Would they have been able to observe as the angels ministered to their children? It\u2019s significant to me that later the Savior gave the most sacred teachings only to the children, then loosed their tongues so they could teach the multitude.
