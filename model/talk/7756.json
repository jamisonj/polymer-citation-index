Scarcely an hour of the day goes by but what we are called upon to make choices of one sort or another. Some are trivial, some more far-reaching.

He had no confidence in the principle of agency or in us and argued for imposed salvation. He insisted that with his plan none would be lost, but he seemed not to recognize\u2014or perhaps not to care\u2014that in addition, none would be any wiser, any stronger, any more compassionate, or any more grateful if his plan were followed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-three-rs-of-choice.p9\" class=\"\">We who chose the Savior\u2019s plan knew that we would be embarking on a precarious, difficult journey, for we walk the ways of the world and sin and stumble, cutting us off from our Father. But the Firstborn in the Spirit offered Himself as a sacrifice to atone for the sins of all. Through unspeakable suffering He became the great Redeemer, the Savior of all mankind, thus making possible our successful return to our Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-three-rs-of-choice.p10\" class=\"\">The prophet Lehi tells us: \u201cWherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man.

He seeks not just the so-called refuse of humanity; he seeks all of us, including the very elect of God. King David listened, wavered, and then followed and fell.

Along that straight and true path there are other goals: missionary service, temple marriage, Church activity, scripture study, prayer, temple work. There are countless worthy goals to reach as we travel through life. Needed is our commitment to reach them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-three-rs-of-choice.p24\" class=\"\">Finally, brethren, I speak of the <span class=\"emphasis\">results<\/span> of choice.

However, whether you decide to push a key on your computer which will take you to pornography can make <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> the difference in your life. You will have just taken a step off the straight, safe path. If a friend pressures you to drink alcohol or to try drugs and you succumb to the pressure, you are taking a detour from which you may not return. Brethren, whether we are 12-year-old deacons or mature high priests, we are susceptible. May we keep our eyes, our hearts, and our determination focused on that goal which is eternal and worth any price we will have to pay, regardless of the sacrifice we must make to reach it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-three-rs-of-choice.p26\" class=\"\">No temptation, no pressure, no enticing can overcome us unless we allow such. If we make the wrong choice, we have no one to blame but ourselves. President Brigham Young once expressed this truth by relating it to himself. Said he: \u201cIf Brother Brigham shall take a wrong track, and be shut out of the Kingdom of heaven, no person will be to blame but Brother Brigham. I am the only being in heaven, earth, or hell, that can be blamed.\u201d He continued: \u201cThis will equally apply to every Latter-day Saint.

I speak of Brother Clayton\u00a0M. Christensen, a member of the Church who is a professor of business administration in the business school at Harvard University.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-three-rs-of-choice.p34\" class=\"\">When he was 16 years old, Brother Christensen decided, among other things, that he would not play sports on Sunday. Years later, when he attended Oxford University in England, he played center on the basketball team. That year they had an undefeated season and went through to the British equivalent of what in the United States would be the NCAA basketball tournament.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-three-rs-of-choice.p35\" class=\"\">They won their games fairly easily in the tournament, making it to the final four. It was then that Brother Christensen looked at the schedule and, to his absolute horror, saw that the final basketball game was scheduled to be played on a Sunday. He and the team had worked so hard to get where they were, and he was the starting center. He went to his coach with his dilemma. His coach was unsympathetic and told Brother Christensen he expected him to play in the game.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-three-rs-of-choice.p36\" class=\"\">Prior to the final game, however, there was a semifinal game. Unfortunately, the backup center dislocated his shoulder, which increased the pressure on Brother Christensen to play in the final game. He went to his hotel room. He knelt down. He asked his Heavenly Father if it would be all right, just this once, if he played that game on Sunday. He said that before he had finished praying, he received the answer: \u201cClayton, what are you even asking me for? You know the answer.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-three-rs-of-choice.p37\" class=\"\">He went to his coach, telling him how sorry he was that he wouldn\u2019t be playing in the final game. Then he went to the Sunday meetings in the local ward while his team played without him. He prayed mightily for their success. They did win.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/the-three-rs-of-choice.p38\" class=\"\">That fateful, difficult decision was made more than 30 years ago. Brother Christensen has said that as time has passed, he considers it one of the most important decisions he ever made. It would have been very easy to have said, \u201cYou know, in general, keeping the Sabbath day holy is the right commandment, but in my particular extenuating circumstance, it\u2019s okay, just this once, if I don\u2019t do it.\u201d However, he says his entire life has turned out to be an unending stream of extenuating circumstances, and had he crossed the line just that once, then the next time something came up that was so demanding and critical, it would have been so much easier to cross the line again. The lesson he learned is that it is easier to keep the commandments 100 percent of the time than it is 98 percent of the time.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote13-09211_000_026\">13<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Clayton\u00a0M.

We shall succeed in the solemn charge: \u201cBe ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote14-09211_000_026\">14<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120845\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120845)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120845)\">Isaiah 52:11<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> That this may be so is my solemn and humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Master, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-09211_000_026\"><a name=\"-09211_000_026\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-09211_000_026\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: David\u00a0O.
