I would like to thank them as one of their\ncountrymen, once removed, for the beautiful music they have rendered. I could not say thank\nyou to them in Danish nor in Swedish nor Norwegian, but I can express some appreciation in\nfour foreign words I have learned, two in Spanish, \"mucho gusto,\" and two in German, \"genz\ngut.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI was recently touring one of the large paper mills in the Pacific Northwest, and as I stood by\none of the tremendous paper making machines, watching those whirring wheels and the\nfast-moving belts and feeling the tremendous heat that comes from those baking ovens, I\nmarveled at the remarkable safety record of that great mill. Then I was told, and my eyes\nafterwards confirmed, that a wonderful safety program was carried on in that big mill, so that\nvery, very few personal injuries were sustained there.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I stood by that giant paper making machine, my eyes went up to the wall and there in a\nsign about six feet square, I read four words. The first word was in great block letters and\noccupied about half the sign, and underneath appeared the other three words. The sign said,\n\"Think, then act safely.\" I learned that was the theme of the safety program in that\ntremendous mill and that it represented the whole idea behind the fact that few men get hurt\nthere.\n<\/p><p>\nBut as I stood there watching that machine go, and then glanced up at that sign, \"Think, then\nact safely,\" my mind immediately went to a problem which Brother Spencer W. Kimball and\nI face together, and which was coming to a focal point at that very time, because school was\nletting out. It was the latter part of May, and I knew that it would not be long until hundreds\nand hundreds of young people would be coming to Salt Lake City and Ogden and other\ncenters, looking for jobs, looking for places to stay, and some of them getting into trouble. I\nthought first of all of the parents of those young people and wondered exactly what they were\nthinking about. Very, very few of the parents of those hundreds of young people ever thought\nof coming to Salt Lake City or to Ogden or to Los Angeles or to San Francisco with their\nboys and girls, some of whom were fifteen and sixteen and seventeen years of age, to help\nthem find a good family with whom to live, or stay with them until they found a decent job\nin decent circumstances with decent people.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I began to wonder what some of those parents would think if they knew what the police\ndepartment knows about some young people who come from smaller communities to these\nlarger centers, unaccompanied, unchaperoned, unprotected, entirely on their own.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, my mind did go back to that big sign in the paper mill, and I wished that every parent of\nevery boy and girl who expects to leave home and go to a larger city would only \"Think, then\nact safely.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI thought, too, of these young people. Many of them had no idea what they were getting into\nwhen they left home and came to the larger centers. They had absolutely no idea. Some of\nthem came with only three or four dollars in their pockets and thought of course the minute\nthey landed here they would get a job and the three or four dollars&mdash;in one case a girl had\nsix&mdash;the three or four to six dollars would last until they got their first payday, and then they\nwould be on easy street, and everything would go fine.\n<\/p><p>\nThey would come to the larger city and look for a cheap place in which to live. Some of\nthem were really cheap, on Twenty-fifth Street or on West Second South, or down on Canal\nStreet in another city. They could not afford much, so they would get into a rooming house of\nsome kind and think they were on their own and then discover that they had walked into\ntragedy. Some of the young people, unfortunately, could not wait to leave their homes. They\nwanted to break away and get on their own, and they did not realize what it meant to cut\nloose from home, to get away from the protection of Mother and Dad, and get into a strange\ncity. Although there are many good people in all these cities, there are others who are cold\nand grasping and predatory, seeking innocent boys and girls to get them in their trap.\n<\/p><p>\nMy mind went to the bishops, to the stake presidents. I still wondered why we have not\nresponded more readily to the appeal of the First Presidency of the Church that you bishops,\nyou counselors in bishoprics, you members of stake presidencies, and you parents cooperate\nwith the program instituted by the Presidency and headed by Elder Kimball in an effort to\nprotect your young people as they come to these larger cities. Will you not cooperate, will\nyou not help? If you parents cannot control your children and they must go away, if instead\nof their being obedient to you, you are more obedient to them, at least will you not go to\nyour bishop and talk about it, and then let the machinery of the Church help you? Will you\n\"think, and then act safely\"?\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the big fears I have in connection with these young people coming to the larger\ncenters is that so many of them actually want to break away from home, cut the apron strings,\nso to speak. They feel that they are self-sufficient; they know it all; Mother and Dad are\nold-fashioned. This is a modern world, and they want to be modern; they want to live in a\nmodern way.\n<\/p><p>\nI ask the youth of the Church, do you really want that? Do you really want to cut loose from\nthe protection of home? Think of all that home means. Think of all the word mother means.\nThink of the strong protecting power of Dad. Think of all that home stands for. And then\nthink of the opposite. Think of the powers that are destructive of the home. And think of the\npowers that work contrary to the advice of Mother and Dad and ask if that is what you want\n<\/p><p>\nO youth of the Church, \"think, then act safely.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the big difficulties about the young people who come on their own and have cut loose,\nescaped the apron strings, is that they then feel so free and in such a new life, they want also\nto cut loose from the Church. They do not go to the meetings any more. They go to other\nplaces and meet other people, and instead of Church friends, clean, fine Latter-day Saint\nfriends, they pick up friends of the other side, of the lower element.\n<\/p><p>\nA question was asked in a full page newspaper advertisement to which I have referred many\ntimes, and this question was: \"How would you like to live in a town where there were no\nchurches?\"\n<\/p><p>\nYoung people, will you think of the kind of folk there are in the non-churchgoing crowd?\nThink about them for a moment. Think of those who oppose the Church and refuse to go to\nchurch. Think of the kind of people they are and the kind of wives and husbands they have\nand the kind of homes they develop, and think also of the kind of children, if any, they have.\nIs that the kind of life you want? Is that to be desired above the beautiful cleanliness of fine\nLatter-day Saint homes? Is that to be desired over the marvelous influence of the faithful\nyouth of the Church?\n<\/p><p>\nWhat kind of crowd are you going with? What kind of person will you marry? You will\nmarry from the crowd you go with; and if you choose the non-churchgoing crowd, remember\nthat is what you will get, and all it includes. Think, consider it carefully, and then act safely.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd if you go with that other crowd, it is not long until you get the invitation to take a\nsmoke. Before you take that cigarette, will you weigh the consequences, and ask yourself if it\nis the smoking crowd you want to go with, if it is the smoking crowd you want to marry\nfrom? And will you remember that the cigarette is the first step to breaking down the\nstandards and the barriers to sin. Do you want to let down the bulwark, do you want to break\ndown the dam and let the flood in? Weigh all these things before you take the smoke. \"Think,\nthen act safely.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd inevitably there will come the invitation to take a drink. Before you take the drink, think\nwhat alcohol does to you. I am not just talking about the possibility of alcoholism. I am\ntalking about the manner in which alcohol will rob you of your self-control, destroy your\nability to think wisely, and put you in the hands of unscrupulous men or women who will rob\nyou of that which is more precious than life itself. Do you want that? Then before you take\nthe drink, really think it over, and then act safely.\n<\/p><p>\nIf you travel with that kind of crowd, there is going to be the invitation to neck and pet. Do\nyou want that? What will be your response? Will you realize, oh, youth of the Church, that\nanyone who attempts to pet with you attempts to make an indecent approach? Petting is\nindecent and sinful, and the person who attempts to pet with you is himself both indecent and\nsinful and is likewise lustful. The invitation to pet, remember, so often ends up in the\ninvitation to something worse. The young people themselves call it, \"going all the way.\" Is\nthat what you want?\n<\/p><p>\nWill you not remember that in the category of crime, God says sex sin is next to murder\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8975\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8975)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8975)\">Alma 39:5<\/a><\/span>)? Do\nyou want it? It will bring broken hearts and remorse and misery all the days of your life and\nonly the most sincere repentance can ever wipe it out. But oh, how you will suffer as many\nhave suffered the remorse that accompanies such a terrible sin as that.\n<\/p><p>\nOh, youth of the Church, oh, parents, oh, bishops, who have charge of the youth, and you\nMIA workers and Sunday School and Primary, you Relief Society mothers, will you all use\nthe intelligence God has given you, will you think, act safely, and live your religion?\n<\/p><p>\nThat is my humble prayer for us all, in Jesus' name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
