There were in attendance twelve sisters. We sang the hymns of Zion from song books\u2014words without music\u2014printed nearly fifty years ago. The spiritual living lesson was reverently given from the pages of a handmade manual.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p5\" class=\"\">I told those sisters that they belonged to the largest, and by all measure, the greatest women\u2019s organization on earth.

And when the meeting closed, the lovely sister who had conducted with gentility and reverence wept openly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p11\" class=\"\">I then told them about you, and they were strengthened. I spoke of the assignment to speak to you here tonight and asked if they had a message for you. Several of them made notes; each expression, every one, was in the spirit of sending something to you\u2014not of asking something from you. One of them said, \u201cA small circle of sisters send their own hearts and thoughts to all the sisters and begs the Lord to help us go forward.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p12\" class=\"\">Those words, \u201ccircle of sisters,\u201d inspired me. I could see them standing in <span class=\"emphasis\">your<\/span> circle. I caught then the vision of a great circle of sisters\u2014the same vision the Apostles and prophets before us have had.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p13\" class=\"\">That evening I stood, for a moment, in that circle and felt the impulses of faith and courage and love coming and going on either side. I remembered the sealing rooms of the temples. In some of them mirrors are placed on opposing walls. If you stand near the altar and look to either side, you can see a corridor of diminishing images. It gives one the feeling of looking into the infinite, into the eternities. You can see as far as you can see and you have the feeling that if you could move to the limit of your vision you could yet see on forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p14\" class=\"\">I feel that here tonight, as I stand for a brief moment in your circle. Each sister, no matter where in that circle she stands, can look to either side and feel the spirit of inspiration coming back as she extends the gentle hand of charity to those on either side.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p15\" class=\"\">I am humbled beyond expression to know that the message I here enter into your circle can surge around the earth and come back, and go out once again. Can you imagine how deeply I desire to have that impulse a worthy one?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p16\" class=\"\">The Relief Society, the Prophet told us, is organized after the pattern of the priesthood. When a man holds the priesthood, he belongs to something bigger than himself. It is something outside himself to which he can make a complete commitment. It requires full dedication and loyalty. There is connected with it an oath and a covenant.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p17\" class=\"\">Membership in the priesthood magnifies the man and the boy. Wherever he is, whatever he does, no matter with whom he associates, he is expected to honor his priesthood. It is the commitment of his manhood to the highest standards of integrity. Attendance at quorum meetings on Sunday is but a part, even a small part, of his membership responsibilities. Through full activity in the priesthood every worthy desire may be achieved, every need of the man can be fulfilled.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p18\" class=\"\">The brethren do not talk much of the needs of men; certainly they are not preoccupied with them. You may be surprised to learn that they are seldom discussed. Those needs are important, very important. So are the restraints that protect each holder of the priesthood and guide him to a complete fulfillment in life. But the brethren are not preoccupied with their needs. They are preoccupied with the <span class=\"emphasis\">priesthood!<\/span> It is a worthy preoccupation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p19\" class=\"\">When the priesthood is organized and functions as it should, the worthy aspirations of all who have part in it are satisfied. Through the priesthood men can be trained in the proper relationship with all sisters\u2014their wives and daughters and mothers. Priesthood is <span class=\"emphasis\">the<\/span> cause for men and boys in the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p20\" class=\"\">Relief Society is a great strength to the priesthood. Through it you will share in the privileges and blessings that belong to the priesthood. Indeed, the holders of the priesthood cannot have a fulness without you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p21\" class=\"\">If you sisters follow after that pattern, you will not be preoccupied with the needs of women. You will serve your organization, your cause\u2014the Relief Society\u2014this great circle of sisters. Your every need shall be fulfilled, now, and in the eternities; every neglect will be erased; every abuse will be corrected. All of this can come to you, and come quickly, when you devote yourself to Relief Society.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p22\" class=\"\">Service in the Relief Society magnifies and sanctifies each individual sister. Your membership in Relief Society should be ever with you. When you devote yourself to the Relief Society and organize it and operate it and participate in it, you sustain the cause that will bless every woman who comes within its influence. You are organized, I remind you again, after the pattern of and under the authority of the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p23\" class=\"\">During the study that concluded with the consolidated schedule, my main anxiety, and I expressed it in every discussion, was for the Relief Society. We had the concern that Relief Society might be regarded thereafter as little more than a Sunday class. That fear was not without some foundation, and I want to remind you\u2014particularly you who are officers and teachers\u2014that the Relief Society has very broad responsibilities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p24\" class=\"\">Attendance at the Sunday meeting is but a small part of your duty. Some of you have not understood this and have set aside much of what Relief Society has meant over the years\u2014the sisterhood, the charitable and practical parts of it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p25\" class=\"\">You must gather them in again. You who lead this work must now find ways to bring back and to increase the sisterhood, the fraternal spirit of the Society. You must find ways to strengthen the charitable and the practical dimensions as well. Nothing must distract you from this. You will receive some suggestions about how this can be done without adding a second meeting every week.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p26\" class=\"\">Many of you are not able to attend the Relief Society Sunday meeting because you are called to serve in the Primary or the Young Women. This, again, is according to the pattern. Many brethren serve the Aaronic Priesthood. Just as their service strengthens the Higher Priesthood, so your service will bless Relief Society. Do not feel denied; never complain. To unselfishly render this service is to show devotion to Relief Society.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p27\" class=\"\">Then this great circle of sisters will be a protection for each of you and for your families. The Relief Society might be likened to a refuge\u2014the place of safety and protection\u2014the sanctuary of ancient times. You will be safe within it. It encircles each sister like a protecting wall.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p28\" class=\"\">Because it is your course of study this coming year, we turn to the Old Testament for a lesson. When the Israelites returned from their long captivity in Babylon, they found their city in ruins. The protecting walls of Jerusalem lay in rubble. Their enemies moved among them with great influence and the Israelites were subject to them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p29\" class=\"\">Then came Nehemiah the prophet, known now as \u201cthe wall builder.\u201d He rallied the Israelites to their own defense. Under his direction they began to rebuild the wall.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p30\" class=\"\">At first their enemies ridiculed them. Tobiah, the Ammonite, mocked them, saying, \u201cEven that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41070\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41070)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41070)\">Neh. 4:3<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p31\" class=\"\">But Nehemiah consoled his people and set to work. The enemy was everywhere. \u201cNevertheless,\u201d he recorded, \u201cwe made [a] prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41071\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41071)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41071)\">Neh. 4:9<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p32\" class=\"\">Sisters, think carefully upon that. They \u201cmade a prayer,\u201d and \u201cset a watch,\u201d and proceeded with their work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p33\" class=\"\">The day came when their enemies saw that the wall went up. It encircled the city. Finally no breach was left, save it be the place for the gates. What their enemies had ridiculed was nearly done. The wall now stood. No longer could their enemies threaten nor destroy. When their enemies saw that they grew strong, they worried, and they turned to other tactics.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p34\" class=\"\">And here is the lesson. It is a type, it is symbolic, it is a warning! In it is a message for every sister in Relief Society; for the general presidency and their board; for the stake and ward officers and teachers; indeed, for every member. Consider it very, very carefully.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-circle-of-sisters.p35\" class=\"\">Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem sent for Nehemiah. \u201cCome,\u201d they enticed, \u201clet us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono.\u201d They endeavored to draw him away from his work on the wall.
