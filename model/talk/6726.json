The lesson that week was on justification and sanctification. It was evident, as the lesson began, that the teacher was well prepared to instruct his brethren. Then a question prompted a response that changed the whole course of the lesson. In response to the question, one brother commented: \u201cI have listened with great interest to the lesson material. The thought has crossed my mind that the information presented will soon be lost if we do not find application to put the material presented into practice in our daily lives.\u201d Then he went on to propose a course of action.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/called-of-god.p16\" class=\"\">The night before, a citizen of the community had passed away. His wife was a member of the Church, but he had not been. This high priest had visited the widow and offered his sympathy. Leaving the home after the visit, his eyes wandered over the beautiful farm of the deceased brother. He had put so much of his life and labor into building it up. The alfalfa was ready to cut; the grain would soon be ready to harvest. How would this poor sister cope with the sudden problems now falling on her? She would need time to get herself organized for her new responsibilities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/called-of-god.p17\" class=\"\">Then he proposed to the group that they apply the principles they had just been taught\u2014by working with the widow to keep her farm operating until the widow and her family could find a more permanent solution.

Our family had moved from California to New York, where I had accepted a position with a new company. We began the process of finding a new home by looking in communities closest to the city. Gradually, however, we moved farther away from the city to find a home in a neighborhood that suited our needs. We found a beautiful home some distance from New York City. It was a one-story house nestled in the lovely deep woods of Connecticut. The final test before purchasing the home was for me to ride the commuter train into New York and check the time and see how long the commute would take. I made the trip and returned quite discouraged. The trip was one and one-half hours each way. I walked into our motel room where our family was waiting for me and presented to my children a choice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/called-of-god.p37\" class=\"\">\u201cYou can have either this house or a father,\u201d I said.
