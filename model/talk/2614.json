By direct revelation we have been informed that tomorrow will also be the 1,975th anniversary of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem of Judea.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/birth.p4\" class=\"\">But this is also the Easter season. Last Sunday we commemorated the anniversary of the initiation upon this earth of the universal resurrection. This is also the springtime of the year, when all of nature is being reawakened into a newness of life. And I thought that inasmuch as this is a season of so many new beginnings I would like to talk to you about birth. However, I don\u2019t mean the birth of Jesus, nor the resurrection, nor the reawakening of nature. I mean your own birth and the great possibilities involved in our own human reawakenings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/birth.p5\" class=\"\">Henry David Thoreau, an early American philosopher, once said that we should thank God every day of our lives for the privilege of having been born. And then he went on to speculate on the rather unique supposition of what it might have been like if we had not been born. Just suppose that you had never been born or that your parents or your brothers and sisters or your children or your friends had never been born. Just think of all the excitement and blessings that we would have missed as a consequence. But what Mr. Thoreau may not have known was that one-third of all the children of God never were born and never can be born because they failed to pass the requirements of their first estate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/birth.p6\" class=\"\">We remember the unembodied spirits who appeared to Jesus in his day who preferred the bodies of swine rather than to have no bodies at all.

And I am very sure that if we could go today while we walk by faith and stand where we once stood when we walked by sight that we would be willing to crawl on our hands and knees through life for this tremendous opportunity which we presently enjoy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/birth.p7\" class=\"\">William Wordsworth said that our birth is a sleep and forgetting. There is one distinguishing characteristic about the moment of birth in that it is an unconscious moment; that is, no one ever realizes while he is being born that that event is actually taking place. Sometimes we don\u2019t discover that we have been born until quite a long time afterward. Sometimes we never do find out that we have been born.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/birth.p8\" class=\"\">I heard one man say about his friend, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know he is alive.\u201d Frequently that strikes very close to the truth. That is, sometimes we don\u2019t know why we were born. We don\u2019t know where we came from. We don\u2019t know the purpose of life. We haven\u2019t any very definite program for just what we are going to do about our eternal destiny.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/birth.p9\" class=\"\">The greatest accomplishment of my life is that I was successful in getting myself born, and I am just awfully pleased about that.

They were parents who were interested in teaching me the principles of the gospel and helping me to make as much as possible out of my life. I am everlastingly grateful for my parents. They were pretty poor financially and we had a little trouble getting along, but sometimes that is all to the good. Somebody has said that one of the most serious disadvantages that anyone can have in life is to have too many advantages. One of the most outstanding advantages of my life is my parents. And I always think of my mother when I read those stimulating lines saying:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">You may have riches and wealth untold<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">With baskets of jewels and caskets of gold<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">But richer than I you will never be<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">For I had a mother who read to me.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/birth.p15\" class=\"\">Strickland W.

I was instructed by my parents and by my Church teachers in the philosophy of Jesus that one birth is not enough, and that everyone should be born twice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/birth.p17\" class=\"\">And so on August 27, 1911, I was born of the water and of the spirit in exactly the meaning of that great command as given by the Savior of the world. And I came forth in a newness of life with a new set of possibilities. I had hands laid upon my head and a prayer was offered in my behalf for the reception of the Holy Ghost, and I was confirmed by my father as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and from that moment until this I have had the direction of those great principles of righteousness and the promptings of the Holy Spirit to help me make of my life something approaching what the Lord would like to have me make of it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/birth.p18\" class=\"\">But since that time, I have discovered some other important things about being born. One of them is that no one is limited to merely two births, that we can be born again as many times as we please. And each time we can be born better.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/birth.p19\" class=\"\">In 1932, Walter Pitkin wrote a great book entitled <span class=\"emphasis\">Life Begins at Forty.<\/span> But that is ridiculous.
