I\u2019ll guarantee that all will return; none shall be lost.\u201d He was a good psychologist. He appealed to our desires for security. He made his plan so attractive that a third of the hosts of heaven followed him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/decisions.p10\" class=\"\">They gave up their right and claim to free agency.

There must be an opposing force. There is no growth, no movement, no accomplishment or progress without overcoming an opposing force.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/decisions.p13\" class=\"\">Lucifer and his agents provided that opposing force, which made free agency possible for us in this life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/decisions.p14\" class=\"\">The right to make a decision, then, is now ours, and it is the greatest asset we have on earth. The Lord will not, and cannot, and does not intend to take it away from us. He intends for us to use it. He is constantly advising us and teaching us how to use it for our own good and further growth, even to attain eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/decisions.p15\" class=\"\">I would think God would be very unjust to put Lucifer here with all his power, to test us and try us, if he did not give us power to resist or overcome him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/decisions.p16\" class=\"\">Remember, Lucifer did not come here of his own choosing.

Lucifer, then, can do on this earth only what he is permitted to do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/decisions.p18\" class=\"\">Remember the story of Job? In each trial Job was subjected to, Lucifer asked for permission to test Job. He was given permission to go just so far, one step at a time. Job lost his wealth on one test, his family on another, his health on another. Then the Lord gave Satan full control over Job, except he could not destroy his soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/decisions.p19\" class=\"\">One step at a time, Job became strengthened to withstand all.
