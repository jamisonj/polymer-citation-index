He cannot be at peace when he is untrue to his better self, when he transgresses the law of righteousness in any way, either in dealing with himself or indulging his passions, his appetites, yielding in any way to the temptations of the flesh, or whether he is untrue to a trust imposed upon him, transgressing the law of righteousness in dealing with his fellowmen. Peace does not come to the transgressor of law; peace comes by obedience to law, and it is that message which Jesus would have us portray among men. Peace is to the individual that he may be at peace with his God, perfect harmony existing between himself and law, the righteous laws to which he is subject and from which he can never escape. \u2026 Life is a struggle, really a struggle to gain mastery over these tendencies, the animal part of our being.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/strength-of-the-spirit.p31\" class=\"\">No one can have complete peace in his heart who shuts out of his heart and soul, by harboring immoral thoughts or indulging in improper conduct, those thoughts and actions that pertain to a godlike life. By neglecting to give heed to the will of God as revealed through the prophets of the Lord, by succumbing to the wiles of the adversary and indulging in unrighteous behavior, by yielding to evil passions and destructive appetites, by failure to give heed to the revealed will of the Lord, one cannot enjoy the peace of which the Lord spoke when he said: \u201cPeace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. \u2026\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28806\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28806)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28806)\">John 14:27<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/strength-of-the-spirit.p32\" class=\"\">The commandments which have been given by the Lord to his prophets in this dispensation pertain to eternal truth and set forth the mind and will of the Lord to his people in this day and age, which is the dispensation of the fulness of times, preparing a people to be worthy to meet the Lord when he shall come again in power and in glory. There are those who would desire to destroy this great nation and its liberties for which our forefathers struggled and fought and bled, and there are also those whose great ambition is to cast reflection and doubt upon the revelations and teachings of the Church.

He that is warned must warn his neighbor. While it is only natural and proper that we should desire and seek those things of a temporal nature that tend to make mortal life wholesome and pleasurable, it is of the utmost importance that we keep in mind the great purpose of life, which is to prepare us for eternal life\u2014the salvation and exaltation of the souls of God\u2019s children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/strength-of-the-spirit.p34\" class=\"\">Like ancient Israel, modern Israel is a peculiar people in that we believe and know that we have constant revelation from God, revealing to us those things that are of eternal value, those things which pertain to the salvation of our own souls.

Grant and others it was my privilege to witness work that was being carried forward in the construction of the Hoover Dam near Las Vegas, Nevada. Some of those present at that time, including President Grant, went to the top of the dam on a makeshift elevator as far as it was completed at that time, and they then climbed a ladder still higher where the concrete was being poured. This concrete, which consisted of boulders and rocks, was held together by cement. Without the cement, which held the rocks together, the dam could not have been made effective in holding back that great stream of water. There would be just a pile or mass of boulders which would have been washed away when the flood waters came against it. But with the cement, a dam curving between the deep sides of the canyon was built in accordance with mathematical principles, one that now holds back the water and brings it into control and provides water for the thirsty land and makes possible, through the great turbines that were built, the creation of electricity to bring light and blessing to peoples far and wide.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/strength-of-the-spirit.p36\" class=\"\">Our lives consist of this act and that act, this experience and that, one accomplishment after another. But if we are to accomplish the great purpose of our earth life, we must have power to resist the forces of the evil one; we must overcome the weaknesses of the flesh; we must distinguish between the physical desires and the spiritual strength, which latter provides the cement that makes possible the accomplishment of life\u2019s purposes and goal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/strength-of-the-spirit.p37\" class=\"\">And what is that life-giving purpose, that goal toward which we should all be striving? It is the gospel of Jesus Christ as restored to man in this great dispensation. It is, of course, necessary that we have the physical necessities of life. It is natural that we should want the things that make life, physical life, desirable and pleasurable. But if in obtaining such things we neglect those things that are of eternal worth, the spiritual part of life, then we have mistaken the chaff for the wheat of life. We have failed to recognize the eternal purpose of our existence. We have neglected the cement which is necessary if we are to build a life that will make our calling and election sure\u2014yes, eternal life in the presence of our Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/strength-of-the-spirit.p38\" class=\"\">Again may I say it is of the utmost importance that people everywhere reflect upon their spiritual assets and spiritual strength, thus preparing themselves for eternal life in the kingdom of our Heavenly Father.
