It is hard to express how much that means to me. I was especially grateful for the sustaining vote of the two extraordinary women in my life: my wife, Ruth, and our dear, dear, dear daughter, Ashley.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/through-gods-eyes.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">My call gives ample evidence to the truthfulness of the Lord\u2019s statement early in this dispensation: \u201cThat the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-12461_000_036\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131256\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131256)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131256)\">Doctrine and Covenants 1:23<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> I am one of those weak and simple. Decades ago, when I was called to be the bishop of a ward in the eastern United States, my brother, slightly older and much wiser than I, called me on the phone. He said, \u201cYou need to know that the Lord hasn\u2019t called you because of anything you have done. In your case, it is probably in spite of what you have done. The Lord has called you for what He needs to do through you, and that will happen only if you do it His way.\u201d I recognize that this wisdom from an older brother applies even more today.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/through-gods-eyes.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">Something wonderful happens in a missionary\u2019s service when he or she realizes that the calling is not about him or her; rather, it is about the Lord, His work, and Heavenly Father\u2019s children. I feel the same is true for an Apostle. This calling is not about me. It\u2019s about the Lord, His work, and Heavenly Father\u2019s children. No matter what the assignment or calling is in the Church, to serve capably, one must serve knowing that everyone we serve \u201cis a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, \u2026 has a divine nature and destiny.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-12461_000_036\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> or <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Nov. 2010, 129; it was first read by President Gordon\u00a0B.

My wife jokingly says that it was a bad prognostic sign to become one of my patients. All teasing aside, I saw many people die, and I developed a kind of emotional distance when things went poorly. That way, feelings of sadness and disappointment were tempered.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/through-gods-eyes.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">In 1986 a young man named Chad developed heart failure and received a heart transplant. He did very well for a decade and a half. Chad did all he could to stay healthy and live as normal a life as possible. He served a mission, worked, and was a devoted son to his parents. The last few years of his life, though, were challenging, and he was in and out of the hospital frequently.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/through-gods-eyes.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">One evening, he was brought to the hospital\u2019s emergency department in full cardiac arrest. My associates and I worked for a long time to restore his circulation. Finally, it became clear that Chad could not be revived. We stopped our futile efforts, and I declared him dead. Although sad and disappointed, I maintained a professional attitude. I thought to myself, \u201cChad has had good care. He has had many more years of life than he otherwise would have had.\u201d That emotional distance soon shattered as his parents came into the emergency room bay and saw their deceased son lying on a stretcher. In that moment, I saw Chad through his mother\u2019s and father\u2019s eyes. I saw the great hopes and expectations they had had for him, the desire they had had that he would live just a little bit longer and a little bit better. With this realization, I began to weep. In an ironic reversal of roles and in an act of kindness I will never forget, Chad\u2019s parents comforted me.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/through-gods-eyes.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">I now realize that in the Church, to effectively serve others we must see them through a parent\u2019s eyes, through Heavenly Father\u2019s eyes. Only then can we begin to comprehend the true worth of a soul. Only then can we sense the love that Heavenly Father has for all of His children. Only then can we sense the Savior\u2019s caring concern for them. We cannot completely fulfill our covenant obligation to mourn with those who mourn and comfort those who stand in need of comfort unless we see them through God\u2019s eyes.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-12461_000_036\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"131257\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131257)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131257)\">Mosiah 18:8\u201310<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> This expanded perspective will open our hearts to the disappointments, fears, and heartaches of others.
