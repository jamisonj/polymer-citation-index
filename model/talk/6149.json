It was the parting of the curtain to open this, the dispensation of the fulness of times. Nothing on which we base our doctrine, nothing we teach, nothing we live by is of greater importance than this initial declaration. I submit that if Joseph Smith talked with God the Father and His Beloved Son, then all else of which he spoke is true.

My response is that we love them as sons and daughters of God. They may have certain inclinations which are powerful and which may be difficult to control. Most people have inclinations of one kind or another at various times. If they do not act upon these inclinations, then they can go forward as do all other members of the Church. If they violate the law of chastity and the moral standards of the Church, then they are subject to the discipline of the Church, just as others are.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/what-are-people-asking-about-us.p21\" class=\"\">We want to help these people, to strengthen them, to assist them with their problems and to help them with their difficulties. But we cannot stand idle if they indulge in immoral activity, if they try to uphold and defend and live in a so-called same-sex marriage situation. To permit such would be to make light of the very serious and sacred foundation of God-sanctioned marriage and its very purpose, the rearing of families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/what-are-people-asking-about-us.p22\" class=\"\">\n\t<span class=\"emphasis\">Question 3: What is your position on abortion?<\/span>\n      <\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/what-are-people-asking-about-us.p23\" class=\"\">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention there were more than 1,200,000 abortions performed in 1995 in the United States alone.
