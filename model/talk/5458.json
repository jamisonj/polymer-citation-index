Are we willing to give thanks for blessings and knowledge received?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/gratitude.p12\" class=\"\">I believe one of the greatest sins that we, the children of our Heavenly Father, are guilty of is the sin of ingratitude. President Joseph F. Smith said in one of his talks that when we see a man who has been blessed with additional gifts or greater intellect, and he rises to the acclaim and success of his fellowmen, ofttimes he will attribute his success to his own energies, labors, and mental capabilities. Rather than acknowledge the hand of God in anything connected with his success, he ignores Him altogether and takes the honor to himself (see <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 25:53).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/gratitude.p13\" class=\"\">In all the great modern discoveries in science, in the arts, and in all the material advancements of the age, the world says, \u201cWe\u2019ve done it!\u201d The individual says, \u201cI\u2019ve done it!\u201d and gives no honor or credit to God. President Smith continues by saying, \u201cOne of the greatest sins of which the inhabitants of the earth are guilty to-day, is the sin of ingratitude\u201d (in <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 25:52).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/gratitude.p14\" class=\"\">I presume most of us have not thought of that as a serious sin. There is a great tendency for us in our prayers\u2014in our pleadings with the Lord\u2014to ask for additional blessings. Sometimes, I feel, we need to devote more of our prayers to expressions of gratitude and thanksgiving for blessings already received. Of course, we need the daily blessings of the Lord. But if we sin in the matter of prayer, I think it is in our lack of expressing thanksgiving for daily blessings. God is not pleased with the inhabitants of the earth but is angry with them because they will not acknowledge his hand in all things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/gratitude.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20095\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20095)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20095)\">D&amp;C 59:21<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/gratitude.p16\" class=\"\">A classic example of ingratitude as spoken of by the Savior is in Luke, chapter 17: \u201cAnd it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/gratitude.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/gratitude.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/gratitude.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests.
