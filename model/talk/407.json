Not only is this\nbuilding now filled to capacity, but there are also thousands of people listening in on the\noutside. Many are witnessing what you are this morning by television.\n<\/p><p>\nA WONDERFUL AGE\n<\/p><p>\nWe live in a wonderful age. I wonder if we appreciate what it is to live today with all the\nadvantages gained in the nearly six thousand years since our first parents came into the world.\nHere we are in the tops of these everlasting hills\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23560\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23560)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23560)\">Gen. 49:26<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12749\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12749)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12749)\">D&amp;C 133:31<\/a><\/span>),\nin this building today that was erected when\nthe people were very poor and in distress. The building itself yet unsurpassed in all the world\nas a house of worship where one's voice may be heard by so many people.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the last few weeks we have had many visitors here, some of them of national\nprominence, some of international prominence. They have come into this structure that our\nforbears prepared; they have looked around; and they have said, \"This is unlike anything I\nhave seen.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSome of them have remarked, \"There is an influence here that is different.\" So there should\nbe. This house is the Lord's house. It was dedicated to him by the people after they had\nstruggled to prepare it. It was presented to him after it had been fully paid for, and since that\ntime all people who have come into this house have come here as the guests of our Heavenly\nFather.\n<\/p><p>\nI say all people. Sometimes I have had individuals interrogate me in regard to whether those\nwho are not members of the Church would be permitted to come here. I have been pleased to\nanswer them, \"All of our Father's children are welcome in his house.\"\n<\/p><p>\nToday, we are met not just as a matter of curiosity. We have not met just because it is\ncustomary. I hope we have come here with the spirit of worship, with a desire that whatever\nis said here may be inspired by our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\n\"COME AND SEE\"\n<\/p><p>\nOur sisters have sung beautifully for us this morning. The great organ has been their\naccompaniment. We who have come to worship must now think seriously of the purpose of\nlife because this world is in a pitiable condition. Notwithstanding the\nfact that our Heavenly Father down through the ages has been counseling and advising his\nchildren through men that he raised up for that purpose, prophets of God, yet there has been\ncontroversy. Even in the days of the Savior, among his own associates, there was controversy.\nPeople have been suspicious of one another. They have not believed what they have heard,\nand they have not been willing to do as Philip, one of the disciples of the Savior,\nrecommended to Nathanael who was visiting with him. Philip said, \"The Lord has come.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he described him and Nathanael asked, \"Where did he come from?\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Philip answered, \"Why, he came from Nazareth.\" And then the good man said, \"Can any\ngood thing come out of Nazareth?\" Philip said, \"Come and see\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27355\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27355)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27355)\">John 1:43-46<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNathanael had been taught to believe that no good could come from Nazareth, and yet he was\nthe man whom the Savior later referred to as an Israelite without guile\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27357\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27357)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27357)\">John 1:47<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;a good man, but\ndeceived because of the stories that he had heard.\n<\/p><p>\nBut when he once learned, when he had accepted the invitation of the disciples to \"Come and\nsee,\" he came to see.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have had great joy under the influence of His Spirit. We would like everybody to enjoy\nthat blessing, and so when they have asked, \"What kind of people are these here?\" our answer\nhas been, \"Come and see.\" This morning we are here as children of our Heavenly\nFather&mdash;members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and others, all welcome\nto his house, all guests of the Lord. And we ought to have a good time.\n<\/p><p>\nJust think of our privileges and our blessings. Think down through the ages of the multitudes\nof wars and destructions that have wiped people out in many parts of the world and entirely\nobliterated nations, and yet for some reason or another there are many good people who, like\nNathanael, cannot believe the truth.\n<\/p><p>\nSomeone has said of the people of the world that they would rather believe a lie and be\ndamned than accept the truth. That is rather a severe statement, but I think perhaps it will\nbear acceptance as fact. There is nothing in the world more deleterious or harmful to the\nhuman family than hatred, prejudice, suspicion, and the attitude that some people have toward\ntheir fellows, of unkindness.\n<\/p><p>\nTWO INFLUENCES\n<\/p><p>\nThe spirit of the adversary is the spirit of destruction. There are two influences in the world.\nThe one is the influence of our Heavenly Father and the other is the influence of Satan. We\ncan take our choice which territory we want to live in, that of our Heavenly Father or that of\nSatan.\n<\/p><p>\nI have many times repeated what my grandfather said. He, too, talked from this stand, and it\nwas he who gave me his name. In advising his family he said, \"There\nis a line of demarcation, well defined. On one side of the line is the Lord's territory. On the\nother side of the line is the devil's territory.\" And he said, \"If you will stay on the Lord's side\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22606\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22606)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22606)\">Ex. 32:26<\/a><\/span>)\nof the line, you are perfectly safe, because the adversary of all righteousness cannot cross\nthat line.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhat does that mean? It means to me that those who are living righteous lives, keeping all of\nthe commandments of our Heavenly Father are perfectly safe, but not those who trifle with\nhis advice and counsel.\n<\/p><p>\nTEN COMMANDMENTS\n<\/p><p>\nThe Ten Commandments are just as necessary for us to observe today as they were by Israel\nwhen they were given to Moses in the wilderness\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50056\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50056)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50056)\">Ex. 20:3-17<\/a><\/span>).\nIf the people of this world were keeping\nthe Ten Commandments, honoring them, there would be no war. There would be no sorrows\nand distresses such as afflict mankind, but because there are so many who cannot put\nthemselves in a frame of mind to live righteous lives, they are in confusion and they are in\ndistress.\n<\/p><p>\nThis building, as I say, was dedicated to the Lord. Some people have criticized in their minds\nthat it has been open to other faiths, to other churches, to people with other beliefs who had a\nmessage, as they felt, for us. I am sure that if you had lived in the days of Jesus of Nazareth\nand followed him, as many people did, through the fields and through the country, you would\nhave found many of them, a majority of them, were not believers in his mission until they\nwere touched by his spirit, and then they became disciples.\n<\/p><p>\nThey were welcome, and so I say all our Father's children are welcome here, and we hope\nthat when they come they will do so with a receptive mind, and with a prayer in their hearts\nsuch as was offered this morning by our brother from Canada. [President Octave W.\nUrsenbach of Lethbridge Stake.]\n<\/p><p>\nA SICK WORLD\n<\/p><p>\nWe are living in a sick world, in a time when, as we read in the scriptures, the wisdom of the\nwise shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25093\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25093)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25093)\">Isa. 29:14<\/a><\/span>). That is the\ncondition of the world today. The leaders of the nations&mdash;many of them&mdash;desire to do the\nthing that will benefit their nation or the group they belong to, but selfishness in many cases\ncharacterizes their conduct, and the result is that instead of peace we have sorrow and distress.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is only one way. We can legislate until doomsday but that will not make men righteous.\nIt will be necessary for people who are in the dark to repent of their sins, correct their lives,\nand live in such a righteous way that they can enjoy the spirit of our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nThink of the beautiful prayer that was offered by Jesus of Nazareth, who gave his life for us,\nwho represented a great race of people who were despised by other races, and who came into\nthe world to bring a blessing. When he was asked, \"Teach us to pray,\"\nwhat a beautiful simple prayer he gave\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34257\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34257)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34257)\">Matt. 6:9-13<\/a><\/span>).\nAnybody could repeat it, and if they repeat it with\ntheir hearts in tune with the Spirit of the Lord, they can feel the influence that comes from it.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was not very long after that until he was cruelly murdered, as have been the prophets of\nGod almost from the beginning. The fact remains that all this time our Heavenly Father has\nhad upon the earth men and women who are righteous, who are seeking to do his will and\nkeep his commandments.\n<\/p><p>\nGOSPEL MESSAGE\n<\/p><p>\nMany of you here today are either from foreign lands or the descendants of those who came\nfrom foreign lands. Many of you or your forebears have heard the gospel as it has been taught\nby the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during a little over a hundred years.\nSometimes you have heard it on the street where there was a humble missionary, teaching\nwhat the Lord had called him to teach.\n<\/p><p>\nThere was something that touched the hearts of those who heard. I have had experiences in\nthe mission field. I have seen groups of people stand and listen to a humble missionary\nexplain the purpose of life and talk to the people and encourage them to repent of their sins,\nand I have sometimes heard people say, \"I have never before felt an influence like I feel\nwhile I hear that man talk.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI take this occasion to express my appreciation for the opportunity of being here, for the\nprivilege of associating with such men and women as are present this morning. I am grateful\nfor the privilege that came to me of being reared in this part of the world under a government\nthat God himself said was prepared by men that he raised up for that very purpose. I refer to\nthe Constitution of the United States\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12716\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12716)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12716)\">D&amp;C 101:80<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful for my blessings&mdash;all of them&mdash;and thank you, my brethren and sisters, who\nfrom day to day and from year to year as I have gone through life, have encouraged me to go\non and represent, as I might, the desires of our Heavenly Father in my own life, that I might\nreceive many blessings.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a law irrevocably decreed in heaven from before the foundation of this world upon\nwhich every blessing is predicated, and unless we observe that law, we cannot enjoy the\nblessing (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12736\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12736)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12736)\">D&amp;C 130:20-21<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Lord has told us that. If people disagree with us, if our Father's other children\ndo not believe the gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed in this latter day to the Prophet Joseph\nSmith, that ought not to incur our displeasure. It ought to enlist our sympathy, because if we\nknow, as Philip knew when he testified of the man who came from Nazareth, we could invite\nour friends to come and see (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27356\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27356)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27356)\">John 1:46<\/a><\/span>).\nIf we are just as sure as that, we will let our light so shine that\nothers, seeing our good works, will be constrained to glorify our Father in heaven\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34246\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34246)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34246)\">Matt. 5:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nACCEPTANCE OF TRUTH\n<\/p><p>\nI have traveled much in the world, approximately a million miles, advocating the gospel of\nJesus Christ as revealed in this latter day. I have found good people everywhere, wonderful\npeople, kind and friendly, but until they received an understanding of the truth and conformed\ntheir lives to the teachings of our Heavenly Father, they were not taking advantage of all their\nopportunities, and when that time came and they accepted the truth, they added to what they\npossessed before.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we go into the world and talk to our Father's other children, we do not ask them to\ngive up any truth that they have. We do not ask them to surrender what they have believed, if\nit is true.\n<\/p><p>\nAt the present time we have approximately five thousand missionaries traveling among the\nnations of the earth who are saying to our Father's other children, \"Come and see. Keep all\nthe good that you have. Let us sit down with you and add to what you already possess for\nyour own happiness and for your own good, and without money and without price\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25103\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25103)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25103)\">Isa. 55:1<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nThat is the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and I assure you I am grateful for the\nknowledge that I have that it is the truth. It has given me comfort and satisfaction, and I\npraise his name who is the Author of our being, that we are permitted to be his guests in his\nhouse today.\n<\/p><p>\nBLESSINGS OF GOSPEL\n<\/p><p>\nThis morning there is peace and quiet all around us, and yet in many parts of the world there\nare distress and anguish, and threat of war&mdash;disturbances of all kinds. Many people have\ncome out of the world for the gospel's sake and come to the valleys of these mountains in\nresponse to the promise,\n<\/p><p>\nBut seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things\nshall be added unto you (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34264\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34264)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34264)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI bear witness to you that that has been realized by the faithful men and women who have\ncome into this part of the world for the gospel's sake.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that during this conference we may rejoice together, that we may feel the influence that\nmakes us happy when we possess it. And when the conference meetings have been finished,\nand we go to our various homes, I pray that we will have felt that we have been fed the bread\nof life, that we may live as our Heavenly Father has desired us to live, and devote our time as\nhe has expected us to do, and then as real Christians, as real sons and daughters of the Living\nGod, let us reach out and try to touch those who have not yet received the blessings that we\nhave received, and offer them an opportunity to enjoy what we appreciate.\n<\/p><p>\nTESTIMONY\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the work of the Lord. This is the Church of Jesus Christ, which name was given to it\nby our Heavenly Father. I do not say that boastfully. I hope no one here this morning will\nfeel that I am arrogant because of my membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints. I have no such feeling, but I have a feeling of humility, of gratitude, of thanksgiving\nfor the companionship of such men and women as are here, and men and women in the world\nwhom I have traveled with and associated with during these many years, many of whom have\nnot been able to understand the gospel of Jesus Christ. I hope for their sakes and for the sake\nof those they love that they will eventually receive that blessing, and it will have to come, if\nit ever does, from the Author of our being through the inspiration of his Spirit.\n<\/p><p>\nAgain I say, this is our Father's work. This is the Church of the Lamb of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1490\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1490)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1490)\">1 Ne. 14:10,12<\/a><\/span>).\nWe who know\nthat have a responsibility that no other people in the world have, and if we will be righteous\nin our lives, having our own homes and our own lives in order, the spirit of our Heavenly\nFather will be with us always. People will rejoice in our companionship, and when we go to\nthe other side, we will find our names enrolled in the Lamb's Book of Life\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42209\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42209)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42209)\">Rev. 21:27<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12745\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12745)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12745)\">D&amp;C 132:19<\/a><\/span>),\nand that will\nentitle us to an eternal inheritance in the celestial kingdom, and this earth will be that\nkingdom. I bear you witness of it in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
