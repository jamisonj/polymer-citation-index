Surely we will never be able to do precisely what he did, partly because his mission and purpose is different than ours. He is the Savior; we are the saved. He is the Mediator between God and man; we are those for whom he mediates. He is the Redeemer; we are the redeemed. The list of differences is long, and possibly endless. The Master\u2019s statement to Moses is a summation of his mission on earth: \u201cMy work and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39554\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39554)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39554)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>).

His promise to us of things which I do, ye can do, and greater things than I do, ye can do (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"28999\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28999)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28999)\">John 14:12<\/a><\/span>) rings loudly in the ears, stimulating the amazement of everyone who reads the holy scriptures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/following-christ-to-victory.p7\" class=\"\">As the scriptures are searched, the life of Christ seems to resolve into a great success formula. I\u2019m sure that I have not caught the significance of all that he did and taught, but may I share five basic principles which have become discernible in my study?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/following-christ-to-victory.p\" class=\"\">Believe you can do it. This is the first important principle. All things are possible to them that believe (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"33302\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33302)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33302)\">Mark 9:23<\/a><\/span>). Surely we must believe in a thing before we can desire it. And God does grant unto men according to their desire (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"9304\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9304)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9304)\">Alma 29:4<\/a><\/span>). If the desire is strong enough, performance is assured.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/following-christ-to-victory.p9\" class=\"\">This principle also includes believing in yourself. Self-esteem is vitally important to successful performance. Self-esteem is different than conceit\u2014conceit is the weirdest disease in the world. It makes everyone sick except the one who has it. It is immensely important that you feel good about yourself. I am sure that you can only feel good about yourself if you are on the way to reaching your potential. I am positive also that no one can be emotionally or physically healthy unless he is keeping the commandments and rendering unto God the things that are God\u2019s. I did not say that this obedience would also make you satisfied with your every performance\u2014I seldom am; I\u2019m sure I can improve my performance in the job. But when I\u2019m on the Lord\u2019s side, keeping the basic commandments, I feel good about me, I esteem myself as a worthy child of God, and I find I am very positive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/following-christ-to-victory.p10\" class=\"\">How to perform positively? Easy: eliminate all negative words and phrases from your vocabulary. Refuse to <span class=\"emphasis\">think<\/span> negatively, for as a man \u201cthinketh in his heart, so is he\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41548\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41548)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41548)\">Prov. 23:7<\/a><\/span>). Refuse also to <span class=\"emphasis\">speak<\/span> negatively. Now you have become an optimist rather than a pessimist. There is a big difference between an optimist and a pessimist\u2014one is positive, a believer; the other is negative, a doubter. The optimist, as you probably know, is a person who, when he wears out his shoes, just figures he\u2019s back on his feet. The pessimist says, \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u201d The optimist says, \u201cI\u2019ll see it when I believe it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/following-christ-to-victory.p11\" class=\"\">In a crisis the optimist takes action; the pessimist takes a seat.

It\u2019s almost as though they fell out of the trees or the sky.\u201d Surely they came from the Lord. Look to the Lord for your blessings.
