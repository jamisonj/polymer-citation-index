There are many reasons that are used to not pay tithing, such as medical emergencies, debts, car or home repairs, educational expenses, and insurance. These reasons and others like them are very real and are lived and dealt with every day by many, if not most, of us. These tax our limited financial resources and, if we are not wise stewards of these resources, may result in the inability to meet our tithing obligation to the Lord. A lack of compliance with this eternal law is not to be taken lightly and can not only seriously impair our spiritual growth and development, but it can also limit the physical and temporal blessings that we could otherwise enjoy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-law-of-tithing.p6\" class=\"\">As President Spencer W. Kimball once said: \u201cThe Lord herein makes clear that tithing is his law and is required of all his followers. It is our honor and privilege, our safety and promise, our great blessing to live this law of God. To fail to meet this obligation in full is to deny ourselves the promises and is to omit a weighty matter. It is a transgression, not an inconsequential oversight.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-26911_000_016\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cHe Did It with All His Heart, and Prospered,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Tambuli,<\/span> Aug. 1981, 3; \u201cPresident Kimball Speaks Out on Tithing,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">New Era,<\/span> Apr. 1981, 6.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-law-of-tithing.p7\" class=\"\"><span class=\"strong\">\n\t  <span class=\"emphasis\">So what is a tithing?<\/span>\n\t<\/span> The Lord has given us His definition: \u201cAnd this shall be the beginning of the tithing of my people.
