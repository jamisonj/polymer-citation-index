Widtsoe<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">John A. Widtsoe, <i>Conference Report<\/i> October 1949, pp. 61-65<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brethren and sisters, I trust and pray that while I speak I may be guided by the Holy\nSpirit of God, that some of my words at least may touch the hearts of some of those who\nlisten.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is good to meet in these great conferences. Thousands of us are of one mind, of one faith,\nof one purpose. It is always good to bear witness to the reality of the restoration of the gospel\nof the Lord Jesus Christ. I bear that witness for myself that this is indeed the work of God,\nthat we are not following a mistaken path, but that we are walking in the light of truth, and\nthat more than one hundred years of existence of this Church of the restoration have\ndemonstrated the truth, the integrity, and the reality of the work begun under divine direction\nby the Prophet Joseph.\n<\/p><p>\nA GREAT HERITAGE\n<\/p><p>\nWe have a great heritage, we Latter-day Saints, a heritage of doctrine, of practice, of\ntradition. I know of none like it. Just as these conferences coming every six months stand out\nas unique in the history of the world, so that which we have inherited from those who have\ngone before us is equally unique and distinctive. It is our duty to respect this heritage, to\nhonor it, and to use it. Things that are not used are dead. They are of little or no value to\nhuman kind. It is only by use that knowledge and all the possessions of mankind blossom into\nlife and become of real value.\n<\/p><p>\nIf this were a testimony meeting, there are thousands here who would bear witness to their\nknowledge of the truth of this work. A testimony is a living thing. Like all living things it\nmust be fed and nourished and cared for if it is really to be of service and value in human life\nand in carrying out the purposes of the Lord. So the heritage, that which has been given us,\nmust be used to become effective in the building of God's kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have noble traditions handed down from the past. My mind has been concerned for some\ntime with one of these traditions. Some may say that this tradition is not spiritual, therefore\nnot part of the gospel, but the Lord himself has said to some of his servants in early days that\nbefore him all things are spiritual\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12617\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12617)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12617)\">D&amp;C 29:34<\/a><\/span>),\nprovided, as I understand it, they are used in the building of God's kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nA LAND-LOVING PEOPLE\n<\/p><p>\nWe Latter-day Saints are a land-loving people. We believe in the land. We are a land-using\npeople. Most of us are farmers, directly or indirectly. Some few years ago&mdash;not many years\nago&mdash;in a census then taken, approximately sixty-five percent, at least, of our people were\nengaged in agriculture, in tilling the soil, or in making use of the things that grow upon the\nmountains, in the valleys and on the deserts. That has given us strength. I hope that we as a\npeople will not depart from that tradition. Those who own the land and use it in the end will\ndetermine the future of mankind. It will not come from those who work in the factories or\nwho live in crowded cities; from those whose feet are planted upon the land will come the\ngreat determining factors in shaping human destiny. It has been so in the past. It will be so in\nthe future. We Latter-day Saints must ever remember the sanctity and the holiness of the land\ngiven us by the Father. There is safety in the land.\n<\/p><p>\nNEW INDUSTRIAL ERA\n<\/p><p>\nMost of us live in the western part of the United States. In all these western states, in Utah,\nthe mother of them all, a new era is opening, an industrial era. Nature has laid down in these\nwestern territories large quantities of raw materials, many, most of them perhaps, of a\nnon-metallic character. These deposits will be used more and more in the future. There will\nbe a reaching out to supply the needs of mankind by the use of these raw materials, of which\ngreat deposits have been laid down by nature throughout the centuries. I am afraid a good\nmany of us will be tempted to say, \"I'll join the industrial procession. I will forget the land.\"\nThis industrial era is welcomed. There's no question about that; but as it arises, we must keep\nour minds steadily upon the old established tradition that we are a land-loving and land-using\npeople. We must remember that industry itself thrives best in the midst of an agricultural\ncommunity. Witness the social troubles of today in our own land. Analyze them, and you\nsoon discover that if we had built, as the Saints a century ago wanted us to build, we would\nhave escaped many of the troubles, chiefly by giving heed to the call of the land.\n<\/p><p>\nSTRENGTH FROM SOIL\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Joseph Smith laid out his ideal city many years ago, he planned it so that while the\nfarms would all be around the city, every homestead would have a kitchen garden in the rear\nof the house and a flower garden in front. There was tremendous wisdom in that. Men, no\nmatter what their work may be, or what their daily callings may require of them, if steadily\nand vigorously they touch the soil, be it ever so lightly or ever so small an acreage, perhaps a\nback yard, will receive from that contact spiritual strength. There is something in the\nsoil and mother earth that gives strength to all who make things grow\non the land.\n<\/p><p>\nOne great man in our history, Henry Ford, sensing this thing, undertook some years ago to\nmake arrangements by which all the employees of one of his factories might be provided with\nhomes surrounded by a little acreage, on which the owners might toil or play throughout the\nyear, and thereby take away the monotony that follows work in a factory. The plan has only\npartially been carried out as yet, but thinking men are looking in that direction for social\nsafety.\n<\/p><p>\nSome years ago, at the time of the first great war, we undertook in Salt Lake City, in\ncommon with other cities, to raise all the foodstuff we could on vacant lots and in the back\nyards of the city. We were not successful in converting all of them to small farms, but quite a\nnumber were so converted. When the season was over and we took an inventory of what we\nhad done, we found that six hundred thousand dollars worth of food had been raised in the\nback yards and vacant lots of Salt Lake City. That was a real contribution to our war needs in\nthose days.\n<\/p><p>\nRECLAMATION OF LAND\n<\/p><p>\nOur young people often say, \"There is no more land, none for us.\" To my office come quite\nregularly men, usually young men, who want to know where to go to find new land. There is\nmuch land still available in the west. We can make more if we want to, for nearly all of these\nwestern states lie under irrigation. I trust you of Utah will not feel embarrassed when I tell\nyou that the water now used in the state of Utah could be made to serve twice the area now\nbeing served. We have it in our own power, with the canals and reservoirs and conditions that\nexist today, to double the area of cultivated land in this state alone. The same holds true in\nnearly all the western states. Moreover, it is a pity that the hundreds of pioneer irrigation\nprojects in this and neighboring states, built by the pioneers in their poverty, with their small\nmeans and poor tools, remain unfinished. In the state of Utah alone we have hundreds of\npioneer irrigation projects waiting for modern pioneers to finish them with modern appliances,\nmodern means. That is the challenge of the pioneer spirit to young and old. We are fixing our\neyes too much upon the great projects. They will come, but meanwhile the little projects\nscattered all over this western country should be our first obligation as individuals, as\ncommunities. The states and federal government will and must take care of the larger ones.\n<\/p><p>\nFERTILITY OF SOIL\n<\/p><p>\nI have noticed also, to my sorrow throughout a rather long life now, that the fertility of our\nsoils seems to be diminishing. Our crop yields are not what they were some years ago, using\nthe same kind of methods as we used then. There seems to be a diminution. That is\nnot the way we should preserve our heritage. When the pioneers came\ninto the west, they found great areas of land made fertile by centuries of sunshine, wind, and\nrain, frost, and summer heat. Plant food lay upon the top of the soil, so to speak. We have\nused it, but have not paid back what we have taken from the land. In spiritual and in temporal\nmatters the law of paying for what man gets is ever uppermost.\n<\/p><p>\nYou farmers who are here, you children of farmers, you understand what I mean. The soil is\na willing servant. It yields to the farmer if the farmer treats it right. Forty-nine or fifty years\nago this last June I visited the great Rothhamsted Agricultural Experiment Station, the mother\nof the hundreds of experiment stations in the world. The head of the station kindly spent a\nday with me. He took me to a rolling hill, rather two hills with a valley between, and showed\nme about ten strips of the same crop, originally, then in full blossom. One was red, another\nblue, and still another yellow, each one bearing a different color. As we stood admiring the\nscene in the beautiful English June sunshine, he said, \"All that has come because we have\nasked the soil to do certain things in a certain way, and the soil has responded. That which we\nstarted with has disappeared under the influence of our culture.\" Nearby, was another field\nwhere wheat had been grown continuously for fifty years. The soil still tried its best to do its\nduty, but there was only a small yield. In a nearby field, properly handled, the wheat stood\nhigh, comparable with the best.\n<\/p><p>\nMan has control over the earth. The Lord has given us mastery\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23547\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23547)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23547)\">Gen. 1:26,28<\/a><\/span>). We are not servants upon the\nface of the earth. We should use that mastery to preserve our heritage. This theme may not be\ndirectly spiritual, but it is important to help us in our spiritual lives, perhaps as important as\nanything that we give our attention to as a people.\n<\/p><p>\nGUIDING PRINCIPLES\n<\/p><p>\nI rejoice at the testimonies borne here today and yesterday. I have enjoyed them very much. I\nhave been thrilled by them. I could see running through the talks the age-old principles that\nhave made us what we are today, a great people, new witnesses of Christ. I saw in the talks\nthe foundation stones of this work here mentioned one after the other by those who spoke\nyesterday. Faith has always been the most important cornerstone of our lives in the gospel of\nJesus Christ. It is basic to know that God lives, that the story of Joseph Smith is true, that the\nLord loves us, and has a great destiny for us. Every speaker touched upon that. Another\nfoundation stone is that we must seek intelligence, education, learning, knowledge. I was\nthrilled by the quotation made by President [Levi Edgar] Young yesterday, showing how the\nearly hard-handed farmers of middle age or beyond gathered after the day's toil to study\nLatin, Greek, and subjects of the mind. We must not forsake the tradition of education. Our\nfathers set up also the doctrine of industry. There is no place for idleness. The idler, the\ndeliberate idler, has no real place in the kingdom of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12663\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12663)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12663)\">D&amp;C 75:29<\/a><\/span>). All these\nprinciples have been bound together by another foundation stone, helping one another, which\nwe call in modern language \"cooperation.\" We cannot be individual members of the Church\nsufficient unto ourselves. The very fact of membership in the Church and our testimonies\ncompel us to think of our neighbor as we go through life. With these guiding principles: faith,\neducation, industry, and cooperation, with our feet firmly on the land, we are safe. Disaster\ncannot overtake us.\n<\/p><p>\nNow these principles and others were mentioned yesterday. They are always mentioned. There\nis nothing new in the age-old gospel taught by the Lord to Father Adam when the story of\nman upon this earth began.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful to be a member of this Church, to be one with you. I trust I am one with you. I\nam grateful for the blessings that flow to those who are faithful in this great work. May we\nall be faithful and worthy of the blessings we need and desire, I pray in the name of the Lord\nJesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
