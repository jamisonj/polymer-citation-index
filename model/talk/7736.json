It was a mother with two beautiful daughters. I thought that these missionaries were doing a very, very good job.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/your-happily-ever-after.p23\" class=\"\">I particularly took notice of the one daughter with gorgeous dark hair and large brown eyes. Her name was Harriet, and I think I fell in love with her from the first moment I saw her. Unfortunately, this beautiful young woman didn\u2019t seem to feel the same about me. She had many young men who wanted to make her acquaintance, and I began to wonder if she would ever see me as anything but a friend. But I didn\u2019t let that deter me. I figured out ways to be where she was. When I passed the sacrament, I made sure I was in the right position so that I would be the one to pass the sacrament to her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/your-happily-ever-after.p24\" class=\"\">When we had special activities at church, I rode my bike to Harriet\u2019s house and rang the doorbell. Harriet\u2019s mother usually answered. In fact, she opened the kitchen window of their apartment on the fourth floor and asked what I wanted. I would ask if Harriet would like a ride to church on my bicycle. Harriet\u2019s mother would say, \u201cNo, she will be coming later, but I will be happy to ride with you to church.\u201d This wasn\u2019t exactly what I had in mind, but how could I decline?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/your-happily-ever-after.p25\" class=\"\">And so we rode to church. I must admit I had a very impressive road bike. Harriet\u2019s mother sat on the top tube bar just in front of me, and I tried to be the most elegant bicycle driver over roads of rough cobblestone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/your-happily-ever-after.p26\" class=\"\">Time passed.

Yes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/your-happily-ever-after.p28\" class=\"\">Was I defeated?

Often these same people are portrayed as models of success and accomplishment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/your-happily-ever-after.p39\" class=\"\">In a world where evil is portrayed as good and good as evil, sometimes it is difficult to know the truth.

My task was to get a big jet safely from any part of the world to our desired destination. I knew with certainty that if I wanted to travel from New York to Rome, I needed to fly east. If some were to tell me that I should fly south, I knew there was no truth in their words. I would not trust them because I knew for myself. No amount of persuasion, no amount of flattery, bribery, or threats could convince me that flying south would get me to my destination because I knew.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/your-happily-ever-after.p41\" class=\"\">We all search for happiness, and we all try to find our own \u201chappily ever after.\u201d The truth is, God knows how to get there!
