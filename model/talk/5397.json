I had the impression that there must be a story behind this unique CTR pin. When I returned home, I wrote him a thank-you letter and asked him about his tie tack. I received this answer:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cYou are very perceptive. Yes, there is a story behind the tie tack I\u2019m wearing. I have a number of tie tacks I really prize. They have been gifts from my children, my wife, and friends. However, I choose to wear this beautiful silver shield inlaid with lovely blue turquoise, with the inspiring CTR emblem of our Primary.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cWhy? I suppose it started back when I was a bishop and had an interview with a good-looking young man who was to receive the Aaronic Priesthood. He told me a special story. He related to me how one day after school, he and some of his friends found a package of cigarettes. They decided to go down on the cliff alongside some large boulders and smoke them. They lit up, and the young man said that as he was looking down at the smoldering cigarette that he held between his fingers, he saw his CTR ring. He quickly put the cigarette out and made a very wise choice, never ever to do such a thing again. He chose to choose the right, as he remembered what the emblem stood for. From this story I gained a special love for the CTR emblem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cNow for the story of how I came to be a recipient of the CTR tie tack. A few weeks ago before coming to New Zealand as a mission president, I was in the Kayenta Ward in Kayenta, Arizona. As I was saying some tender farewells to many of my Navajo friends, a remarkable young Navajo bishop gave me a big hug, then removed his tie tack and pinned it on my tie. As he did so, he asked me not to forget him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cNow here in New Zealand, the last thing I do every morning as I dress for this great calling is to pin my tie tack with this beautiful silver and turquoise CTR emblem on my tie. I love it! It helps this old boilermaker make the right choices throughout the day. I know that it also helps fulfill the prophetic promise made to my wife and me from President Gordon B. Hinckley as he laid his hands on our heads and set us apart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cHe said words to this effect: \u2018You will have an instant bonding of love for every missionary in your mission.\u2019 I can\u2019t tell you how many times that a missionary, during a visit, has said something like this: \u2018President Gardner, I love your tie tack.\u2019 And then he or she will show me their CTR ring.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cI believe that Navajo bishop was inspired to give me the tie tack and that I make the right decision every day when I choose to wear it. And the beautiful blue and silver CTR pin is helping bond me to a royal army of missionaries in the New Zealand Wellington Mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cI appreciate the opportunity of relating to you my special experience associated with this great Primary children\u2019s motto, \u2018Choose the Right.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p17\" class=\"\">That special letter from this mission president in New Zealand has prompted me to speak to you great young people of the Church, who have had, or are currently having, the opportunity of being taught by loving Primary teachers who teach the gospel principles that will help you choose the right. The Book of Mormon is filled with accounts of what happens to people who make both the right and wrong choices.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p18\" class=\"\">Let me refer to two examples. During Alma\u2019s first year in the judgment seat, a large and strong man by the name of Nehor was brought before him to be judged. According to the scriptures, Nehor was going about among the people causing much dissension.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he had gone about among the people, preaching to them that which he termed to be the word of God, bearing down against the church; declaring unto the people that every priest and teacher ought to become popular; and they ought not to labor with their hands, but that they ought to be supported by the people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he also testified unto the people that all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they need not fear nor tremble, but that they might lift up their heads and rejoice; for the Lord had created all men, and had also redeemed all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9962\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9962)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9962)\">Alma 1:3\u20134<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p21\" class=\"\">Nehor\u2019s words appealed to the people, but his doctrine, while popular to many, was incorrect. As we face the many decisions in life, the easy and popular messages of the world will not usually be the right ones to choose, and it will take much courage to choose the right.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p22\" class=\"\">Now for the second example. In the land of Ammonihah, Amulek and Alma also found a people following false teachings. Amulek attempted to convert them to the true and living gospel. Zeezrom, a man who was expert in the devices of the devil, challenged the teachings of Amulek. Zeezrom asked Amulek, \u201cShall he [Christ] save his people in their sins?\u201d Amulek answered and said, \u201cI say unto you he shall not, for it is impossible for him to deny his word\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9981\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9981)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9981)\">Alma 11:34<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p23\" class=\"\">Then Zeezrom taunted Amulek, but Amulek\u2019s response was marvelous as he explained the plan of redemption:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their sins; for I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore, how can ye be saved, except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven?

Television offers both the good and the bad. Bookstores are full of publications offering the right and the wrong. Very few movies are worthy of seeing because of the profanity, violence, and immorality that fill them. Advertising is full of enticements to lead us to violate the Word of Wisdom. Some music, with its monotonous rhythms, beats illicit thoughts into our heads.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p30\" class=\"\">Consider the counsel given by President Spencer W.

Develop discipline of self so that, more and more, you do not have to decide and redecide what you will do when you are confronted with the same temptation time and time again. You need only to decide some things once. How great a blessing it is to be free of agonizing over and over again regarding a temptation. To do such is time-consuming and very risky.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/choose-the-right.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cLikewise, my dear young friends, the positive things you will want to accomplish need be decided upon only once\u2014like going on a mission and living worthily in order to get married in the temple\u2014and then all other decisions related to these goals can fall into line. Otherwise, each consideration is risky, and each equivocation may result in error. There are some things Latter-day Saints do and other things we just don\u2019t do.
