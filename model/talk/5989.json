Mustering all the composure he could, Joseph answered evenly while looking the man straight in the eye, \u2018Yes, siree; dyed in the wool; true blue, through and through.\u2019 Almost stunned by this wholly unexpected response, the gunman stopped, dropped his hands to his sides, and, after looking incredulously at Joseph for a moment, said in a subdued tone, \u2018Well, you are the \u2014 \u2014 pleasantest man I ever met!

No person could object, therefore, to the practices of whittling and whistling. Many of the boys of the city had each a large bowie knife made, and when a man came to town who was known to be a villain, and was there for evil purposes, a few of them would get together, and go to where the obnoxious person was, and having previously provided themselves with pine shingles, would commence whittling. The presence of a number of boys, each [harmlessly] whittling \u2026 was not a sight to escape the notice of a stranger. \u2026 His first [reaction] \u2026 would be to \u2026 ask what this meant. The boys would make no reply, but with grave faces, keep up their [harmless] whistling. \u2026 What could the man do? If he was armed, he could shoot; but the resolute expression of the boys\u2019 faces, and the gleaming knives \u2026 would convince him that discretion was the better part of valor. \u2026 The most we ever knew them to do was to stand for awhile and curse and threaten. \u2026 Then they would walk off\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, followed by the troop of boys vigorously whittling and whistling.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote13-97911_000_018\">13<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cHistory of the Church,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Juvenile Instructor,<\/span> 30 Sept. 1871, 158.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/standing-for-truth-and-right.p24\" class=\"\">Now, I\u2019m not suggesting that we begin issuing bowie knives to our deacons.

However, there are some simple things that we can do in our day to prevent others from drifting toward gangs and crime. We can avoid the temptation of being cliquish at school or at church. All of us can refrain from finding fault or alienating anyone by our words or actions. Nothing is more hurtful than to feel left out or made fun of. Therefore, we must never do anything that may drive others toward being accepted by a gang because they feel rejected by us. Many new families are moving in among us. Brethren, reach out the hand of friendship and make everyone feel welcome and secure in our neighborhoods and in our Church. Guard against spreading rumors or saying unkind things or allowing anything to occur that may hurt another. Make friends with your neighbors, watch out for each other, and help build a spirit of unity, peace, and love among them. These may seem like small things, but I assure you, if we do these kinds of things, they may be every bit as effective in keeping people away from evil and crime as whittling and whistling were in the days of Nauvoo. True friendship may well be the best thing that we can do to help reach those who may be drifting toward unsafe and morally damaging activities and counterfeit forms of belonging.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/standing-for-truth-and-right.p26\" class=\"\">There are countless stories that could be told of bright, talented priesthood holders who have influenced for good the lives of others.

Those who deliberately choose to violate God\u2019s commandments or ignore the standards of the Church, even when promising themselves and others that someday they will be strong enough to repent, are stepping onto a dangerously slippery slope upon which many have lost their spiritual footing. While it is true that some young people have made remarkable recoveries from sin through the process of repentance, the sad reality is that others have lost their way because of the paths they have chosen to follow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/standing-for-truth-and-right.p27\" class=\"\">These are difficult times in which we are living.
