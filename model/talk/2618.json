The law of sacrifice is a celestial law; so also is the law of consecration.

The law of consecration is that we consecrate our time, our talents, and our money and property to the cause of the Church: such are to be available to the extent they are needed to further the Lord\u2019s interests on earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/obedience-consecration-and-sacrifice.p10\" class=\"\">The law of sacrifice is that we are willing to sacrifice all that we have for the truth\u2019s sake\u2014our character and reputation; our honor and applause; our good name among men; our houses, lands, and families: all things, even our very lives if need be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/obedience-consecration-and-sacrifice.p11\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith said, \u201cA religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary [to lead] unto life and salvation.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Lectures on Faith,<\/span> p. 58.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/obedience-consecration-and-sacrifice.p12\" class=\"\">We are not always called upon to live the whole law of consecration and give all of our time, talents, and means to the building up of the Lord\u2019s earthly kingdom.
