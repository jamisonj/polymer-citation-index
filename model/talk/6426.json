We will choose friends who encourage our eternal goals, and we will treat others with kindness. We will shun the vices of immorality, gambling, tobacco, liquor, and illicit drugs. Our Sunday activities will reflect the commandment of God to remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. We will follow the example of Jesus Christ in the way we treat others. We will live to be worthy to enter the house of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-covenant-of-baptism-to-be-in-the-kingdom-and-of-the-kingdom.p37\" class=\"\">We will be examples \u201cof the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2782\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2782)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2782)\">1 Tim. 4:12<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-covenant-of-baptism-to-be-in-the-kingdom-and-of-the-kingdom.p38\" class=\"\">We will receive \u201ca mighty change \u2026 in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.\u201d We will keep our \u201ccovenant with our God to do his will, and to be obedient to his commandments in all things \u2026 all the remainder of our days\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40025\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40025)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40025)\">Mosiah 5:2, 5<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-covenant-of-baptism-to-be-in-the-kingdom-and-of-the-kingdom.p39\" class=\"\">We will demonstrate that we \u201care desirous to \u2026 be called his people, and are willing to bear one another\u2019s burdens, that they may be light;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-covenant-of-baptism-to-be-in-the-kingdom-and-of-the-kingdom.p40\" class=\"\">\u201cYea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40039\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40039)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40039)\">Mosiah 18:8\u20139<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-covenant-of-baptism-to-be-in-the-kingdom-and-of-the-kingdom.p41\" class=\"\">I urge all parents to prepare your children, and missionaries to prepare your converts, for the sacred baptismal ordinance.
