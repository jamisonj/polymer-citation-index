We make judgments concerning their actions or inactions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p15\" class=\"\">There is really no way we can know the heart, the intentions, or the circumstances of someone who might say or do something we find reason to criticize. Thus the commandment: \u201cJudge not.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p16\" class=\"\">Forty-seven years ago this general conference, I was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. At the time, I had been serving on one of the general priesthood committees of the Church, and so before my name was presented, I sat with my fellow members of that priesthood committee, as was expected of me. My wife, however, had no idea where to go and no one with whom she could sit and, in fact, was unable to find a seat anywhere in the Tabernacle. A dear friend of ours, who was a member of one of the general auxiliary boards and who was sitting in the area designated for the board members, asked Sister Monson to sit with her. This woman knew nothing of my call\u2014which would be announced shortly\u2014but she spotted Sister Monson, recognized her consternation, and graciously offered her a seat. My dear wife was relieved and grateful for this kind gesture. Sitting down, however, she heard loud whispering behind her as one of the board members expressed her annoyance to those around her that one of her fellow board members would have the audacity to invite an \u201coutsider\u201d to sit in this area reserved only for them. There was no excuse for her unkind behavior, regardless of <span class=\"emphasis\">who<\/span> might have been invited to sit there. However, I can only imagine how that woman felt when she learned that the \u201cintruder\u201d was the wife of the newest Apostle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p17\" class=\"\">Not only are we inclined to judge the actions and words of others, but many of us judge appearances: clothing, hairstyles, size. The list could go on and on.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p18\" class=\"\">A classic account of judging by appearance was printed in a national magazine many years ago. It is a true account\u2014one which you may have heard but which bears repeating.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p19\" class=\"\">A woman by the name of Mary Bartels had a home directly across the street from the entrance to a hospital clinic. Her family lived on the main floor and rented the upstairs rooms to outpatients at the clinic.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p20\" class=\"\">One evening a truly awful-looking old man came to the door asking if there was room for him to stay the night. He was stooped and shriveled, and his face was lopsided from swelling\u2014red and raw. He said he\u2019d been hunting for a room since noon but with no success. \u201cI guess it\u2019s my face,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it looks terrible, but my doctor says it could possibly improve after more treatments.\u201d He indicated he\u2019d be happy to sleep in the rocking chair on the porch. As she talked with him, Mary realized this little old man had an oversized heart crowded into that tiny body. Although her rooms were filled, she told him to wait in the chair and she\u2019d find him a place to sleep.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p21\" class=\"\">At bedtime Mary\u2019s husband set up a camp cot for the man. When she checked in the morning, the bed linens were neatly folded and he was out on the porch. He refused breakfast, but just before he left for his bus, he asked if he could return the next time he had a treatment. \u201cI won\u2019t put you out a bit,\u201d he promised. \u201cI can sleep fine in a chair.\u201d Mary assured him he was welcome to come again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p22\" class=\"\">In the several years he went for treatments and stayed in Mary\u2019s home, the old man, who was a fisherman by trade, always had gifts of seafood or vegetables from his garden. Other times he sent packages in the mail.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p23\" class=\"\">When Mary received these thoughtful gifts, she often thought of a comment her next-door neighbor made after the disfigured, stooped old man had left Mary\u2019s home that first morning. \u201cDid you keep that awful-looking man last night? I turned him away. You can lose customers by putting up such people.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p24\" class=\"\">Mary knew that maybe they <span class=\"emphasis\">had<\/span> lost customers once or twice, but she thought, \u201cOh, if only they could have known him, perhaps their illnesses would have been easier to bear.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p25\" class=\"\">After the man passed away, Mary was visiting with a friend who had a greenhouse. As she looked at her friend\u2019s flowers, she noticed a beautiful golden chrysanthemum but was puzzled that it was growing in a dented, old, rusty bucket. Her friend explained, \u201cI ran short of pots, and knowing how beautiful this one would be, I thought it wouldn\u2019t mind starting in this old pail. It\u2019s just for a little while, until I can put it out in the garden.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p26\" class=\"\">Mary smiled as she imagined just such a scene in heaven. \u201cHere\u2019s an especially beautiful one,\u201d God might have said when He came to the soul of the little old man. \u201cHe won\u2019t mind starting in this small, misshapen body.\u201d But that was long ago, and in God\u2019s garden how tall this lovely soul must stand!<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-09211_000_047\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Adapted from Mary Bartels, \u201cThe Old Fisherman,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Guideposts,<\/span> June 1965, 24\u201325.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p27\" class=\"\">Appearances can be so deceiving, such a poor measure of a person.

What the photograph <span class=\"emphasis\">didn\u2019t<\/span> show was that she was a loyal and compassionate friend, a woman of intelligence who loved the Lord and who loved and served His children. It didn\u2019t show that she volunteered in the community and was a considerate and concerned neighbor. In short, the photograph did not reflect who she really was.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p30\" class=\"\">I ask: if attitudes, deeds, and spiritual inclinations were reflected in <span class=\"emphasis\">physical features,<\/span> would the countenance of the woman who complained be as lovely as that of the woman she criticized?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/charity-never-faileth.p31\" class=\"\">My dear sisters, each of you is unique.
