Simpson, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1969, pp. 9-12<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brethren and sisters: I feel great spiritual strength in the presence of these wonderful\npatriarchs who attend our conference here this morning. We love you, we appreciate you, and\nwe feel confidence in your wonderful calling.\n<\/p><p>\nThese few thoughts that I share with you this morning are directed primarily to a large group\nof men who are perhaps beyond the range of my voice. Nevertheless, I speak to them with all\nthe sincerity and fervor of my soul, hoping that somehow perhaps a few may be reached.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A satisfying experience<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAs we visit the stake conferences each week, few experiences are more satisfying than\nthat little nudge on the arm from the stake president as he points out some good brother just\ntaking his place on the third row, and then he whispers a few choice comments about some\nrecent changes in that man's life. Sometimes it is about response to a faithful and patient\nhome teacher; frequently, about the faith and prayers of a patient wife being answered in a\nglorious way. Too often the change has come about following adversity. Some are adversities\nthat might have been avoided, but most important of all, he is back. He is on course again.\nHe is feeling the joy of service to others, perhaps to some other wonderful\nmen who need the same kind of helping hand that was extended toward him at that right\nmoment. There are far too many who trod the futile path that leads to nowhere.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Hopelessly lost<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAn air traffic control tower recently established radio contact with a plane that was\nstreaking across the radar scope, obviously not on proper course. The pilot was asked to\nreport his situation. The controller's voice seemed urgent. The pilot responded to the tower\nwith this classic observation: \"We are making wonderful time, but we are hopelessly lost.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI wonder how many men there might be in the world who are making wonderful time but\nwithout direction. Of what value is speed if the direction is without purpose? Someone has\nwritten: \"A destination is a fine thing to have. If a man does not know to what port he is\nsteering, no wind is favorable to him; and if he doesn't know where he is now, he cannot\nvery well set a course. How hard he rows, or how good his engine is: these do not count in\nhis favor unless he has a good definition of his objective. Hard work is often robbed of its\nreward by poor planning.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A child's song<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI was touched by the story of one highly successful business executive who recently\nresponded graciously and humbly to a call to serve in his elders quorum presidency. Upon\nbeing asked the direct question: \"What brought you back?\" he responded, \"Well, I have never\ntold anyone before, but this is what happened: \n<\/p><p>\n\"One morning while shaving, I overheard my six-year-old son singing from the next room. He\nwas singing a little song I had heard him sing dozens of times before, 'I Am a Child of God';\nbut somehow that morning when he came to the part that says, 'Lead me, guide me, walk\nbeside me, Help me find the way,' I had the feeling that he was singing directly to me. I just\nstood there and listened. Within seconds, my whole life seemed to pass in review; and it\nreally came home with full force that some changes had to be made, especially when he came\nto the part, 'Teach me all that I must do, To live with him some day.'\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis good man confesses today that these simple words from the lips of his own child reached\nhis heart as a personal plea. The plea was from a child of God who had been placed in his\ncustody to be delivered back some day into Heavenly Father's presence. He concluded his\nanswer to this question by stating that he decided then and there that he had something\nimportant to do, something more important than anything else in the world for a little fellow\nwho still loved his daddy in spite of many personal failings.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Effect of church hymns<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhile on the subject of church songs, let me tell you briefly about a man who was\nattending a patio party one Sunday afternoon at the home of a business associate who\nhappened to live next door to an LDS meetinghouse. As the sacrament meeting got underway,\nthe strains of the organ could be clearly heard over the back fence and seemed to be\nsomewhat incongruous to the tinkle of ice being placed in the cocktail glasses. There were\nsome uncomplimentary jokes and the usual snide remarks about religious fanatics, when all of\na sudden the strains of the opening song broke the warm summer afternoon air. It was \"Come,\nCome Ye Saints.\" The party tempo was warming up, and by now, the church music was all\nbut unnoticed&mdash;unnoticed by all but one, a man whose grandmother had walked across the\nplains pulling a handcart. His mind withdrew from the party. For the first time in many years,\nhe spent some minutes in sincere reflection concerning his birthright.\n<\/p><p>\nAbout ten minutes later, the sacrament song came drifting across the back fence.\nUnknowingly, a chorister, inspired in her calling, I am sure, had selected, \"I Know That My\nRedeemer Lives.\" And way down deep, he knew it, too, but it had been a long, long time.\nFrom that moment on, he was attending a patio party in body, but mentally\nand spiritually he was far above and beyond his environment of the moment.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was almost an hour later, just about the time that he had lapsed back into the party mood,\nwhen the closing song, \"We Thank Thee, O God, For a Prophet,\" reached his ear and\nmellowed his heart to the point of submission. Isn't it odd that a man should start his way\nback while attending a cocktail party? \"The Lord moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to\nperform.\" Incidentally, that man is probably here in this meeting today, a fine leader in the\nchurch, doing what the Lord would have him do.\n<\/p><p>\nThe road back has been described by some as long and tedious and hard, but this is only as\nyou stand at the starting end of that road. Those who have made the journey find that after\nthe first difficult step, the road is sweet and pleasant to travel; the end rewards are beyond\ndescription.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Help of home teachers<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless the home teacher who goes the extra mile, who confirms his love for the\nfamilies he teaches with genuine interest and follow-up. May I tell you about a pair of home\nteachers who felt impressed to discuss some recently published findings on lung cancer with a\nbrother who had been plagued with the cigarette habit all of his adult life. As the home\nteachers said goodnight, the brother expressed appreciation for their message and concluded\nwith, \"I will try to quit again, starting right now. I hope I can make it this time.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThese home teachers could have been like most of us and waited until next month's visit to\nsee if he succeeded, but they did not. They came by the very next morning at 6:45 a.m.,\nunannounced and unexpected. They expressed keen interest in their visit the night before and\nespecially in his expressed desire to stop smoking. They went on to tell this brother that they\nhad decided to fast and pray for him that day. \"We will be thinking about you all day today,\nand not only that, we will meet you here at your bus stop tonight to see how you made out.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis man could not help but succeed. \"These two wonderful home teachers are going to be\nfasting and praying for me. They are going to be thinking about me all day. Tonight they are\ngoing to meet me at the bus stop.\" He wanted to have a right answer for them. He did. With\nhelp, he succeeded. He came back.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The glorious road back<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJust within the past few weeks a 73-year-old man took that glorious road back after 50\nlong years of indifference. There were many tears on that occasion, tears of joy&mdash;yes, his and\nespecially those of a loving companion who had waited those 50 long years for this most\nglorious moment. The tenderness of that occasion was mute evidence to the sanctification of\nthat moment by a kind and loving Heavenly Father who stands always prepared to say,\n\"Welcome back, my son.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOh, that thousands might put aside their stubborn pride! Oh, that thousands might find the\ncourage for that first giant step back! Oh, that thousands of fine upstanding men with great\npotential might place themselves in the hands of the Lord, for as he has said: \". . . my yoke is\neasy, and my burden is light\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35921\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35921)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35921)\">Matt. 11:30<\/a><\/span>).\nWe testify to you that it is! Oh, that thousands might give way\nto their real, deep-down inner feelings, for as President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., has said: \". . .\nGod has placed in every man's heart a divine spark, which never wholly goes out; it may\ngrow dim, it may become hidden, almost smothered by the ashes of transgression; but the\nspark still lives and glows and can be fanned into flame by faith, if the heart is touched.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThose of you who sit reluctantly in the wings, find your patriarchal blessing, dust it off, and\nread it again; contemplate deeply the Lord's personal message given to you alone by these\nwonderful men who are attending this conference, the patriarchs of the Lord. There is yet\ntime. It's never too late to pick up the pieces.\n<\/p><p>\nI feel confident that one of the Lord's favorite greetings is \"Welcome back,\nmy son.\" May we find the way back where we belong is my humble prayer in the name of\nJesus Christ, the Redeemer of the world. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
