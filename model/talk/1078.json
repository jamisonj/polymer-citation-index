I have noted that many of the speakers during this\nconference have called attention to the revelations of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith.\nThis one was received fourteen months before the Church was organized, for it was recorded\nin February of 1829. What a great declaration to make to the world! Joseph Smith knew there\nhad been spiritual darkness, and it was revealed to him that a marvelous work was to come\nforth&mdash;not a marvelous thing&mdash;you will note that the word \"work\" is used. I am thankful for\nthat word&mdash;that four-letter word \"work.\" This is a Church of faith and works.\n<\/p><p>\nReference has been made to another revelation bearing on the subject of the restoration of the\ngospel, the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Proclamation of warning and commandment to the Church and to the inhabitants of the earth\nat large&mdash;The authority of the Priesthood in this dispensation attested&mdash;Second advent of the\nLord Jesus Christ foretold&mdash;Authenticity of the Book of Mormon affirmed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13824\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13824)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13824)\">D&amp;C 1 Headnote<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis revelation was given November of 1831 after the Church had been organized and set up,\nas we learned today from President David O. McKay.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, a marvelous work has taken place, and the authority of the priesthood in this\ndispensation has been attested. It was humbling to hear Brother Lee speak of the little town in\nwhich I was born which is now part of a stake of Zion. I recall being told of the missionaries\ncalling in this town at the home of my parents, sixty-four years ago. Elder Mark Austin was\none, willing to leave his home here and the comforts and conveniences to carry this glorious\nmessage&mdash;this marvelous work&mdash;to affirm the authenticity of the Book of Mormon to the\npeople of that land.\n<\/p><p>\nThere was another missionary who had an influence in the lives of my parents&mdash;a Methodist\nminister, who was their neighbor. He told a group at one time that he was\ncoming over to America to convert the Mormons, and he paid his own expenses to try to do\nthat. He became acquainted with Elder James Paxman, with whom I had the opportunity to be\nassociated on the high council of the Highland Stake. Elder Paxman was the patriarch of that\nstake. Before coming to Salt Lake City he had lived in Nephi, Utah.\n<\/p><p>\nThis Methodist minister some way got to Nephi, where he had several gospel conversations\nwith James Paxman and one or two others. He was heard to make the statement, \"It will be a\ncold day when I join the Mormon Church\"&mdash;and it was! It was a day in January in Nephi,\nUtah. They had to break the ice to baptize him. Why? Because he had received a witness. He\nhad received the light of the glorious gospel which banished darkness and untruth and half\ntruths. The authenticity of the Book of Mormon had been affirmed to him. Then he was\nunashamed after he received that affirmation and witness to be baptized and have hands laid\nupon his head to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. He was unashamed to return to England\nwhere he assisted Elder Mark Austin in the conversion&mdash;or in teaching the gospel&mdash;to my\nparents that they might convert themselves.\n<\/p><p>\nA marvelous work has come forth. In years gone by we have been on the defensive because\nSatan has done everything in his power to thwart the work of the Lord. We are still on the\ndefensive for he is still endeavoring to weaken the faith and testimony of those whose lives\nhave been touched by the gospel. If we continue working at building faith and testimony, he\nwill not have power over this work. This is evidenced by the number of stakes that have been\nestablished in spite of his buffetings&mdash;294 stakes, some 2400 wards, over 300 branches, in\nthe stakes of Zion fifty-one missions and the many branches and districts contained therein.\n<\/p><p>\nIn all parts of the Church we have many men who are anxious and willing to bear witness to\nthis marvelous work, that it is the work of the Lord, not a thing of man. It was deeply stirring\nto listen to the reports of forty-two mission presidents in the temple a week ago\nTuesday&mdash;men from all vocations, willing to serve the Lord, to be shepherds, if you please, of your sons\nand daughters, all of whom are united in the desire to serve God, to thrust in their sickle that\nthe inhabitants of the earth might be warned, the authority of the priesthood attested, and the\nauthenticity of the Book of Mormon affirmed. The faithfulness of these fine men and women\nwho are bringing to pass the fulfillment of latter-day revelation is most heart-warming. I do\nnot underestimate what has been accomplished in the past&mdash;in fact, I salute the leaders\nthrough the years&mdash;since Joseph Smith made his declaration, \"a marvelous work is about to\ncome forth,\" but I recognize too that today there is just as much faith and devotion in the\nchildren of God who are willing to serve and to spread these glorious truths and to build up\nhis kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nJust six months ago last Sunday night&mdash;the Sunday night of general conference in\nOctober&mdash;it was our privilege to be invited to Tooele to attend a missionary farewell. It was a rich\nexperience. I learned that a faithful son from out there had been called into the service by\nUncle Sam after filling his mission for the Church. He became acquainted with a young man\nfrom Kansas who was a staunch Baptist. This young man had an inquiring mind. He was also\nobservant, and he was willing to listen and learn. Several Latter-day Saint servicemen taught\nhim the gospel. He received a conviction of its truth and was baptized. He and this young\nman from Tooele decided they would send some of their earnings from their Army pay each\nmonth back home to a missionary fund, to help support some missionary. After they were\nreleased they learned that this money had been untouched, and the idea came to them that this\nconverted Baptist might go into the mission field to share with others the joy that had come\ninto his life, so he accepted a call to serve as a missionary.\n<\/p><p>\nI shall always remember the testimony that he bore that night at his farewell. As he looked\ndown into the congregation and saw there many young people with whom he had been\naffiliated while in the service of his country, some of them now married, one or two with\nbabes in arms, he said, \"I am thankful tonight that I had the opportunity of\nmeeting with you and learning of these glorious truths, but more important, I want to testify\nto you that had you kicked over the traces just once, I would not be here tonight.\" They had\npreached the gospel by their actions as well as by their words!\n<\/p><p>\nDo we fully appreciate the influence that we have in the lives of others? It surely was called\nto my attention as I listened to his witness and testimony. We must continually work at being\nLatter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear you my witness that a marvelous work truly has come forth. There is nothing like it in\nthe world. It is the pattern for living. The Lord has given us a safeguard, the authority of the\npriesthood. We may know of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon if we will but study its\ncontents. We have the power of the Holy Ghost which will guide into further light and truth\nand knowledge. I humbly pray that we will constantly recognize the importance of this\nmarvelous work and wonder and will ever be found furthering it, teaching it, living it, that\nothers may see our good works and glorify our Father in heaven\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35013\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35013)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35013)\">Matt. 5:16<\/a><\/span>), and his Son, Jesus Christ. I\nbear witness that they live, that Joseph Smith was and is a Prophet of God, as those who have\nsucceeded him down to President David O. McKay today.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless us with the desire and spirit to do, to accomplish, with an eye single to his\nglory, I humbly pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
