The pattern was established by Adam and Eve, our first parents. Joseph, the descendant of David, agreed to become the surrogate father of Jesus, the Son of God, when he accepted Mary as his wife, following a visitation of the angel Gabriel. In Nazareth, Joseph was regarded as the father of Jesus (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"37544\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37544)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37544)\">Matt. 13:55<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-special-status-of-children.p6\" class=\"\">The Christ child grew and developed in a modest home, where Joseph earned a humble living as a carpenter, and where Jesus also learned this craft (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"33446\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33446)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33446)\">Mark 6:3<\/a><\/span>). There were other members of the family. Mary and Joseph had four other sons and at least two daughters, all of whom were referred to in the community as the brothers and sisters of Jesus (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"37545\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37545)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37545)\">Matt. 13:55\u201356<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"33447\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33447)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33447)\">Mark 6:3<\/a><\/span>).

Understanding the special status of little children before God, because of their pure and innocent nature, brings understanding of the Lord\u2019s commandment to \u201crepent, and become as a little child, and be baptized in [His] name\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6341\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6341)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6341)\">3 Ne. 11:37<\/a><\/span>).

This teaching is to be done before a child reaches the age of accountability, and while innocent and sin-free. This is protected time for parents to teach the principles and ordinances of salvation to their children without interference from Satan. It is a time to dress them in armor in preparation for the battle against sin. When this preparation time is neglected, they are left vulnerable to the enemy. To permit a child to enter into that period of his life when he will be buffeted and tempted by the evil one, without faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and an understanding of the basic principles of the gospel, is to set him adrift in a world of wickedness. During these formative, innocent years, a child may learn wrong behavior; but such is not the result of Satan\u2019s temptations, but comes from the wrong teachings and the bad example of others. In this context, the Savior\u2019s harsh judgment of adults who offend children is better understood, wherein he said, \u201cIt were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32505\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32505)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32505)\">Luke 17:2<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-special-status-of-children.p12\" class=\"\">We offend a child by any teaching or example which leads a little one to violate a moral law; causes him to stumble, or go astray; excites him to anger; creates resentment; or perhaps even leads him to become displeasing and disagreeable. Certainly, in the context of the Savior\u2019s harsh indictment concerning anyone who \u201coffends\u201d a child, one guilty of such conduct is in serious jeopardy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-special-status-of-children.p13\" class=\"\">Every child is entitled to live in a home, as Jesus did, where there is an environment permitting growth in gospel understanding, where each can wax strong in spirit and his life be filled with wisdom, so that the grace of God will be upon him (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32487\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32487)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32487)\">Luke 2:40<\/a><\/span>).

In fact, the most effective instruction may well be done at the humblest fireside. Some may rationalize their failure to follow this God-given instruction by assuming that children of tender years are not capable of understanding gospel principles. Parents who have followed the practice of teaching their children know otherwise. Family home evening presents a special opportunity to teach the gospel to the family. The parents of a five-year-old were concerned about how they should teach of Nephi\u2019s encounter with the wicked Laban. Laban had repeatedly refused to make the precious brass plates containing a religious record available to Nephi and had sought to kill him and his brothers after confiscating their family wealth. When Nephi encountered the drunken Laban, the Spirit directed Nephi to slay him:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/the-special-status-of-children.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes.

It is also my witness that he gave parents, and all adults, the responsibility of properly teaching and protecting them. Offenders of these little ones face a divine wrath. The Savior\u2019s injunction to become as a little child is an invitation to purify our lives that we also may stand blameless before Him.
