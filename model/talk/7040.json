The Apostle Paul said, \u201cIn the last days perilous times shall come\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43773\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43773)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43773)\">2 Tim. 3:1<\/a><\/span>), and then he went on to catalog and describe with remarkable accuracy much that we currently see daily in the media, in advertisements for entertainment, and almost everywhere in the world around us. As careful as we might and should be, absolute avoidance of much of the peril which is seemingly enveloping us is at best difficult and often near impossible to avoid.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/perilous-times.p5\" class=\"\">Happily, we are not left without hope or spiritual sustenance as we strive individually and as families to accomplish the sacred purposes of mortal life for which we came to this earthly probation. Each of our circumstances is unique. We come literally from the four corners of the earth, and we also come from tremendously different families, backgrounds, challenges, opportunities, experiences, triumphs, and disappointments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/perilous-times.p6\" class=\"\">Likewise, in common with all of the human family\u2014everyone being the progeny of our loving Heavenly Father\u2014we share vast congruence in our DNA or genetic physical makeup, as well as the universally possible and promised blessings and characteristics that identify our divine parentage and spiritual potential. It is this special blending of our common origins and characteristics and also of our unique attributes, experiences, and specialized challenges that makes each of us who and what we are. While we may have differences in what constitutes special peril for us individually, we share much that establishes the apt description of \u201cperilous times\u201d for all.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/perilous-times.p7\" class=\"\">Paul, in describing our \u201cperilous times,\u201d did not promise that things would necessarily get easier or necessarily better. He did give counsel to those seeking comfort and assurance in the face of the deteriorating conditions of our day. Just as his prophecies or predictions were clearly accurate, so is his direction to us remarkably relevant as well. Said he, \u201cContinue \u2026 in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43778\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43778)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43778)\">2 Tim. 3:14<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/perilous-times.p8\" class=\"\">In this general conference, consistent with the pattern covering the entire history of the Church, we have learned and will learn of the Restoration of the gospel in our day; of the remarkable clarity and testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ found in the Book of Mormon; of the mission and contributions of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his successors in the Presidency of the Church, including especially President Gordon B. Hinckley, who teaches and testifies with such power, spirituality, and lucidity; and of the strength, comfort, and blessings that accrue from the presence of other living apostles and prophets in our midst. Not only do we learn these things, but we are assured that they are true, knowing, as Paul said, \u201cof whom [we have] learned them.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/perilous-times.p9\" class=\"\">Another who was authorized to assure those to whom he ministered was Alma. As he expressed his pleasure at the privilege of teaching and testifying to the people of Gideon, he was forthright, clear, and direct in his witness of the Lord Jesus Christ, who was yet to come in His earthly ministry. He expressed his delight at the general faith and faithfulness of this group of good people and promised them that they would be the recipients of \u201cmany things to come\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43836\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43836)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43836)\">Alma 7:7<\/a><\/span>). In the midst of his discourse, describing things yet to come, he said, \u201cThere is one thing which is of more importance than they all\u2014 \u2026 the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43837\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43837)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43837)\">Alma 7:7<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/perilous-times.p10\" class=\"\">Alma was speaking in his time specifically of the events of a few decades hence when the Savior would be born into mortality. Centuries have passed and Alma\u2019s prophecies have been largely fulfilled, but the central fact of his estimation of the thing more important than all else is still absolutely true, completely relevant, and fundamentally essential for us today as well. It is that \u201cthe Redeemer liveth.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/perilous-times.p11\" class=\"\">As Alma and \u201call the prophets who have prophesied ever since the world began\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43828\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43828)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43828)\">Mosiah 13:33<\/a><\/span>) have taught and testified of the coming of the Messiah and His mission to redeem His people, so do we join in bearing testimony of Him and His sacred work \u201cto bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44037\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44037)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44037)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>). Surely when we begin to understand the magnitude of His sacrifice and service to us individually and collectively, we then cannot consider anything else to be of more importance or to approach His significance in our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/perilous-times.p12\" class=\"\">For most of us, this understanding does not come all at once and likely will not be fully complete during our mortal sojourn. We do know, however, that as we learn line upon line, our appreciation for the Savior\u2019s contributions will increase and our knowledge and assurance of their truthfulness will grow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/perilous-times.p13\" class=\"\">The Apostle Paul was forceful and candid in much of his teaching and preaching. Listen to these familiar words that may describe most of us in our efforts and progression and yet provide the counsel, encouragement, and witness that we so badly need:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/perilous-times.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/perilous-times.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cFor now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43759\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43759)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43759)\">1 Cor. 13:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/perilous-times.p16\" class=\"\">Many years ago, President James E.
