Pratt (see <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 224). They represent his declaration of the miraculous coming forth of a remarkable book. Exactly 150 years ago this fall that book was first being set in type and run on a press in Palmyra, New York.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/an-angel-from-on-high-the-long-long-silence-broke.p4\" class=\"\">Permit me to tell you how Parley Pratt came to know of the book about which he wrote these words. In August of 1830, as a lay preacher, he was traveling from Ohio to eastern New York. At Newark, along the Erie Canal, he left the boat and walked ten miles into the country where he met a Baptist deacon by the name of Hamlin, who told him \u201cof a <span class=\"emphasis\">book,<\/span> a <span class=\"small\">STRANGE BOOK<\/span>, a VERY STRANGE BOOK! \u2026 This book, he said, purported to have been originally written on plates either of gold or brass, by a branch of the tribes of Israel; and to have been discovered and translated by a young man near Palmyra, in the State of New York, by the aid of visions, or the ministry of angels. I inquired of him how or where the book was to be obtained. He promised me the perusal of it, at his house the next day. \u2026 Next morning I called at his house, where, for the first time, my eyes beheld the \u2018BOOK OF MORMON\u2019\u2014that book of books \u2026 which was the principal means, in the hands of God, of directing the entire course of my future life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/an-angel-from-on-high-the-long-long-silence-broke.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cI opened it with eagerness, and read its title page. I then read the testimony of several witnesses in relation to the manner of its being found and translated. After this I commenced its contents by course. I read all day; eating was a burden, I had no desire for food; sleep was a burden when the night came, for I preferred reading to sleep.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/an-angel-from-on-high-the-long-long-silence-broke.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cAs I read, the spirit of the Lord was upon me, and I knew and comprehended that the book was true, as plainly and manifestly as a man comprehends and knows that he exists\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt,<\/span> 3d ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, pp. 36\u201337).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/an-angel-from-on-high-the-long-long-silence-broke.p7\" class=\"\">Parley Pratt was then twenty-three years of age. The reading of the Book of Mormon affected him so profoundly that he was soon baptized into the Church and became one of its most effective and powerful advocates. In the course of his ministry he traveled from coast to coast across what is now the United States, into Canada, and to England; he opened the work in the isles of the Pacific and was the first Mormon elder to set foot on the soil of South America. In 1857, while serving a mission in Arkansas, he was shot in the back and killed by an assailant. He was buried in a rural area near the community of Alma, and today in that quiet place a large block of polished granite marks the site of his grave. Incised in its surface are the words of another of his great and prophetic hymns, setting forth his vision of the work in which he was engaged:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">The morning breaks; the shadows flee;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Lo, Zion\u2019s standard is unfurled! \u2026<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">The dawning of a brighter day<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Majestic rises on the world.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">The clouds of error disappear<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Before the rays of truth divine; \u2026 <\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">The glory bursting from afar<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Wide o\u2019er the nations soon will shine.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/an-angel-from-on-high-the-long-long-silence-broke.p16\" class=\"\">(<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 269).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/an-angel-from-on-high-the-long-long-silence-broke.p17\" class=\"\">Parley Pratt\u2019s experience with the Book of Mormon was not unique. As the volumes of the first edition were circulated and read, strong men and women by the hundreds were so deeply touched that they gave up everything they owned, and in the years that followed not a few even gave their lives for the witness they carried in their hearts of the truth of this remarkable volume.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/an-angel-from-on-high-the-long-long-silence-broke.p18\" class=\"\">Today, a century and a half after its first publication, it is more widely read than at any time in its history. Whereas there were 5,000 copies in that first edition, today\u2019s editions are ordered in lots of as many as a million, and the book currently is printed in more than a score of languages.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/an-angel-from-on-high-the-long-long-silence-broke.p19\" class=\"\">Its appeal is as timeless as truth, as universal as mankind.

But the book is here to be felt and handled and read. No one can dispute its presence. All efforts to account for its origin, other than the account given by Joseph Smith, have been shown to lack substance. It is a record of ancient America. It is a scripture of the New World, as certainly as the Bible is the scripture of the Old. Each speaks of the other. Each carries with it the spirit of inspiration, the power to convince and to convert. Together they become two witnesses, hand in hand, that Jesus is the Christ, the resurrected and living Son of the living God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/an-angel-from-on-high-the-long-long-silence-broke.p21\" class=\"\">Its narrative is a chronicle of nations long since gone. But in its descriptions of the problems of today\u2019s society, it is as current as the morning newspaper and much more definitive, inspired, and inspiring concerning the solutions of those problems.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/an-angel-from-on-high-the-long-long-silence-broke.p22\" class=\"\">I know of no other writing which sets forth with such clarity the tragic consequences to societies that follow courses contrary to the commandments of God. Its pages trace the stories of two distinct civilizations that flourished on this Western Hemisphere. Each began as a small nation, its people walking in the fear of the Lord. But with prosperity came growing evils. The people succumbed to the wiles of ambitious and scheming leaders who oppressed them with burdensome taxes, who lulled them with hollow promises, who countenanced and even encouraged loose and lascivious living, who led them into terrible wars that resulted in the death of millions and the final and total extinction of two great civilizations in two different eras.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/an-angel-from-on-high-the-long-long-silence-broke.p23\" class=\"\">No other written testament so clearly illustrates the fact that when men and nations walk in the fear of God and in obedience to his commandments, they prosper and grow, but when they disregard him and his word, there comes a decay that, unless arrested by righteousness, leads to impotence and death.
