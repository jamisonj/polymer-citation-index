Sill, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1966, pp. 18-21<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brothers and sisters, I appreciate very much this privilege of having a part with you in\nthis great general conference of the Church. As important ideas are held up before our minds,\nwe are helped to follow more fully that divine instruction that \"man shall not live by bread\nalone\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35522\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35522)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35522)\">Matt. 4:4<\/a><\/span>). It is desirable at all times that we should live by the word of the Lord, but\nthis applies particularly to us, as our age is the most important and the most exciting that the\nworld has ever known. Our forefathers lived on a flat stationary earth and plowed their\nground with a wooden stick. But we live on an earth of power steering, jet propulsion, and\natomic power, and we need personality and character qualities to match the times. Great\nevents are now taking place at breathtaking speed in fulfillment of the word of the Lord to\nDaniel, twenty-five centuries ago. Concerning our day, he said, \"But thou, O Daniel, shut up\nthe words . . . even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be\nincreased\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10684\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10684)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10684)\">Dan. 12:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The \"Knowledge Explosion\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nCertainly the knowledge explosion of our day furnishes a literal fulfillment of this prophecy\nbefore our own eyes. It is interesting to remember that George Washington rode to his\ninauguration in a chariot drawn by horses, but two thousand years earlier, Julius Caesar had\ngone to his Roman capital in exactly the same way. Little or no change had taken place in all\nof that long period. When I was born, the Wright Brothers had not yet made their famous\nmaiden 60-foot flight at Kill Devil Hill. During the first part of our century we had no guided\nmissiles, no space travel, no automobiles, no radios, no television, no movies, and no atomic\nbombs. And most of the world's work was then still being done by the muscle power of men\nand animals. However, the ancient prophets have known a great deal about our age of\nmiracles for many centuries.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Moses foresaw history<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMoses was permitted to see the history of our earth from its beginning to its end (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39252\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39252)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39252)\">Moses 1:8<\/a><\/span>).\nMuch of the writings of Isaiah concerns our own day, though he seemed a little bit surprised\nwhen he looked out of his window into the future and exclaimed: \"Who are these that fly as a\ncloud, and as the doves to their windows?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25322\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25322)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25322)\">Isa. 60:8<\/a><\/span>). Foreseeing our day, the prophet\nHabakkuk said, \"Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the\nevening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come\nfrom afar; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24161\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24161)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24161)\">Hab. 1:8<\/a><\/span>). And Nahum gives a clear\nmental view of one of our night scenes when he said: \". . . the chariots shall be with flaming\ntorches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall jostle one against another in the broad ways:\nthey shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41064\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41064)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41064)\">Nahum 2:3-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe important world events all seem to have been foretold. The people of Noah's day were\nwarned about the flood, and God made known to Sodom and Gomorrah that their evil would\ndraw a rainstorm of fire and brimstone from heaven. Jesus warned Jerusalem of its impending\ndoom and foretold his own death. He announced the apostasy from God and foretold the dark\nages that would follow the Savior's rejection.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Second coming of Christ foreseen<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nBut one of the most important events on the divine timetable of the world's future is the\nglorious second coming of Jesus Christ. This will probably be the most momentous happening\never to take place in the history of the world. The most often mentioned event in the entire\nBible is that wonderful, yet awful experience that we will have when Jesus Christ shall come\nto judge our world. There are many important gospel doctrines mentioned in the Bible only\nbriefly, and some not at all. The new birth is mentioned in the Bible nine times; baptism is\nmentioned 52 times, repentance is mentioned 89, but the second coming of Christ is\nmentioned over 1,500 times in the Old Testament and 300 times in the New Testament. If\nGod thought this subject that important, he must have wanted us to do something about it.\nThe Holy Bible forecasts events before they happen, and much of our history has actually\nbeen written down before it occurred. The Bible accurately predicted Christ's first coming in\nevery detail, hundreds of years in advance. It revealed that he would come from the tribe of Judah\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37895\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37895)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37895)\">Micah 5:2<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28253\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28253)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28253)\">John 7:42<\/a><\/span>),\nthat his birthplace would be Bethlehem\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37896\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37896)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37896)\">Micah 5:2<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28254\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28254)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28254)\">John 7:42<\/a><\/span>),\nthat he would be born of a virgin (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25298\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25298)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25298)\">Isa. 7:14<\/a><\/span>), that he would flee into Egypt\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24906\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24906)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24906)\">Hosea 11:1<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35518\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35518)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35518)\">Matt. 2:15<\/a><\/span>),\nthat he would heal the sick, that his own people would reject him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25316\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25316)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25316)\">Isa. 53:3<\/a><\/span>), that he\nwould be betrayed by a friend and sold for 30 pieces of silver\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43078\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43078)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43078)\">Zech. 11:12-13<\/a><\/span>), that he would take upon\nhimself the sins of the world and be crucified with sinners\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25318\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25318)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25318)\">Isa. 53:3-12<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31684\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31684)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31684)\">Luke 22:37<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33190\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33190)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33190)\">Mark 15:27<\/a><\/span>),\nthat his sides would be pierced\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43079\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43079)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43079)\">Zech. 12:10<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28309\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28309)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28309)\">John 19:37<\/a><\/span>),\nthat he would institute a\nuniversal resurrection, and that he would personally rise from the dead the third day\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24905\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24905)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24905)\">Hosea 6:2<\/a><\/span>;\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31669\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31669)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31669)\">Luke 9:22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis same Bible also foretells that he will come to the earth a second time, though in a\ndifferent manner. The first time he came as a man of sorrows who was acquainted with grief\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25317\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25317)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25317)\">Isa. 53:3<\/a><\/span>), but the second time he will come as the mighty God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25299\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25299)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25299)\">Isa. 9:6<\/a><\/span>). He came the first\ntime as the Prince of Peace (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25300\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25300)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25300)\">Isa. 9:6<\/a><\/span>). He will come the second time as King of kings and\nLord of lords (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42401\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42401)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42401)\">Rev. 17:14<\/a><\/span>). He came the first time to atone for our sins; he will come the\nsecond time to judge those sinners who have not repented. The Apostle Paul says, \". . . the\nLord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,\n<\/p><p>\n\"In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of\nour Lord Jesus Christ\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5046\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5046)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5046)\">2 Thes. 1:7-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMalachi says, \". . . and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple. . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32793\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32793)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32793)\">Mal. 3:1-2<\/a><\/span>). And we might ask ourselves, who indeed?\n<\/p><p>\nAccording to the divine plan, our earth has been allotted a mortal or temporal existence of\nseven thousand years, patterned after the seven days of creation. The first four thousand years\nbegan with the fall of Adam and ended at the birth of Christ. But 1966 more years have come\nand gone since that time. Therefore, on the divine calendar we are now living in the late\nSaturday evening of time. This glorious second coming of Christ is scheduled to usher in the\nearth's Sabbath of a thousand years, known to the prophets as the millennium. During this\nperiod Christ will reign personally upon the earth. However, before this can happen, the\nwicked will be destroyed by fire (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14766\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14766)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14766)\">D&amp;C 43:33<\/a><\/span>) and Satan will be bound\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14764\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14764)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14764)\">D&amp;C 43:31<\/a><\/span>). At Christ's coming a great number\nof very exciting things are going to take place. He is not coming alone; as Paul says, he will\ncome with his mighty angels (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"5047\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5047)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5047)\">2 Thes. 1:7-8<\/a><\/span>).\nAt his coming a great many of the faithful\ndead will be resurrected and caught up to meet the Lord in the air. And some of the righteous\nwho are then living upon the earth will be changed from mortality to immortality in the\ntwinkling of an eye (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14765\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14765)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14765)\">D&amp;C 43:32<\/a><\/span>) to join that impressive company in the air. Certainly this is something to\nlook forward to (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"2740\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2740)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2740)\">1 Thes. 4:13-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAt the time of Adam's fall, a curse was placed upon the earth, and since then it has existed in\nits fallen or telestial state. For nearly six thousand years it has brought forth thorns, thistles,\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23735\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23735)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23735)\">Gen. 3:17-18<\/a><\/span>),\nand noxious weeds, while crime, corruption, war, and sin have flourished upon its face. But at\nthe second coming of Christ, the earth will be cleansed by fire (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24356\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24356)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24356)\">Heb. 6:7 (JST)<\/a><\/span>). It will then be renewed and\nreceive its paradisiacal glory (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6832\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6832)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6832)\">A of F 1:10<\/a><\/span>) as it is raised to the status of a terrestrial sphere.\n<\/p><p>\nOn the last Tuesday of the Lord's life, his disciples came to him and said, \". . . what shall be\nthe sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35628\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35628)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35628)\">Matt. 24:3<\/a><\/span>). Jesus warned them of the\ngreat wickedness that would exist upon the earth and the deception of false teachers. He said,\n\". . . then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35637\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35637)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35637)\">Matt. 24:10,12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAt that time Jesus said some rather uncomplimentary things about us. He said, \". . . as the\ndays of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35649\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35649)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35649)\">Matt. 24:37<\/a><\/span>). Apparently\nNoah's day was quite a day; some of its chief characteristics were the people's lack of\npreparation and their disbelief in God. As in our own day, the antediluvians thought that the\nheavens were sealed and that God would never again reveal himself. It must have sounded a\nlittle bit ridiculous to them when on a warm cloudless day Noah prophesied that a flood\nwould come and destroy their entire society if they did not repent, but we are in a similar\nsituation. And even though the combined sins of Sodom, Babylon, and ancient Rome all glare\nat us from our own newspaper headlines, yet we are far from changing our ways. Instead,\nmany people of our day are contending for a type of behavior that condones alcoholism,\nimmorality, and a wide variety of deviations from God's laws.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Signs of His coming<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAs one of the signs that would precede his coming, Jesus said that there would be wars and\nrumors of wars (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35631\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35631)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35631)\">Matt. 24:6<\/a><\/span>), and an awful hate would exist among people. He said, \"For nation shall rise\nagainst nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and\nearthquakes, in divers places\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35635\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35635)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35635)\">Matt. 24:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nDr. Carl Joachim Hambro, late president of the League of Nations, said that in World War I\nalone, thirty-five million human beings died of starvation and epidemics. But that is only a\ndrop in the bucket compared to the possible horror and mutilation of present-day war. We can\nnow drop concentrated fire on a nation and literally roast its population. War doesn't solve a\nsingle human problem, and yet the one place where our generation excels most is in its ability\nto make war. Modern war is undoubtedly the most highly developed of all of our sciences.\nEven a horrible kind of destructive cold war now seems to have become a fixed part of our\nunfortunate way of life. But sinful, unstable man now holds in his hands the ability to destroy\neverything upon the earth in just a few hours. Our failure has been that while we have\nperfected weapons, we have failed to perfect the men who may be asked to use them. But still\nthere is no letup in our evil. Like the ancients, we can discern the face of the sky, but we fail\nin reading the signs of the times (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35596\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35596)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35596)\">Matt. 16:3<\/a><\/span>).\nThis has always been one of the world's most serious problems.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Gospel shall be preached for a witness<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOn the Mount of Olives the Lord also foretold another event that would precede his glorious\nsecond coming. He said: \"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world\nfor a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35639\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35639)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35639)\">Matt. 24:14<\/a><\/span>). Angelic\nmessengers with authority from God have been sent to the earth in our day to restore the\nsimple principles and ordinances of the gospel that fulfill this prophecy. The Church of Jesus\nChrist has again been established upon the earth, built upon its necessary foundation of\napostles and prophets (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"21787\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21787)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21787)\">Eph. 2:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn obedience to God's command, the world has also been given three great volumes of new\nscripture outlining in every detail the simple principles of the gospel of Christ. These modern\nscriptures add many additional prophetic statements to those of the Old and New Testaments,\nwarning us to make ourselves ready for this tremendous event that is now at our doors\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14869\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14869)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14869)\">D&amp;C 110:16<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30791\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30791)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30791)\">JS&mdash;M 1:39<\/a><\/span>). May\nGod help us so to do, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
