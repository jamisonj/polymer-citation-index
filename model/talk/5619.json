The killing and maiming seem to go on, despite the efforts put forth to bring peace. The account of a sniper taking deadly aim and snuffing out the life of a small child brought sorrow to my soul. I silently asked: <span class=\"emphasis\">Where to be found is that divine attribute of mercy?<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/mercy-the-divine-gift.p5\" class=\"\">The cruelty of war seems to bring forth hatred toward others and disregard for human life.

I particularly remember the comments of an American infantryman who told that, after a day of ferocious fighting, he glanced up from his shallow foxhole to see an enemy soldier with his gun barrel leveled at the American\u2019s heart. Said the infantryman: \u201cI felt I was soon to cross over that bridge of death which leads to eternity. Incredibly my enemy, in broken English, said to me, \u2018Soldier, for you this war is over!\u2019 He took me prisoner and thus saved my life. Such mercy I shall remember forever.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/mercy-the-divine-gift.p7\" class=\"\">At an earlier time and in a different conflict\u2014namely the American Civil War\u2014a historically documented account illustrates courage, coupled with mercy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/mercy-the-divine-gift.p8\" class=\"\">From December 11 to 13, 1862, the Union forces attacked Marye\u2019s Heights, a large hill overlooking the town of Fredericksburg, Virginia, where six thousand Rebels awaited them. The Southern troops were in secure defensive positions behind a stone wall which meandered along the foot of the hill. In addition, they stood four deep on a sunken road behind the wall, out of sight of Union forces.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/mercy-the-divine-gift.p9\" class=\"\">The Union troops\u2014over forty thousand strong\u2014launched a series of suicidal attacks across open ground. They were mowed down by a scythe of shot; none got closer than forty yards from the stone wall.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/mercy-the-divine-gift.p10\" class=\"\">Soon the ground in front of the Confederate positions was littered with hundreds, then thousands, of fallen Union soldiers in their blue uniforms\u2014over twelve thousand before sunset. Crying for help, the wounded lay in the bitter cold throughout that terrible night.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/mercy-the-divine-gift.p11\" class=\"\">The next day, a Sunday, dawned cold and foggy. As the morning fog lifted, the agonized cries of the wounded could still be heard. Finally, a young Confederate soldier, a nineteen-year-old sergeant, had had all he could take. The young man\u2019s name was Richard Rowland Kirkland. To his commanding officer, Kirkland exclaimed, \u201cAll night and all day I have heard those poor people crying for water, and I can stand it no longer. I \u2026 ask permission to go and give them water.\u201d His request was initially denied on the grounds that it was too dangerous. Finally, however, permission was granted, and soon thousands of amazed men on both sides saw the young soldier, with several canteens draped around his neck, climb over the wall and walk to the nearest wounded Union soldier. He raised the stricken man\u2019s head, gently gave him a drink, and covered him with his own overcoat. Then he moved to the next of the wounded\u2014and the next and the next. As Kirkland\u2019s purpose became clear, fresh cries of \u201cWater, water, for God\u2019s sake water\u201d arose all over the field.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/mercy-the-divine-gift.p12\" class=\"\">The Union soldiers were at first too surprised to shoot. Soon they began to cheer the young Southerner as they saw what he was doing. For more than an hour and a half, Sergeant Kirkland continued his work of mercy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/mercy-the-divine-gift.p13\" class=\"\">Tragically, Richard Kirkland was himself killed a few months later at the battle of Chicamauga. His last words to his companions were, \u201cSave yourselves, and tell my pa I died right.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/mercy-the-divine-gift.p14\" class=\"\">Kirkland\u2019s Christlike compassion made his name synonymous with mercy for a post\u2013Civil War generation, both North and South. He became known by soldiers on both sides of the conflict as \u201cthe angel of Marye\u2019s Heights.\u201d His loving errand of mercy is commemorated by a bronze monument which stands today in front of the stone wall at Fredericksburg. It depicts Sergeant Kirkland lifting the head of a wounded Union soldier to give him a drink of refreshing water. A tablet to Kirkland\u2019s honor hangs in the Episcopal church in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. With simple eloquence, it captures the essence of the young soldier\u2019s mission of mercy. It reads: \u201cA hero of benevolence, at the risk of his own life, he gave his enemy drink at Fredericksburg.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-95905_000_025\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">The Battle Fredericksburg,<\/span> Eastern Acorn Press, 1990; \u201c\u2018He Gave His Enemy Drink,\u2019\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">CWT Illustrated,<\/span> Oct. 1962, pp. 38\u201339.

We have a four-year-old grandson named Jeffrey. One day his fifteen-year-old brother, Alan, had just completed, on the family computer, a most difficult and rather ingenious design of an entire city. When Alan slipped out of the room for just a moment, little Jeffrey approached the computer and accidentally erased the program. Upon his return, Alan was furious when he observed what his brother had done. Sensing that his doom was at hand, Jeffrey raised his finger and, pointing it toward Alan, declared from his heart and soul, \u201cRemember, Alan, Jesus said \u2018Don\u2019t hurt little boys.\u2019\u201d Alan began to laugh; anger subsided; mercy prevailed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/mercy-the-divine-gift.p29\" class=\"\">There are those among us who torture themselves through their inability to show mercy and to forgive others some supposed offense or slight, however small it may be.
