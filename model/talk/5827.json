It is, in my judgment, the most significant event that has occurred in this world since the Son of God walked forth from the tomb a resurrected being. I refer to that first heavenly vision that came to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Let me read his words:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-spirit-of-prophecy.p4\" class=\"\">\u201cIt was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-spirit-of-prophecy.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cAfter I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-spirit-of-prophecy.p6\" class=\"\">He then described a few moments of severe spiritual anguish, convincing him that the forces of evil were real and powerful. Then he continued:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-spirit-of-prophecy.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cI saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-spirit-of-prophecy.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cIt no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air.

Hinckley has said: \u201cMuch has been written, much will be written, in an effort to explain it away. The finite mind cannot comprehend it. But the testimony of the Holy Spirit, experienced by countless numbers of people all through the years since it happened, bears witness that it is true, that it happened as Joseph Smith said it happened, that it was as real as the sunrise over Palmyra, that it is an essential foundation stone, a cornerstone, without which the Church could not be \u2018fitly framed together\u2019 [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"124804\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124804)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124804)\">Eph. 2:21<\/a><\/span>].\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-96911_000_005\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1984, 52.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/the-spirit-of-prophecy.p12\" class=\"\">I repeat: the testimony of the Holy Spirit bears witness that it is true.
