Why then do some suffer so badly from <span class=\"emphasis\">logokophosis,<\/span> the inability to hear or understand?

We often find among <span class=\"emphasis\">them<\/span> the most faithful members of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-greatest-news-of-all-times-is-that-jesus-lives.p10\" class=\"\">The Apostle Paul was an inspired teacher, and he gave many spoken directions to the people during his apostolic travels.

He again informed them in writing that Christ died for our sins, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day, and that he appeared to Simon Peter and then to the Apostles.

Having a partnership with the Lord in saving others is for me another definition of missionary work. And I want every young man who is preparing himself for a mission to read the Book of Mormon in order to realize that he is indeed preparing himself to have a very personal partnership with the Lord in saving others, for the duration of his mission and beyond. The same is true for every young woman preparing for her mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-greatest-news-of-all-times-is-that-jesus-lives.p16\" class=\"\">The greatest news of all times is that Jesus lives and that his atoning sacrifice took place for all people; and when they put their trust in him and indeed walk in obedience to his commandments, there is a way for them to gain salvation and exaltation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-greatest-news-of-all-times-is-that-jesus-lives.p17\" class=\"\">How blessed we are to live in this last dispensation when, through the restored priesthood and the Book of Mormon, the globalization of the gospel of Jesus Christ is underway.

I can testify to you that while I labor in the countries of Asia and see the enormous progress there in the work of the Lord, the Spirit repeatedly bears witness to my soul of the truthfulness of the prophetic words of President Brigham Young concerning opposition to the Church.
