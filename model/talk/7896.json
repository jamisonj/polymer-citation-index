Soon after my arrival in Quantico, Virginia, for basic training, I found myself standing at attention in front of my barrack\u2019s bunk along with 54 other Marine Corps recruits. I met my drill instructor, a battle-hardened veteran, when he kicked open the door to the barracks and entered while screaming words laced with profanity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/come-unto-me-o-ye-house-of-israel.p6\" class=\"\">After this terrifying introduction, he started at one end of the barracks and confronted each recruit with questions. Without exception, the drill instructor methodically found something about each recruit to ridicule with loud, vulgar language. Down the row he came, with each marine shouting back his answer as commanded: \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo, Sergeant Instructor.\u201d I could not see exactly what he was doing, because we had been ordered to stand at attention with our eyes looking straight ahead. When it was my turn, I could tell he grabbed my duffel bag and emptied the contents onto my mattress behind me. He looked through my belongings, then walked back to face me. I braced myself for his attack. In his hand was my Book of Mormon. I expected that he would yell at me; instead, he moved close to me and whispered, \u201cAre you a Mormon?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/come-unto-me-o-ye-house-of-israel.p7\" class=\"\">As commanded, I yelled, \u201cYes, Sergeant Instructor.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/come-unto-me-o-ye-house-of-israel.p8\" class=\"\">Again I expected the worst. Instead, he paused and raised his hand that held my Book of Mormon and in a very quiet voice said, \u201cDo you believe in this book?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/come-unto-me-o-ye-house-of-israel.p9\" class=\"\">Again I shouted, \u201cYes, Sergeant Instructor.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/come-unto-me-o-ye-house-of-israel.p10\" class=\"\">At this point I was sure he would scream disparaging words about Mormons and the Book of Mormon, but he just stood there in silence. After a moment he walked back to my bunk and carefully laid down my Book of Mormon. He then proceeded to walk by me without stopping and went on to ridicule and disparage with profane language all remaining recruits.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/come-unto-me-o-ye-house-of-israel.p11\" class=\"\">I have often wondered why that tough Marine Corps sergeant spared me that day. But I am grateful I was able to say without hesitation, \u201cYes, I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u201d and \u201cYes, I know the Book of Mormon is true.\u201d This testimony is a precious gift given to me through the Holy Ghost with the help of two missionaries and a priests quorum adviser.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/come-unto-me-o-ye-house-of-israel.p12\" class=\"\">When I was 14 years old, two missionaries, Lee Pearson and Boyd Camphuysen, taught my family the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, and I was baptized. Two years later my priests quorum adviser, Richard Boren, challenged me to read the Book of Mormon. I accepted that challenge, and I read at least 10 pages every night until I finished.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/come-unto-me-o-ye-house-of-israel.p13\" class=\"\">On the title page I read that it is \u201cwritten to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile.\u201d In the introduction to the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, it says that the Lamanites \u201care among the ancestors of the American Indians.\u201d As I read the Book of Mormon, it seemed to me that it was about my American Indian ancestors. It tells the story of a people, a part of which were later described as \u201cLamanites,\u201d who migrated from Jerusalem to a \u201cland of promise\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"123324\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123324)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123324)\">1\u00a0Nephi 2:20<\/a><\/span>) about 600 <span class=\"small\">B.C.<\/span> It is an account of God\u2019s dealings with these ancient inhabitants located somewhere on the American continents.

Their prophets foretold that many multitudes of Gentiles would eventually come to this land of promise and the wrath of God would be upon the Lamanites and they would be scattered, smitten, and nearly destroyed (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"123326\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123326)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123326)\">1\u00a0Nephi 13:10\u201314<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/come-unto-me-o-ye-house-of-israel.p14\" class=\"\">My great-grandfather Echo Hawk, a Pawnee Indian, was born in the mid-1800s in what is now called Nebraska. When he was 19 years of age, the Pawnee people were forced to give up their 23-million-acre (9.3 million ha) homeland to make room for settlers. In 1874 the Pawnee people were marched several hundred miles south to a small reservation located in the Oklahoma Indian Territory. The population of Pawnee people had declined from over 12,000 to less than 700 upon their arrival in Oklahoma. The Pawnee, like other tribes, had been scattered, smitten, and nearly destroyed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/come-unto-me-o-ye-house-of-israel.p15\" class=\"\">The Book of Mormon has a special message for descendants of the Lamanites, a remnant of the house of Israel. Nephi expressed this message while interpreting his father\u2019s vision of these latter days: \u201cAnd at that day shall the remnant of our seed know that they are of the house of Israel, and that they are the covenant people of the Lord; and then shall they know and come to the knowledge of their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the gospel of their Redeemer, which was ministered unto their fathers by him; wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and the very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be saved\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"123327\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123327)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123327)\">1\u00a0Nephi 15:14<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/come-unto-me-o-ye-house-of-israel.p16\" class=\"\">The Book of Mormon is sacred scripture. It contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel.
