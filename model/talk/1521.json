This is an incident in western hemisphere religious history in\nwhich a prophet-teacher named Ammon exultantly praises God for his missionary successes.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Divine power source of strength<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHis brother Aaron chided him, saying: \"Ammon, I fear that thy joy doth carry thee away unto\nboasting.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But Ammon said unto him, I do not boast in my own strength, nor in my own wisdom . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak, therefore I will not boast of\nmyself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9061\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9061)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9061)\">Alma 26:10-12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFrequently the question is asked by those in and out of the Church: How do we develop the\nspiritual quality in our natures in order to serve our earthly missions more completely and\nthus become attuned with that infinite power of which the Prophet Ammon speaks?\n<\/p><p>\nAmmon answered that question in part: \"Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and\nbringeth forth good works, and prayeth continually without ceasing&mdash;unto such it is given to\nknow the mysteries of God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9062\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9062)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9062)\">Alma 26:22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFor a few moments today, I would have you hear the testimonies as found in sacred scriptures\nof a few of the great leaders who learned how to tap the sources of divine power and became\nspiritual giants among the people of their day.\n<\/p><p>\nDavid, the psalmist, learned even as a young man the source of spiritual power. The spirit\nwhispered, \"Be still, and know that I am God . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . the God of Jacob is our refuge\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41861\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41861)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41861)\">Ps. 46:10-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nProphets of old learned, as all must know, how to communicate with the Lord by prayer, to\ntalk with and then receive answers in the Lord's own way.\nTo know God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28303\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28303)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28303)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>), as the Master told his disciples,\nis to begin on the sure course that leads to eternal life in the presence of these glorified\nbeings.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord told Elijah, the prophet: \"Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And,\nbehold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in\npieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an\nearthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still\nsmall voice.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out,\nand stood in the entering in of the cave\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1233\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1233)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1233)\">1 Kgs. 19:11-13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAll too often when God speaks in this still, small voice, as he did to Elijah in the cave, it may\nnot be audible to our physical hearing because, like a faulty radio, we may be out of tune\nwith the infinite.\n<\/p><p>\nNephi, of Book of Mormon history, speaks of this spiritual communication when he rebuked\nhis brothers who had it in their hearts to destroy him: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your God. Ye have seen an angel,\nand he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken\nunto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his words;\nwherefore, he has spoken unto you like unto the voice of thunder, which did cause the earth\nto shake as if it were to divide asunder\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1636\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1636)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1636)\">1 Ne. 17:45<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the Gospel of John is related a parallel experience in the Master's ministry showing how,\nout of a multitude, only a few&mdash;or none&mdash;may hear God when he speaks.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the Master entered Jerusalem on this occasion, the people gathered around and heard him\npray: \". . . Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified\nit, and will glorify it again.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel\nspake to him.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28269\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28269)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28269)\">John 12:27-30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOnly the Master, apparently, knew that God had spoken. So often today, men and women are\nliving so far apart from things spiritual that when the Lord is speaking to their physical\nhearing, to their minds with no audible sound, or to them through his authorized servants\nwho, when directed by the Spirit, are as his own voice, they hear only a noise as did they at\nJerusalem. Likewise, they receive no inspired wisdom, nor inward assurance, that the mind of\nthe Lord has spoken through his prophet leaders.\n<\/p><p>\nThe great law-giver, Moses, has given us the key to the beginning of heavenly wisdom. After\nhe had sought God on Mt. Sinai, a soul-stirring vision was given him in which he was\npermitted to enter into the presence of the Lord. When the vision was ended and he was left\nunto himself, he made this profound statement: \"Now, for this cause I know that man is\nnothing, which thing I had never supposed\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39253\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39253)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39253)\">Moses 1:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat was the beginning of his wisdom unto the obtaining of the spiritual power necessary for\nhim to perform his great mission. He had found himself by losing himself in the great work\nto which God had now called him.\n<\/p><p>\nIn one of the greatest religious motion pictures of our day, <i>The Ten Commandments<\/i>, we are\ngiven a dramatic portrayal by the great actor, Charlton Heston, of the Moses before and after\nhe had been commissioned of God for his great ministry to become the mouthpiece of the\nLord to all Israel.\n<\/p><p>\nCharlton Heston apparently studied and researched carefully in order to portray accurately the\ncharacter of Moses. This actor has written of his spiritual experiences while filming this great\nepic drama: \n<\/p><p>\nHe first takes us to Mt. Sinai for the filming of that tremendous experience as Moses was\nshown climbing that sacred mountain to commune with God.\n<\/p><p>\nThen, by contrast, this actor gives his impression of the Moses, now divinely commissioned,\nleading the children of Israel out of Egyptian bondage: \n<\/p><p>\n\"The last glimpse I had of Moses was at the edge of the desert not far from Cairo, where\n7,000 Egyptians had assembled for the Exodus.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I was lost, now, not in space, but in centuries. Surely, on the morning of that long-ago\nExodus, these were the same eyes that followed Moses. The same skinny animals, the ragged\nclothes, the stink of poverty. I squeezed through the farthest rim of the crowd and out into the\ndesert. Lifeless and endless it stretched to the horizon, while behind me the voices faded and\nswelled. These people trusted Moses, they had followed where he led&mdash;and where had he led\nthem? Into this unspeakable wilderness?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Of course Moses could not lead these thousands across the desert. He never would have\ntried. But God could do it. And Moses, this all-too-human man, this man, so much like the\nrest of us, had simply turned himself into the instrument through which the strength of God\nmoved.\n<\/p><p>\n\"With joy I cried out the words that Moses cried: \n<\/p><p>\n'Bear us out of Egypt, O Lord,<br \/>\n      As the eagle bears its young upon its wings.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"Then I lifted Moses' staff and saw the multitude heave into a vast shudder of motion and\nwalk out from bondage.\" (Charlton Heston, \"My Three Meetings with Moses.\")\n<\/p><p>\n<b>How to know the Lord<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHere again we have the testimony of Jacob, son of Lehi, the pioneer of the Nephite\ndispensation, explaining how one can come to know God and to learn of his mysteries and to\nattain a state in which one may act in very deed as an agent of the Almighty.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and the spirit of prophecy;\nand having all these witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch\nthat we truly can command in the name of Jesus and the very trees obey us, or the mountains,\nor the waves of the sea\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25855\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25855)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25855)\">Jacob 4:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt was so with another of the Nephite leaders. Enos, grandson of Lehi, gives us to understand\nwhy some can receive a knowledge of the things of God while others cannot. Enos recounts\nhis struggle to obtain a forgiveness of his sins that he might be worthy of his high calling.\n<\/p><p>\nHe then concludes: \"And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the\nLord came into my mind again, saying: I will visit thy brethren according to their diligence in\nkeeping my commandments\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21496\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21496)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21496)\">Enos 1:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere you have, in simple language, a great principle: It isn't the Lord who withholds himself\nfrom us. It is we who withhold ourselves from him because of our failure to keep his\ncommandments.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Begins childhood and youth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThis \"spiritual fitness program\" must begin in childhood and youth. You parents of children\nand impressionable youth, may you teach yours to keep the commandments, that they may not\nfail their destiny.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, may I direct a few words especially to our younger people, to my grandchildren and\nyours: \n<\/p><p>\nYou, the youth of today, are living in the midst of turmoil. In this militaristic age, most of\nyou able-bodied young men may, at one time or another, be required to engage in military\nservice. Do you know that in your day, the voice of the Lord has spoken to you words of\nadmonition, of blessings, and of promise, through your Church leaders, the living mouthpieces\nof the living God today? Listen to this inspired utterance from the First Presidency of the\nChurch, given to you who go into military service or elsewhere, for that matter: \n<\/p><p>\n<b>In military service<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"To our young men who go into service, no matter whom they serve or where, we say live\nclean, keep the commandments of the Lord, pray to him constantly to preserve you in truth\nand righteousness, live as you pray, and then whatever betides you the Lord will be with you\nand nothing will happen to you that will not be to the honor and glory of God and to your\nsalvation and exaltation. There will come into your hearts from the living of the pure life you\npray for, a joy that will pass your powers of expression or understanding. The Lord will be\nalways near you; he will comfort you; you will feel his presence in the hour of your greatest\ntribulation; he will guard and protect you to the full extent that accords with his all-wise\npurpose.... Your faith and testimony will be strong beyond breaking. You will be looked up to\nand revered as having passed through the fiery furnace of trial and temptation and come forth\nunharmed. Your brethren will look to you for counsel, support, and guidance. You will be the\nanchors to which thereafter the youth of Zion will moor their faith in man.\" (Message of the\nFirst Presidency [April 1942 general conference], <i>The Improvement Era<\/i>, May 1942, pp. 349-350.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>To the daughters of Zion<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnd to you young girls, will you hear the voice of the Lord to you today from this same\nsource, as a Prophet dedicated a beautiful new temple: \n<\/p><p>\n\"We pray for the daughters of Zion. May they be preserved in virtue, chastity, and purity of\nlife, be blessed with vigorous bodies and minds, and with great faith. May they develop into\ntrue womanhood and receive choice companions under the new and everlasting covenant for\ntime and for all eternity in thy temples provided for this priceless privilege and purpose. May\nthey too be privileged to enjoy as the fruits of their union a noble posterity which, we pray\nthee, may be taught at their mother's knee to believe in thee and in the divine mission of thy\nBeloved Son.\" (President George Albert Smith, dedicatory prayer at the Idaho Falls Temple;\n<i>The Improvement Era<\/i>, October 1945, p. 563.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Counsel of inspired leaders<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMay youth of today never forget what our inspired leaders have counseled.\n<\/p><p>\nEven in times of great danger, moral or physical, when, like the Apostle Paul, you may be in\ndanger of \"shipwreck\" either to your body or your soul, there can be standing by you, as there\nwas by him, after fasting and prayer, an angel of God who whispered peace to his soul (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8016\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8016)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8016)\">Acts 27:23-24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHow is it done, you ask? The Lord answers: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And if ye are purified and cleansed from all sin, ye shall ask whatsoever you will in the\nname of Jesus and it shall be done.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, I am in your midst, and I am the good shepherd, and the stone of Israel.

The Prophet Joseph Smith tells\nus: \n<\/p><p>\n\"A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation for instance,\nwhen you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas, so\nthat by noticing it, you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon; (i.e.) those things that were\npresented unto your minds by the Spirit of God, will come to pass; and thus by learning the\nSpirit of God and understanding it, you may grow into the principle of revelation, until you\nbecome perfect in Christ Jesus.\" (<i>Documentary History of the Church<\/i>, Vol. 3, p. 381.)\n<\/p><p>\nMother's intuition, with which most of you are familiar, is a form of divine guidance in its\npurest and simplest form. Can you now understand why we counsel you to heed the\nadmonitions of your parents during your growing-up years?\n<\/p><p>\nIn one of the Master's parables, he tells of the foolish rich man who laid up treasure for\nhimself but was \"not rich toward God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31673\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31673)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31673)\">Luke 12:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Rich toward God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn King Solomon's \"personal diary,\" as someone has called the Book of Ecclesiastes, this wise\nking gives us an enumeration of the things he had acquired, but which did not make him rich\ntoward God. All of such, he concluded, \"was vanity . . . and there was no profit under the\nsun\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21416\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21416)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21416)\">Eccl. 2:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI heard an impressive testimony of a college student in a sacrament meeting in my ward. He\nhad been warned not to take a certain course at the university because it had threatened to\ndestroy the faith of previous students who had taken this course. He determined to take the\ncourse, and he determined also that he would not lose his faith. This was his testimony as to\nhow he sidestepped this hazard: He kept active in the Church. He continued to pray. He kept\nhimself clean. In a word, he kept himself rich toward God.\n<\/p><p>\nThen he bore testimony that these university courses did cause one to doubt; and if these\ndoubts were aggravated by inactivity, the result could mean the loss of faith and possibly his\nstanding in the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nWill you remember the great experience of Peter, the ranking member of the Twelve, whose\nloyalty to the Master seemed to have exceeded his courage when, in the face of physical\nhazard, he denied the Master thrice on the night of the betrayal? Compare this fear-torn Peter\nwith the boldness he manifested shortly thereafter, before those same religious bigots who had\nso recently demanded the death of Jesus. He denounced them as murderers and called them to\nrepentance, suffered imprisonment, and later went fearlessly to his own martyrdom.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat was it that had changed him? He had been a personal witness to the change that came\nto the broken, pain-racked body taken from the cross, unto a glorified, resurrected body that\ncould pass thereafter unhindered through walls of mortar and stone, that could eat broiled fish\nand honeycomb (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31703\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31703)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31703)\">Luke 24:42<\/a><\/span>), that could appear and disappear suddenly from the sight of mortals. The\nplain and simple answer is that Peter was a changed man because he now knew the power of\nthe risen Lord. No more would he be alone on the shores of Galilee, or in prison, or in death.\nHis Lord would be near him.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Let virtue garnish thy thoughts\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThere is the Lord's promise if we live worthily before him: \". . . let virtue garnish thy\nthoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the\ndoctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The Holy Ghost shall be thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and\nthy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and\nthy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and with out compulsory means it shall flow\nunto thee forever and ever\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14877\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14877)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14877)\">D&amp;C 121:45-46<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod grant that each of us may so live that we may enjoy that communion with Deity through\nthe Holy Ghost, and know without doubt that he does live, and be prepared one day to enter\ninto his presence, I humbly pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
