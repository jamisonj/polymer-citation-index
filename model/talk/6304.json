One of them apparently used the word <span class=\"emphasis\">stupid.<\/span> Eight-year-old Nicholas, recently baptized, commented that perhaps one should not say that, as it was a \u201cbad word.\u201d It was evident that there had been some good influence from Mom and Dad. I know there had been similar discussions about other expressions. Now some might think that these are small matters compared to the far more foul and demeaning expressions all around us. Yet, in small and in great ways, our words are creating an atmosphere in which we build or demolish. I recently commented to a friend from New York City that I thought the atmosphere had improved markedly in the city over the past years and wondered why. He noted that his wife is a municipal judge, and they were enforcing the little things, like ordinances against spitting and jaywalking, and the big things were being affected thereby. So in our daily speech and acts of edification, the Lord said, we invite the spirit of truth and righteousness in which we \u201cmay chase darkness from among [us]\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21096\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21096)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21096)\">D&amp;C 50:25<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/the-tongue-of-angels.p9\" class=\"\">I recall when I was in a freshman English class and the professor was insisting that, to describe a situation, one of the students must substitute a crude expression for one gentler. I was jarred at an expression which I had seldom heard and never in harmonious circumstances. Years later in graduate school I had a conversation with a friend who argued that one should be, as he called it, direct, even if rude and insensitive to others\u2019 feelings. Unfortunately, the spirit animating these incidents has taken firm hold on society and is found even among the Saints. Over the years, there has been an increase in sexual innuendos, raucous humor, violent expressions, and great noise in talk, in music, in gestures. Much around us is crude and rude, with a corruption of moral behavior and sensitivity. Society has not been improved by our \u201clight speeches\u201d and our \u201clight-mindedness.\u201d Instead, our expressions have polluted our communities and corrupted our souls.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/the-tongue-of-angels.p10\" class=\"\">President Spencer W.
