Why are changes in that people occurring so dramatically? The title page of the record their ancestors gave to the world, entitled the Book of Mormon, indicates that the book was \u201cwritten to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the house of Israel.\u201d In the last chapter of the book, the prophet Moroni gives to the Lamanites farewell instructions, a portion of which contains the conditions on which individual testimonies of the truth may be obtained. The record is for all men, but from cover to cover the book is filled with prophecies concerning the Lamanites, indicating \u201cthat the promises of the Lord [would] be fulfilled, which he made to his people\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"17332\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17332)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17332)\">D&amp;C 3:18\u201319<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p9\" class=\"\">The promises were not exclusively given to the Lamanites but to all nations who would possess these lands.

Our living prophet has also said, \u201cIt is a people who \u2026 call for assistance from those who can push and lift and open doors.

Only in <span class=\"emphasis\">part<\/span> of the Lamanite world, in Latin America alone, there are over 600,000 members of the Church, with 7,000 baptized nearly every month; 181 stakes at present with almost 2,400 congregations of Saints and 2,500 Latin missionaries serving; thousands and thousands of priesthood holders\u2014Regional Representatives, mission presidents, patriarchs, bishops\u2014faithful sisters, and faithful children of a powerful generation yet to come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p15\" class=\"\">Yes, the descendants of Lehi have learned much from us, the Church in general, as we have established the Church among them.

Thanks belong to you who serve or have served in these countries, and to the parents who worried about you but sent you anyway, trusting in the Lord, and who found that their sons and daughters received far more in their service to this people than they were capable of giving.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p16\" class=\"\">They appreciate the fulfillment of these words of the Lord also: \u201cI will consecrate of the riches of those who embrace my gospel among the Gentiles unto the poor of my people who are of the house of Israel\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17399\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17399)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17399)\">D&amp;C 42:39<\/a><\/span>). Thanks belong to the thousands of you who have contributed generously and enabled the work to go forth. You have given much for which the Lord will bless you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p17\" class=\"\">You have also received much, as many of you have a personal debt to the Lamanites\u2019 forefathers for your own testimony obtained from their diligent record-keeping in the Book of Mormon. We are all blessed to participate with them in making latter-day history and assist in the fulfillment of prophecy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p18\" class=\"\">Now, what can the rest of the Church learn from this people? They would not have you think they are any better than anyone else. However, because of the prophetic nature of their role in the last days, because the Lord has pre-prepared their hearts, one is able to see the Lord\u2019s handiwork in their very lives and understand why they are so susceptible to the gospel. This very understanding ought to teach all of us much about the sacred conversion process. Their lives teach of the basics of the gospel\u2014godly traits\u2014traits that we could do well to emulate in our progress toward exaltation. Repayment of temporal resources to the Church may never be made by them. However, the additional spiritual insight obtained from them may well represent an overpayment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p19\" class=\"\">Their lives teach of simple truths like faith, confidence, trust in God. For example, a small village of Aymara Indians is converted within a matter of a few weeks\u2014the entire village. Missionaries learn through the gift of tongues to speak Spanish, Aymara, Quechua, and many other Indian dialects. Lamanite Saints accept in faith instructions to become self-sufficient when the vision of that concept in their world seems to be totally impossible. They believe anyway and are on their way to making that become reality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p20\" class=\"\">Their lives emanate the basics of the gospel, like repentance and love unfeigned. New leaders enter the Church from many kinds of worldly conditions but come forth cleansed and, in but \u201cmoments,\u201d stand tall as the Lord\u2019s leaders. They quickly learn by the Spirit that all can lead, even though many can\u2019t even read. A man who has not spoken for many years repents, is baptized, and speaks his first words as he leaves the baptismal font.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p21\" class=\"\">Their lives teach the simple truths of humility, meekness, teachableness. May I share another example? A Lamanite missionary baptizes eighteen souls in a matter of three weeks, where all last year none had been baptized. There are few problems with respect to teachableness among this people. They are teachable, meek, open in their hearts, and, in this respect, much like submissive children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p22\" class=\"\">When nonmembers are first taught gospel truths, with little or no difficulty they believe. They believe in the Savior of the world. They believe in prophets. It seems as though they always have. The premortal existence seems to be common knowledge. The Joseph Smith story is believable and reasonable. They are not the least bit astonished by the coming of angels. They truly do hearken unto the voice of the Good Shepherd and thus truly do come unto God (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"40478\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40478)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40478)\">Mosiah 26:21<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"17471\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17471)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17471)\">D&amp;C 84:47<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p23\" class=\"\">Their lives teach the basics of prayer, fasting, priesthood blessings. A sister unable to have children has a daughter, receiving that gift indirectly through a blessing given to her husband in which the promise was extended to her. A sick sister is raised at the very moment from her sick-bed by a priesthood blessing. The devil openly opposes the work and as needed is controlled by the priesthood. Servants of the Lord partake of food and water that is poison to them and receive no harm. A sister, as a young girl thousands of miles from her present home, is promised in a patriarchal blessing that one day General Authorities will be served at her humble table. Today she is married to a Lamanite stake president with the prophetic statement fulfilled.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p24\" class=\"\">Their lives emanate basic truths of kindness, long-suffering, and sacrifice. A man sells his only watch to purchase gasoline for his car so that he might find a man the Brethren desire to interview. A leader who struggles for years to own a car sells it that he might take his family to the temple. Men, women, and children give rings, watches, corn, grain, animals, and even the gold from their teeth that they may show the Lord their desire to help him raise up in their lands a temple to the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p25\" class=\"\">Even though the Spirit has manifested itself in the lives of these people in many miraculous ways, the common way\u2014the most effective way\u2014continues to be by the still small voice simply going forth, converting them \u201cin their inward parts\u201d by the thousands (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"125215\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125215)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125215)\">Jer. 31:33<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p26\" class=\"\">These are the children of Lehi, the children of the prophets, great in many respects but blessed, as are all the children of God, according to their righteousness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p27\" class=\"\">None of us would ever boast in our own strength nor in our own wisdom, but as Ammon said about the Lamanites:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p28\" class=\"\">\u201c[Our] joy is full \u2026 and [we] will rejoice in [our] God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p29\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 For in his strength [we] can do all things; \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/miracles-among-the-lamanites.p30\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 Behold, who can glory too much in the Lord?
