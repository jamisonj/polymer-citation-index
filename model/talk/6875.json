I reflect on that meeting with a few present in the Peter Whitmer farmhouse on the 6th of April 1830. Here the Church was organized, and here began the long march which has brought it to its present stature.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-state-of-the-church.p7\" class=\"\">Our people have passed through oppression and persecution; they have suffered drivings and every imaginable evil.

We have such in every state of Mexico, in every nation of Central America, and throughout the nations of South America. We have strong congregations in Australia and New Zealand and the isles of the Pacific. We are well established in the nations of the Orient.

They were from various nations across the earth, from Mongolia to Madagascar. They were clean and bright and enthusiastic. They bespoke love for the Church, for their mission president, for their companions. What a marvelous thing is this unique and tremendous program of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-state-of-the-church.p27\" class=\"\">Likewise other programs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-state-of-the-church.p28\" class=\"\">We recently were applauded in the public press for giving three million dollars to vaccinate children against measles in Africa. This money did not come from tithing. It came from contributions of the faithful to the humanitarian work of the Church. We have joined the American Red Cross, the United Nations Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the World Health Organization, and the Pan American Health Organization in an effort to immunize 200 million children and prevent 1.2 million deaths from measles over the next five years. Our contribution alone will provide vaccine for three million children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-state-of-the-church.p29\" class=\"\">What a marvelous and wonderful thing that is. And so it is with each of our humanitarian programs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-state-of-the-church.p30\" class=\"\">One more item.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-state-of-the-church.p31\" class=\"\">In March 2001, we announced that the Church was establishing a plan to assist our returned missionaries and other young adults in gaining education and training leading to better employment opportunities in countries with less abundance and fewer opportunities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-state-of-the-church.p32\" class=\"\">We invited those who wished to help in this plan to contribute to a fund called the Perpetual Education Fund, patterned after the 19th-century Perpetual Emigration Fund. I offer a brief report on what is happening with that plan.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-state-of-the-church.p33\" class=\"\">Because of your generous contributions, we have been able to keep current with the growing need for loans. To date the Church has granted about 10,000 loans to young men and women in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and other areas of the Church. These young people have committed to repay their loans so that others may enjoy the same opportunities they are experiencing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-state-of-the-church.p34\" class=\"\">Many have graduated and are experiencing the benefits of their training. To date about 600 young men and women have completed their training. The majority of these have found good employment. Many more will graduate and enter the workforce in their own communities in the months ahead. They will make their mark in the world, rear families, and serve the Church. Many are already achieving these objectives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-state-of-the-church.p35\" class=\"\">For example, Patrick was the first Perpetual Education Fund student to complete school in Jamaica. His basic training in management earned him a well-paying job at the national airport, with a promising future. Repayment of his loan began immediately.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-state-of-the-church.p36\" class=\"\">Flavia, a sister from a poorer part of South America, found little opportunity and means for training and regular employment until help came through the PEF to receive training in operating computers. With the help of LDS Employment Services, she found work in a good company after completing her training. She reports: \u201cToday I am responsible for the financial consulting area of one of the largest hospitals in Recife using [a sophisticated] computer system. I was among the crew that implemented this financial system in the company.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-state-of-the-church.p37\" class=\"\">These examples could be multiplied. We are happy to report that the plan is working well and gradually expanding as we gain experience. Early reports of loan repayments are encouraging. Again, we thank you for your generosity, interest, and prayers in behalf of the Perpetual Education Fund.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/the-state-of-the-church.p38\" class=\"\">It was said that at one time the sun never set on the British Empire.
