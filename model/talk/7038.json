The Apostle Paul wrote that when he was a child he understood as a child, but when he became a man he put away such things (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43758\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43758)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43758)\">1 Cor. 13:11<\/a><\/span>).

Along the road there are many signs that beckon. Satan is the author of some of these invitations. He seeks to confuse and deceive us, to get us on a low road that leads away from our eternal destination.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/be-not-deceived.p9\" class=\"\">In the beginning, when a powerful spirit was cast down for rebellion, \u201che became Satan, \u2026 the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44039\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44039)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44039)\">Moses 4:4<\/a><\/span>). He and the spirits who follow him are still deceiving the world. Modern revelation declares that \u201cSatan hath sought to deceive you, that he might overthrow you\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43947\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43947)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43947)\">D&amp;C 50:2\u20133<\/a><\/span>). Satan\u2019s methods of deception are enticing: music, movies and other media, and the glitter of a good time. When Satan\u2019s lies succeed in deceiving us, we become vulnerable to his power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/be-not-deceived.p10\" class=\"\">Here are some ways the devil will try to deceive us. God\u2019s commandments and the teachings of His prophets warn against each of them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/be-not-deceived.p11\" class=\"\">1. One kind of deception seeks to mislead us about whom we should follow. In speaking of the last days, the Savior taught: \u201cTake heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43698\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43698)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43698)\">Matt. 24:4\u20135<\/a><\/span>). In other words, many will seek to deceive us by saying that they or their teachings will save us, so there is no need for a Savior or His gospel. The Book of Mormon describes this as \u201cthe power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people \u2026 to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43883\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43883)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43883)\">3 Ne. 2:2<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/be-not-deceived.p12\" class=\"\">2. Satan also seeks to deceive us about right and wrong and persuade us that there is no such thing as sin. This detour typically starts off with what seems to be only a small departure: \u201cJust try it once. One beer or one cigarette or one porno movie won\u2019t hurt.\u201d What all of these departures have in common is that each of them is addictive. Addiction is a condition in which we surrender part of our power of choice. When we do that we give the devil power over us. The prophet Nephi described where this leads: the devil says, \u201cThere is no hell,\u201d and, \u201cI am no devil, for there is none\u2014and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43809\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43809)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43809)\">2 Ne. 28:22<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/be-not-deceived.p13\" class=\"\">If we choose the wrong road, we choose the wrong destination. For example, a friend of many years told me that her husband, always a \u201cgood kid\u201d in high school, took a few drinks he thought would help him forget some problems. Before he knew what was happening, he was addicted. Now he is not able to support his family, and he is ineffective at almost everything he tries to do. Alcohol governs his life, and he cannot seem to break free of its grip.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/be-not-deceived.p14\" class=\"\">3. The prophet Nephi warns against another kind of deception: \u201cAnd others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well\u2014and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43808\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43808)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43808)\">2 Ne. 28:21<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/be-not-deceived.p15\" class=\"\">Those who fall for this deception may profess to believe in God, but they do not take His commandments or His justice seriously.
