As we align our manner with the Holy Ghost\u2019s manner, then the Holy Ghost can teach and testify without restraint. This important alignment may be illustrated by the following example.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/teaching-after-the-manner-of-the-spirit.p11\" class=\"\">Many years ago my children and I hiked to the top of South Sister, a 10,358-foot (3,157 m) mountain in Oregon. After several hours we encountered a long 45-degree slope of tiny volcanic pebbles. With the summit in sight, we pressed on only to find that with every step, our feet would sink in the pebbles, causing us to slide backward several inches. My 12-year-old son forged ahead as I stayed with my 8-year-old daughter. Fatigue and discouragement soon set in, and she was heartbroken, thinking that she might not join her brother at the top. My first impulse was to carry her. My spirit was willing, but sadly my flesh was weak. We sat down on the rocks, assessed our situation, and devised a new plan. I told her to put her hands in my back pants pockets, hold on tight, and\u2014most important\u2014as soon as I lifted my foot to take a step, she should quickly put her foot in its place. She mirrored my every move and relied on the lift that came from hanging on to my pockets. After what seemed like an eternity, we made it to the top of the mountain. Her expression of triumph and satisfaction was priceless. And yes, she and her brother were, in my estimation, <span class=\"emphasis\">real<\/span> hikers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/teaching-after-the-manner-of-the-spirit.p12\" class=\"\">My daughter\u2019s success was a result of her diligent effort and how well she hiked <span class=\"emphasis\">after the manner<\/span> that I hiked. As she synchronized her movement with mine, we achieved a rhythm together, allowing me to utilize my full energy. Such is the case when we teach \u201cafter the manner of the workings of the Spirit.\u201d As we align the manner of our teaching to match that of the Holy Ghost, the Spirit strengthens us and, at the same time, is not constrained. With this in mind, please consider two fundamental \u201cworkings of the Spirit\u201d worthy of our emulation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/teaching-after-the-manner-of-the-spirit.p13\" class=\"\">First, the Holy Ghost teaches individuals in a very personal way.
