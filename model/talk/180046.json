Circumstances always did more or less to alter the condition of the people. Some, by virtue of their Priesthood have officiated, without being set apart, in certain callings that pertain to those who should be selected and set apart for that purpose. Let me here say, for the benefit of those who have not studied the Doctrine and Covenants of the Church, that if we have literal descendants of Aaron, they have the birthright, through their obedience to the Gospel of the Son of God, to the bishopric, which pertains to the lesser Priesthood.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"90161\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 90161)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(90161)\">D&amp;C 107:15-17<\/a><\/span> It is the presiding authority over the lesser Priesthood; they have the right to claim it, and to all the keys and powers pertaining to it, they have the right to be ordained and set apart to that calling and to officiate therein, and that too without the aid of two counselors.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"90359\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 90359)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(90359)\">D&amp;C 107:69-76<\/a><\/span> <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"364b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD18\/JoD18_0364.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;364b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/6777\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> That is what we are taught in modern revelation.

And no doubt those few who are acting in the Bishopric without being ordained will receive their ordination, and there may be many changes, in order to introduce, in all its perfection, as far as we have knowledge and understanding, a more perfect organization throughout the Church in these mountains. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n1286\"> The object of this perfect organization is that we may be entitled to greater blessings therefrom; that we may be entitled to a greater fullness of the Holy Spirit; that everything may be dictated according to the mind and will of God, not only in spiritual things, but also in regard to our temporal matters; and also that every person may know his place, that his duties may be assigned to him, and by knowing what is required, that all may the more diligently seek after the Holy Ghost to direct them in their positions and callings, and have more faith, more assurance before God, to obtain confidence before the heavens, and before the brethren, in order that their ministry may benefit the people. You are well aware that we have been taught, for these many years, the great necessity of establishing a union in the midst of this people. Although we are the most united people upon the face of the earth, of which we have any knowledge, yet we are far from that perfection of unity which should characterize the Saints of the Most High God. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n1287\"> I can see, in this order which the President has laid before us, a beauty, <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"365b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD18\/JoD18_0365.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;365b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/6776\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> a consistency, a plan which the Lord has revealed that will entitle the Latter-day Saints to greater blessings and privileges through which that union will be brought about which we have so long desired in our hearts. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n1288\"> We preach and declare to all people that God has raised up a kingdom to prepare the way before the coming of Christ. We declare to all men, wherever our missionaries go, that this is the grand preparation for the coming of our Lord and Savior to reign on the earth. When he does come, that part of the prayer which he taught us to utter will be fulfilled, namely, &#x201C;Thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"63397\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 63397)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(63397)\">Matt. 6:10<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"67480\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 67480)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(67480)\">Luke 11:2<\/a><\/span> Were we permitted to have the veil removed, according to the hymn just sung, namely that &#x201C;the veil should be rent in twain,&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"66381\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 66381)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(66381)\">Matt. 27:51<\/a><\/span> and were we to behold the order that exists in yonder heavens in the midst of celestial hosts, we should there see a perfect union&#x2014;no dissensions, no bitterness of feeling, no difference of ideas or opinion in regard to their duties, but all understanding as one, and all moving as one body to fulfill and accomplish the purposes of Jehovah. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n1289\"> Now, his will must be done on the earth as is done in heaven,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"63398\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 63398)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(63398)\">Matt. 6:10<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"67479\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 67479)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(67479)\">Luke 11:2<\/a><\/span> in order that that prayer which has been offered up by his people ever since it was revealed, may be fulfilled to the very letter.
