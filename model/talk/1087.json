Moyle, <i>Conference Report<\/i> October 1960, pp. 19-23<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nPresident Clark called during the noon recess and wanted you all to know how much he\nappreciated the inspired message of President McKay delivered at the beginning of the\nmorning session, and how much he regretted not being present with us here today. He wanted\nme to extend his greeting to you all, and I am sure that he would appreciate our united faith\nand prayers in his behalf that he might yet meet with us before the conference is over, in\nkeeping with his innermost desires.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a great privilege, my brethren and sisters, to be with you this afternoon and to have this\nwonderful opportunity of bearing witness to the truths of the gospel. There is one thing in the\nworld today above all else which people are seeking after, and that is peace.\n<\/p><p>\nThe fundamental purpose of the organization of the Church is to establish peace upon the\nearth.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay recently told us that, \"peace is the exemption from individual troubles, from\nfamily brawls, from national difficulties. Peace does not come to the transgressor of law.\nPeace comes by obedience to law&mdash;peace to the individual that he may be at peace with God,\nat peace in the home, and in the neighborhood. The spirit of the world is antagonistic to the\nestablishment of peace. The law of nature seems to be the survival of the fittest at all costs.\nBut peace can come into the world only through obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ.\"\nSeek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35021\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35021)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35021)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>). His teaching regarding arbitration as a\nmeans of settling difficulties, if applied by nations, would do away with war.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The gospel is a complete way of life, and the true plan of life brings joy and peace,\" says\nPresident McKay. Fundamental to the doctrines of the Church is the declaration of Father\nLehi:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3639\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3639)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3639)\">2 Ne. 2:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe present teachings of our President are not the development of a philosophy by the\nwisdom of men that changes with time and experience. They do not result from the trial and\nerror of improvement. They are not discovered as the result of laboratory experiments on the\none hand or study of the past, present, or future on the other hand. They are eternal truths\ntaught to the children of men by the prophets of God, ancient and modern. The truths of the\ngospel are unchangeable. They are infallible. The Savior of mankind&mdash;our Redeemer, the Son\nof the Living God, the Lord of lords and King of kings, who rules and reigns over this\nuniverse, brought peace to this earth as he dwelt among the children of men in the flesh. He\nis the man of peace. He came with a promise: \"Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be\ncalled the children of God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35012\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35012)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35012)\">Matt. 5:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nExcept with peace in our hearts we cannot be the children of God. This follows just as\ncertainly as do all the promises given us by our Master in his Sermon on the Mount. Surely\nwe cannot expect to see God if we are not pure in heart\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35011\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35011)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35011)\">Matt. 5:8<\/a><\/span>). We bear witness to the world by\nvirtue of the power and authority of the Holy Priesthood of God which we bear that the\nwords of his mouth contained in the sacred Beatitudes were not platitudes or trite sayings to\ncatch the ear of man, spoken by a humanitarian, but on the contrary, they are the words of\nGod spoken by his Son Jesus Christ, upon which all the children of men can place their trust\nunfalteringly and conform their lives, their thoughts and actions, to\nmerit in this life and in the life to come all the blessings promised those who are faithful and\nobedient to his teachings&mdash;not only the Sermon on the Mount, but all that he taught during\nhis ministry here upon this earth as he sojourned among men, and all that the has revealed to\nhis prophets to the present time. John, in his Gospel, says: \"These things I have spoken unto\nyou,\" [quoting the Savior] \"that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have\ntribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27933\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27933)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27933)\">John 16:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPaul said: \"... let the peace of God rule in your hearts\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10505\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10505)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10505)\">Col. 3:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nUnfortunately, many in the world, both individuals and nations, will ignore the teachings of\nChrist and deny his divinity. With two powers upon earth exerting their influence upon\nmankind this result is inevitable. They, through their own conduct, their own choice, do not\nqualify for the enjoyment of peace, and peace will not be theirs.\n<\/p><p>\nThe history of the world has already altogether too clearly demonstrated that the farther we\ndepart from the gospel of Jesus Christ, the greater is the distress and tribulation under which\nwe live.\n<\/p><p>\nShould those who keep the commandments of God have any fear for their own security and\nhappiness? This is an interesting question, and this again has been answered so often in the\nrecent ministry of President David O. McKay. He assures us that we need have no worry. We\nwill never be left in the dark, and we should have no concern other than to follow the\nleadership God has given us here upon the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are the children of promise (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23258\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23258)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23258)\">Gal. 4:28<\/a><\/span>) as long as\nwe keep the commandments of God. I have no doubt it will take continuous effort, however,\nupon our part. These are not blessings which will flow to us automatically merely because we\nask for them. We will be justified, however, if we follow all that God reveals through his\nservants, the prophets. We have been given direction, sometimes thought of as temporal in its\nnature, such as tithing, fast offerings, the welfare program, the Word of Wisdom, chastity,\nobedience to the law of the land, and others. Whatever their temporal aspect may be, they are\ngiven to us to build us up spiritually. We can draw no hard and fast line between temporal\nand spiritual. All that is good is spiritual.\n<\/p><p>\nSo we can well afford to ask ourselves the question: Can we expect the blessings of peace if\nwe ignore the Word of Wisdom, for example? Will we be prepared to take advantage of the\nways and means our Father in heaven may make available for us to retain our peace in times\nof great emergency, indeed at all times, if we are not physically fit? I have no doubt God will\nrequire us to be sound in mind and body to carry on the work of his priesthood at home and\nabroad, at least as far as we by our own efforts can retain our bodily and spiritual health and\nstrength. We cannot be justified in destroying ourselves through our disobedience, no matter\nhow limited our conduct in this direction may be.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is an inspiration to me, and I hope it will be to you, to reflect for a moment upon the\nteachings we have received through our inspired prophets in these latter days. Though times\nhave changed, and conditions in the world are different, neither the hearts of men nor the\nrevelations of God to his people through his prophets have changed. We read in the Holy\nBible:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the\nprophets\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10415\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10415)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10415)\">Amos 3:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI know by the testimony of the Holy Ghost that is in me that this declaration of Amos is\nliterally true in the ministry of President David O. McKay as it was in the life of Joseph\nSmith and those who followed the first Prophet in these latter-days in this high and holy\noffice. \"It is out of the abundance of the heart that man speaketh,\" said Brigham Young, \"and\nthe man who tells you words of life is the man who can save you.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhat Joseph Smith said in 1844 in principle is largely applicable today, although our\nproblems are somewhat different and the remedy prescribed unique to the solution of the\nspecific problem that then confronted the nation. The nation did not accept his solution, which\nwas inspired of God. Had his direction been given to the problem, we all know what the\nresult would have been&mdash;no bloodshed. Both the Civil War and its\naftermath, with us even now, and the economic loss of both would have been avoided. What\nhappened to those who followed his leadership and direction? Even though the Prophet Joseph\nwas martyred, two months after this solution to our national ills was publicly given, the Saints\nwere driven from their peaceful homes in the states to a haven of safety in the fastness of this\nmountain region. That is where they were when the Civil War began.\n<\/p><p>\nCertainly God works in a mysterious way, his wonders to perform. Who would have ever\nthought among the inhabitants of Nauvoo in the days of the final persecution that they were\nbeing driven from their homes by their enemies against their will and against their better\njudgment, only to wake up one day and find that the Lord had preserved them in a land of\npeace, even in the midst of the greatest of all civil wars. Who doubts that the Lord can do\nwhat he pleases with his people today?\n<\/p><p>\nI have implicit faith in the words of the Prophet when he tells us today that all we need to\nworry about is to keep the commandments of God, and peace will be ours. We do not know\nwhen or where or what exactly may happen. It is therefore foolish and impossible to\nconjecture on the nature of the relief or protection or security designed for the future\naccomplishment of God's purpose.\n<\/p><p>\nThis, however, we do know: that God lives and in him we can trust, and through our\nobedience are now free from fear or doubt or insecurity, and shall remain so always, as long\nas we retain the right through our faithfulness to call upon him for the blessings which he has\npromised the faithful.\n<\/p><p>\nI conceive of peace as something which we might all enjoy, even in the midst of future wars.\nWe may suffer trials and tribulations. We may suffer from the loss of our loved ones, but let\nus stop for a moment and call just two instances to mind. I think of the Prophet Joseph that\nnight after he had left Nauvoo with some of his close brethren and crossed over to the other\nside of the river to Montrose, and there the question was should he go on, or should he go\nback? It was during these days that the Prophet said that he was devoid of offense toward any\nman, and that he would be taken as a lamb to the slaughter\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13948\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13948)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13948)\">D&amp;C 135:4<\/a><\/span>), but does anybody have any doubt\nin his mind but that the peace of God was in his heart and in his soul and gave him the\nstrength and the courage and the power of his priesthood to fulfil his mission here upon the\nearth as God might decree?\n<\/p><p>\nThe other great example, of course, supersedes all else in human knowledge and\nunderstanding, and that is the intercessory prayer of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as he\nprayed to his Father in heaven in the Garden of Gethsemane. But there was peace in his heart\nwhen he said, \"Nevertheless, Father, thy will, not mine, be done\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31534\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31534)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31534)\">Luke 22:42<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow that peace can come into our hearts, no matter what the circumstances may be, and no\nmatter what process or what circumstance the Lord may use to bring his faithful people the\npeace which he has promised them. I have an abiding conviction that if that peace is given to\nus and we are called upon to lose our lives or the lives of our loved ones, that we will have\nthe absolute assurance, as did the Prophet Joseph, that we would die in the Lord, and when\nwe die in the Lord we have fulfilled the will of the Master here upon this earth, to his\npleasure and to his satisfaction, and more can be gained by none of us.\n<\/p><p>\nNo greater power can exist upon the earth than the power of the priesthood&mdash;a gift of God to\nus&mdash;calling upon us to exercise our power as elders in Israel to bring all nations which permit\nus within their borders to a knowledge of the truth; to draw out those nations, not necessarily\nphysically, but into these stakes of Zion which are being and will continue to be organized in\nthe various countries of the world. These men and women through their faith, conversion, and\ntheir faithfulness will join with us as recipients of these greatest of all blessings which the\nLord has in store for his chosen people. So, neither they nor we need to worry about our\nsecurity when we know that our welfare will be taken care of directly from the throne of God\non High.\n<\/p><p>\nI first quoted from President David O. McKay's teachings of a short time ago, and now\nI want to just quote a word or two from the other Presidents of the Church to show how\nuniform the Lord has revealed his will to his prophets in these latter days.\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph Smith said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Make honor the standard with all men. Be sure that good is rendered for evil in all cases;\nand the whole nation, like a kingdom of kings and priests, will rise up in righteousness, and\nbe respected as wise and worthy on earth, and as just and holy for heaven, by Jehovah, the\nAuthor of perfection.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBrigham Young said: \"Great peace have they who love the law of the Lord and abide in his\ncommandments. Our belief will bring peace to all men and good will to all the inhabitants of\nthe earth. It will induce all who sincerely follow its dictates to cultivate righteousness and\npeace; to live peaceably in their families; to praise the Lord morning and evening; to pray\nwith their families, and will so fill them with the spirit of peace that they will never condemn\nor chasten any one unless it is well deserved\" (Brigham Young, <i>Discourses<\/i>, pp. 223, 449).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is interesting to see what John Taylor in his day said: \"This peace is the gift of God alone,\nand it can be received only from him by obedience to his laws. If any man wishes to\nintroduce peace into his family or among his friends, let him cultivate it in his own bosom;\nfor sterling peace can only be had according to the legitimate rule and authority of heaven and\nobedience to its laws\" (John Taylor, <i>The Gospel Kingdom<\/i>, page 319).\n<\/p><p>\nWilford Woodruff said: \"Put your trust in God and rely on his promises, living up to the light\nand knowledge you possess; and all will be well with you whether living or dying\"\n(<i>Discourses of Wilford Woodruff<\/i>, p. 260).\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Lorenzo Snow, from a document published in the Deseret News of Jan. 1, 1901:\n<\/p><p>\n\"A new century dawns upon the world today. The hundred years just completed were the\nmost momentous in the history of man upon this planet. It would be impossible to make even\na brief summary of the notable events, the marvelous developments, the grand achievements,\nand the beneficial inventions and discoveries, which mark the progress of ten decades now left\nbehind in the ceaseless march of humanity. The very mention of the nineteenth century\nsuggests advancement, improvement, liberty, and light. Happy are we to have lived amidst its\nwonders and shared in the richness of its treasures of intelligence.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The lessons of the past century should have prepared us for the duties and glories of the\nopening era. It ought to be the age of peace, of greater progress, of the universal adoption of\nthe golden rule. Barbarism of the past should be buried. War with its horrors should be but a\nmemory. The aim of nations should be fraternity and mutual greatness. The welfare of\nhumanity should be studied instead of the enrichment of a race or the extension of an empire.\nAwake, ye monarchs of the earth and rulers among nations and gaze upon the scene on which\nthe early rays of the rising millennial day gild the morning of the twentieth century!\n<\/p><p>\n\"The power is in your hands to pave the way for the coming of the King of kings, whose\ndominion will be over all the earth. Disband your armies; turn your weapons of strife into\nimplements of industry; take the yoke from the necks of the people; arbitrate your disputes;\nmeet in royal congress and plan for union instead of conquest, for the banishment of poverty,\nfor the uplifting of the masses, and for the health, wealth, enlightenment, and happiness of all\ntribes and peoples and nations. Then shall the twentieth century be to you the glory of your\nlives and the luster of your crowns, and posterity will sing your praises, while the Eternal One\nshall place you on high among the mighty . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"In the eighty-seventh year of my age on earth, I am full of earnest desire for the benefit of\nhumanity. I wish all a Happy New Year . . .\nMay justice triumph and corruption be stamped out. And may virtue, chastity, and honor\nprevail, until evil shall be overcome and the earth shall be cleansed from wickedness. Let\nthese sentiments, as the voice of the 'Mormons' in the mountains of Utah, go forth to the\nwhole world, and let all people know that our wish and our mission\nare for the blessing and salvation of the entire human race.\n<\/p><p>\n\"May the twentieth century prove the happiest, as it will be the grandest, for all the ages of\ntime, and may God be glorified in the victory that is coming over sin, sorrow, misery, and\ndeath. Peace be unto you all.\"\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph F. Smith said: \"There is only one thing that can bring peace into the world. It is the\nadoption of the gospel of Jesus Christ, rightly understood, obeyed and practiced by rulers and\npeople alike\" (Joseph F. Smith, <i>Gospel Doctrine<\/i>, 1928 ed., page 529). I love such words of\nscripture.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd President Grant said: \"This gospel of Jesus Christ which the world says is a delusion, a\nsnare, and a fraud, [yet] to each and every man who goes out to proclaim it, and who lives an\nupright and virtuous life, it brings peace, it brings joy, it brings happiness unspeakable.\"\n(Heber J. Grant, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1911, page 22.)\n<\/p><p>\nAt the October conference of 1921 President Grant presented a \"Peace Resolution,\"\nrepresenting the Church as favoring world peace, and invoking blessings and \"divine guidance\nof the International Conference of the Limitations of Armaments, that the cause of Peace may\nbe thereby enhanced, and an amelioration of the burdens of mankind secured.\"\n<\/p><p>\nPresident George Albert Smith once prayed: \"And, O Father, in the midst of confusion that is\neverywhere, and uncertainty, bless us in America, that we may repent of our foolishness, our\nlight-mindedness and our wrongdoing, realizing as we should, that all the blessings that are\nworthwhile come to us only as a result of honoring thee and keeping thy commandments. The\npathway of righteousness is the highway of peace and happiness.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then finally, to end, I come back to where I began, to the words of President McKay:\n\"The Need of Peace: The greatest need of this old world today is peace. The turbulent storms\nof hate, enmity, of distrust, and of sin are threatening to wreck humanity. It is time for\nmen&mdash;true men&mdash;to dedicate their lives to God, and to cry with the spirit and power of the\nChrist, 'Peace, be still' (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33123\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33123)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33123)\">Mark 4:39<\/a><\/span>).\nOnly in the complete surrender of our inner life may we rise above\nthe selfish, sordid pull of nature.

I cannot imagine peace in a\nworld from which God and religion are banished.\"\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us brethren and sisters, that we may follow the admonition and counsel of these\ngreat leaders who have preceded us and listen intently and sincerely to the words of our\npresent leader, that our lives may be sweet in its enjoyment, I pray humbly in the name of the\nLord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
