Grant. I call this to your attention because I have great\nappreciation for that wonderful man, for the remarkable influence he had upon my life,\nparticularly in my younger years.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was President Grant who gave to me my first real introduction to the Book of Mormon.\nWhen I was about ten years of age, he came to the ward in which I lived and spoke in one of\nour Sacrament meetings. As he has done on other occasions, that day he told of his own first\nreading of the Book of Mormon and of the great impression made upon him by the life of\nNephi. In his address he made Nephi such a reality to me that I had a desire to read about\nhim for myself.\n<\/p><p>\nI took my father's Book of Mormon, and I read the story of Nephi, having in mind what\nPresident Grant had said. As I read, not only did I learn to appreciate that great prophet of\nold, but I had come into my soul also a deep love for the Book of Mormon, even as a boy.\n<\/p><p>\nYou will remember another address that President Grant gave, sometimes repeating, pertaining\nto the Book of Mormon. I would like to read to you an excerpt from that address. Said\nPresident Grant: \"When I was a young unmarried man, another young man who had received\na doctor's degree ridiculed me for believing in the Book of Mormon. He said he could point\nout two lies in that book. One was that the people had built their homes out of cement, and\nthey were very skilful in the use of cement\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24684\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24684)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24684)\">Hel. 3:7<\/a><\/span>). He said there had never been found and never\nwould be found, a house built of cement by the ancient inhabitants of this country, because\nthe people in that early age knew nothing about cement. He said that should be enough to\nmake one disbelieve the book. I said: 'That does not affect my faith one particle. I read the Book\nof Mormon prayerfully and supplicated God for a testimony in my heart and soul of the\ndivinity of it, and I have accepted it and believe it with all my heart.' I also said to him, 'If\nmy children do not find cement houses, I expect that my grandchildren will.' Now, since that\ntime, houses made of cement and massive structures of the same material have been\nuncovered.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Not very far from the City of Mexico there is a monument two hundred and ten feet high,\nbuilt of cement . . . My first counselor [Anthony W. Ivins] has stood on that  monument. You\ncould put forty tabernacles like this one inside of it. It covers more\nthan ten acres of ground and is two and a half times higher than this building. From the top\nof that monument one can see small mounds, and as these mounds are being uncovered, they\nare found to be wonderfully built cement houses, with drain pipes of cement, showing skill\nand ability, superior almost to anything we have today so far as the use of cement is\nconcerned.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Another statement that this doctor made,\" continued President Grant, \"was this: that the voice\nof man can only carry a few hundred feet, and yet the Book of Mormon teaches that . . . Jesus\nChrist . . . spoke to the people and his voice was heard all over the land\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5572\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5572)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5572)\">3 Ne. 9:1<\/a><\/span>). 'That is a lie,' said he,\n'and you know it.' I said, 'That is no lie at all. Jesus Christ, under God, was the Creator of\nthis earth, and if he had the power and ability to create the earth I believe that he could\narrange for his voice to carry all over the world at one and the same time.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"The radio is doing what?\" asks President Grant. \"I read the other day that a song had been\nheard nine thousand miles away, not only every word of it, but every note . . . We had four\nletters from New Zealand or Australia, I have forgotten which, to the effect that people there\nhad heard perfectly the programs that had been broadcast over the radio. In that program the\nannouncement was made that if anybody in a foreign land who heard the program would so\nindicate there would be sent to him a pound box of candy, and four people wrote for the boxes\nof candy. It takes the sun eighteen and one half hours to travel that far (with reference to the\nrotation of the earth), yet the voice carried that distance as quickly as you can snap your\nfinger.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I said to this man,\" continued President Grant, 'the voice of the Savior could go all\nover the world if he so arranged it.' The radio has proved what I said.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Faith is a gift of God, and I thank God for the faith in and the knowledge of the divinity of\nthe Book of Mormon which I had in my youthful days, and that these two alleged scientific\nfacts, which are now known to be fallacies, did not destroy my faith\" (<i>Conference Report<\/i>,\nApril, 1929:128-130).\n<\/p><p>\nThis was very interesting to me because I had an experience similar to it. When I was a\nyoung missionary, I came to a professional man and his wife and told them the story of the\ncoming forth of the Book of Mormon, and of its having been translated by Joseph Smith\nthrough the power of God from a set of gold plates. This professional man laughed at me and\nridiculed the idea that gold plates were ever used as records of the past. \"Why,\" he said, \"I\nhave specialized in ancient history, and I know from all my reading there is not one single\ninstance in all of the textbooks where it says that ancient records were inscribed upon gold\nplates.\" He said, \"If you know anything at all about ancient history, you know that clay tablets\nwere used, and that papyrus was used, but never is there a mention of gold plates.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI was a student at school when I was called on my mission, and I had read some little bit in\nancient history. I remembered that there was not any mention in my textbooks, either, about\ngold plates, although much had been said about the clay tablets. So I had no scholastic answer\nfor this man. But as I stood before him, I remembered President Grant and his testimony that\nI heard as a ten-year-old boy, and then as I later heard, this declaration that he made which I\nhave read to you.\n<\/p><p>\nIn my simplicity I bore testimony to this learned man that although I knew little about the\nhistory of the past, and I had no scholastic material to present to him about the gold plates,\nGod had given me a testimony that indeed Joseph Smith did have gold plates, and that from\nthem the Book of Mormon was translated, and that I knew it was true.\n<\/p><p>\nI used to think a lot about that conversation and wondered about the historians, and why they\nhad said nothing about gold plates. It did not disturb me, however.\n<\/p><p>\nBut how different are things today! History is no longer silent about the gold plates.\nHistorians not only are vocal, but they are also eloquent in announcing to the world that many\nsets of plates of precious metal have been found containing many records of the past engraved\non their pages by skilful men who knew how to write on plates of\nmetal. Archaeologists have found gold plates and silver plates, copper plates and brass plates\nand bronze plates. They have found big plates and little plates, thick plates and thin plates.\nSome of them were found separately and singly, and others had been brought together in book\nform&mdash;many with pages of gold and silver as thin as modern paper, many of them skillfully\nand beautifully engraved with the record of the civilizations of the past.\n<\/p><p>\nQuite as interesting to me as the discovery that there have been many other plates was the\nmanner in which these plates were found. Under the stones of the palace of the Chaldean\nmonarch, Sargon, was found a set of plates, some of gold and some of silver, and do you\nknow how they were deposited? They were placed in a box made of stone carefully put\ntogether and buried in the ground. In Iran have been found some plates of King Darius, dating\nback to 518 BC. They were gold and silver also, and beautifully engraved. And how had they\nbeen preserved? By having been placed in a carefully made box of stone and buried in the\nground.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I read these things, my mind went quickly back to the description of Joseph Smith,\npertaining to the manner in which the Book of Mormon plates had been preserved, for Joseph\nSmith wrote:\n<\/p><p>\nConvenient to the village of Manchester, Ontario county, New York, stands a hill\nof considerable size, and the most elevated of any in the neighborhood. On the\nwest side of this hill, not far from the top, under a stone of considerable size, lay\nthe plates, deposited in a stone box. This stone was thick and rounding in the\nmiddle on the upper side, and thinner towards the edges, so that the middle part\nof it was visible above the ground, but the edge all around was covered with earth.\n<\/p><p>\nHaving removed the earth, I obtained a lever, which I got fixed under the edge of\nthe stone, and with a little exertion raised it up. I looked in, and there indeed did\nI behold the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate, as stated by the\nmessenger. The box in which they lay was formed by laying stones together in\nsome kind of cement. In the bottom of the box were laid two stones crossways of\nthe box, and on these stones lay the plates and the other things with them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30375\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30375)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30375)\">JS&mdash;H 1:51-52<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I read the reports of these other plates and remembered the story of Joseph Smith, I\nsaid to myself: \"Thank the Lord. Surely God moves in a mysterious way, his wonders to\nperform!\"\n<\/p><p>\nPlates have been found in many places, in both the Old World and the New. They have been\nfound in Palestine, in Egypt, in Babylonia, ancient Assyria, Rome, ancient Carthage, Portugal,\nItaly, ancient Phoenicia, India, Pakistan, Arabia, several places in South America and Central\nAmerica, Mexico, and in the United States. A set was found in the state of Ohio. Many\ncopper plates have been found, including one set of eight in Dunklin County, Missouri.\nAnother set was found near Mound City, Missouri, and still another in the state of Georgia.\nFive copper and two brass plates were found among the Tuckaubatchee Indians, who have a\ntradition that these plates were given to them by God.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I thought about the plates being discovered in Ohio, Georgia, and Missouri, I asked a\nfriend of mine: \"Which is more difficult to believe: that plates were found in Georgia and\nMissouri and Ohio, or that they were found in the state of New York?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen he said, \"Yes, but you involve an angel with your plates.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI said, \"Do you believe the Bible?\" And he said, \"Yes.\" I asked him, \"Which is more difficult:\nto believe that an angel came down from heaven and showed Joseph Smith the resting place\nof a set of plates made by ancient man; or to believe that God would come down from heaven\nhimself and with his hand engrave the Ten Commandments upon two tablets of stone and\ngive them to Moses?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen I remembered that we do not receive a testimony from scientific research, nor from\nargument. I remembered that the only way we get a testimony of the truthfulness of the Book\nof Mormon is in the way President Grant received it, in a way that I received it, and as a\nmillion other Latter-day Saints have received it&mdash;the way explained by Mormon when he said:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask\nGod,  the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and\nif ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent,\nhaving faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of\nthe Holy Ghost (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38270\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38270)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38270)\">Moro. 10:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWith all the fervor of my soul I thank the Almighty that he has given to me a testimony of\nthat book. And what is the testimony? That the Book of Mormon is true, that it is the word of\nGod, a new volume of scripture for this modern world. And I testify to you and all others\nwho listen that if they will but read the Book of Mormon prayerfully with a sincere heart and\nask God for a testimony of it, they will receive it, as so many of the others of us have, and\nthis is my testimony, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
