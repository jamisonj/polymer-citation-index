It is healthy and sanctifying for the barber, the merchant, the lawyer, the doctor, the teacher, and the mechanic to <span class=\"emphasis\">get together;<\/span> to hoe the same row\u2014together; to pray for the same rain\u2014together; to prune the same tree\u2014together; and to harvest the same crop\u2014together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/welfare-services-the-saviors-program.p26\" class=\"\">While our financial contributions are needed, we must work <span class=\"emphasis\">together<\/span> with our hearts and hands if we are to come to that unity and oneness required of the Saints.
