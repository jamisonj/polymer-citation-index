Whether He was journeying along the dusty way from Perea to Jerusalem, addressing the multitudes on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, or pausing beside Jacob\u2019s well in Samaria, He taught in parables. Jesus spoke frequently of having hearts that could know and feel, ears that were capable of hearing, and eyes that could truly see.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/for-i-was-blind-but-now-i-see.p6\" class=\"\">One not so blessed with the gift of sight was the blind man who, in an effort to sustain himself, sat day in and day out at his usual place on the edge of a busy sidewalk in one of our large cities. In one hand he held an old felt hat filled with pencils. With his other hand he held out a tin cup. His simple appeal to the passerby was brief and to the point. It had a certain finality to it, almost a tone of despair. The message was contained on the small placard held about his neck by a string. It read, \u201cI am blind.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/for-i-was-blind-but-now-i-see.p7\" class=\"\">Most did not stop to buy his pencils or to place a coin in the tin cup. They were too busy, too occupied by their own problems. That tin cup had never been filled or even half-filled. Then one beautiful spring day a man paused and, with a marking pen, added several new words to the shabby sign. No longer did it read, \u201cI am blind.\u201d Now the message read, \u201cIt is springtime and I am blind.\u201d The cup was soon filled to overflowing. Perhaps the busy people were touched by Charles L.
