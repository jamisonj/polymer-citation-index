We have unitedly come here to worship the Lord and to receive instruction and counsel from our leaders. We have much for which to be thankful, and my heart is filled with appreciation and gratitude for the rich blessings from the Lord which are mine in serving with the wonderful missionaries and members of the Church in Asia. His work is growing and prospering there as well as throughout the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/what-think-ye-of-christ.p4\" class=\"\">As Jesus approached that fateful hour when he would give himself as the supreme sacrifice for all mankind, he asked those who challenged him, \u201cWhat think ye of Christ?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37222\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37222)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37222)\">Matt. 22:42<\/a><\/span>). I have pondered many times that searching inquiry as it applies to my life and to all of us in this time of history. I wonder, as the register of our lives is indelibly written, and from which we will be judged, what that heavenly record will say of us in this generation of time. Do we fully accept him as the only begotten Son of God sent to earth to redeem the world? King Benjamin, as Nephi recorded, so testified.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/what-think-ye-of-christ.p5\" class=\"\">We read from Helaman:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/what-think-ye-of-christ.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cO remember, remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake unto his people; yea, remember that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who shall come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24774\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24774)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24774)\">Hel. 5:9<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/what-think-ye-of-christ.p7\" class=\"\">The Lamb of God came to earth to redeem and to teach.

Every act of his life was one of deep inner love, compassion, kindness, and forgiveness. The poor and downtrodden continuously had his benevolence, and, as he came to the end of his mortal life, his heart was full of sympathy for those who had caused his crucifixion. He prayed to the Father, \u201cForgive them; for they know not what they do\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32346\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32346)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32346)\">Luke 23:34<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/what-think-ye-of-christ.p13\" class=\"\">As the dark and dreadful days in the world\u2019s history came to pass, Jesus was betrayed, apprehended, bound, and led away captive to answer the trumped-up charges against him. They taunted him with false witnesses who came forth to challenge him. They smote him, ridiculed him, tormented him. Finally, blindfolded and scourged, he was mocked in brutish manner.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/what-think-ye-of-christ.p14\" class=\"\">His adversaries sought to take his life. No other judgmental decree would satisfy them. They accepted full responsibility for his blood on them and their children. They led him bound before Pilate, who found in him no fault at all. Then he was taken before Herod, who likewise found nothing of which to condemn him. With envy and malice, they once again brought him before Pilate. For the third time, Pilate found no justifiable reason to declare him guilty. He offered a substitute and to set Jesus free. The hideous cries from those who feared the Son of God called forth to crucify him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/what-think-ye-of-christ.p15\" class=\"\">The sacrifice of the Lamb of God, so prophesied by the prophets for centuries, had come. Quietly, and without further utterance in his own defense, he gave his life as a ransom for us, that through him and by him we might have blessed immortality\u2014to be resurrected, body and spirit united forever. He further provided the way that through obedience to his commandments and reception of the sacred ordinances, we might have eternal life. His life was evidence of his consciousness for all of his father\u2019s children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/what-think-ye-of-christ.p16\" class=\"\">Again, I ask the question, \u201cWhat think ye of Christ?\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37223\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37223)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37223)\">Matt. 22:42<\/a><\/span>] I bear you my solemn testimony and stand by the side of the disciple Peter who, when asked the direct and pointed question, \u201cBut whom say <span class=\"emphasis\">ye<\/span> that I am?\u201d answered, \u201cThou art the Christ, the Son of the living God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37198\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37198)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37198)\">Matt. 16:15\u201316<\/a><\/span>; italics added).
