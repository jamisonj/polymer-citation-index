For him, in his life and teachings, it was not an option. Indeed, he declared that without it one could not qualify for the greatest of eternal blessings\u2014eternal life (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"37238\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37238)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37238)\">Matt. 25:31\u201346<\/a><\/span>).

It is not principles and ordinances or missionary work or leadership as an end in themselves.

It is an inevitable element of mortality, and all of us have some share in it ultimately. But our religion, centering in the life and mission of the Lord Jesus Christ, helps us comprehend that. God and Christ love us with a mature, perfect love. The plan by which they lead requires mortal instruments of their love. We have the great honor to be invited to be such instruments. We need them, but they also need us. In this service we find the roots of most of those blessings that God wants us to enjoy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-royal-law-of-love.p20\" class=\"\">Once I was invited by a civic organization to present an award of recognition to the person who had done the most to help handicapped people in the area.

These birth difficulties, he had assured her, were no one\u2019s fault\u2014they were the consequence of problems not yet solved in this imperfect and sometimes unfair world. \u201cBut,\u201d said he, \u201cif you will always be more fair and more kind to others than a few of them may sometimes be to you, you will enjoy every sweet blessing life affords.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-royal-law-of-love.p22\" class=\"\">That was her one qualification, she said: she had tried to be more fair and more kind to others than a few of them had sometimes been to her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-royal-law-of-love.p23\" class=\"\">The sweetness of true Christian service is often experienced in obscurity\u2014in quiet rooms in homes and hospitals and places of confinement, in military barracks and refugee camps, and in other places far from public attention.
