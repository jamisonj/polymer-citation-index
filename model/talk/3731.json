This beautiful hymn not only incorporates the elements of rejoicing and prophecy, but also contains basic doctrine, as is evidenced by the statement, \u201cSacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven.\u201d The law of sacrifice is an important part of the gospel of Jesus Christ and contributes to the building of faith, love, and many other virtues.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/lds-hymns-worshiping-with-song.p26\" class=\"\">Also in the same stanza with the sacrifice doctrine, we sing, \u201cWake up the world for the conflict of justice.
