But I have thought of it occasionally since as I have traveled the earth, often separated from family and other loved ones.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p5\" class=\"\">Suppose that everyone in the world received simultaneously the word that the inconceivable was about to occur: civilization as we know it was about to end.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p6\" class=\"\">What would happen?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p7\" class=\"\">Well, for one thing, the streets would be a maelstrom of frantic people trying to get to a telephone to talk with someone. Every line would be jammed and every telephone booth besieged by people trying to reach someone to say \u201cI love you.\u201d There would be other messages also. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d would be one of them, or \u201cHow foolish I have been.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p8\" class=\"\">The condition of the world about us assures us that the unthinkable could happen; but it is not of such a cataclysm that I am thinking, but of our daily walk and our everyday relationships. They who love should manifest their love while there is a chance to do so. If we are waiting for some later time, some period when all imperfections are corrected and when all frustrations pass away, we are not wise. Resentment or pride or selfishness or impatience can lead us to miss what life is meant to be, and can be, and is for those who love and serve. To postpone loving and giving until some time of perfect freedom from distress or discomfort is a great mistake; it will not happen. It is not for this world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p9\" class=\"\">But we should be earnestly seeking and striving to correct and improve our own attitude and our own behavior. God has so ordained it. He loves us and believes in us and has done and will do anything he can to help us, but he will not impose on our free agency. \u201cWe love him,\u201d says the scripture, \u201cbecause he first loved us.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1136\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1136)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1136)\">1 Jn. 4:19<\/a><\/span>.) He does not love us because we love him; he loves us unconditionally. But his love does not take the course of negating or smothering our privilege to choose, or our responsibility to account for what we choose and to experience the consequences. Indeed, it is written that he weeps for the bad judgment of some of his willful and disobedient children:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold these thy brethren \u2026 are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39630\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39630)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39630)\">Moses 7:32<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd \u2026 the God of heaven looked upon the residue of the people, and he wept.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39629\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39629)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39629)\">Moses 7:28<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p12\" class=\"\">We had that agency with God before this world was. In the heavenly council of which the scriptures teach, there was another plan than God\u2019s presented: Lucifer was permitted to offer his program. It is vital for us in our leadership and our relationships to remember that God so loved that he would not shield us from the perils of freedom, from the right and responsibility to choose. So deep is his love and so precious that principle that he, who was conscious of the consequences, required that we choose. Lucifer had no love in his heart, no real concept of freedom or respect for it. He had no confidence in the principle or in us. He argued for forced salvation, for imposed survival, for an agencyless round trip to the earth and back again. None would be lost, he insisted. But he seemed not to understand that none would be any wiser, either, or any stronger or more compassionate or humble or grateful or more creative, under his plan.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p13\" class=\"\">We understood before we left that premortal state that freedom is precarious, difficult. We knew that to love would make us vulnerable to heartbreak and pain and disappointment. But we had learned that the alternatives to love and freedom of choice cannot provide the climate for growth and creative capacity that can eventually lead us to a stewardship like our Father\u2019s. The unselfish love of our Father\u2019s Firstborn in the spirit helped us understand when he, knowing the personal cost ahead for him but also the eternal significance for all of us, volunteered for his role of redemption.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p14\" class=\"\">We chose then, and we are, in consequence, on this earth still choosing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p15\" class=\"\">Recently I listened to a lovely young lady just leaving her teens as she spoke in a stake conference, her first address ever. She had never known a true family of her own. She had experienced many temporary homes, made many mistakes, had much heartache and hopelessness. Then an older Church couple found her, and loved her, and taught her. Her prepared talk was witty and interesting, but when she laid it down and bore witness through tears, it became magic:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cNo one ever helped me to understand that I was worth anything,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I was special in any way. And then the missionaries taught me about Jesus Christ and his love and the God who sent him. They taught me that Jesus died for me\u2014for <span class=\"emphasis\">me.<\/span> I am valuable! I am valuable! He died for me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p17\" class=\"\">The lesson of God\u2019s great love and wisdom seems lost on many who are on this earth because of their choice but we do not understand. Our responsibility is to help them. But we must ourselves pray and strive earnestly that we do not obscure its meaning. If we do not really love and really believe in free agency, we may be inclined to impose our will on others for what we think is their best good. If we love enough, we will not do that, even at the risk of failure. Instruction and rules and training and discipline are essential, of course. From our Father\u2019s example of godly love and patience, we should be motivated to stretch to any lengths to teach, to persuade, to encourage, to help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p18\" class=\"\">But in matters of conscience and faith, if we truly love we will never seek to impose our will and deprive others of their agency. That is, after all, Satan\u2019s way. He is still permitted in this world to pursue his own rebellious approach. Since his encounter with earth\u2019s first family, he has waged war unceasingly upon God\u2019s children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p19\" class=\"\">A scene to give us pause is portrayed in the Book of Moses:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cSatan \u2026 had a great chain in his hand, and it veiled the whole face of the earth with darkness; and he looked up and laughed, and his angels rejoiced.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p21\" class=\"\">But it is written also:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd \u2026 angels descend[ed] out of heaven, bearing testimony of the Father and Son; and the Holy Ghost fell on many.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39628\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39628)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39628)\">Moses 7:26\u201327<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-love.p23\" class=\"\">The contest for the souls of men continues.
