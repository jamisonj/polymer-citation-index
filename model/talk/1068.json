Buehner, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1960, pp. 75-78<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nRecently, I saw in a national magazine a cartoon depicting a master of ceremonies introducing\nthe next person to take part on the program, and under the cartoon were these words: \"Our\nnext speaker will need all the introduction he can get.\" Now brethren and sisters, I need all the\nhelp from above that I can get.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have all been tremendously impressed by the spirit present in these conference sessions,\nalso by the inspiring and uplifting talks of the Brethren.\n<\/p><p>\nI was moved when I learned that President McKay has given fifty-four years of valiant\nservice in the leading councils of the Church and that President Joseph Fielding Smith has\nrendered fifty years of service as a member of the Council of the Twelve. Others have also\ngiven many years to the work of our Heavenly Father. I would like to submit meekly that this\nis my eighth anniversary as a member of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church. This has been\na very rewarding experience and a great blessing in my life.\n<\/p><p>\nOur work with the Aaronic Priesthood has prompted me to say something concerning the\norigin and history of this priesthood through the ages.\n<\/p><p>\nWe first came to know of the Aaronic Priesthood at the time Moses was leading the children\nof Israel out of Egyptian bondage. The Lord intended to have Israel as a nation enjoy the\nblessings of the Melchizedek Priesthood. He made the following promise to them: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a\npeculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: \"And ye shall be unto me\na kingdom of priests, and an holy nation\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22676\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22676)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22676)\">Ex. 19:5-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBut Israel as a nation became wicked and rebellious and thus were not worthy to receive this\nblessing. While Moses was upon the mount for forty days receiving the law from the Lord,\nIsrael was guilty of backsliding, returning to the worship of idols. When Moses returned and\nbeheld them worshiping the golden calf, he in his anger threw down the tablets of stone,\nbreaking them into pieces. The Lord later called Moses to return to the mount, instructing him\nto hew out other tablets of stone upon which he would write with his finger, but from the\ninspired version of the Bible, as given to us by the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord indicated\nthere would be changes from what he had originally written because of Israel's forgetting\ntheir God <span class=\"citation\" id=\"22682\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22682)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22682)\">Ex. 34:1-2 (JST)<\/a><\/span>.\nAbout this time the higher priesthood was taken\nfrom Israel as a nation, and a carnal or lesser law was given as punishment for their\ndisobedience.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord then commanded Moses to appoint and ordain Aaron and his sons, Nadab, Abihu,\nEleazer, and Ithamar to receive the lesser priesthood\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22679\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22679)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22679)\">Ex. 28:1<\/a><\/span>). Aaron and his sons were\nset apart to preside over the lesser priesthood, and this assignment became an inherited\nprivilege to them and their posterity forever\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22680\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22680)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22680)\">Ex. 28:43<\/a><\/span>). Nadab and Abihu\nsoon forfeited this inheritance by usurping authority and were stricken dead before the\ncongregation at the altar. Since they had no sons, there was no extension of this privilege to\nanother generation in their families.\n<\/p><p>\nUntil the ordination of Aaron and his sons, the first born male in each family of each tribe\nwas considered as belonging to God and was thus ordained, but now the Lord called all the\nmales of the tribe of Levi to assist Aaron and his sons in this priestly office\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41106\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41106)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41106)\">Num. 8:13-19<\/a><\/span>).\nIt was the duty of Aaron and his sons to preside, but the Levites were limited in\ntheir duties to perform the ordinance of baptism, assisting in the offering of sacrifice and\nother duties coming under the lesser or carnal law. In addition they were assigned to care for\nthe dismantling and setting up of the tabernacle as they moved about in the wilderness and to\nkeep it in order. When Moses returned from the mount and found Israel worshiping the\ngolden calf, it is rather significant to note that he stood at the gate of the camp and indicated\nthat all those who were on the Lord's side should come to him. \". . . and all the sons of Levi\ngathered themselves together unto him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22681\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22681)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22681)\">Ex. 32:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Aaronic Priesthood embraces the Aaronic and Levitical Priesthood. While Aaron and his\nsons were Levites, they presided in the Aaronic Priesthood, and the Levites who were not the\nsons of Aaron, held the Levitical Priesthood and served in a lesser capacity than did the sons\nof Aaron. The Aaronic Priesthood continued to function in this pattern until near the time of\nthe birth of the Savior. The Jews at this time had drifted into almost total apostasy. No longer\nwere the lineal descendants of Aaron permitted to preside in the temple. The presiding high\npriest was appointed by Herod the king and sometimes by Roman authority, according to\npersonal desire, and they were deposed in the same manner. A good example of their method\nof operation comes from Zacharias who was a descendant of Aaron entitled to serve as the\npresiding high priest. While he was permitted to officiate in the temple, it was not in a\npresiding capacity. John the Baptist likewise should have been the presiding priest in the\ntemple because he was a direct descendant of Aaron through his father Zacharias and his\nmother Elisabeth, but the Jews rejected him. It should be understood that those who were\ncalled high priests by the apostate Jews were not high priests bearing the Melchizedek\nPriesthood. They should have been designated as presiding priests and not high priests.\n<\/p><p>\nJohn the Baptist was one of the most distinguished of God's servants. That he found favor\nwith the Lord is emphasized in the Angel Gabriel's appearance in the temple to his father,\nZacharias, promising him that he and his wife were to have a son who should \". . . be great in\nthe sight of the Lord\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31518\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31518)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31518)\">Luke 1:15<\/a><\/span>).\nThe birth of few men has been foretold. He was one of\nthis select group whose coming was made known centuries before his birth. Isaiah prophesied\nconcerning his mission approximately seven-hundred years before he was born\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25206\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25206)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25206)\">Isa. 40:3<\/a><\/span>).\nHe was an Elias in that he was a forerunner of Jesus. He vigorously preached the gospel of\nrepentance to the Jews. There came to him one of the highest privileges ever accorded\nman&mdash;that of baptizing the Savior of the world. He was a personal witness of one of the greatest\nmanifestations ever given. It came at the time of Jesus' baptism. As Jesus came forth out of\nthe water, John beheld the Holy Ghost descend on him like a dove, and there came from the\nheavens the voice of the Father giving divine approval: \". . . This is my beloved Son, in\nwhom I am well pleased\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35004\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35004)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35004)\">Matt. 3:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJesus attested to the fact that John the Baptist was one of the greatest of his servants. He paid\nhim a glowing tribute when he said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For I say unto you, among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than\nJohn the Baptist\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31522\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31522)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31522)\">Luke 7:28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord repeated in this dispensation the divine nature of John's mission: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For he was baptized while he was yet in his childhood, and was ordained by the angel of\nGod at the time he was eight days old unto this power, to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews,\nand to make straight the way of the Lord before the face of his people, to\nprepare them for the coming of the Lord, in whose hand is given all power\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13899\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13899)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13899)\">D&amp;C 84:28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJohn faithfully prepared the way for Jesus' mission. He was instrumental in overthrowing the\nkingdom of the Jews. While the decline of Judah as a nation began long before John's birth, it\nwas further weakened during his ministry, and within three decades after his death it was no\nmore. He stands with Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Joseph Smith as trusted and\ntrue servants to whom the Lord committed a dispensation of the gospel. He suffered death as\na martyr and was beheaded through the trickery of the wicked Herodias. Like many of the\nservants of God, he sealed his testimony with his blood.\n<\/p><p>\nLittle is known of the functions of the Aaronic Priesthood in the primitive church. The offices\nof deacon, teacher, and priest are named, but their duties are not clarified\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21717\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21717)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21717)\">Eph. 4:11<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2819\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2819)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2819)\">1 Tim. 3:8<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24289\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24289)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24289)\">Heb. 10:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay 15, 1829, was a day of paramount importance to this generation. On that beautiful\noccasion, the Aaronic Priesthood was restored to earth after an absence of many centuries. It\nwas the resurrected John the Baptist who was the central figure in this restoration. He it was\nwho appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery on the banks of the Susquehanna River as\na messenger sent from God in answer to their prayers. He told them that he came under the\ndirection of Peter, James, and John, and he conferred upon them the Aaronic Priesthood and\nthe keys to this sacred power (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30406\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30406)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30406)\">JS&mdash;H 1:72<\/a><\/span>).\nHis life and mission should be an inspiration to every bearer of the Aaronic Priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is the hope of the Presiding Bishopric that not only each member of the Aaronic Priesthood\nbut also each member of the Church will come to realize the greatness of Aaron, his sons and\ntheir posterity, and John the Baptist, as men who have made a great contribution to the\nkingdom in their day.\n<\/p><p>\nBecause the Aaronic Priesthood has been designated as the Lesser Priesthood does not lessen\nor diminish its sacredness. It is still the power of God. Its method of operation has been\ncompletely transformed in our day. From the time of its institution in the days of Aaron and\nthroughout the days of the primitive church in the Meridian of Time and again during the\nearly period of the Church in this dispensation, only men were called to the offices of this\npriesthood. Before the turn of the last century, young men were gradually inducted into this\nprogram, and today it is chiefly a plan to give training to our young men twelve to twenty\nyears of age. The training they receive today is a boon to the Melchizedek Priesthood. It is\none of the primary objectives of the Presiding Bishopric to see that each young man shall\nreceive this training. The members of the Aaronic Priesthood of today are the members of the\nMelchizedek Priesthood of tomorrow, and if they participate actively in the Aaronic\nPriesthood, they establish a solid foundation on which to build once they receive the higher\npriesthood. The advantages of today's Aaronic Priesthood program have never been equaled.\n<\/p><p>\nBetween his 19th and 20th birthday, there are at least three important blessings that come to a\nyoung man who has honored his priesthood. First, he is recommended to be ordained an elder\nand to hold the high priesthood. Second, he will more than likely be invited to serve on a\nmission for the Church. This is a tremendous and important opportunity for every young man.\nThird through his faithfulness to the Aaronic Priesthood and his ordination to the high\npriesthood, he will very likely have the opportunity of taking his bride into the house of the\nLord and being sealed for time and eternity. These are only three of the important blessings\nthat come through faithfulness in the Aaronic Priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nI trust that I shall always be found assisting our young men in the Church, even as I was\nassisted by faithful brethren who presided over the Aaronic Priesthood when I was a boy. I\nrecall very vividly a wonderful bishop by the name of Elias S. Woodruff, who twice became\na mission president, who was a member of the general Church welfare committee, but whom\nI think was outstanding as a bishop and a leader of boys. I was one of his priests. At the time\nhe was bishop, he presided over a very large ward. There were sixty-three\npriests in that priests' quorum. I recall Bishop Woodruff's coming into the room, taking off\nhis coat, hanging it over the back of his chair and then teaching this large group of youngsters\nthe gospel. We all learned to love him. As I recall, more than fifty of those boys went on\nmissions, and we had thirty-two missionaries from our ward in the mission field at the same\ntime. Bishop Woodruff was an outstanding example of the devotion of a bishop to his\nAaronic Priesthood quorums. I hope all bishops can learn from an example such as this.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we as parents and leaders of our boys exert every effort to bring the full blessings of the\npriesthood to every one of them, to the end that the culmination of their Aaronic Priesthood\nactivities will become a steppingstone to a great and marvelous future.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the choice blessings of our Heavenly Father be with us in our efforts to serve him, I\npray and leave my testimony, along with the wonderful testimonies that have already been\ngiven to the divinity of this great latter-day work, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
