I have done this by dropping in unannounced on classes in various wards in different parts of the Church. By now I have visited hundreds of classes. I apologize if any of my visits has terrorized a teacher. My impression is that almost all of the teachers I have observed in these surprise visits have appreciated having a visitor who was there to learn and there to show appreciation for their efforts and concern for their students.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/gospel-teaching.p18\" class=\"\">For the most part, what I have seen in these visits has been gratifying and reassuring.

I have also seen thoughtful and respectful students, receptive to the message and hungry to learn.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/gospel-teaching.p19\" class=\"\">Notwithstanding the great examples I have observed, I am convinced that in the Church as a whole\u2014as with each of us individually\u2014we can always do better. The challenge of progress is inherent in our Father in Heaven\u2019s plan for His children. And in our sacred callings of gospel teaching, no effort is too good for the work of the Lord and the growth of His children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>III.<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/gospel-teaching.p21\" class=\"\">There are many different ways to teach, but all good teaching is based on certain fundamental principles. Without pretending to be exhaustive, I wish to identify and comment on six fundamental principles of gospel teaching.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/gospel-teaching.p22\" class=\"\">The <span class=\"emphasis\">first<\/span> is love. It has two manifestations. When we are called to teach, we should accept our calling and teach because of our love for God the Eternal Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. In addition, a gospel teacher should always teach with love for the students. We are taught that we should pray \u201cwith all the energy of heart, \u2026 [to] be filled with this love\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38790\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38790)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38790)\">Moro. 7:48<\/a><\/span>). Love of God and love of His children is the highest reason for service. Those who teach out of love will be magnified as instruments in the hands of Him whom they serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/gospel-teaching.p23\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Second,<\/span> a gospel teacher, like the Master we serve, will concentrate entirely on those being taught. His or her total concentration will be on the needs of the sheep\u2014the good of the students. A gospel teacher does not focus on himself or herself. One who understands that principle will not look upon his or her calling as \u201cgiving or presenting a lesson,\u201d because that definition views teaching from the standpoint of the teacher, not the student.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/gospel-teaching.p24\" class=\"\">Focusing on the needs of the students, a gospel teacher will never obscure their view of the Master by standing in the way or by shadowing the lesson with self-promotion or self-interest. This means that a gospel teacher must never indulge in priestcrafts, which are \u201cthat men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4761\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4761)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4761)\">2 Ne. 26:29<\/a><\/span>). A gospel teacher does not preach \u201cto become popular\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10329\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10329)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10329)\">Alma 1:3<\/a><\/span>) or \u201cfor the sake of riches and honor\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10330\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10330)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10330)\">Alma 1:16<\/a><\/span>). He or she follows the marvelous Book of Mormon example in which \u201cthe preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10331\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10331)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10331)\">Alma 1:26<\/a><\/span>). Both will always look to the Master.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/gospel-teaching.p25\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Third,<\/span> a superior teacher of the gospel will teach from the prescribed course material, with greatest emphasis on teaching the doctrine and principles and covenants of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This is commanded in modern revelation, where the Lord said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/gospel-teaching.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cTeachers of this church shall teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/gospel-teaching.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd they shall observe the covenants and church articles to do them, and these shall be their teachings, as they shall be directed by the Spirit\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21084\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21084)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21084)\">D&amp;C 42:12\u201313<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/gospel-teaching.p28\" class=\"\">Teachers who are commanded to teach \u201cthe principles of [the] gospel\u201d and \u201cthe doctrine of the kingdom\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21144\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21144)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21144)\">D&amp;C 88:77<\/a><\/span>) should generally forgo teaching specific rules or applications. For example, they would not teach any rules for determining what is a full tithing, and they would not provide a list of <span class=\"emphasis\">dos<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">don\u2019ts<\/span> for keeping the Sabbath day holy. Once a teacher has taught the doctrine and the associated principles from the scriptures and the living prophets, such specific applications or rules are generally the responsibility of individuals and families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/gospel-teaching.p29\" class=\"\">Well-taught doctrines and principles have a more powerful influence on behavior than rules. When we teach gospel doctrine and principles, we can qualify for the witness and guidance of the Spirit to reinforce our teaching, and we enlist the faith of our students in seeking the guidance of that same Spirit in applying those teachings in their personal lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/gospel-teaching.p30\" class=\"\">The subject being taught in the Melchizedek Priesthood quorums and Relief Societies of the Church during the second and third Sundays of each month is the <span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church.<\/span> During the last two years we have studied the teachings of President Brigham Young. For the next two years we will be studying the teachings of President Joseph F. Smith. The books containing these teachings, which are being given to every adult member of the Church as a permanent personal library resource, contain doctrine and principles. They are rich and relevant to the needs of our day, and they are superb for teaching and discussion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/gospel-teaching.p31\" class=\"\">As I have visited in quorums and Relief Societies, I have generally been pleased and impressed at how these <span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church<\/span> are being presented and received. However, I have sometimes observed teachers who gave the designated chapter no more than a casual mention and then presented a lesson and invited discussion on other materials of the teacher\u2019s choice. That is not acceptable. A gospel teacher is not called to choose the subject of the lesson but to teach and discuss what has been specified. Gospel teachers should also be scrupulous to avoid hobby topics, personal speculations, and controversial subjects. The Lord\u2019s revelations and the directions of His servants are clear on this point. We should all be mindful of President Spencer W. Kimball\u2019s great instruction that a gospel teacher is a \u201cguest\u201d:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/gospel-teaching.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cHe has been given an authoritative position and a stamp of approval is placed upon him, and those whom he teaches are justified in assuming that, having been chosen and sustained in the proper order, he represents the Church and the things which he teaches are approved by the Church. No matter how brilliant he may be and how many new truths he may think he has found, he has no right to go beyond the program of the Church.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-99911_000_031\">6<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">The Teachings of Spencer W.

It is a gospel teacher\u2019s privilege and duty to seek that level of discipleship where his or her teachings will be directed and endorsed by the Spirit rather than being rigidly selected and prearranged for personal convenience or qualifications.
