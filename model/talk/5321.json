Today I add my testimony of the blessing of peace that comes through the miraculous power of prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/peace-through-prayer.p5\" class=\"\">Alexandre Dumas, in his classic tale <span class=\"emphasis\">The Count of Monte Cristo,<\/span> wrote, \u201cFor the happy man prayer is only a jumble of words, until the day when sorrow comes to explain to him the sublime language by means of which he speaks to God.\u201d (Trans. Lowell Bair, New York: Bantam Books, 1981, p. 34.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/peace-through-prayer.p6\" class=\"\">It was a happy, carefree time in my young life until on such a day, sorrow and tragedy brought me closer to God in humble, sincere prayer. In the summer of my thirteenth year, on a July night, I eagerly joined some neighborhood friends to light fireworks. Five of us took turns igniting the colorful assortment of Roman candles and rockets and firecrackers. Each was a new surprise with its burst of sights and sounds through the evening sky.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/peace-through-prayer.p7\" class=\"\">Not all of our fireworks worked as they should have. Most, in fact, were what we called duds. They sputtered momentarily, and then died. We set the duds aside until we had tried to light all of the fireworks. We had so many defective ones remaining, we wondered what to do. We couldn\u2019t just throw them away. What if we emptied the powder from all of them into the cardboard box? We could toss in a match and have one gigantic blast!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/peace-through-prayer.p8\" class=\"\">Fortunately for us, our idea failed\u2014at first. The match was tossed; we quickly ran away and waited. Nothing happened. Pressing our luck, we tried a second time, using a makeshift fuse of rolled-up newspaper. Again we anxiously waited at a distance. Again, to our good, nothing happened. That is when we should have quit. Foolishly, we gave it one more try; this time my friend Mark and I huddled around the box to keep the flame from being extinguished by the evening breeze.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/peace-through-prayer.p9\" class=\"\">Then it happened! The \u201cgigantic blast\u201d we thought we wanted exploded with fury into our faces. The force of the explosion knocked us off our feet, and flames from the ignited powder burned us severely. It was a tragic scene. Responding quickly to the screams and cries of the injured youth in her driveway, our friend\u2019s mother gathered us into her home. \u201cFirst we will pray,\u201d she said, \u201cand then we will call the doctor.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/peace-through-prayer.p10\" class=\"\">That was the first of many prayers I remember being offered for us. Soon after, I felt my face, hands, and arms being wrapped in bandages. I heard the voices of my father and my doctor administering a priesthood blessing to me. I heard my mother\u2019s voice many times, pleading with Heavenly Father to please let her son see again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/peace-through-prayer.p11\" class=\"\">I had been taught very early in my life to pray. Mother and Father had made prayer an important part of our family life. Not until that day, however, did it become so meaningful to me. In those frightening moments I found peace and comfort through prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/peace-through-prayer.p12\" class=\"\">Recently in his own pain and suffering, my friend and associate Elder Clinton Cutler said of his experience, \u201cThe Lord\u2019s peace comes not without pain, but in the midst of pain.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/peace-through-prayer.p13\" class=\"\">Our Father in Heaven has promised us peace in times of trial and has provided a way for us to come to Him in our need.

It can provide us with courage and hope to meet the challenges of life. The miracle of prayer, to me, is that in the private, quiet chambers of our mind and heart, God both hears <span class=\"emphasis\">and<\/span> answers prayers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/peace-through-prayer.p19\" class=\"\">Perhaps the greatest test of our faith and the most difficult part of prayer may be to recognize the answer that comes to us in a thought or a feeling, and then to accept or to act on the answer God chooses to give. Consistency in prayer, along with searching the scriptures and following the counsel of living prophets, keeps us in tune with the Lord and enables us to interpret the promptings of the Spirit more easily. The Lord has said; \u201cLearn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19770\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19770)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19770)\">D&amp;C 19:23<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/peace-through-prayer.p20\" class=\"\">A few days ago I attended the funeral of a lifelong friend, Ralph Poulsen. He was a righteous man of accomplishment and integrity, yet he had to endure the pain and sorrow inflicted upon him by the consequences of a cruel disease. His dear wife, Joyce, suffered also as she was by his side through his agony and pain. As the days and years of suffering went on, she arrived at a time when she felt she could not handle another day. She had done all she could for him. Now a strength beyond her own was needed. In the depth of her sorrow, she pleaded more fervently to God for His help. With the morning came a blessed peace that filled her whole soul\u2014a peace that has continued with her to this day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/peace-through-prayer.p21\" class=\"\">There <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> terrible suffering in our world today. Tragic things happen to good people. God does not cause them, nor does He always prevent them.

Evans wrote. \u201cPrayer is not a matter of asking only. It should not be always as the beggar\u2019s upturned hand.
