His wife and married daughter were with him. When we had accomplished the purpose of his visit, the younger woman asked if I would accept something from her thirteen-year-old daughter. She unwrapped a painting of two butterflies around a flowering shrub.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p6\" class=\"\">The mother explained that her daughter had been struck by a car in a terrible accident when she was four years of age. Her body was badly broken. She was left paralyzed from the shoulders down, a quadriplegic without the use of arms or legs. She had painted this picture holding a brush between her teeth and moving her head.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p7\" class=\"\">As I listened to that story, the painting grew in beauty and value before my eyes. It became more than a portrayal of butterflies. It represented remarkable courage in the face of blinding adversity; tenacious practice in holding and moving the brush; pleading prayers for help; faith\u2014the faith of a child, nurtured by loving parents, that she could create beauty notwithstanding her handicap.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p8\" class=\"\">Some might say that this is not a masterpiece.

Thank you, Krystal, for what you have done for me. I hope the telling of your story will bring a new measure of strength to others who, facing discouragement, have felt they could not go on.

Although they are vocal and have access to the media, they are relatively few in number. If we were entirely without criticism, we would be concerned.

It is evident in the easy breakup of marriages, in widespread infidelity, in the growth of youth gangs, in the increased use of drugs and the epidemic spread of AIDS, and in a growing disregard for the lives and property of others. It is seen in the defacement of private and public property with graffiti, which destroys beauty and is an insult to art. It is expressed in the language of the gutter, which is brought into our homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p22\" class=\"\">The endless sex and violence on network TV, the trash of so many motion pictures, the magnified sensuality found in much of modern literature, the emphasis on sex education, a widespread breakdown of law and order\u2014all are manifestations of this decay.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p23\" class=\"\">What is the answer?

Those who are concerned with the problem advocate more legal regulation, large appropriations for increased police forces, tax increases to build additional jails and prisons. These may be needed to deal with the present problems. They may help in the near term. But they will be only as a bandage too small for the sore. They may help in taking care of the fruits, but they will not get at the roots. In searching for remedies, we speak of a greater work that must be done in our schools. But educators have largely abdicated their responsibility for teaching values. The Church is looked to\u2014this and all other churches. I am grateful for what the Pope recently said in Denver in warning against moral pitfalls. I am pleased to note that the Baptists have begun a campaign for chastity. We as a church are doing much, very much, and I think we are accomplishing much.

I do not doubt that he has tried. But it is now too late. Attitudes have been fixed. Habits have become rigid. If we are to turn this tide, the effort must begin with children when they are young and pliable, when they will listen and learn.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p27\" class=\"\">Not long after we were married, we built our first home. We had very little money. I did much of the work myself. It would be called \u201csweat equity\u201d today. The landscaping was entirely my responsibility. The first of many trees that I planted was a thornless honey locust. Envisioning the day when its filtered shade would assist in cooling the house in the summertime, I put it in a place at the corner where the wind from the canyon to the east blew the hardest. I dug a hole, put in the bare root, put soil around it, poured on water, and largely forgot it. It was only a wisp of a tree, perhaps three-quarters of an inch in diameter. It was so supple that I could bend it with ease in any direction. I paid little attention to it as the years passed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p28\" class=\"\">Then one winter day, when the tree was barren of leaves, I chanced to look out the window at it. I noticed that it was leaning to the west, misshapen and out of balance. I could scarcely believe it. I went out and braced myself against it as if to push it upright. But the trunk was now nearly a foot in diameter. My strength was as nothing against it. I took from my toolshed a block and tackle. Attaching one end to the tree and another to a well-set post, I pulled the rope. The pulleys moved a little, and the trunk of the tree trembled slightly. But that was all. It seemed to say, \u201cYou can\u2019t straighten me. It\u2019s too late. I\u2019ve grown this way because of your neglect, and I will not bend.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p29\" class=\"\">Finally in desperation I took my saw and cut off the great heavy branch on the west side. The saw left an ugly scar, more than eight inches across. I stepped back and surveyed what I had done. I had cut off the major part of the tree, leaving only one branch growing skyward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p30\" class=\"\">More than half a century has passed since I planted that tree. My daughter and her family live there now. The other day I looked again at the tree. It is large. Its shape is better. It is a great asset to the home. But how serious was the trauma of its youth and how brutal the treatment I used to straighten it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p31\" class=\"\">When it was first planted, a piece of string would have held it in place against the forces of the wind.

The parents who brought them into the world seem almost to have abdicated their responsibility. The results have been tragic.

I repeat that plea to all fathers. Yours is the basic and inescapable responsibility to stand as the head of the family. That does not carry with it any implication of dictatorship or unrighteous dominion. It carries with it a mandate that fathers provide for the needs of their families. Those needs are more than food, clothing, and shelter. Those needs include righteous direction and the teaching, by example as well as precept, of basic principles of honesty, integrity, service, respect for the rights of others, and an understanding that we are accountable for that which we do in this life, not only to one another but also to the God of heaven, who is our Eternal Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p37\" class=\"\">Let every mother realize that she has no greater blessing than the children which have come to her as a gift from the Almighty; that she has no greater mission than to rear them in light and truth, in understanding and love; that she will have no greater happiness than to see them grow into young men and women who respect principles of virtue, who walk free from the stain of immorality and from the shame of delinquency.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p38\" class=\"\">Said the writer of Proverbs, \u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41639\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41639)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41639)\">Prov. 22:6<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p39\" class=\"\">The health of any society, the happiness of its people, their prosperity, and their peace all find their roots in the teaching of children by fathers and mothers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p40\" class=\"\">The very structure of our society is now threatened by broken homes and the tragic consequences of those homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/bring-up-a-child-in-the-way-he-should-go.p41\" class=\"\">I believe that with effort we can change this course.
