I believe the Savior was seeking purity of soul in those he called to be his twelve Apostles. When he spoke of being without guile, he referred to something far deeper than outward appearance.

Honesty is of God and dishonesty of the devil; the devil was a liar from the beginning.

We see and hear reports of fraud and deception in all levels of our society. A few citizens of some nations betray their country by exchanging sensitive information for money, information they have stolen or with which they have been entrusted. The entertainment industry seems to have lost, in large measure, the concept of moral values. Employees falsify expense accounts. These few examples of guile illustrate how pervasive it is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/without-guile.p31\" class=\"\">Of far greater concern than the outward acts of guile are the inner feelings and the attitudes that motivate them. Fraud and deception appear to be increasingly acceptable; the only wrongdoing seems to be in being caught. The objective often is to get gain or to profit, regardless of the injury, loss, or damage to others. This attitude is totally contrary to the principles of the gospel. It hinders or thwarts the spiritual progress of anyone afflicted by it. The practice of guile prevents the Holy Ghost from prompting, guiding, and instructing us, leaving us ever more susceptible to the buffetings of Satan. When we break the commandments, we close ourselves to God\u2019s influence and open ourselves to Satan\u2019s influence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/without-guile.p32\" class=\"\">If we practice guile in small matters, we soon can find ourselves entangled in an ever-increasing, unending spiral, because each lie or other deception often requires a larger one to cover the first. Moreover, the practice of guile often leads to hypocrisy, which is the false pretense of virtue or righteousness and pretending to be something that we are not. If we know what is right and profess to live by that knowledge but, in fact, do not, we are hypocrites. The Savior denounced hypocrites in unmistakable language.

I cite two examples from the scriptures. The first is the City of Holiness, even Zion, a city in which the inhabitants were pure in heart and dwelt in righteousness. In fact, Zion is the name given by the Lord to his Saints. That city, referred to as the city of Enoch, was taken up into heaven (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"39742\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39742)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39742)\">Moses 7:18\u201321<\/a><\/span>). The second example is the society of the Nephites that lasted for about two hundred years after the resurrected Lord visited and taught them. The following words of inspiration from the Book of Mormon describe this society:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/without-guile.p52\" class=\"\">\u201cThere were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/without-guile.p53\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/without-guile.p54\" class=\"\">\u201cThere were no robbers, nor murderers, \u2026 but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/without-guile.p55\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd how blessed were they!

Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. He stands at the head of this Church. Joseph Smith was the prophet of God through whom the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored in these, the latter days. President Ezra Taft Benson is the Lord\u2019s prophet today. He directs this Church by revelation. I bear this testimony humbly in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
