A dispensation is also defined as a period when God has revealed his mind and will to man. It \u201cmeans the opening of the heavens to men; the \u2026 dispensing to them the word of God; the revealing to men \u2026 the principles and ordinances of the Gospel; the conferring of divine authority upon \u2026 chosen ones, by which they are empowered to act in the name \u2026 [and] authority of God. \u2026 The Dispensation of the Fulness of Times is the dispensation which includes all others,\u201d both in heaven and on earth. It is the dispensation which will fulfill all of the decrees of a loving Heavenly Father for \u201cthe salvation of [all] men and the redemption of the earth itself.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 1:xxiii.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/linking-the-family-of-man.p6\" class=\"\">An inspired Prophet Joseph Smith wrote, \u201cIt is necessary \u2026 that a \u2026 welding together of dispensations \u2026 should take place \u2026 from the days of Adam even to the present time.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19530\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19530)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19530)\">D&amp;C 128:18<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/linking-the-family-of-man.p7\" class=\"\">The gospel, of course, is of great antiquity.

From the road deep in the canyon floor, most automobile passengers do not see the large, arched portals cut high in the side of the mountain. Few would realize that behind these portals are six large storage rooms cut deep into the solid granite and that in them lie the world\u2019s largest collection of genealogy records. These are not ordinary records, but records listing the births, marriages, and deaths of nearly two billion people who have lived on the earth. They are the product of over fifty years of tireless effort the world over by Church representatives, by microfilm camera operators, and those who care for these records housed row upon row in microfilm cabinets deep in the mountain. The magnitude of this project to gather and preserve these records is awesome to behold.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/linking-the-family-of-man.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cWhy do you do this?\u201d some ask. \u201cWhy does the Church commit millions of dollars and tens of thousands of hours to this immense but unusual project?

We identify our ancestors so that we may perform for them the saving ordinances of the gospel in holy temples dedicated to that purpose. It is our responsibility, given to us by the Lord, to help redeem all those of our Father\u2019s children who have lived and died without receiving the sacred ordinances of the gospel\u2014yet all have the opportunity to accept or reject the ordinances performed in their behalf.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/linking-the-family-of-man.p13\" class=\"\">Several years ago I was riding on a train from Edinburgh, Scotland, to Glasgow with a noted British lawyer. We had engaged him to present our claim of discrimination by the city council of Glasgow. We were seeking a building permit, which had been repeatedly denied by the city council at the instigation of an opposing ministerial group as not needed inasmuch as there was an abundance of vacant or unused church buildings. We had been granted a hearing before the secretary of state for Scotland\u2014a member of the prime minister\u2019s cabinet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/linking-the-family-of-man.p14\" class=\"\">As the early morning train sped toward Glasgow, I asked the distinguished counsel if he had any additional questions about our church.

But no more! Now we have available a modern miracle called FamilySearch\u2122. FamilySearch is a powerful, innovative computer system. In response to your typing in a name of one of your ancestors at a keyboard, FamilySearch, in just moments, races through millions of names and finds any that match what you typed. It knows how to match names that are spelled differently but sound the same. It can guide you from one small fragment of sketchy information to full screens of information\u2014dates and places of birth, marriage, and death; and names of parents, children, and spouses.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/linking-the-family-of-man.p26\" class=\"\">To store all of this information, FamilySearch uses little compact discs\u2014the same electronic marvels that you see in the record stores.
