Belief in the fact that God exists is of first importance, but it is not <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> that is necessary in order to exercise an intelligent faith that will lead us back into his presence for eternal life with him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/a-basis-for-faith-in-the-living-god.p8\" class=\"\">In addition to a belief in the existence of God, we must know something of his character and attributes or our faith will be imperfect and unfruitful. Faith will avail us nothing unless it is based on true principles. This is illustrated in a story I have told before about the meeting of the Indians with the Europeans when they first began their explorations in the New World. The Indians were amazed at the power and explosive qualities of gunpowder and asked many questions about how it was produced. Taking advantage of the ignorance of the savages and seeing an opportunity to increase their wealth through deception, the Europeans told them it came from the seed of a plant. The Indians believed them and purchased some seed in exchange for gold. They carefully planted the seed and watched it grow, but of course they did not get any gunpowder. No matter how sincere one\u2019s belief may be in an error, it will not change the error into truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/a-basis-for-faith-in-the-living-god.p9\" class=\"\">So it is with our belief in God. Unless we know him and understand his nature and character, we cannot have perfect faith in him. There was no question about God in Old Testament times. He walked and talked with Adam and Eve, and even after their transgression they continued to call upon him and to sacrifice to him. He gave them commandments which they obeyed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/a-basis-for-faith-in-the-living-god.p10\" class=\"\">Cain and Abel learned of God from the teachings of their parents, as well as from personal revelations.

As man proceeds to the closer examination of things he finds that by study and scientific investigation these proofs are multiplied many fold. He may learn of the laws by which the earth and its associated worlds are governed in their orbits; by which satellites are held subordinate to planets, and planets to suns; he may behold the marvels of vegetable and animal anatomy, and the surpassing mechanism of his own body; and with such appeals to his reason increasing at every step, his wonder as to who ordained all this gives place to adoration for the Creator whose presence and power are thus so forcefully proclaimed; and the observer becomes a worshiper.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Articles of Faith,<\/span> 42nd ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1961, pp. 32\u201333.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/a-basis-for-faith-in-the-living-god.p15\" class=\"\">With all this evidence it is hard to understand how some can doubt the very existence of God. The early scriptures do not attempt to demonstrate God\u2019s existence or to argue on the sophistries of atheism, so it seems that the errors of doubt crept in at some later time. With the death of Christ and the apostles, and during the period of apostasy when revelation ceased, the simple, consistent, and authentic doctrine about the character and attributes of God became distorted, and numerous theories and dogmas of men appeared, many of which are utterly mystical and incomprehensible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/a-basis-for-faith-in-the-living-god.p16\" class=\"\">Seeking to end the many disagreements and arguments regarding the Godhead which were prevalent at the time, the emperor Constantine in the year <span class=\"small\">A.D.<\/span> 325 convened the Council of Nice in order that this body might make \u201ca declaration of \u2026 belief that would be received as authoritative.\u201d This council brought forth what is known as the Nicene Creed, followed some time later by the Athanasian Creed which reads in part:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/a-basis-for-faith-in-the-living-god.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cWe worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the persons, nor dividing the substance.

Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost. The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the Holy Ghost uncreate. The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy Ghost incomprehensible. The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Ghost eternal. And yet there are not three eternals, but one eternal. As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncreated; but one uncreated, and one incomprehensible.
