Although they had only recently been called to the holy apostleship, they knew Him and they loved Him and believed in Him. They had left their work and their families to follow Him.

We sometimes fail to understand that the everlasting peace Jesus promises is an inner peace, born in faith, anchored by testimony, nurtured with love, and expressed through continual obedience and repentance. It is a peace of spirit that echoes through the heart and the soul. If one truly knows and experiences this inner peace, there is no fear from worldly disharmony or discord. One knows deep down inside that all is well as far as the things that really matter are concerned.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p17\" class=\"\">As President Hinckley instructed the brethren last night, there is no peace in sin.

One cannot be at peace if one is living a life out of harmony with revealed truth. There is no peace in being mean-spirited or contentious.

There is no peace in being abusive to others in any way, whether it be emotionally, physically, or sexually, for those who are abusive will remain in mental and spiritual turmoil until they come to Christ in all humility and seek forgiveness through complete repentance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p18\" class=\"\">At one time or another I believe everyone yearns for the \u201cpeace of God, which passeth all understanding\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41212\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41212)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41212)\">Philip. 4:7<\/a><\/span>).

When that precious truth is discovered and gospel principles are understood and applied, great peace can distill in the hearts and souls of our Heavenly Father\u2019s children. Said the Savior through Joseph Smith, \u201cHe who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11314\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11314)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11314)\">D&amp;C 59:23<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p24\" class=\"\">It is sometimes amazing to see the difference this peace can have in the lives of those who accept it. While I was presiding over the Canada Toronto Mission many years ago, our missionaries began teaching a family that was in spiritual darkness. They were poor, uneducated, and their personal appearance reflected a lack of appreciation or concern for normal hygiene and grooming. But they were good, honorable people\u2014among the honest in heart that we always pray for our missionaries to find\u2014and they responded spiritually as they felt for the first time in their lives the peace the gospel offers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p25\" class=\"\">When we learned that they were going to be baptized, Sister Ballard and I attended the baptismal service. I happened to be standing next to the bishop of the ward when the family arrived. In all honesty, I must tell you that they were quite a sight. They looked unkempt, unclean, and somewhat scruffy. Because he had been out of town for a period of time, the bishop had not yet met the newest members of his ward; so this first impression was, to say the least, unimpressive. As they walked away, I thought I could feel his knees begin to buckle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p26\" class=\"\">I put my arm around this good bishop to give him my support\u2014physically as well as spiritually. I felt prompted to say to him: \u201cBishop, isn\u2019t this wonderful? We will make good Latter-day Saints out of them!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p27\" class=\"\">He looked at me, and he smiled. I just couldn\u2019t tell if he was smiling because he agreed with me, or if he thought that I might be just another overenthusiastic missionary.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p28\" class=\"\">The baptismal service proceeded, and the family was baptized. The next day, we decided to attend that ward to make sure the family was well received when they came to their meetings as new members of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p29\" class=\"\">As the family came into the chapel for sacrament meeting, I was sitting on the stand next to the bishop. The father was wearing a clean white shirt. It was not large enough for him to fasten the top button at the neck, and he was wearing a tie that I could remember seeing on one of my elders. But his face radiated with happiness and peace. The mother and daughters looked like they had been transformed from the previous day. Their dresses were not fancy, but they were clean and lovely. They, too, had that special gospel glow. The little boys wore white shirts that were several sizes too large for them, even with the sleeves rolled up. And they were wearing ties that almost extended down to their knees. It was obvious that the missionaries had put their own white shirts and ties on these little boys so they could come to sacrament meeting appropriately dressed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p30\" class=\"\">They sat with their missionaries, and the light of the gospel literally shone from them. Alma describes this as \u201c[receiving God\u2019s] image in your countenances\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8696\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8696)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8696)\">Alma 5:14<\/a><\/span>).

Through the instruction of the missionaries and the subsequent fellowshipping of their good bishop and the ward members, this entire family emerged from spiritual darkness into gospel light and truth. In that light the family was warmed, refreshed, and revitalized by the peace that comes from knowing the Lord Jesus Christ lives. The light of the gospel truths restored to earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith began to show this family the way to the temple, where one year later they received their eternal blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p32\" class=\"\">Again quoting the prophecies of Isaiah: \u201cAnd all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24969\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24969)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24969)\">Isa. 54:13<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p33\" class=\"\">Once we have tasted the sweet fruit of God\u2019s peace, we are naturally inclined to share it with others.
