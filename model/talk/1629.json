McKay's key note address at the commencement of this conference, this statement was made: \"One supreme wish in my heart is that the spirit of this conference could be felt in every home in this world.\" I pray for that same influence to permeate the homes of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring this conference, we have again raised our hands to sustain our Prophet, the First Presidency, and other General Authorities of the Church. We have welcomed into this group some new young men, and others have been reassigned, but all for one purpose and with one overriding call&mdash;to be personal representatives of Jesus Christ on the earth today.\n<\/p><p>\nIt's a fair guess to say that throughout the Church today there will be several thousand people, young and old, called to positions of leadership and service in their respective branches, wards, stakes, and missions.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I suggest that there is a solemn duty upon both groups to bring beautiful, spiritual peace to the earth.\n<\/p><p><b>\nPrepare ye\n<\/b><\/p><p>\nThe Lord, speaking to the Prophet Joseph Smith, said: \"Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come, for the Lord is nigh.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15083\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15083)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15083)\">D&amp;C 1:12<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nThe scriptures are replete with admonitions to \"prepare ourselves and our fellowmen for the good life here and hereafter.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Hearken, and lo, a voice as of one sent down from on high, who is mighty and powerful, whose going forth is unto the ends of the earth, yea, whose voice is unto men&mdash;Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15154\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15154)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15154)\">D&amp;C 65:1<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nThe preamble to the 65th section to the Doctrine and Covenants states: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet . . . 1831.

C. They were discussing world problems. For a long while, the President listened; then he said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"My friends, the biggest, most powerful weapon in the world is not the atomic bomb, or even the fighting ability of men. It is their moral and spiritual strength. Nothing can ever conquer that strength. Remember this, gentlemen, because that is the weapon our enemies really fear.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOur message to the world is that moral and spiritual courage are needed to prepare the way.\n<\/p><p><b>\nMeaning of preparedness\n<\/b><\/p><p>\nPreparedness has many connotations, and perhaps each of us thinks of it differently, at the same time agreeing on its basic principle.\n<\/p><p>\nPreparedness means to get ready for a given event; if we are entertaining friends in our homes, we make ready the home and the refreshments, and so forth.\n<\/p><p>\nUnexpectedly I visited a home sometime ago. In this home was a young lady afflicted with a dreadful disease. The mother answered the door and said, \"Oh, Brother Longden, come in. I wondered why I was cleaning the house so well this morning. I didn't know a servant of God would be calling.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn this home they are already prepared and doing their bit to help others prepare the way. The gospel of Jesus Christ is their way of life, and it is that simple.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we are holding a meeting, we prepare for that. Planning for a trip or a vacation, we prepare well in advance.\n<\/p><p>\nA few months ago I visited a mortuary in respect to a choice lady whom I had known for many years. In visiting with some of her children, one of the daughters said, \"Mother was prepared to die, but Mother was prepared to live all her life.\" Knowing this lady, I concurred in this sincere tribute. Because of this one woman, many lives were better prepared to live.\n<\/p><p><b>\nConstant preparation needed\n<\/b><\/p><p>\nThe Lord, speaking to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1832, said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men's hearts shall fail them; for fear shall come upon all people.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And angels shall fly through the midst of heaven, crying with a loud voice, sounding the trump of God, saying: Prepare ye, prepare ye, O inhabitants of the earth; for the judgment of our God is come. Behold, and lo, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15186\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15186)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15186)\">D&amp;C 88:91-92<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nWe can be prepared to meet him, either if we should be called to leave here, or if we should still be here at his second coming.\n<\/p><p>\nThree or four years ago, two young high school students were driving on Wasatch Boulevard in Salt Lake City. It was reported a man under the influence of liquor, driving the car coming in the opposite direction, came over the center line and rammed into their small car. They were killed instantly.\n<\/p><p>\nEach of them was a fine young man, not only holding the office of priest in the Aaronic Priesthood but honoring that priesthood by the way he lived. I attended the funeral service of one of them. Never have I attended one like it. The chapel and cultural hall were filled to overflowing, mostly by young people.\n<\/p><p>\nThe remarks of a young student speaker impressed upon me the need for constant preparation, the need to be constantly prepared.\n<\/p><p>\n He said, addressing his remarks to the bereaved parents, \"I have never seen your son say or do anything you would be ashamed of.\"\n<\/p><p><b>\nPrepared to live eternally\n<\/b><\/p><p>\nThirty-nine years ago, we buried our firstborn. Elder Adam S. Bennion spoke these words at our daughter's service: \n<\/p><p>\n\"There are out beyond today for this young couple two gates. They will choose to open one of them. The first one swings to the touch of grief. It will open quickly and easily. It leads out into doubt and despair, even to bitterness. The other gate opens more slowly, isn't so promising to look at. It yields to the push of patience. I'm not sure that it doesn't swing better to a pull, but if it may be pulled through patience, it opens to hope and faith and confidence in God, consolation and mutual benediction. I know these two young people well enough to know which gate they will enter.\"\n<\/p><p>\nMay I say now, after nearly forty years, this is true: pulling on that gate brings a deep sense of spiritual peace; come what may, it has helped us to ride over several stormy parts of our lives. Someone helped prepare the way for us. What have we done to help others? There may be sorrow, tragedy, commotion, frustration, tension, pressures, strife, troubles, and problems in this fast-moving world. Yet, in the gospel of Jesus Christ is the pattern which will extend comfort, hope, and peace to the world. Living by its tenets, we are prepared to die; but more important, to live eternally.\n<\/p><p>\nThe parables of Jesus, the scriptures, old and new, are filled with admonitions to prepare ourselves and help to prepare the way for others.\n<\/p><p><b>\nExample of being prepared\n<\/b><\/p><p>\nIt was my privilege this morning, just before the commencement of this conference, to shake hands with a former missionary companion. Forty-six years ago was our first meeting, as he indoctrinated me into the missionary service. Our paths have crossed many times. To me he is a living example of constantly being prepared. He now holds the high office of patriarch in the Hunter Stake.\n<\/p><p>\nI am reminded of a series of talks given from this podium by a prophet of the Lord several years ago; his name: Elder Albert E. Bowen. I would remind each of us of the title of these discourses, \"Constancy Amid Change.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn the first prayer opening this conference, this statement was uttered: \"May we get a stimulation to great action.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now in conclusion, may I give you a thought from President David O. McKay: \"Most earnestly do I hope that we shall never lose the great conviction that the world is our field of activity. Can you think of anything more potent in moving a people to action?\n<\/p><p>\n\"But what a responsibility this entails of leading good men and good women all over the world to know God, and to know what their mission is on earth!\" (Instructions to Regional Representatives of the Twelve, September 27-28, 1967.)\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that we will constantly be prepared and know our mission on earth, and pray for his blessings upon us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
