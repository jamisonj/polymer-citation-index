We are commanded to pray always to the Father in the name of the Son (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"117513\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117513)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117513)\">3\u00a0Nephi 18:19\u201320<\/a><\/span>).

The mysteries are those matters that can only be known and understood by the power of the Holy Ghost (see Harold\u00a0B.

In a similar way, meaningful morning prayer is an important element in the spiritual creation of each day\u2014and precedes the temporal creation or the actual execution of the day. Just as the temporal creation was linked to and a continuation of the spiritual creation, so meaningful morning and evening prayers are linked to and are a continuation of each other.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"preamble\">Consider this example. There may be things in our character, in our behavior, or concerning our spiritual growth about which we need to counsel with Heavenly Father in morning prayer. After expressing appropriate thanks for blessings received, we plead for understanding, direction, and help to do the things we cannot do in our own strength alone. For example, as we pray, we might:<\/p>\n      <ul class=\"bullet\"><li>\n\t  <span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Reflect on those occasions when we have spoken harshly or inappropriately to those we love the most.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t  <span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Recognize that we know better than this, but we do not always act in accordance with what we know.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t  <span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Express remorse for our weaknesses and for not putting off the natural man more earnestly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t  <span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Determine to pattern our life after the Savior more completely.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t  <span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Plead for greater strength to do and to become better.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul><p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/pray-always.p20\" class=\"\">Such a prayer is a key part of the spiritual preparation for our day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/pray-always.p21\" class=\"\">During the course of the day, we keep a prayer in our heart for continued assistance and guidance\u2014even as Alma suggested: \u201cLet all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117477\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117477)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117477)\">Alma 37:36<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/pray-always.p22\" class=\"\">We notice during this particular day that there are occasions where normally we would have a tendency to speak harshly, and we do not; or we might be inclined to anger, but we are not. We discern heavenly help and strength and humbly recognize answers to our prayer. Even in that moment of recognition, we offer a silent prayer of gratitude.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/pray-always.p23\" class=\"\">At the end of our day, we kneel again and report back to our Father. We review the events of the day and express heartfelt thanks for the blessings and the help we received. We repent and, with the assistance of the Spirit of the Lord, identify ways we can do and become better tomorrow. Thus our evening prayer builds upon and is a continuation of our morning prayer. And our evening prayer also is a preparation for meaningful morning prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/pray-always.p24\" class=\"\">Morning and evening prayers\u2014and all of the prayers in between\u2014are not unrelated, discrete events; rather, they are linked together each day and across days, weeks, months, and even years.

Our family learned an important lesson about meaningful prayer as we knelt to pray one evening with a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/pray-always.p30\" class=\"\">Earlier in the day Sister Bednar and I had been informed about the unexpected death of a dear friend, and our immediate desire was to pray for the surviving spouse and children. As I invited my wife to offer the prayer, the member of the Twelve, unaware of the tragedy, graciously suggested that in the prayer Sister Bednar express only appreciation for blessings received and ask for nothing. His counsel was similar to Alma\u2019s instruction to the members of the ancient Church \u201cto pray without ceasing, and to give thanks in all things\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117445\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117445)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117445)\">Mosiah 26:39<\/a><\/span>). Given the unexpected tragedy, requesting blessings for our friends initially seemed to us more urgent than expressing thanks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/pray-always.p31\" class=\"\">Sister Bednar responded in faith to the direction she received. She thanked Heavenly Father for meaningful and memorable experiences with this dear friend. She communicated sincere gratitude for the Holy Ghost as the Comforter and for the gifts of the Spirit that enable us to face adversity and to serve others. Most importantly, she expressed appreciation for the plan of salvation, for the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ, for His Resurrection, and for the ordinances and covenants of the restored gospel which make it possible for families to be together forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/pray-always.p32\" class=\"\">Our family learned from that experience a great lesson about the power of thankfulness in meaningful prayer. Because of and through that prayer, our family was blessed with inspiration about a number of issues that were pressing upon our minds and stirring in our hearts. We learned that our gratefulness for the plan of happiness and for the Savior\u2019s mission of salvation provided needed reassurance and strengthened our confidence that all would be well with our dear friends. We also received insights concerning the things about which we should pray and appropriately ask in faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/pray-always.p33\" class=\"\">The most meaningful and spiritual prayers I have experienced contained many expressions of thanks and few, if any, requests. As I am blessed now to pray with apostles and prophets, I find among these modern-day leaders of the Savior\u2019s Church the same characteristic that describes Captain Moroni in the Book of Mormon: these are men whose hearts swell with thanksgiving to God for the many privileges and blessings which He bestows upon His people (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"117493\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117493)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117493)\">Alma 48:12<\/a><\/span>). Also, they do not multiply many words, for it is given unto them what they should pray, and they are filled with desire (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"117516\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117516)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117516)\">3\u00a0Nephi 19:24<\/a><\/span>). The prayers of prophets are childlike in their simplicity and powerful because of their sincerity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/pray-always.p34\" class=\"\">As we strive to make our prayers more meaningful, we should remember that \u201cin nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117616\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117616)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117616)\">D&amp;C 59:21<\/a><\/span>).

However, praying earnestly for others, both those whom we love and those who despitefully use us, is also an important element of meaningful prayer. Just as expressing gratitude more often in our prayers enlarges the conduit for revelation, so praying for others with all of the energy of our souls increases our capacity to hear and to heed the voice of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/pray-always.p37\" class=\"\">We learn a vital lesson from the example of Lehi in the Book of Mormon.
