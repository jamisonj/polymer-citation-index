A second definition is, \u201cthe attainment of wealth, favor, or eminence,\u201d and surely this is the most commonly used definition today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p6\" class=\"\">We are prone to apply the term <span class=\"emphasis\">successful <\/span>to those who <span class=\"emphasis\">look <\/span>prosperous or wealthy or appear to have scaled the pinnacle of accomplishment in their own particular profession. Whether a man be a doctor, lawyer, financier, builder, politician, an admiral or a general, an actor, an airline pilot, or an athlete, all these and many others have the term <span class=\"emphasis\">success <\/span>applied to them. But is this really success?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p7\" class=\"\">Man\u2019s definition of success is, many times, very difficult to comprehend. Some feel to be right is to be successful. Henry Clay said he would rather be right than president. Perhaps he felt successful: he ran for the presidency three times and failed all three times. \u201cEven a stopped clock is right twice a day. After some years it can boast a long series of successes.\u201d (Abner-Eschenbach.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cThe reasonable man will know that the actual magnitude of success obtained bears no real relation to the amount of pleasure that is conveyed; the man who becomes prime minister or wins a Nobel prize is not really more elated than he who secures a trophy for playing Ping Pong or wins a bronze medal for growing large chrysanthemums.\u201d (Harold Necholson.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p9\" class=\"\">The Lord doesn\u2019t seem to measure success in terms of attainment of position or power or wealth. A prophet in the Book of Mormon (where, by the way, the most succinct and unvarnished truths can be found) said, \u201cBut behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things. Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3893\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3893)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3893)\">2 Ne. 2:24\u201325<\/a><\/span>.) If man is that he might have joy, then success to the Lord must include the attainment of real joy. On the basis of this definition, then, no one is really successful who is not happy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p10\" class=\"\">If this be the Lord\u2019s definition, then there is precious little success in this world. Success in its practical application seems to be more a state of mind than anything else. Obviously, many people never make it because they are ungrateful. They are not thankful for what they have; therefore, they are unhappy and thus are not successful. I have never seen a happy person who was not thankful for what he had, to paraphrase the Prophet Joseph Smith, who stated that \u201cdoubt and faith cannot exist in the same person at the same time.\u201d (6th Lecture on Faith.) It is also doubtful that success and unhappiness can exist in the same person at the same time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p11\" class=\"\">Generally speaking, we are unhappy because we are dissatisfied, and this because we pursue after things that cannot make us happy, even if we obtain them. In the words of H. W. Beecher, \u201cSuccess is full of promise till men get it, and then is as a last year\u2019s nest, from which the bird has flown.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p12\" class=\"\">There is a great lesson to be learned here. Some think of success as obtaining \u201csomething for nothing\u201d or the securing of a great bargain. The words of James Russell Lowell seem particularly applicable. He said, \u201cEarth gets its price from what Earth gives us.\u201d In order to be happy, it is particularly important that we learn that everything has its price and not expect something for nothing. This seems to be what earth life is all about\u2014to teach us the lesson that as ye sow, so shall ye reap. We cannot receive something for nothing: on the contrary, we will pay for everything we receive.

We pursue after bubbles many times, thinking they will make us happy and that obtaining this particular bubble would make us successful. There are many, many bubbles for sale. This is another word for material possessions, which the world would have us believe are necessary to make us happy. We get the idea from modern advertising that happiness comes from the accumulation of material possessions. We must have a new house, a new car, or a snowmobile, or maybe even a boat.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p24\" class=\"\">Elder ElRay L. Christiansen tells an interesting story about his neighbor who bought a boat. He really couldn\u2019t afford a boat; but he bought it anyway, because he had a credit card. In order to pay for the boat, he had to take a second job, which meant he had to work on Saturday. This, of course, left one day per week on which he could use the boat. When do you suppose that was? Yes, you are right\u2014it was Sunday. But he loved his boat and invited Brother Christiansen over to admire it, saying, \u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful? What shall we name it?\u201d (Now, you see, it is a member of the family\u2014it has to have a name.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p25\" class=\"\">Brother Christiansen said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you call it The Sabbath Breaker?\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Conference Report, <\/span>April 1962, p. 33.) Now, please don\u2019t misunderstand me\u2014I have nothing against boats. I have a friend who has a boat, and he calls his boat \u201cNever on Sunday,\u201d which, of course, is a better name for a boat.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p26\" class=\"\">There is no real joy or happiness in the accumulation of material possessions. There are too many people today who are so miserable in this life that they cannot stand themselves. They are seeking any avenue of escape\u2014to get out of this life, even to taking their own lives. Many of these people have material possessions heaped up in piles all around them\u2014and many of their associates would say they were successful. But material possessions have not made them happy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p27\" class=\"\">The Master emphasized this when he said, \u201cFor what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36223\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36223)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36223)\">Matt. 16:26<\/a><\/span>.)

As we visited he told me that one thing he would rather do was drive a dune buggy. We talked about the relative merits of trading eternal life for a dune buggy; and he decided, perhaps, that was not exactly a fair exchange. I suggested to him that if he still wanted to drive a dune buggy after he had filled his mission, the Lord would probably let him do so, since the Lord always grants unto men \u201caccording to their desire.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9171\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9171)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9171)\">Alma 29:4<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p29\" class=\"\">We must not be misled.

They feel it is so vital that they must have a revelation from the Lord, so they will know what to do with their lives. Generally speaking, I\u2019m not sure that the Lord really cares what we choose as a vocation\u2014whether we are a plumber or a librarian\u2014so long as we keep the commandments of God. Of course, it is sometimes easier to keep the commandments when we are happy in our professions, and to that extent it is important that we do something we enjoy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p31\" class=\"\">The Lord, through living prophets as well as prophets in earlier times, has made it abundantly clear where real joy can be found, and he has placed the emphasis for real joy squarely on the family.

These statements and others update and reemphasize the Lord\u2019s injunction to Adam and Eve in the Garden when he commanded them to \u201cbe fruitful, and multiply and replenish the earth.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23853\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23853)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23853)\">Gen. 1:28<\/a><\/span>.)

And the Prophet Joseph Smith also added to this statement when he said, \u201cHappiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it. \u2026\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, <\/span>p. 255.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p35\" class=\"\">From what we have considered, that path inevitably leads to the altar of the temple. I have, many times, seen the Spirit lift choice young people who had come to the temple to become a family; and it seemed to me in these instances that the temple became a \u201cheavenly family house,\u201d the sealing room became a \u201cheavenly family room,\u201d and the altar of the temple became a \u201cheavenly family altar.\u201d For as they knelt there, they were joined by the Lord through his priesthood for all eternity and thus were made \u201cone,\u201d a family, in the Lord. The importance of this ordinance cannot be overemphasized, for if we raise a family outside the temple, we may lose it. We have no promise with respect to the continuation of family ties after we leave this life unless the covenants have been solemnized at the altar of the temple. Otherwise, it is only \u201cuntil death do ye part.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p36\" class=\"\">God is the Heavenly Father of the human family.
