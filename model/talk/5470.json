To a group of disciples in the New World, a group anxious to be taught by him and even more anxious because he would soon be leaving them, he asked, \u201cWhat manner of men ought ye to be?\u201d Then in the same breath he gave this answer: \u201cEven as I am\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6359\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6359)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6359)\">3 Ne. 27:27<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/what-manner-of-men-ought-ye-to-be.p5\" class=\"\">The world is full of people who are willing to tell us, \u201cDo as I say.\u201d Surely we have no lack of advice givers on about every subject.

The only sure way! The light and the life of the world! How grateful we should be that God sent his Only Begotten Son to earth to do at least two things that no other person could have done. The first task Christ did as a perfect, sinless Son was to redeem all mankind from the Fall, providing an atonement for Adam\u2019s sin and for our own sins if we will accept and follow him. The second great thing he did was to set a perfect example of right living, of kindness and mercy and compassion, in order that all of the rest of mankind might know how to live, know how to improve, and know how to become more godlike.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/what-manner-of-men-ought-ye-to-be.p11\" class=\"\">Let us follow the Son of God in all ways and in all walks of life.

We must follow Christ, in the best sense of that word. We must be about his work as he was about his Father\u2019s. We should try to be like him, even as the Primary children sing, \u201cTry, try, try\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Children\u2019s Songbook,<\/span> p. 55).
