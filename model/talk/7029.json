It provides a foundation for happiness. It is a condition of immense worth, yet there are few on earth that enjoy it. Why? Most often because the principles upon which peace of conscience is founded are either not understood or not adequately followed. My life has been so richly endowed from peace of conscience that I would share insights on how it can be obtained.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/peace-of-conscience-and-peace-of-mind.p6\" class=\"\">Peace of conscience is the essential ingredient to your peace of mind. Without peace of conscience, you can have no real peace of mind. Peace of conscience relates to your inner self and is controlled by what you personally do. Peace of conscience can come only from God through a righteous, obedient life. It cannot exist otherwise. On the other hand, peace of mind is most often affected by external forces such as concern for a wayward child, economic pressures, real or imagined offenses, deteriorating world conditions, or more to do than sufficient time to do it. An unsettled mind is temporary, transitory. Peace of mind is restored by resolving the external forces that disturb it. Not so with a troubled conscience, for it is unrelenting, ever present, a constant reminder of the need to correct your past mistakes, to resolve an offense to another, or to repent of transgression. Oh, a disturbed conscience can be temporarily masked by physical stimulation of the mind and body where one yields to the temptations of alcohol, drugs, pornography, and worse. All this at the cost of an increased appetite for false efforts to calm an aching conscience with the risk of incurring unrelenting addictions. There is a better way to restore peace of conscience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/peace-of-conscience-and-peace-of-mind.p7\" class=\"\">The ability to have an unsettled conscience is a gift of God to help you succeed in this mortal life. It results principally from the influence of the Light of Christ on your mind and heart. The Light of Christ is that divine power or influence that emanates from God through Jesus Christ.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-24911_000_007\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Topical Guide, \u201cLight of Christ,\u201d 290.]<\/span><\/sup> It gives light and life to all things.

The Light of Christ is not a person. It is a power and influence that comes from God and when followed can lead a person to qualify for the guidance and inspiration of the Holy Ghost.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-24911_000_007\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43718\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43718)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43718)\">John 1:9<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43983\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43983)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43983)\">D&amp;C 84:46\u201347<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/peace-of-conscience-and-peace-of-mind.p8\" class=\"\">It is well to remember that even with peace of conscience you can have temporary periods when your peace of mind is interrupted by external concerns. Your understanding of the causes can relieve much of the pressure they generate. As your personal life conforms to the teachings of the Lord, you can seek His help in resolving the troubling issues. Thus your faith in the Lord and in His teachings will yield peace of mind. Your efforts will be stepping-stones to greater personal growth as Spirit-guided solutions are found. In addition, as they are resolved such challenges can often bring blessings to others when their needs have caused the disturbed feelings in your mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/peace-of-conscience-and-peace-of-mind.p9\" class=\"\">In summary, you can regain peace of conscience by repenting of personal transgressions that cause you internal turmoil. Then peace of mind can be secured by resolving the external pressures that cause you temporary anxiety, worry, and distress. Yet try as you might, you will not find enduring happiness until, through repentance, you satisfy personally broken law to restore peace to a troubled conscience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/peace-of-conscience-and-peace-of-mind.p10\" class=\"\">Whether you are one who recognizes a need to repent and are finding it difficult to do so or one who wonders if you have repented enough to be fully forgiven, it may be helpful to review some fundamental principles upon which peace of conscience is founded.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/peace-of-conscience-and-peace-of-mind.p11\" class=\"\">Broken law from sin or transgression causes anguish of mind and heart from an offended conscience. Knowing that all of His spirit children save His Only Begotten, Jesus Christ, would unintentionally or intentionally violate His laws, our Eternal Father provided a means to correct the consequences of such acts. Whether the violation be great or small, the solution is the same: full repentance through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement with obedience to His commandments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/peace-of-conscience-and-peace-of-mind.p12\" class=\"\">When needed, full repentance will require action on your part. If you are not familiar with the classic steps to repentance, such as <span class=\"emphasis\">confession and abandonment of sin, restitution, obedience, and seeking forgiveness,<\/span> talk to a bishop or study a source such as President Spencer W. Kimball\u2019s masterly work <span class=\"emphasis\">The Miracle of Forgiveness.<\/span> In addition to fulfilling those requirements, the return of your peace of conscience will be hastened by careful attention to another step that is sometimes not recognized. The Savior has made it clear that to receive forgiveness you must forgive others their offenses against you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/peace-of-conscience-and-peace-of-mind.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cI, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/peace-of-conscience-and-peace-of-mind.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd ye ought to say in your hearts\u2014let God judge between me and thee, and reward thee according to thy deeds.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-24911_000_007\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43957\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43957)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43957)\">D&amp;C 64:10\u201311<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/peace-of-conscience-and-peace-of-mind.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/peace-of-conscience-and-peace-of-mind.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cBut if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-24911_000_007\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43709\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43709)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43709)\">Mark 11:25\u201326<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/peace-of-conscience-and-peace-of-mind.p17\" class=\"\">If as an innocent victim you have been seriously wronged, don\u2019t harbor feelings of hatred, anger at what appears to be unjust.

If there is discipline required for a serious transgression against you, leave that to the Church and civil authorities. Don\u2019t burden your own life with thoughts of retribution. The Lord\u2019s mill of justice grinds slowly, but it grinds exceedingly well. In the Lord\u2019s economy, no one will escape the consequences of unresolved violation of His laws. In His time and in His way full payment will be required for unrepented evil acts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/peace-of-conscience-and-peace-of-mind.p18\" class=\"\">I testify that of all the necessary steps to repentance, the most critically important is for you to have a conviction that forgiveness comes in and through Jesus Christ.
