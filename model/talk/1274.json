Packer, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1963, pp. 106-109<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nIn 1833 a revelation was given by the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith known as the Word\nof Wisdom, given as a principle with a promise\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14309\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14309)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14309)\">D&amp;C 89:3<\/a><\/span>). This principle has not been neglected by the\nleaders of the Church nor abandoned by them. It has been reaffirmed vigorously, as one theme\nof this conference, for we have learned that however much a generation of people learn a\ntruth, it must be rediscovered by each succeeding generation.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is to the young people of our generation that I speak. Some may regard as trivial the\nassignment to speak to young people. I consider it otherwise and sense the meaning of an\nappeal made by the late President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., in speaking to the teachers of the\nChurch. \"May he,\" President Clark said, \"give you entrance to the hearts of those you teach\nand then make you know that as you enter there you stand in holy places.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSome young people, not members of the Church, may not be acquainted with the revelation\nknown as the Word of Wisdom. It is simply this, a law of temperance. In it we are counseled\nby the Lord to refrain from: the use of alcoholic beverages&mdash;any of them, tobacco in any\nform, and from hot drinks&mdash;understood by the Church to mean those with habit-forming\npotential, specifically coffee and tea.\n<\/p><p>\nMembers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are expected to live this\nprinciple.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has directed that observance of this principle is a condition of membership for one\nseeking baptism into his Church. For the member of the Church, compliance with this law is a\nprerequisite for the bestowal of the priesthood, for a call to missionary service, for temple\nendowments or temple marriage.\n<\/p><p>\nYou who are young members of the Church full well know that preliminary to such a call\nyou will be interviewed, and the question will be put to you directly, \"Do you keep the Word\nof Wisdom?\" If you must confess that you do not, and if there is reasonable doubt that you\ncan honor a commitment to live the principle, your opportunity may be withheld from you.\n<\/p><p>\nYou may have difficulty, my young friends, understanding why the Lord should require his\nservants to hold so stedfastly to this rule, particularly when the use of alcohol, tobacco, and\nhot drinks is practised so commonly in the world, and when we seem to run the risk of\ndriving many fine young people from activity in the Church. Some say we are too persistent\nin stressing this principle&mdash;that indeed it has been over-stressed.\n<\/p><p>\nA principle with a promise such as this could hardly be over-stressed. It may well have been\nstressed in a negative way, emphasizing only the \"Don't.\"\n<\/p><p>\nA father, censuring his little son for some mischief, demanded an explanation from the boy.\n\"Why,\" he said with exasperation, \"did you <i>do<\/i> such a thing?\" The little lad was thoughtful for\na moment, then, \"If I'd had a 'why,' Daddy, I wouldn't have done it.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt isn't always easy to give you a \"why\" for everything. But we owe it to you of the coming\ngeneration to do more than just say, \"Don't!\" There are several \"whys\" for the Word of\nWisdom.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first \"why\" concerns the effect upon your body. The case against tobacco as the killer in\nlung cancer, and the indictment for accident, death, and moral mischief returned against alcohol\nare so well substantiated that hardly anyone would wish to act as attorney for the defense\nwhen these two malefactors are brought to trial.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Word of Wisdom offers protection to your body. Part of the promise reads: \"And all\nsaints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the\ncommandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; \n<\/p><p>\n\"And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14314\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14314)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14314)\">D&amp;C 89:18,20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBut the greatest loss in failing to observe the Word of Wisdom is not what may happen to\nyour lungs or to your brain or to your coordination. There is another \"why\" much more\nimportant even than this.\n<\/p><p>\nNo doubt you have noticed that some, who have achieved so-called success, have not kept the\nWord of Wisdom; for instance, you may know a businessman who provides generously for\nhis family, and you know that he does not. Or you may know of a political figure who seems\nto command the vote of the people in spite of known intemperance. You could hardly escape\nthe example of the movie queen&mdash;fair in face and figure&mdash;who makes no effort to hide her\ndissipation. Or the athlete who has run up impressive records, yet openly endorses one brand\nor another of these injurious agents.\n<\/p><p>\nHe seems to run without fainting, you reason, and bewildered you may wonder \"Why?\" How\ncan this principle be so intensely important when so many people&mdash;some of them who have\nbeen taught otherwise&mdash;abuse the principle and yet seem immune from any penalties? You,\nmy young friends, have a greater calling than that in the business world, or\nas a political figure, or as an athlete. Your opportunity is not so much in what you will\ncontribute materially but in the influence that you may have spiritually.\n<\/p><p>\nTo those who keep the Word of Wisdom the promise is given of \". . . wisdom and great\ntreasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14316\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14316)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14316)\">D&amp;C 89:19<\/a><\/span>). Our spiritual senses are\nmore delicately balanced than any of our physical senses. Like a fine radio receiver with a\nsensitive tuning mechanism, they can easily be thrown off channel or even jammed by\ncorrosive influences introduced into our minds and bodies.\n<\/p><p>\nYou, my young friends, can be sensitive to inspiration and spiritual guidance. To do this you\nneed the wisdom and treasures of knowledge&mdash;they constitute a spiritual confirmation, your\ntestimony of the truth. To have this witness fulfills the promise of the Lord. To be denied it is\nthe penalty.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is yet another \"why\"&mdash;perhaps the most important of all. In the fourth verse of the\nrevelation we read: \"Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils and\ndesigns which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have named\nyou, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation&mdash;\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14310\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14310)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14310)\">D&amp;C 89:4<\/a><\/span>).\nThis is a solemn&mdash;even frightening warning. But in the promise we are offered protection.\nTo understand, we turn in the Old Testament to the account of the ten plagues of Egypt.\n<\/p><p>\nMoses and Aaron were negotiating for the release of the Israelites from bondage. Nine\nplagues were called forth upon Egypt, but none of them softened the Pharaoh's heart. The\nLord said then unto Moses: \". . . Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon\nEgypt; afterwards he will let you go hence . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the\nland of Egypt . . . and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22706\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22706)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22706)\">Ex. 11:1<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22707\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22707)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22707)\">Ex. 12:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nUnder a strange requirement, Israel was to escape this judgment. They were instructed to take\na lamb, a male of the first year, without blemish. It was to be slain and prepared as a feast.\nThey were instructed to take of the blood of the lamb and strike it upon the doorposts of the\nhouses, \"And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I\nsee the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22708\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22708)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22708)\">Ex. 12:13<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd it is recorded that the plague of death was visited upon Egypt from \". . .\nthe firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the\ndungeon\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22709\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22709)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22709)\">Ex. 12:29<\/a><\/span>).\nBut Israel, because of the blood of the lamb, was spared, for the\nplague of death passed over them and did not slay them.\n<\/p><p>\nRemarkable, is it not, that in addition to the other promises offered to those who observe the\nWord of Wisdom, we find in the last verses of the revelation this additional promise: \"And I,\nthe Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the\nchildren of Israel, and not slay them\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14317\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14317)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14317)\">D&amp;C 89:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nCan you understand now, my young friends, why we stress so strongly this principle? It is\nnot, certainly not, to drive any of you from activity in the Church, but that your blessings\nmay be full. Some have said of you who are young that you are attracted to the low standard,\nto the easy course, to the careless way. I say they who would sell youth so cheaply do not\nknow you.\n<\/p><p>\nSome of you who are young, and many perhaps who are older, have unwittingly been\ntampering with, or have become addicted to, the use of alcohol, tobacco, or hot drinks.\nProbably you feel estranged, even rejected, by the Lord and by his Church.\n<\/p><p>\nIf you only knew how he yearns to open the flood gates of blessings. How he cries for you as\ndid David for Absalom, \". . . my son, my son!\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4997\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4997)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4997)\">2 Sam. 18:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe make no apologies for holding to a standard that the Lord has set. In this ominous day\nwhen spiritual strength is so desperately needed, we invite all youth to come where a\nstandard is kept, where the challenge is great, where much is required, where\nthe gospel is lived.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that he is the Lamb of God, crucified\nthat men might live. Though we suffer mortal death, through the blood of the Lamb we have\namnesty from spiritual death if we keep the commandments of the Lord, for it shall pass over\nus and not slay us. This witness may come to you even in your youth. On the basis of this\npersonal testimony I commend to you the Word of Wisdom, which is not only a code of\nhealth, but quite as much a key to spiritual wisdom&mdash;a principle with a promise&mdash;in the\nname of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
