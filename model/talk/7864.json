One of the most meaningful and important ways to establish real growth in the Church is to reach out and rescue those who have been baptized yet are wandering in a less-active state, void of the blessings and saving ordinances. Regardless of our individual calling\u2014home or visiting teacher, Sunday School teacher, bishop, father, mother, or General Authority\u2014all can engage in the rescuing effort in a meaningful way. After all, bringing all\u2014our family, nonmembers, less active, sinners\u2014to Christ to receive the saving ordinances is the divine calling that we all share.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p6\" class=\"\">One Sunday morning some 30 years ago, while I was serving in a stake presidency, we received a telephone call from one of our faithful bishops. He explained that his ward had grown so rapidly that he could no longer provide a meaningful calling to all worthy members. His plea to us was that we divide the ward. While waiting for such approval, we decided as a stake presidency that we would visit the ward and call all these wonderful, worthy brothers and sisters to be stake missionaries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p7\" class=\"\">About the third person I visited was a young female student attending the local university. After chatting for a few moments, I issued the call to serve as a missionary. There was silence for a few moments. Then she said, \u201cPresident, don\u2019t you know that I am not active in the Church?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p8\" class=\"\">After a few moments of silence on my part, I said, \u201cNo, I did not know you were not active.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p9\" class=\"\">She answered, \u201cI have not been active in the Church for years.\u201d Then she said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that when you have been inactive, it\u2019s not all that easy to come back?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p10\" class=\"\">I responded, \u201cNo. Your ward starts at 9:00\u00a0a.m. You come into the chapel, and you are with us.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p11\" class=\"\">She answered, \u201cNo, it is not that easy. You worry about a lot of things. You worry if someone will greet you or if you will sit alone and unnoticed during the meetings. And you worry about whether you will be accepted and who your new friends will be.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p12\" class=\"\">With tears rolling down her cheeks, she continued, \u201cI know that my mother and father have been praying for me for years to bring me back into the Church.\u201d Then after a moment of silence, she said, \u201cFor the last three months I have been praying to find the courage, the strength, and the way to come back into activity.\u201d Then she asked, \u201cPresident, do you suppose this calling could be an answer to those prayers?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p13\" class=\"\">My eyes started to water as I responded, \u201cI believe the Lord has answered your prayers.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p14\" class=\"\">She not only accepted the call; she became a fine missionary. And I\u2019m certain she brought much joy not only to herself but also to her parents and probably other family members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"preamble\">There were several things I learned or was reminded of with this and similar interviews:<\/p><ul class=\"bullet\"><li><span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I learned that many less-active members have loved ones on their knees daily petitioning the Lord for help in rescuing their loved one.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I learned that it is not all that easy or comfortable for a less-active member to just walk back into the Church.

As they approached their assignment, Alma pleaded with the Lord with these words:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cO Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them <span class=\"emphasis\">again<\/span> unto thee in Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, O Lord, their souls are precious, and <span class=\"emphasis\">many of them are our brethren;<\/span> therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122925\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122925)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122925)\">Alma 31:34\u201335<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p26\" class=\"\">A few months ago after a meeting with new converts and less-active members, a reactivated gentleman about my age came up to me and said, \u201cI am one who has been less active most of my life. I fell away from the Church early in my life. But I am back now, and I work in the temple with my wife.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p27\" class=\"\">To let him know that everything was OK, my response was something like this: \u201cAll is well that ends well.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p28\" class=\"\">He responded, \u201cNo, all is not well.

And then I think of the scripture: \u201cBring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122927\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122927)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122927)\">D&amp;C 18:15<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p36\" class=\"\">To His Apostles, the Lord said, \u201cThe harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122928\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122928)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122928)\">Matthew 9:37<\/a><\/span>). The laborers need not be few. We have thousands of capable, worthy priesthood holders and millions of committed members of the Church in all parts of the world. We have functioning ward councils, priesthood quorums, Relief Societies, and other organizations all with the charge to rescue. Saving souls is the work the Savior has called all of us to do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p37\" class=\"\">Earlier in my remarks I referred to the prayer Alma offered as he and his companions embarked on the rescue of the Zoramites. During World War II approximately 500 U.S. soldiers and supporting locals were held captive in a prison camp. Because of the suffering and concern for their safety, a volunteer force of approximately 100 U.S. soldiers was selected to rescue these prisoners. After the volunteers were assembled, the commanding officer instructed them something like this: \u201cThis evening you men meet with your religious leaders, you kneel down, and you swear to God that as long as you have a single breath of life, you will not let one of these men suffer one more moment.\u201d (See Hampton Sides, <span class=\"emphasis\">Ghost Soldiers: The Forgotten Epic Story of World War\u00a0II\u2019s Most Dramatic Mission<\/span> [2001], 28\u201329.) This successful rescue was a rescue from physical and temporal suffering. Should we be less valiant in our efforts to rescue those who could suffer spiritual and eternal consequences? Should we make less of a commitment to the Lord?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p38\" class=\"\">In conclusion, our commitment as members of Christ\u2019s true Church stems from the fact that the Lord suffered for every single one of us\u2014the nonmember, the less-active member, even the sinner, and every member in our own family. I believe we can bring thousands to the joy, peace, and sweetness of the gospel, and hundreds of thousands, even millions, in their following generations. I believe we can succeed because this is the Lord\u2019s Church, and by virtue of our priesthood and our membership, we are called to succeed. I bear that witness to you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
