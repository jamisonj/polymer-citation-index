She told him that he was out plowing. The neighbor then spoke with great concern. Earlier that morning he had passed the field and noticed Emery\u2019s team of horses standing in a half-finished furrow with the reins draped over the plow. Emery was nowhere in sight. The neighbor thought nothing of it until much later when he passed the field again, and the team had not moved. He climbed the fence and crossed the field to the horses. Emery was nowhere to be found. He hurried to the house to check with Lucille.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-bishop-and-his-counselors.p7\" class=\"\">Lucille calmly replied, \u201cOh, don\u2019t be alarmed.
