Hanks<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Of the First Council of the Seventy<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Marion D. Hanks, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1958, pp. 98-100<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nPerhaps no conference in my remembrance has devoted such effective and repeated emphasis\nto the home and the family, to children and youth, and to those who have to deal with them. \nNot attempting to correlate or specifically to fit in with what has been said, and out of my\nmodest experience and ability, I would like today, in the time allotted to me, to talk not to the\nyoung (which I have often done), nor exclusively to their parents, but <i>about<\/i> the young to the\nadult generation in and out of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nOut of my love for young people and the blessing of teaching them over the years and the\nassociation and friendship I have enjoyed with them, I have learned a few things, some of\nwhich I would like to mention today as pertinent to the general theme of home and family\nand the relationships of adult and youth.\n<\/p><p>\nAbout the young people I have learned these things, among others: \n<\/p><p>\n1. That by and large they are inclined to be like their parents, to be what their parents are. \nPresident Richards has impressively given the basis for my brief repetition of this thought.\nThere are, I am certain, exceptions, since each child, like each of us, is an agent before God,\nblessed with the right to choose and responsible for his choices. They, like we, must choose,\nand therefore some of them are not like their fine parents, while some improve upon their\nparents. But we may repeat with absolute assurance that by and large they are inclined to be\nlike their parents.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, this characteristic of youth can result in great good or in bad, depending upon what\nparents are, what kind of example and precept they present.\n<\/p><p>\n2. A second thing I mention about the young: they can be tremendously influenced by\ninterested adults other than their parents, by teachers, leaders, counselors, bishops, by\ninterested adults who will take time to love and give attention to them, to have confidence in\nthem, and faith, because young people, like the rest of us, respond to those who show interest\nin them. They love those who love them, trust those who trust them, and in general can be\ncounted upon responding to the type of adult who is interested in them.\n<\/p><p>\nOf course, this can be a good or bad thing, depending upon the kind of adults who show\ninterest, and what their motivations are.\n<\/p><p>\n3. A third thing I have learned about the young: They love an ideal. They are great followers.\nTheir ideal may be a singer, an actor, a teacher, a parent, an author, an explorer, a scientist,\nan athlete, but they are inclined to choose someone to idealize. Usually it is someone older\nthan they, more mature and adult, but not always.\n<\/p><p>\nThis, like other characteristics of the young, can be good or bad, depending upon the persons\nwhom they choose to idealize.\n<\/p><p>\n4. I have learned about the young that they can be taught, that they are responsive to the\natmosphere and environment of the world around them. They respond to advertising and\nexample, to filth and evil and degradation and bad influence, and they will respond likewise\nto virtue and decency and integrity and honor, if these qualities are manifested to them in\nlanguage they can understand.  They can be taught.\n<\/p><p>\nThis can be good or bad, depending upon the fare their minds and eyes are fed upon.\n<\/p><p>\n5. I note about the young that they are not easily misled as to individuals. They can often\ndetect quickly one who seeks to deceive them.  They can uncover in interested adults with\nquestionable motivations the real purposes of their interest.  Again and again I have seen it\ndemonstrated that they can spot one who tries to deceive, who pretends to represent virtue and\nintegrity and does not. It is also true that young people sometimes are more willing to follow\nan openly evil or cynical person than one who is not what he should be and pretends to be. \nTherefore, it matters a great deal that we be genuine and earnest and honest\nin our relationships with them.\n<\/p><p>\nBelieving that the young can be taught, and desiring to surround them with virtuous and\nuplifting and ennobling ideals, the Church has endeavored to provide experiences and\ninfluences and opportunities in the lives of the young which will bring into their beings, their\nminds, their very souls, the high and noble and decent things which will motivate them to\ncontributing, participating citizenship in the world and in God's kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nFor that purpose, the Brethren have provided a series of small cards and large posters, with a\ngeneral theme, \"Be Honest with Yourself,\" and some magnificent contributions have been\nmade to the young, contributions with which I am sure every right thinking adult, in or out of\nthe Church, would be sympathetic.  My experience as I have traveled the country and passed\non the idea to others not of the Church is that they have responded with great interest to the\nprogram.  Last night Brother Petersen announced that records have been added to this\nprogram&mdash;recordings of voices of successful, spiritual men, whose example and whose\ncounsel will bless the lives of the young.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I have one serious question to ask. I have talked about the young, and have said of\nthem that they are going to be like their parents by and large, but that they will respond to\ninterested adults outside of the home; that they are responsive also to ideas and ideals; that\nthey can be taught; and that we are attempting to get them to \"be honest\" with themselves. \nThe question I ask is:  \"Are we, the adult generation, honest with ourselves and with them?\"\n<\/p><p>\nTime will not permit any kind of extensive treatment of the problem or question, but I repeat\nit and ask: Is it possible that in our approaches to the youth we are missing the significance of\nthe opportunity to teach them that is ours? Could it be that Thoreau speaks of many of us\nwhen he says there are \"thousands hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at\nthe roots\"?\n<\/p><p>\nI read a statement by an interested modern observer a time ago, which is a little harsh,\nperhaps, but which I repeat because I am sure it has some truth in it. He says,\n<\/p><p>\nYouth has more to teach its parents than to learn from them.  The real savages are the old,\nnot the young. Much of what the young learn from their elders they acquire at their peril. \nThe world's tragedy is that it must be grown up&mdash;in other words, that it must be run by men,\nwho though they know much, have forgotten what they were in their youth.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd as a key to what I am hoping to suggest to you, in and out of the Church, interested\nadults, these words of Quarles: \n<\/p><p>\nThou canst not rebuke in children what they see practised in thee.  Till reason be ripe,\nexamples direct more than precept. Such as is thy behavior before thy children's faces,\nsuch is theirs behind thy back.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I point out an example or two. The Lord has given us counsel about the significance of\nthis magnificent machine, the body with which we are mortally blessed, and has taught us that\nthe body is an eternal component of the soul&mdash;that \"the spirit and the body are the soul of\nman\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13655\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13655)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13655)\">D&amp;C 88:15<\/a><\/span>).\nWe teach the young that their bodies matter, and that their care of them is important.\n<\/p><p>\nOn an airplane a week ago last Friday headed toward the East, I read out of the same section\nof one newspaper two interesting items&mdash;one a statement by a director of the American\nCancer Society that if Americans would stop smoking it is likely 25,000 of them would be\nsaved from certain death by lung cancer in the next few years.  And in the same section, the\nnotation that in 1957 Americans smoked 409 billion cigarettes, an increase of four percent and\nmore over the year before.  Can you say to a youngster, \"Be Honest with Yourself,\" in a\nworld where this goes on? Do you yourself contribute to the confusion that must result in his\nmind?\n<\/p><p>\nI read in that same newspaper (out of one edition in one day) another interesting item&mdash;a\nstatement about a 62-year-old practicing attorney in a Midwestern city who had given himself\nup under the pressures of a tremendous man hunt for a hit-run driver. A prominent leading\ncitizen, he confessed that he had a hazy notion of having hit something on his way home\nfrom a cocktail party.  The something he hit was a 31-year-old father of five\nchildren, a scoutmaster who died on the street where he was hit.  In newspapers and\nmagazines on the airplane were the blandishments of the liquor trusts, encouraging youngsters\nto be like certain \"men of distinction,\" like this man, perhaps.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are so many elements of the theme that there is not time to touch them, but I ask you\ntoday that when we cry to the young to \"be honest\" with themselves we consider what goes\non in the world around us, the movies and television, the books and plays, the advertising in\nthe newspapers we read, that so pervert the great creative capacity of man given us of God in\norder that we might find a partner, get married in his appointed way, establish a home and\nbuild a family, an outpost on earth of heaven's promise.  So many have perverted this\nmagnificent gift of God that we live in a world where sexual adventuring is almost, it would\nseem, a rule among many, looked upon as a form of amusement.  I say I cannot believe that\nwe can with honor and honesty tell the young to \"be honest\" with themselves knowing that\nthey are responsive to the example we interested adults set.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is so with us&mdash;we who claim to be followers of the Risen Christ and yet do not obey his\ncommandments.  It is so especially on this significant Easter day.  He said: \n<\/p><p>\nI am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27793\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27793)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27793)\">John 14:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYet there are those preaching in his name who are willing to be quoted in the newspapers as\nsaying that they prefer not to have the term Christian applied to themselves, for Jesus Christ,\nto them, said one recently, was a folk tale like Santa Claus.\n<\/p><p>\nI say to you that there are those who know for certain for themselves that God lives, that\nJesus is the Christ, and that living his commandments and being honest with ourselves is the\nonly way really to motivate the young to do what we would like them to do.  I testify that I\ndo know these things. God bless us that we may bless them as he intends we shall, I pray in\nJesus' name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
