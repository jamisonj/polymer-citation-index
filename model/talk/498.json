Romney, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1951, pp. 19-24<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nYe fearful saints, fresh courage take; <br \/>\nThe clouds ye so much dread<br \/>\nAre big with mercy, and shall break<br \/>\nIn blessings on your head.\n<\/p><p>\nIf I can enjoy the Spirit of the Lord, for which I earnestly pray, I desire to give you a\nmessage of hope and courage. I am prompted to this desire by the fact that in my recent\ntravels among the people, I have sensed a growing spirit of uneasiness and foreboding.\n<\/p><p>\nSPIRIT OF UNEASINESS\n<\/p><p>\nFollowing a welfare meeting held a few months ago on the Pacific Coast, in which we had\ncounseled the people to obtain permanent welfare production projects that they might produce\nthe necessities to carry on our welfare work without calling upon the Saints year after year for\ncash contributions, a sister told me she was comforted by our advice, that she felt it would not\nhave been given if the people were not to stay there permanently. She had been disturbed and\nworried by talk that bombs might be dropped in that area, necessitating their moving inland.\n<\/p><p>\nThis brought to my mind the experiences of youth, when in the colonies of Old Mexico we\nwere agitated over whether the troubles incident to the Madero Revolution would necessitate\nour leaving the country. At the peak of the disturbances, our stake president who was my\nuncle, Junius Romney&mdash;planted an orchard of young apple trees. I well remember how my\nmind was relieved by hearing people say that if we were facing expulsion, the stake president\nwould not be planting trees which would take years to mature. Notwithstanding the comfort I\ngot out of that assurance, we did have to leave.\n<\/p><p>\nNEED FOR HOPE AND COURAGE\n<\/p><p>\nI was, of course, unable to advise the good sister whether bombs would be dropped, nor did I\nknow whether the city would have to be evacuated, but I did have a great desire to give her\nsome comfort and courage which would ease her mind.\n<\/p><p>\nI remembered that President Joseph F. Smith had said that leaders in the Church \"should be\nmen not easily discouraged, not without hope, and not given to foreboding of all sorts of evils\nto come,\" that if they \"sometimes feel the weight and anxiety of momentous times, they\nshould be all the firmer and all the more resolute in those convictions which come from a\nGod-fearing conscience and pure lives. It is a matter of the greatest importance,\" he\nconcluded, \"that the people be educated to appreciate and cultivate the bright side of life\nrather than to permit its darkness and shadows to hover over them.\" ( Gospel Doctrine, p.\n193. )\n<\/p><p>\nCALAMITIES AHEAD\n<\/p><p>\nI could not give her, nor can I extend to you, much hope and courage based upon an\nexpectation that we are about to enter upon a period of world peace and security. I do not\nexpect any such happy circumstances to prevail in the immediate future. As I read the signs of\nthe times, in light of the revealed word of God, we are in line for something quite different.\n<\/p><p>\nA long time ago the Lord raised the curtain on the scene of destruction awaiting the\ninhabitants of the earth if they followed to the end the course they were then pursuing. More\nthan a hundred years ago, he said that a desolating scourge should go forth among the\ninhabitants of the earth, and if they repented not, it should continue from time to time until\nthe earth was empty and the inhabitants thereof utterly destroyed\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12863\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12863)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12863)\">D&amp;C 5:19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFor all flesh is corrupted before me; and the powers of darkness prevail upon\nthe earth, among the children of men.\n<\/p><p>\n. . . all eternity is pained, and the angels are waiting the great command to reap down\nthe earth, to gather the tares that they may be burned\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12883\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12883)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12883)\">D&amp;C 38:11-12<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nI am convinced that the overwhelming majority of men have chosen to continue down the\npath they were then following. I can discern no change in their course sufficient to justify in\nme a hope that the calamities which the Lord said he knew would come upon the inhabitants\nof the earth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12856\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12856)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12856)\">D&amp;C 1:17<\/a><\/span>) will be turned aside.\n<\/p><p>\nCOURAGE OF FAITH\n<\/p><p>\nBut we Latter-day Saints must not let ourselves be so engulfed with forebodings that we fail\nto obtain and enjoy such hope and courage as is within our reach&mdash;the hope and courage\nborn of faith in the power of righteousness to ultimately triumph. I have boundless confidence\nin that power. I am persuaded beyond all doubt that the destiny of men and nations is in the\nhands of the Almighty, who has respect for righteousness, and not in the hands of conniving\npoliticians whose wisdom has perished, whose understanding has come to naught\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12903\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12903)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12903)\">D&amp;C 76:9<\/a><\/span>), and who\nhave no respect for righteousness. If it were not so, I should be in utter despair. I believe that\nthe record and the word of God justify us in so placing our hope.\n<\/p><p>\nCHARGE TO JOSHUA\n<\/p><p>\nI cite your attention to the calling of Joshua, the successor to Moses, whose mission it was to\nlead Israel over Jordan and divide among them the promised land which was then inhabited\nby an armed and hostile people. It was a difficult and arduous assignment. To strengthen him\nfor it, the Lord gave Joshua a great promise and a great charge. This is the promise: \n<\/p><p>\nThere shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was\nwith Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd this is the charge: \n<\/p><p>\nBe strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an\ninheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them. Only be thou\nstrong and very courageous...\n<\/p><p>\nNow note with care how Joshua was directed to show his strength and courage, and also that\nprosperity was to follow his performance.\n<\/p><p>\n. . . that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant\ncommanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest\nprosper whithersoever thou goest.\n<\/p><p>\nMoses had been the living prophet during the days of Joshua.\n<\/p><p>\nThis book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein\nday and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein:\nfor then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success.\n<\/p><p>\nThe book of the law was the standard church work of that day.\n<\/p><p>\nHave not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither\nbe thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30042\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30042)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30042)\">Josh. 1:5-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs I read this scripture, I felt that Joshua's obedience to the teachings of Moses and to the\ncontents of the book of the law was the test of his strength and courage. The extent to which\nhe was to prosper, be unafraid and undismayed, and have the Lord with him, depended upon\nhis rating in that test. We can demonstrate our strength and courage in the same way, and be\nunafraid and undismayed and have the Lord with us whithersoever we go, by observing the\nteachings of the living prophets and observing to do according to all that is written in the\nstandard works of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nTEACHINGS OF WILFORD WOODRUFF\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the last years of President Woodruff's life, his mind dwelt much upon the calamities\nwhich were coming upon the earth, and he gave many warnings of them. But he did not leave\nhis hearers in despair. Always he held out to them hope and courage, conditioned on their\nrighteousness. Here is a sample of his teachings: \n<\/p><p>\nOver the millions of people on this earth, there hangs a cloud of darkness almost\nentirely upon their shoulders. Can you tell me where the people are who will be\nshielded and protected from these great calamities and judgments which are even now\nat our doors? I'll tell you. The priesthood of God who honor their priesthood, and who\nare worthy of their blessings, are the only ones who shall have their safety and\nprotection. They are the only mortal beings. No other people have a right to be\nshielded from these judgments. They are at our very doors; not even this people will\nescape them entirely. They will come down like the judgments of Sodom and\nGomorrah. And none but the priesthood will be safe from their fury.\n<\/p><p>\nBut he concluded with this note of assurance: \n<\/p><p>\nIf you do your duty, and I do my duty, we shall have protection, and shall pass\nthrough the afflictions in peace and in safety (<i>The Improvement Era<\/i>, Vol. 17, pp.\n1164-1165).\n<\/p><p>\nOn another occasion he had this to say: \n<\/p><p>\nI will say to the Latter-day Saints, if they will be faithful, and do what they should do,\nand listen to the counsel given to them, they need not have any fears about anything,\nfor the whole work is in the hands of God, the destinies of nations lie there. It is better\nfor a people to be wise, to get righteousness, to be the friends of God, than to occupy\nany other positions in life (<i>Journal of Discourses<\/i> 2:199, February 25, 1855; Discourses of Wilford\nWoodruff, p. 6).\n<\/p><p>\nPROTECTION OF RIGHTEOUS\n<\/p><p>\nNephi, speaking of our day which by the power of God he had seen in vision, said the Lord\nwould not suffer the wicked to destroy the righteous, but that he would \"preserve the\nrighteous by his power, even if it so be that the fullness of his wrath must come, and the\nrighteous be preserved, even unto the destruction of their enemies by fire. Wherefore, the\nrighteous need not fear\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1502\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1502)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1502)\">1 Ne. 22:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord renewed this same promise of protection to the righteous in 1831 when he said he\nwas angry with the wicked, that he was withholding his Spirit from the inhabitants of the\nearth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12894\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12894)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12894)\">D&amp;C 63:32<\/a><\/span>),\nthat he had decreed wars upon the face of the earth, and that the wicked should destroy\nthe wicked.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the saints also shall hardly escape; nevertheless, I, the Lord, am with them, and\nwill come down in heaven from the presence of my Father and consume the wicked\nwith unquenchable fire (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12895\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12895)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12895)\">D&amp;C 63:33-34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTwo or three months later, he continued: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace shall be taken from the earth,\nand the devil shall have power over his own dominion.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd also the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign in their midst\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12860\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12860)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12860)\">D&amp;C 1:35-36<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI am persuaded that a complete surrender to the principles of righteousness would lift God's\npeople out of the turmoil of this present world. Such has been the record in the past, as\nwitness the experiences of Enoch and his people and the record of the Nephites following\ntheir visit from the risen Redeemer.\n<\/p><p>\nZION A PLACE OF SAFETY\n<\/p><p>\nI believe a similar performance by us in our day would bring the same results. I not only\nbelieve, but I know it would, and that it will yet be done. I don't know just how soon, but I\nam looking forward with certainty to the fulfillment of the words spoken by the Lord to the\nChurch in its infancy, when he directed the Saints to gather together their riches to purchase\nan inheritance in Zion which he said was to be a land of peace, a city of refuge, a place of\nsafety for the Saints of the most high God. There the glory of the Lord is to be a terror to the\nwicked and a comfort to the righteous. Zion's inhabitants are to be the only people that shall\nnot be at war one with another, and every man that will not take up his sword against his\nneighbor must flee unto it for safety\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12890\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12890)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12890)\">D&amp;C 45:65-70<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it shall come to pass that the righteous shall be gathered out from among all\nnations, and shall come to Zion, singing with songs of everlasting joy\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12891\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12891)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12891)\">D&amp;C 45:71<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHOPE IN THE FUTURE\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I know, my brothers and sisters, that we will have our souls tested before we reach\nthese glories of the future, but if we have them in view and live righteously, we shall thereby\nbe sustained for the trials we must endure. Paul said it was the glory set before Jesus for\nwhich he endured the cross (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24233\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24233)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24233)\">Heb. 12:2<\/a><\/span>),\nand President Young said it was the vision of Zion as it shall be\nwhich sustained the Saints as they pulled their covered wagons from ruts and mudholes and\ntrudged across the plains. Therefore, with hope in the future, let us lift up our hearts and\nrejoice, and with strength and courage let us gird up our loins and take upon us the whole\narmor of righteousness, that we may be able to withstand these evil days, that having done all,\nwe may be able to stand (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21653\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21653)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21653)\">Eph. 6:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd as we journey through these anxious times,\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord bless thee, and keep thee: \n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee: The Lord lift up\nhis countenance upon thee, and give thee peace\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41093\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41093)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41093)\">Num. 6:24-26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
