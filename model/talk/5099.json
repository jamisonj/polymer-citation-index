President David O. McKay said, \u201cTeaching is the noblest profession in the world. Upon the proper education of youth depend the permanency and purity of home, the safety and perpetuity of the nation. The parent gives the child an opportunity to live; the teacher enables the child to live well.\u201d (David O. McKay, <span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Ideals,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Improvement Era, 1953, p. 436.) I trust we shall recognize their importance and their vital mission by providing adequate facilities, the finest of books, and salaries which show our gratitude and our trust.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/precious-children-a-gift-from-god.p17\" class=\"\">Each of us remembers with affection the teachers of our youth. I think it amusing that my elementary school music teacher was a Miss Sharp. She had the capacity to infuse within her pupils a love for music and taught us to identify musical instruments and their sounds. I well recall the influence of a Miss Ruth Crow who taught the subject of health. Though these were depression times, she ensured that each sixth-grade student had a dental health chart. She personally checked each pupil for dental health and made certain that through public or private resources, no child went without proper dental care. As Miss Burkhaus, who taught geography, rolled down the maps of the world and, with her pointer, marked the capital cities of nations and the distinctive features of each country, language, and culture, little did I anticipate or dream that one day I would visit these lands and peoples.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/precious-children-a-gift-from-god.p18\" class=\"\">Oh, the importance in the lives of our children of teachers who lift their spirits, sharpen their intellects, and motivate their very lives!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/precious-children-a-gift-from-god.p19\" class=\"\">The classroom at church adds a vital dimension to the education of every child and youth. In this setting each teacher can provide an upward reach to those who listen to her lessons and feel the influence of her testimony. In Primary, Sunday School, Young Women meetings and those of the Aaronic Priesthood, well-prepared teachers, called under the inspiration of the Lord, can touch each child, each youth, and prompt all to \u201cseek \u2026 out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19491\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19491)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19491)\">D&amp;C 88:118<\/a><\/span>.)

Why, the teacher can bring the Apostles of old and the Savior of the world not only into the classroom but also into the hearts, the minds, the souls of our children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/precious-children-a-gift-from-god.p22\" class=\"\">Perhaps most significant of all classrooms is the classroom of the home. It is in the home that we form our attitudes, our deeply held beliefs. It is in the home that hope is fostered or destroyed. Our homes are the laboratories of our lives. What we do there determines the course of our lives when we leave home. Dr. Stuart E. Rosenberg wrote in his book <span class=\"emphasis\">The Road to Confidence,<\/span> \u201cDespite all new inventions and modern designs, fads and fetishes, no one has yet invented, or will ever invent, a satisfying substitute for one\u2019s own family.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/precious-children-a-gift-from-god.p23\" class=\"\">A happy home is but an earlier heaven.

Charles Dickens, the author of the classic <span class=\"emphasis\">A Christmas Carol,<\/span> illustrated this fact when he described the humble Bob Cratchit family assembling for a rather meager but long-anticipated Christmas dinner. Bob, the father, was returning home with his frail son Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Tiny Tim \u201cbore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame.\u201d Bob\u2019s wife asked of him, \u201cAnd how did little Tim behave?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/precious-children-a-gift-from-god.p37\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018As good as gold,\u2019 said Bob, \u2018and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see.\u2019\u201d (Charles Dickens, <span class=\"emphasis\">Christmas Carol<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">Cricket on the Hearth,<\/span> New York: Grosset and Dunlop, n.d., pp. 50\u201351.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/precious-children-a-gift-from-god.p38\" class=\"\">Charles Dickens himself said, \u201cI love these little people, and it is not a slight thing when they who are so fresh from God love us.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/precious-children-a-gift-from-god.p39\" class=\"\">Children express their love in original and innovative ways.

But when a gift must be found, it is always some absurd little thing, pasted on crooked, \u2026 an angel looking like a clown. A child has so little that it can give, because it never knows it has given you everything.\u201d (Margaret Lee Runbeck, <span class=\"emphasis\">Bits &amp; Pieces,<\/span> 20 Sept. 1990.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/precious-children-a-gift-from-god.p41\" class=\"\">Such was Jenny\u2019s gift to me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/precious-children-a-gift-from-god.p42\" class=\"\">Children seem to be endowed with abiding faith in their Heavenly Father and His capacity and desire to answer their sweet prayers.

There he met Ricky Little, a stalwart Atlanta Braves\u2019 supporter, but a youngster afflicted with leukemia. It was readily apparent that Ricky was near death. Barry felt a deep desire to think of something comforting to say, but nothing seemed adequate. Finally, he asked if there were anything they could do. The youngster hesitated and then asked if they would each hit a home run for him during the next game. Barry said later, \u201cThat request wasn\u2019t such a hard thing for Dale, who in fact hit two homers that night, but I was struggling at the plate and hadn\u2019t hit a homer all year. Then I felt a warm feeling come over me and I told Ricky to count on it.\u201d That night, Barry hit his only home run of the season.
