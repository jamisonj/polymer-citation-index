Postmen delivered sealed envelopes, and small children placed at the doorsteps of special friends folded papers containing brightly colored pictures. Each contained a greeting\u2014a message of love. After all, Valentine\u2019s Day is a day of love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/sailing-safely-the-seas-of-life.p4\" class=\"\">Far from America\u2019s shores, in Hamburg, Germany, a public holiday also was being celebrated. However, a more somber mood prevailed. Amid fervent speeches, cheering throngs, and the playing of the national anthem, the new battleship <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> rumbled down into the River Elbe. This, the most powerful vessel afloat, carried not a message of love; rather, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> bristled with weapons of war.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/sailing-safely-the-seas-of-life.p5\" class=\"\">The mighty colossus was a breathtaking spectacle of armor and machinery. Construction required more than fifty-seven thousand blueprints for the 406-millimeter, triple turret, radar-controlled guns. The vessel featured twenty-eight thousand miles of electrical circuits, and thirty-five thousand tons of armor-plate provided maximum safety. Majestic in appearance, gigantic in size, awesome in firepower, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> was considered unsinkable.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/sailing-safely-the-seas-of-life.p6\" class=\"\">The <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck\u2019s<\/span> day of destiny dawned more than two years later, when on May 24, 1941, the two most powerful warships in the British navy, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Prince of Wales<\/span> and the <span class=\"emphasis\">Hood,<\/span> engaged in battle the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> and the German cruiser <span class=\"emphasis\">Prinz Eugen.<\/span> Within four minutes, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> had sent to the depths of the Atlantic the <span class=\"emphasis\">Hood<\/span> and all but 3 men of a crew of 1,419. The other British battleship, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Prince of Wales,<\/span> had suffered heavy damage and turned away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/sailing-safely-the-seas-of-life.p7\" class=\"\">Three days later, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> was engaged again, by four British warships. In all, the British concentrated the strength of eight battleships, two aircraft carriers, eleven cruisers, and twenty-one destroyers in an effort to seek and sink the mighty <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/sailing-safely-the-seas-of-life.p8\" class=\"\">Shell after shell inflicted but superficial damage. Was the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> unsinkable after all? Then a torpedo scored a lucky hit which jammed the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck\u2019<\/span>s rudder. Repair efforts proved fruitless. With guns primed, the crews at ready, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> could only steer a slow and stately circle. Just beyond reach was the powerful German air force. The safety of home port was ever so close. Neither could provide the needed haven, for the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> had lost the ability to steer a charted course. No rudder; no help; no port. The end drew near. British guns blazed as the German crew scuttled and sank the once proud vessel. The hungry waves of the Atlantic first lapped at the sides, then swallowed the pride of the German navy. The <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck<\/span> was no more. (See David Irving, <span class=\"emphasis\">Hitler\u2019s War,<\/span> New York: The Viking Press, 1977.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/sailing-safely-the-seas-of-life.p9\" class=\"\">Like the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bismarck,<\/span> each of us is a miracle of engineering. Our creation, however, was not limited by human genius. Man can devise the most complex machines, but he cannot give them life or bestow upon them the powers of reason and judgment. Why? Because these are divine gifts, bestowed solely at God\u2019s discretion. Our creator has provided us with a circulatory system to keep all channels constantly clean and serviceable, a digestive system to preserve strength and vigor, and a nervous system to keep all parts in constant communication and coordination. God gave man life, and with it, the power to think, to reason, to decide, and to love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/sailing-safely-the-seas-of-life.p10\" class=\"\">Like the vital rudder of a ship, we have been provided a way to determine the direction we travel. The lighthouse of the Lord beckons to all as we sail the seas of life. Our home port is the celestial kingdom of God. Our purpose is to steer an undeviating course in that direction. A man without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder\u2014never likely to reach home port. To us comes the signal: Chart your course, set your sail, position your rudder, and proceed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/sailing-safely-the-seas-of-life.p11\" class=\"\">As with the ship, so it is with man. The thrust of the turbines, the power of the propellers are useless without that sense of direction, that harnessing of the energy, that directing of the power provided by the rudder, hidden from view, relatively small in size, but absolutely essential in function.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/sailing-safely-the-seas-of-life.p12\" class=\"\">Our Father provided the sun, the moon, the stars\u2014heavenly galaxies to guide mariners who sail the lanes of the sea.

Most prominent among their number was that son of Adam born of Eve, even Cain\u2014a well-known name among men. Powerful in potential, but weak of will, Cain permitted greed, envy, disobedience, and even murder to jam that personal rudder which would have guided him to safety and exaltation. The downward gaze replaced the upward look; Cain fell.

Folkman D. Brown, then the Director of Mormon Relationships for the Boy Scouts of America, came to my office, having learned that I was about to depart for a lengthy assignment to New Zealand. He told me of his widowed sister, Belva Jones, who had been stricken with terminal cancer, who knew not how to tell her only son\u2014a missionary in that far away country. Her wish, even her plea, was that he remain in the mission field and serve faithfully. She worried about his reaction; for the missionary, Elder Ryan Jones, had lost his father just a year earlier to the same dread disease.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/sailing-safely-the-seas-of-life.p51\" class=\"\">I accepted the responsibility.

I said to the stake president, \u201cWho is the sister upon whom the sunlight is resting? I feel I must speak to her today.\u201d He replied, \u201cHer name is Belva Jones.
