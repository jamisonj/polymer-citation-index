We have so many interesting things happen to us these days that we\nlittle realize some of the great circumstances we find ourselves in.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I was reflecting just a moment ago, I think two of the greatest missionaries that the world\nhas ever known are right here today&mdash;our Prophet David O. McKay and our Tabernacle\nChoir. It is good to be in the presence of good people. I am going to take just a moment and\nreflect on one or two of the simple important teachings of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nIn preaching to the missionaries many times I have said that these commandments are the test\nof a missionary. I believe also they are the test of a Saint. The Savior had the ability to put\nmany volumes and many sermons into few words, and we find ourselves taking inventory\nwhen we read into the depth of his great counsel. These commandments\nhave been mentioned many times. You are well-acquainted with them.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus said, \"But I say unto you, Love your enemies\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35229\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35229)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35229)\">Matt. 5:44<\/a><\/span>).\nThat's not just so many words, you\nknow, that's a responsibility placed on a Saint. Quite often if we have an enemy, \"Well, if he\ndoesn't like me I don't like him. I can get along without him.\" There is no Christianity in this\nattitude. When Christianity is shown, it's when the individual says, \"Well, I love you no\nmatter how you act or feel toward me.\" When one does this, the tide of evil, the tide of\ndegeneration is stopped, love takes the place of enmity. Wouldn't it be great if we were all\nChristians with love for all in our hearts; there would be no enmity.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Bless them that curse you\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35230\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35230)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35230)\">Matt. 5:44<\/a><\/span>).\nHave you ever had someone curse you, and it made you angry,\nso you cursed them back? You showed them how to curse. Satan enjoys that; there's no\nChristianity in cursing back. There's a responsibility if someone curses you, and in this\nChurch it is not so unusual to be cursed or spoken against. \"Bless them that curse you,\" a\nresponsibility as a Christian&mdash;a follower of Jesus Christ. We must bless them that curse us.\nWouldn't it be great if you would visit and bless them. \"God bless you, I want you to know\nyou have my blessings.\" Can you see the tide of Christianity turning back the evil trend of\ncursing among God's children.\n<\/p><p>\nIt's not too easy to be a Christian. I'm only on one verse here of the Savior's many verses.\nThere are four commandments in one verse (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"35231\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35231)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35231)\">Matt. 5:44<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Do good to them that hate you\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35232\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35232)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35232)\">Matt. 5:44<\/a><\/span>).\nDo we always practice this commandment? Well, it is not\neasy. \"And pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35233\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35233)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35233)\">Matt. 5:44<\/a><\/span>). Did the Savior\npractice this? You know, to be a Christian, we must follow the Savior. It is easy to hide\nbehind Christianity, but it is not easy to be a Christian. Let's see whether the Savior practiced\nwhat he taught.\n<\/p><p>\nI'm not going to take time because the time is very short, but remember when the Savior was\nhanging on the cross, his accusers, his murderers at his feet; he could have said something\nrather severe and scolding, but no, he practiced what he preached. \"Father in heaven, forgive\nthem\" (see (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31602\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31602)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31602)\">Luke 23:34<\/a><\/span>).\nHe prayed for those who persecuted him and bitterly abused him.\n<\/p><p>\nI'm going to turn over a page to hurry, in this same great sermon. \"Enter ye in at the strait\ngate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be\nwhich go in thereat\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35245\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35245)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35245)\">Matt. 7:13<\/a><\/span>).\nIt's real wide, the gate's wide, and there is a great\nmultitude headed for it and many there be which go in thereat. These are the words of the\nSavior. \". . . strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there\nbe that find it\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35248\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35248)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35248)\">Matt. 7:14<\/a><\/span>).\nNot many will find the gate to heaven.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are\nravening wolves\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35249\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35249)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35249)\">Matt. 7:15<\/a><\/span>).\nA false prophet will teach false doctrine. Any false teacher is in that category.\n<\/p><p>\nNow the Savior gives us many wonderful keys here. \"Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do\nmen gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35250\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35250)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35250)\">Matt. 7:16<\/a><\/span>). What if you saw figs growing\non a thistle? You'd know they were out of place, wouldn't you? Grapes growing on thorns,\nit's just as obvious and just as easy to tell a true prophet as it is to tell that figs are out of\nplace on a thistle bush.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, a God without body, parts, or passions, uncreate&mdash;and the Prophet Joseph Smith\nintroducing back again a God with body, parts, and passions. Man saying the Godhead is\nthree in one and one in three&mdash;most difficult to explain and understand. Joseph Smith\nrestoring the knowledge of three separate Personages. You know the agnostic could say they\nare both wrong, but it is obvious they are not both right. It's as obvious as a fig on a thistle\nthat one is opposite the other.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus had Twelve Apostles&mdash;many churches do not have apostles. Our message is not a\ndifficult one to deliver to the world as soon as we can prepare the world for it. Then the Lord\nclarifies this, \"Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth\nforth evil fruit.\n<\/p><p>\n\"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring\nforth good fruit\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35252\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35252)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35252)\">Matt. 7:17-18<\/a><\/span>).\nPresident McKay does not build the kingdom of Satan, he\nbuilds the kingdom of God. He teaches the same gospel and doctrines that Jesus Christ and\nthe apostles taught.\n<\/p><p>\nOur prophet has asked us all to be missionaries&mdash;every member a missionary. That's the way\nto build this Church. Wouldn't it be great if all two million each brought one soul into the\nChurch. How many of you brought one new member into the Church last year? The prophet\nasked us to do it under the inspiration of the Lord because the Lord knows how to build his\nChurch.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat if it meant your life if you did not bring a soul in this coming year? You'd have him or\nher, wouldn't you? You'd bring your soul in. This is just a little way for the Lord to test and\ntell whether we love our neighbor as ourselves (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35266\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35266)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35266)\">Matt. 22:39<\/a><\/span>).\nWe'd do pretty nearly anything to save and preserve our own lives.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear witness that God lives, that David O. McKay is his prophet and mouthpiece. It is good\nto be in your presence. May the Lord bless each one, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
