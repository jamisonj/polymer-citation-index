For some fifteen hundred\nyears or more, perhaps, the world had lost the truth in relation to the Father and the Son and\nin the year 325, at a conclave that was held, they adopted a new idea entirely in regard to\nGod and confused the Father and the Son, and the Christian world, from that day down until\nnow, has looked upon the Father and the Son as being mysterious&mdash;I cannot say individuals,\nnor can I say substance, but some sort of spirit without separation and the idea of the separate\nindividuals, Father and Son, from that day on ceased to exist.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, if the Prophet was telling a falsehood when he went into the woods to pray, he never\nwould have come out and said that he had seen a vision of the Father and the Son and that\nthey were separate Personages, and that the Father introduced the son and then told\nthe Prophet to address his question to the Son, who would give him the\nanswer (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30398\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30398)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30398)\">JS&mdash;H 1:14-20<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Prophet never would have thought of such a thing as that, had it been a fraud.\n<\/p><p>\nIf he had come out of the woods saying he had seen a vision, had it been untrue never would\nhe have thought of separating Father and Son, nor would he have ever thought of having the\nFather introduce the Son and for him to put his question to the Son to receive his answer. He\nnever could have thought of it; for that was the farthest thing from the ideas existing in the\nworld in the year 1820.\n<\/p><p>\nThe very fact that the Prophet made that statement that he saw the Father and the Son and\nthey were glorious Personages, and that the Father spoke to him and introduced the Son but\ndid not ask him what he wanted, is one of the most significant things that ever occurred in the\nhistory of this world. The Prophet, if he had been telling an untruth, even if he had thought\nthat the Father and the Son were separate Personages, would have made another very serious\nerror, if he had lied about it. More than likely he would have said he saw the Father and the\nSon and the Father asked him what he wanted, and the Father gave him the answer. If Joseph\nSmith had said a thing like that, it would have been fatal to his story. He did not make a\nmistake. It was Jesus who answered his question, and the Father introduced his Son, just as he\ndid at the baptism of the Savior (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35003\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35003)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35003)\">Matt. 3:17<\/a><\/span>),\nand just as he did to the three, Peter, James, and John, on the\nMount (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35054\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35054)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35054)\">Matt. 17:5<\/a><\/span>),\nand the Savior gave the answer, as all answers have come from our Father in heaven\nfrom the beginning, since Adam was driven out of the Garden of Eden, down to this day.\nThey have all come through the Son.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, the Prophet made no mistake, and a boy of his age would not have known; he would\nhave fallen into a trap, just as sure as we live, if it were untrue.\n<\/p><p>\nDo I believe that the Prophet saw the Father and the Son? I certainly do. I know it. I do not\nneed a vision. Reason teaches that to me. And then I have that knowledge also by the\nguidance of the Spirit of the Lord. The Lord has made it known to me. So I thanked the\nchoir, as I sat here wondering what I would say.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, let me say a few things more about the\nProphet. I have that absolute confidence in every vision, in every manifestation, in every\nrevelation that has come to us through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I know he spoke the truth.\nAnd the evidence is made manifest in every act where there has been a manifestation from the\nheavens, either by the Son of God, himself, or by his servants the prophets of old. Everything\nhas worked out harmoniously and according to the revelations we find in the Old Testament\nand in the New. There were no mistakes made.\n<\/p><p>\nOn the 3rd day of April, 1836, certain\nheavenly messengers appeared to the Prophet and to Oliver Cowdery\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13930\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13930)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13930)\">D&amp;C 110:1-16<\/a><\/span>). First came the Son of\nGod himself. And they described him. Then the Lord sent certain messengers with keys to\nrestore pertaining to the restoration of all things. Moses came and gave to the Prophet the\nkeys of the gathering of Israel, otherwise you would not be here today, and through those\nkeys the gospel is being preached in all the world, and scattered Israel is being gathered out\nagain according to the fulfillment, that is, in fulfillment of the promises that were made by the\nLord to his ancient prophets, that he would gather Israel in the latter days.\n<\/p><p>\nElias came and\nrestored the gospel of Abraham. Who was Elias? That question is frequently asked. Well,\nElias was Noah (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13931\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13931)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13931)\">D&amp;C 110:12<\/a><\/span>),\nwho came and restored his keys.\n[Footnote: \"The priesthood was first given to Adam; he obtained the First Presidency and held\nthe keys of it from generation to generation. He obtained it in the Creation, before the world was formed, as in Gen. 1:26, 27, 28\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23657\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23657)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23657)\">Gen. 1:26-28<\/a><\/span>).\nHe had dominion given him over every living creature. He is Michael the Archangel, spoken of in the scriptures. Then to Noah, who is Gabriel; he stands next in authority to Adam in the priesthood; he was called of God to this office, and was the father of all living in his day, and to him was given dominion. These men held keys first on earth, and then in heaven.\" (<i>DHC<\/i> 3:385-386; <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>, page 157.) It was Gabriel who appeared to Zacharias and promised him a son, and who appeared to Mary and announced the coming of the Son of God as recorded by Luke. It was also Gabriel as an Elias who is mentioned in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 27, verse 7\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13856\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13856)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13856)\">D&amp;C 27:7<\/a><\/span>). It was Gabriel, or Noah, who stands next to Michael or Adam in the priesthood.]\n<\/p><p>\nElijah came and restored his keys, opening the way for the preaching of the gospel to the\ndead and the performing of the ordinances in the temples of the Lord, for the dead. The\nprophecy of Malachi was fulfilled (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32765\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32765)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32765)\">Mal. 4:5-6<\/a><\/span>),\nat least the beginning of it, and the keys\nwere again given through the coming of Elijah, which turned the hearts of the fathers to the\nchildren and the hearts of the children to the fathers so that we can go into the temple and do\nthe work for our dead. There is nothing, in my judgment, that has been revealed that is more\napparent of its fulfillment than the coming of Elijah, for this spirit has gone forth into the\nworld. It is not confined to the members of the Church, and I am sorry to say, it does not rest\nupon the members of the Church as fully as it ought to, but it has gone forth into the world\nso that there are thousands of those who do not belong to the Church, whose hearts have been\nturned to their fathers and who are seeking out the records of their dead, and preparing them\nso that we, their children, that is, the children of the dead may go into the temples of the\nLord and perform the labors that will give unto those who had no opportunity, when they\nwere living, to receive the gospel of Jesus Christ, to give them that liberty and the privilege,\nthat they, too, might be numbered in the house of Israel and receive the blessings of eternal\nlife.\n<\/p><p>\nDo I love the Prophet Joseph Smith? Yes, I do, as my father did before me. I love him\nbecause he was the servant of God and because of the restoration of the gospel and because of\nthe benefits and blessings that have come to me and mine, and to you and yours, through the\nblessings that were bestowed upon this man and those who were associated with him in the\nrestoration of the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless us, I pray, and guide us in all things and help us to keep the\ncommandments of the Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
