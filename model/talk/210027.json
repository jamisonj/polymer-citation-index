I came here to attend your Primary meeting of the juveniles; and as I was here, I thought I would stay over Sunday and talk to the fathers and mothers a little. And I would state, as is generally understood by you all, that we do not have our discourses arranged for us, or marked out particularly. Our ideas are to present ourselves before the people, and to seek for the influence of the Spirit of the Lord, that such things may be communicated as may be advantageous and interesting to those who hear. And, therefore, when we meet together in an assembly like this we ought all of us, both speaker and hearer, to feel that we are in the hands of our Heavenly Father, and to seek for the aid of his Holy Spirit, that the speaker may speak correctly and understandingly, and in a manner that shall be calculated to promote the welfare of the people, and that the people themselves may also be prepared to receive such things as may be communicated.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"128310\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 128310)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(128310)\">D&amp;C 50:17-22<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n680\"> We occupy a peculiar position on the earth at the present time, per<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"241b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD21\/JoD21_0241.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;241b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7668\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>haps a little different from that of any other people that have existed on the earth&#x2014;our thoughts, our ideas our principles, our organization, our doctrines, our ordinances, and everything connected with our religious matters are different from those of other people; and it is our opinion, and not only our opinion, but a certainty&#x2014;in fact, it amounts to knowledge among a great many of the Latter-day Saints, that the influences and principles that we have received have been communicated to us by the Almighty. We were not the originators of the principles we believe in; neither was Joseph nor Hyrum Smith, nor President Brigham Young, nor the Twelve; neither was any individual nor any people associated with the priesthood or the organization of the Church at the present time. We believe that these things have been communicated to us by the Lord; that they are in strict harmony with principles that have existed heretofore, to a certain extent, with this difference however, that in the various dispensations that have existed upon the earth since its formation, each one has had its peculiar role to fulfil, with  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"242a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD21\/JoD21_0242.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;242a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7667\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>certain duties devolving upon those operating to attend to.

And hence we are told that Adam, three years before his death, gathered together a great many of his people and the prominent authorities of the holy priesthood, and he blessed them, and being filled with the Holy Ghost, predicted whatsoever should befall his posterity unto the latest dispensation, including all the leading events that should transpire in the different ages of time, even until the winding up scene, associated with this our earth; embracing those things that have been and are to be brought <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"242b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD21\/JoD21_0242.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;242b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7667\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> forth in this the present dispensation.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"90319\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 90319)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(90319)\">D&amp;C 107:53-57<\/a><\/span> And, in fact, this dispensation, we are told, has been &#x201C;spoken of by all the holy prophets since the world was.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"71398\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 71398)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(71398)\">Acts 3:21<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"84530\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 84530)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(84530)\">D&amp;C 27:6<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"88114\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 88114)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(88114)\">D&amp;C 86:10<\/a><\/span> And, therefore, it must of necessity have been associated with the teachings of Adam, of Seth, of Enoch, of Methuselah, and of Noah, Abraham, Moses and many other prominent characters that held communication with the Lord, and who had revealed unto them his purposes and designs in the days in which they lived.

And at Bethel the sons of the prophets at that place came forth unto Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace. At this place Elijah wanted Elisha to tarry, saying that the Lord had sent him to a place called Jericho; but Elisha made the same answer. Elijah at this place made the same request of his companion, saying the Lord had sent him on to Jordan; but Elisha would not be separated from his master. And they went on to Jordan together; and when they came to that stream, Elijah took off his mantle, wrapped it together and smote the water which divided, so that they went over on dry ground. And when they had passed over, Elijah asked Elisha what he could do for him before he should be taken away.
