I had always been a good student in school\u2014that is, until we arrived in West Germany. There, my educational experience was a significantly different one. The geography we studied in my school was new to me. The history we studied was also very different. Before, I had been learning Russian as a second language; now, it was English. This was hard for me. Indeed, there were moments when I truly believed my tongue simply was not made to speak English.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/continue-in-patience.p16\" class=\"\">Because so much of the curriculum was new and strange to me, I fell behind.

Patience means active waiting and enduring. It means staying with something and doing all that we can\u2014working, hoping, and exercising faith; bearing hardship with fortitude, even when the desires of our hearts are delayed. Patience is not simply enduring; it is enduring well!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/continue-in-patience.p21\" class=\"\">Impatience, on the other hand, is a symptom of selfishness.

The lessons we learn from patience will cultivate our character, lift our lives, and heighten our happiness. They will help us to become worthy priesthood bearers and faithful disciples of our Master, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/continue-in-patience.p50\" class=\"\">It is my prayer that patience will be a defining characteristic of we who hold the priesthood of Almighty God; that we will courageously trust the Lord\u2019s promises and His timing; that we will act toward others with the patience and compassion we seek for ourselves; and that we will continue in patience until we are perfected. In the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-09205_000_025\"><a name=\"-09205_000_025\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-09205_000_025\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>See Jonah Lehrer, \u201cDon\u2019t!
