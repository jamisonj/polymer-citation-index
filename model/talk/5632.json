As I look across the lake of faces here in the Tabernacle and imagine the immense ocean of young women gathered in chapels around the world, I truly stand all amazed. For a farm girl from Herriman, Utah, this is a humbling sight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/fat-free-feasting.p5\" class=\"\">Sisters, I want to tell you a secret. I love to eat. Don\u2019t you? When food has the perfect herbs, when it\u2019s cooked just right, when it\u2019s served like a work of sculpture, I\u2019m in heaven. I can gain weight just reading a menu.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/fat-free-feasting.p6\" class=\"\">And did you know that the Lord doesn\u2019t expect us to diet? Trust me!

Now look at the very last line. It says, \u201cLet your soul delight in fatness.\u201d But feast on what? Chocolate?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/fat-free-feasting.p7\" class=\"\">Look closely: Feast on his <span class=\"emphasis\">word.<\/span> When was the last time you feasted on the word? Did you know that feasting could be so guilt-free?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/fat-free-feasting.p8\" class=\"\">One of the joyous parts of my new calling is feasting with our presidency. We begin our meeting by studying the scriptures. President Hales starts us out by saying, \u201cDoes anyone have a scripture?\u201d Someone always does. We look up cross-references, scour the Topical Guide, apply ideas to our own lives, and we think about you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/fat-free-feasting.p9\" class=\"\">This savoring the scriptures invites the Spirit. It\u2019s a bonding time, when, in addition to a red pencil, we share our hearts, our understanding, our desires. We become more united, more able to serve you. Are you doing this kind of feasting in your Beehive, Mia Maid, Laurel, or Young Women presidency meetings? Try beginning those meetings with a thought from the scriptures. I think you\u2019ll be surprised at the spirit scripture sharing will bring.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/fat-free-feasting.p10\" class=\"\">I wasn\u2019t very good at studying the scriptures as a young woman. I wish I would have! Not until I was living in Seattle, Washington, did a friend and I realize we were hungering to know what spiritual women in our ward knew. We wanted righteous children, \u201ctaught by their mothers\u201d to be believing (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10163\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10163)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10163)\">Alma 56:47<\/a><\/span>). And like a good dinner, the gospel becomes more exciting sharing it with a friend. I had Louise Nelson. We feasted together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/fat-free-feasting.p11\" class=\"\">I remember sitting on an old worn couch reading scripture stories to my sons. As we studied, a power began to permeate our lives. I learned that Ruth left her family to join the believers, that Sariah reared children in the wilderness, that Esther risked her life to save others, and that, most important, Mary bore a son in a straw-filled stable and laid him in a manger. I learned that God worked miracles in the lives of others, and he could work wonders in mine too.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/fat-free-feasting.p12\" class=\"\">I discovered the scriptures later than some. But I discovered them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/fat-free-feasting.p13\" class=\"\">And now, like reading a good menu, I still <span class=\"emphasis\">hunger<\/span> for their wise words. Why not gain some spiritual weight?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/fat-free-feasting.p14\" class=\"\">It\u2019s not always easy, and there are things I still don\u2019t understand. But when I look past all that, craving the Lord\u2019s companionship, the scriptures infuse my spirit with <span class=\"emphasis\">the<\/span> Spirit. They will do the same for you. They will enlighten you, lift you, comfort you, strengthen you. They will envelop you in a warm blanket of heavenly love. How do I know? Because they do that for me. It is Heavenly Father\u2019s promise to us. It is eating at the Lord\u2019s table.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/fat-free-feasting.p15\" class=\"\">Beloved sisters, I invite you to experiment upon the word, to feast.
