We are out of control.\u201d What force or power could soften the human cry for greater security, orderliness, control, even peace?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/the-power-of-goodness.p4\" class=\"\">My first memories of a need for power came when my family moved the year I began third grade. I started figuring out more about friends and other people\u2019s families. As my new friends talked to kids in the extended neighborhood, we sized up assets and numbers\u2014who had shade trees you could sit in or chicken coops you could climb on. Besides whose dad was the strongest, I noticed many of the kids were older than I. Luckily, I had two big sisters with lots of friends. In fact, I once said I could call out the whole high school if needed. I felt I had the needed personal power for safety and self-preservation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/the-power-of-goodness.p5\" class=\"\">My eight-year-old world was enlarging. So was the need for the skills that help one cope in this civilized world. I started appreciating the safety one gets from size, numbers, resources. Our use of what I call personal or political power begins early. Most children learn about size first. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop that, I\u2019ll call Mom.\u201d \u201cWhen Dad comes home, you\u2019ll be in big trouble.\u201d Resources can supplement our need for size. A toy becomes a stick. What begins as a snowman becomes a fortress. The world was at war in those days, but I was a third-grader. The physical danger I feared was the boy with a wooden gun that shot rubber rings taken from fruit jars. His target was girls\u2019 legs. Friends told me you could give the boy bottle rings and he wouldn\u2019t hit you, but adding to his arsenal seemed like a traitorous thing to do, and I doubted you could trust a commitment from a bully. I think a teacher eventually took his gun. In my world, I appreciated people who had power, like teachers and parents, especially if they had fair rules.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/the-power-of-goodness.p6\" class=\"\">That same year the community seemed to rejoice with our family when my mother gave birth to her only son after four daughters. My dad was an only son and now he had someone to carry on his name. Within months it was obvious that Tommy was severely handicapped. A force that was just the opposite of my outside world started to be felt inside. There seemed to develop a new dimension of love, tenderness, compassion. I watched my mother and dad make adjustments in lifestyle to lovingly care for a child who in his five-and-one-half years never learned to sit or speak but who warmed an entire room with his smile. The whole town seemed more gentle, interested, concerned. My outside fears were diminished. I felt securely attached because my mother and brother were there. My parents were home at night. Our home seemed more warm, full. There was a different power. It seemed to grow from the inside. It felt more permanent, unlike the temporary power I felt with my friends. It was calm and peaceful\u2014the power of goodness, the power of love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/the-power-of-goodness.p7\" class=\"\">There <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> a power in goodness that is often learned in families. There is a void when it is lacking. I know one family that left what they described as \u201cthe good life\u201d in a desire to <span class=\"emphasis\">do good<\/span> [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"8435\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8435)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8435)\">Acts 10:38<\/a><\/span>]. They agreed on a noble purpose that would take them to the Philippines for a year. The mother of this family reported, \u201cWe were flabbergasted it was so hard.\u201d Without the normal routine and conveniences of home, she said, \u201cWe were just the same old ornery people.\u201d Then they set a new routine\u2014exercise at 5:30 <span class=\"small\">A.M.<\/span>, 6:30 scripture study, then breakfast and school. Each afternoon they visited orphanages to play with the children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/the-power-of-goodness.p8\" class=\"\">Gradually the family started to notice a change\u2014new levels of patience, gratitude, and respect. They started to talk to each other\u2014to <span class=\"emphasis\">really<\/span> talk and to <span class=\"emphasis\">really<\/span> listen. The mother stated, \u201cI will never forget the learning that took place for me and my family the day they brought a five-month-old baby into the orphanage whose tongue had been cut and an eye poked out.\u201d When they learned the mother, a beggar, had injured her own child, it gave a new dimension to the social studies lesson they had discussed at home. A new level of compassion started to develop\u2014greater reverence for the sanctity of life. This family put their \u201ctrust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20255\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20255)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20255)\">D&amp;C 11:12<\/a><\/span>), and gradually they started to experience the power to become changed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/the-power-of-goodness.p9\" class=\"\">The powers of heaven are available to everyone through righteousness.
