I deem it a privilege and a great honor to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We meet in his name. It is because of him that we are here, and everything we do in this life, if it is really worthwhile, comes through him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/our-witness-to-the-world.p4\" class=\"\">We are Christians. We want the whole world to know that we are. Sometimes we are accused of not being Christians, but such is not the case. In the words of the great prophet Nephi, \u201c\u2026 we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3886\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3886)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3886)\">2 Ne. 25:26<\/a><\/span>.)

He is our Redeemer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/our-witness-to-the-world.p5\" class=\"\">In the meridian of time, his church was established upon a foundation of apostles and prophets, holy men whom he knew in the flesh while he walked upon the earth. They received his teachings. He ordained them and gave them authority to act for him in all things with respect to the salvation of mankind. He knew he was not going to remain upon the earth for very long, for he so stated: \u201c\u2026 the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36160\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36160)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36160)\">Matt. 20:28<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/our-witness-to-the-world.p6\" class=\"\">Therefore, he needed men to remain here upon this earth who could receive communication from him from heaven, where he would be. This kind of communication is known as revelation, and those who receive it are designated prophets by God. In the beginning of his ministry, he chose twelve special witnesses, who were with him in mortality. But after his crucifixion, he chose others by revelation, who may not have known him in mortality. Certainly Paul was one of these.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/our-witness-to-the-world.p7\" class=\"\">For a time, these men presided over the church and handled problems, set the affairs of the church in order. But over a time the church became corrupt. The members refused to follow the inspired counsel of the apostles. Paul wrote many letters trying to bring them back to the fold. Persecution became intense, and the apostles, who were prophets, were killed or otherwise taken from the earth. And when they were gone, the light of revelation went out. Even secular history records this period as the dark ages.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/our-witness-to-the-world.p8\" class=\"\">But as had been prophesied by the apostles and the prophets of old, a new day dawned and God once again spoke from heaven and called a new prophet in this day and time. He was but a lad in his fifteenth year. His name was Joseph Smith, Jr. God called upon him in a great vision in the year 1820. He spoke unto him from heaven and gave him commandments, and also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these things unto the whole world, and all this that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets: \u201cThe weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm of flesh\u2014<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/our-witness-to-the-world.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cBut that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/our-witness-to-the-world.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cThat faith also might increase in the earth;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/our-witness-to-the-world.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cThat mine everlasting covenant might be established;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/our-witness-to-the-world.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cThat the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15833\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15833)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15833)\">D&amp;C 1:19\u201323<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/our-witness-to-the-world.p13\" class=\"\">And so we have a new witness for God in modern America.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/our-witness-to-the-world.p14\" class=\"\">We are not Protestants, because we are not protesting against any person or group or organization.

We believe it too. Without faith it is impossible to please God, but there is more to it than just faith. There are certain ordinances you must receive, and certain authority that you must possess, and there are certain works that you must perform, so come, let us reason together.

So come\u2014let us share with you the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We won\u2019t take anything from you that you have that\u2019s true; we will just add to what you have, and we will do it in love, with no compulsion, no force; only love and sacrifice can bring people to a knowledge of the truth.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/our-witness-to-the-world.p19\" class=\"\">And now it would seem that we have sorted through the many different religions of the world and taken from them the very best parts of each of the churches. It would seem this way, but such is not the Case. We can show that each principle that we teach is taught in the Holy Bible, which is a record of God\u2019s dealings with his people, particularly the Hebrews and the Jews, generally speaking. But if all the Bibles on earth had been destroyed in the year 1830 (when this church was organized), it would still be organized exactly as it is organized today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/our-witness-to-the-world.p20\" class=\"\">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is distinguished from the church that the Master organized in the meridian of time by the phrase \u201cLatter-day Saints.\u201d These principles did not come from the Bible, but they came through revelation from God through a modern prophet, Joseph Smith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/our-witness-to-the-world.p21\" class=\"\">We have a message for all good men everywhere.
