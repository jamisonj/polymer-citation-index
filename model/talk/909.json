Dilworth Young, <i>Conference Report<\/i> April 1957,  pp. 118-120<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI cannot remember the time when I have not heard the story, quoted by Brother Bennion,\nconcerning the coming of the Father and the Son to the Prophet Joseph Smith. I am convinced\nas I grow older and become proportionately wiser that if boys and girls in our Church could\nkeep that story uppermost in their hearts, believing it, having a testimony of it, much of the\nills of our youth which President Richards so graphically portrayed this morning would not\nbe.\n<\/p><p>\nI am concerned however with one item which has recently been\ncalled to my attention on this matter. There appears to be going about our communities some\nwriting to the effect that the Prophet Joseph Smith evolved his doctrine from what might have\nbeen a vision, in which he is supposed to have said that he saw an angel, instead of the Father\nand Son. According to this theory, by the time he was inspired to write the occurrence in\n1838, he had come to the conclusion that there were two Beings.\n<\/p><p>\nThis rather shocked me. I can see no reason why the Prophet, with his brilliant mind, would\nhave failed to remember in sharp relief every detail of that eventful day. I can remember quite\nvividly that in 1915 I had a mere dream, and while the dream was prophetic in its nature, it\nwas not startling. It has been long since fulfilled, but I can remember every detail of it as\nsharply and clearly as though it had happened yesterday. How then could any man conceive\nthat the Prophet, receiving such a vision as he received, would not remember it and would fail\nto write it clearly, distinctly, and accurately?\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems to me, too, that had he evolved such a thing, his enemies would have used it against\nhim. In 1838 there was a crisis in the Church. Men were falling away. It was at that time that\nOliver Cowdery became disaffected. If any man in this Church had ever heard that story of\nthe first vision, Oliver Cowdery must have heard it. Yet his reasons for disaffection were\nnever given as an evolution of the first vision. Other men of that time did not use it as their\nexcuse. In 1844, when the final conspiracy was concocted to murder Joseph Smith, the\nreasons given by those men were not discrepancies in his story of the first vision, but rather\nother matters far removed from it.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Joseph wrote the story in 1838, men and women who had known him ever since he had\nstarted this work took the story in their stride; that is, it was common enough knowledge from\nthe beginning that no one took an exception to it. Everybody knew it; everybody had heard it;\nnot exactly in the words in which he wrote it&mdash;I believe no man will speak extemporaneously\nin the same manner that he will write something&mdash;but essentially the same, and when the\nSaints read it, it merely confirmed what they had heard over and over again.\n<\/p><p>\nHis mother should have known something about it. You will remember, he walked into her\nhouse that morning and told her that the church to which she had given allegiance was not\ntrue. To my way of thinking, he must have told her all about the vision. When she chose to\nwrite the story of her son's experience, she did not put it in her own words. I suspect that she\nmust have felt that so nearly was what he had written the way he had described it to her, that\nshe quoted his written statement.\n<\/p><p>\nAll of these things seem to me to add up to irrefutable evidence, although not said exactly,\nthat Joseph Smith, in 1838, told the correct story of his vision of 1820.\n<\/p><p>\nRecently I made some slight investigation, although not enough, trying to find the testimonies\nof some of those who had heard Joseph say these things before 1838. I did not find much&mdash;I\ndid not have time to look far&mdash;but I have one, which I should like to give you.\n<\/p><p>\nEdward Stevenson told how in 1834 the Prophet came to Pontiac, Michigan, Stevenson's\nhome town, and there held a series of meetings, attended by Brother Stevenson. Brother\nStevenson wrote that the following was the Prophet's testimony on that occasion:\n<\/p><p>\n\"I am witness that there is a God, for I saw him in open day, while praying in a silent grove\nin the spring of 1820.\" Then Brother Stevenson wrote: \"He further testified that God the\nEternal Father, pointing to a separate Personage in the likeness of himself, said, 'This is my\nbeloved Son. Hear Him'\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30372\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30372)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30372)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI submit this excerpt as enough like the story that the Prophet wrote to bear witness that he\nwrote it accurately and correctly.\n<\/p><p>\nI am of the fifth generation. I can remember the second generation. My grandchildren are of\nthe seventh generation. Likely in their day, they will remember not only my generation, but\nwill see also, before they die, the tenth or the eleventh generation. It is just possible that some\nof them may be interested enough to want to know what their\ngrandfather thought about these things, and they will investigate the conference reports. I\nshould like them to have in my words what I believe about this great event.\n<\/p><p>\nSo will you indulge me while I talk a moment to my grandchildren and to my\ngreat-great-grandchildren, to Loraine, to Parkie, to Charlotte, to Annette, and Wendy, and any\nthat may come hereafter. (I hope there will be many of them.) I want you to know that I\nknow that Joseph Smith walked into a grove in 1820, inspired of the Lord to do so, knelt\ndown, as he said, among the silent trees, offered up a prayer, and there he was given a vision\nin which he saw God the Eternal Father, who in his turn introduced to Joseph his beloved\nSon. The Son told Joseph many things which would transpire but of which he was not\nallowed to speak. Beginning with that vision, which gave us our first knowledge since the\ntime of the Savior of the true relationship of our Father and his Son to us, has grown this\nChurch. That is my solemn and humble testimony to those of my house who in the future will\nwant to know what I thought and believed.\n<\/p><p>\nIn order that they will have no doubt, and that no carping critic may read into my words\nthings that are not there, I should like to repeat for their benefit what the Prophet said when\nhe wrote his vision:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun,\nwhich descended gradually until it fell upon me.<br \/>\n. . . when the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory\ndefy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me,\ncalling me by name and said, pointing to the other&mdash;This is My Beloved Son.\nHear Him!

Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
