What I have read, heard, and observed concerning serious conditions confronting this\nworld in which we live makes me more appreciative than ever before of the testimony I have\nof things eternal.\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure we are all interested in security, and would like to say to all people living that if we\nare interested in security, we should live close to the teachings of the God of this land, who is\nJesus Christ, for he has said, \". . . and though the heavens and the earth pass\naway, my word shall not pass away\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13708\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13708)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13708)\">D&amp;C 1:38<\/a><\/span>).\nI think more people than ever before\nare turning their hearts to religion for an answer to some of the perplexing problems we face.\n<\/p><p>\nI find great joy in my work in the Church, and I hope it will always be my desire to have the\nwork of the Church come first. I like people who put \"first things\" first in the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is very encouraging to know that progress is being made all along the line. I enjoy my\nexperiences in the stakes with you people.\n<\/p><p>\nRecently, a young man speaking at a stake quarterly conference said: \"I am a very important\nperson in my ward. I hold the office of a priest. I am the only priest in my priests' quorum.\nIn our quorum, it is either one-hundred percent or nothing.\" It did not take long for this\nyoung man to prove to us that he was a hundred percenter. I admire the young men and\nyoung women who are achieving to be hundred percenters by the standards with which we\nmeasure them. I am sure we cannot measure all of their activities, but many of them are\nmaking remarkable progress. This is even carrying over to some of our bishops and some of\nour other leaders.\n<\/p><p>\nI learned not long ago while attending a Fathers' and Sons' banquet in the Summit Stake that\none bishop in a ward&mdash;and I guess he has been the bishop a long time or else it is the\ncontinuous record of two bishops&mdash;said they have not lost a boy to inactivity in their ward\nfor thirteen years.\n<\/p><p>\nIn another stake I attended, I heard a bishop make a similar report, but his was for six years,\nand still a third bishop in another stake said, \"We haven't lost a boy in our ward for five\nyears.\" Then I began hoping for the day when we could say to the whole Church, \"We have\nnot lost a boy or a girl in the Church this year, or for five years, or ten years.\" I think we are\nmoving forward and accomplishing things that we have never accomplished before.\n<\/p><p>\nI was interested in hearing a young Latter-day Saint girl speak on the topic, \"When and How\nDoes a Young Woman Make Preparation for Marriage in the Temple.\" As she developed her\nsubject, she said: \"I have come to one conclusion. There is a right way to get married, and\nthere is a wrong way to get married. If some young man does not propose to me who can\ntake me to the temple, I will convert one who can. I have a desire to be married the Lord's\nway, and I am going to insist that the man whom I marry is one who can take me to the\nHouse of the Lord.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI heard another little experience of a man who had recently been asked to supervise a district\nin ward teaching. He said, \"Bishop, I will accept on one basis, that we do one-hundred\npercent ward teaching, and when I am unable to maintain one-hundred percent, I quit.\" I got a\nletter from his bishop the other day, who said, \"For forty months, he has had one-hundred\npercent, and we see no reason why this will not continue indefinitely.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThere come to us many experiences of devoted and dedicated ward teachers to the\never-expanding ward teaching program. I learned of a pair of ward teachers who travel 180\nmiles each month to visit three families, and they always get the three families visited. In\nanother stake&mdash;I think in Florida&mdash;two ward teachers travel 160 miles each month to visit the\nfamilies in their district, and they are always doing one-hundred percent teaching. If I\nremember right, we had a report some time ago of two teachers in one of the Canadian stakes\nwho traveled approximately 4,000 miles a year to visit those in their district, and they\nfaithfully visited every family each month.\n<\/p><p>\nI learned of a faithful ward teacher up in the Ogden area who has just completed fifty-six\nyears as a ward teacher with a perfect record of never missing one month in the fifty-six\nyears' time that he has been a teacher, even though for the first ten years or more he had\ntwenty-five families in his district. He underwent a serious operation; he had some other\ndifficult problems, but his perfect record was maintained in spite of these conditions. He is\nheld in high esteem by the families in his district.\n<\/p><p>\nI learned of two high priests who impressed me very much. One of them is ninety-two years\nof age and served as a ward teacher for seventy years. The other at the age of ninety-four had\nbeen a ward teacher for eighty-two years, having started when he was twelve\nyears of age. This good brother indicated that he had only missed visiting his district four or\nfive times in this eighty-two year period. In my humble opinion, I think when men, who give\nthis type of service to the responsibilities that come to them, report to the other side, someone\nis going to stand there with outstretched arms, welcoming them into the kingdom of our\nHeavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nThe ward teaching program is one of the oldest programs in the Church, having come to the\nProphet Joseph Smith by revelation sometime between the first and sixth day of April 1830,\nin what is known as the twentieth section of the Doctrine and Covenants\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13719\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13719)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13719)\">D&amp;C 20:51<\/a><\/span>). The program is\ndesigned to reach the fireside of every family in the Church with a spiritual message at least\nonce each month and more often if necessary.\n<\/p><p>\nWard teachers carry a challenging responsibility, that is, to watch over the Church. Residing\nwithin a ward teaching district may be families and individuals whose activities represent a\ncommendable peak, while there may be some totally indifferent to things spiritual. You may\nbe interested to know that at the present time there are in excess of 139,000 men and boys\nserving as ward teachers in the organized stakes of Zion. During the year 1958, 3,386,000\nvisits were made to the homes of these families, and this represents eighty percent of the\nfamilies visited every month during the year, which is the highest record we have achieved in\nthe Church.\n<\/p><p>\nWard teachers are expected to promote the spirit of goodwill; be prepared to meet the\ncriticism of those who find fault. They are always to defend the Church, uphold its doctrine,\nand support its leaders; to strengthen those who are offended or weak in the faith; to comfort\nthose who mourn or have sorrow; to be among the first to offer assistance in cases of\nemergency and sickness; and to deliver a message of good cheer to the discouraged, the\nunfortunate, the aged, and the homebound. Their message should be gauged to meet the\nunderstanding of both the young and the old in each family.\n<\/p><p>\nIf ward teachers faithfully perform their duties, each family&mdash;and for that matter, each\nmember who is willing&mdash;will find themselves enfolded in the arms of the Church. In some\ninstances faithful ward teachers have been responsible for bringing people into the Church. A\nmember now residing in Arizona made this report to the stake president in my presence. He\nsaid: \"You do not know who I am. A few years ago, I came here from the East, having been\nretired because of poor health, and I was told that if I came to Arizona I may have an\nopportunity to prolong my life. I had a little money, and I invested in some real estate. The\ncity grew out my way, and my property became very valuable. I sold it, bought more, and I\nhave made a lot of money. In short, this is what has happened to me.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I have recovered my health. I have become a member of your Church, first having been\ncontacted by the ward teachers, who had the stake missionaries sent to me. I have made a lot\nof money. Now I would like to show my appreciation for the goodness of the Lord to me by\nhaving you select a number of young people who might serve as missionaries, but who\nhaven't the finances to take care of their own expenses. You call them and send me the bill.\"\nI thought that was a nice way to express his appreciation.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to close with another experience I have heard related in which ward teachers\nentered a family's home who were rather lukewarm, and even a little bitter, when the ward\nteachers came to pay a visit.\n<\/p><p>\nIn a brusk voice, the head of the family said, \"I am a very busy man. You can have fifteen\nminutes to get on with your message.\" This startled the ward teachers, and because their\nexperience had not been too great, they paused and wondered just how to approach the\nsubject. They learned about some of the children in the family, and discovered among them, a\nlittle girl who was going to turn eight years of age in just a few days. While they were talking\nto the children, the head of the family said, \"Five minutes are gone; you have ten minutes\nleft.\" They inquired a little further into the family, and after a few more minutes, the\nman reminded them again that they had five minutes left. In desperation, the\nward teachers suggested that the family kneel down and have prayer with them before they\nleft. This they did, and during the prayer, the ward teacher prayed that the Lord would protect\nthis little girl who was about to become eight years of age, that nothing harmful would\nhappen to her but that she might be baptized a member of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nThe following day, this man was mowing hay in the field behind his home. A number of\nchildren were playing in the yard, among whom was his little daughter. While making one of\nthe rounds with his tractor, the wheel of the tractor went over a mound. As he quickly looked\naround, he observed that his daughter was missing. A sickening feeling overcame him. He\nwent to the mound, pushing aside the hay, and deep below was his little daughter, who\nlooking up said, \"Daddy, don't tell them where I am. I am hiding from them.\" The prayer of\nthe ward teacher had been heard. The little girl's life had been preserved, and needless to say,\nthe family's reaction to the ward teachers was from this time forward, completely reversed.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we all have a desire to fulfil our assignments faithfully and well, and if possible, be\nhundred percenters. I cannot help but be reminded of the statement that the Savior made: \"Be\nye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34936\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34936)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34936)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>). To a\ngreat degree, we can accomplish this one-hundred percent perfection.\n<\/p><p>\nI leave you my testimony of the divinity of this great work, and my blessing, in the name of\nJesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
