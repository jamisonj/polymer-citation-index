I seek the guidance of the\nSpirit of the Lord in what I have to say.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the past week or two I have received a number of letters from different parts of the\nUnited States written by people, some of whom at least are a little concerned because they\nhave been approached by enemies of the Church and enemies of the Book of Mormon, who\nhad made the statement that there have been one or two or more thousand changes in the\nBook of Mormon since the first edition was published. Well, of course, there is no truth in\nthat statement.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is true that when the Book of Mormon was printed the printer was a man who was\nunfriendly. The publication of the book was done under adverse circumstances, and there were\na few errors, mostly typographical&mdash;conditions that arise in most any book that is being\npublished&mdash;but there was not one thing in the Book of Mormon or in the second edition or\nany other edition since that in any way contradicts the first edition, and such changes as were\nmade, were made by the Prophet Joseph Smith because under those adverse conditions the\nBook of Mormon was published. But there was no change of doctrine.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, these sons of Belial (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2547\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2547)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2547)\">1 Sam. 2:12<\/a><\/span>)\nwho circulate these reports evidently know better. I will not use the\nword that is in my mind. I started to read the Book of Mormon before I was old enough to be\na deacon, and I have been reading it ever since, and I know that it is true. Every member of\nthe Church ought to know that it is true, and we ought to be prepared with an answer to all of\nthese critics who condemn it. They are laying themselves open to punishment when they come\nto the judgment, and the Lord has said that such characters would arise. Moroni wrote about\nthem, and the Lord answered him in regard to the critics that \"fools mock, but they shall\nmourn\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22237\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22237)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22237)\">Ether 12:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe have been trying this year to get every man holding the priesthood, and our sisters too, to\nread the Book of Mormon during the year 1961&mdash;no matter how many times they may have\nread it before. It seems to me that any member of this Church would never be satisfied until\nhe or she had read the Book of Mormon time and time again, and thoroughly considered it so\nthat he or she could bear witness that it is in very deed a record with the inspiration of the\nAlmighty upon it, and that its history is true.\n<\/p><p>\nI can testify of that, for I know the Book of Mormon is true just as well as I know I am\nstanding here in this building facing you.\n<\/p><p>\nSo much for that. I want to address myself to the men holding the priesthood, particularly,\nand to their wives and to all other members of the Church. No member of this Church can\nstand approved in the presence of God who has not seriously and carefully read the Book of\nMormon, and I think I could add to that also, as far as our brethren are concerned, the\nDoctrine and Covenants.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have besides the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants, another record which is\npriceless, as these records are, that every member of this Church ought to have read, and\nwhich I fear many have not read. I have reference to the Pearl of Great Price. It seems to me\nthat a member of this Church would not be able to rest in peace and comfort and have a clear\nconscience without having knowledge by study and by faith of the standard works of the\nChurch. These records are priceless. The world mocks at them, but through their teachings we\nare permitted to come nearer unto God, get a better understanding of our Heavenly Father and\nhis Son Jesus Christ, become closer acquainted with them and to know more in regard to the\nwonderful plan of salvation which they have given unto us and unto the world if it will\nreceive the plan that will exalt us in the kingdom of God to become his sons\nand his daughters, receiving the fulness of that kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nIn closing this record, Moroni wrote these words: \"And I exhort you to remember these\nthings; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at\nthe bar of God, and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my words unto you,\nwhich were written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking\nout of the dust?\n<\/p><p>\n\"I declare these things unto the fulfilling of the prophecies. And behold, they shall proceed\nforth out of the mouth of the everlasting God; and his word shall hiss forth from generation to\ngeneration.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And God shall show unto you, that that which I have written is true.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every\ngood gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38292\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38292)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38292)\">Moro. 10:27-30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat is the counsel of Moroni as he closed his record, not only to the members of the Church,\nbut to every soul unto whom this record comes. I want to bear testimony to you, my good\nbrethren here, and our sisters and to the members of the Church who listen in and to everyone\nelse, that I know that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith received it from the\nhand of God through an angel that was sent to reveal it, the same angel who, while living in\nthis world, finished the record and sealed it up to come forth in this Dispensation of the\nFulness of Times.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to call your attention to one thing in the Book of Mormon. The Lord has\npromised us greater knowledge, greater understanding than we find in the Book of Mormon,\nwhen we are prepared to receive it. When the brother of Jared went upon the mount to have\nthe Lord touch stones to give them light to light their way across the great ocean, the Lord\nrevealed to him the history of this world from the beginning of it to the end\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22229\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22229)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22229)\">Ether 3:25-28<\/a><\/span>). We do not have\nit.\n<\/p><p>\nI am going to read one or two passages of scripture from the Book of Mormon in relation to\nthat matter.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And he\" (that is, Christ) \"did expound all things, even from the beginning until the time that\nhe should come in his glory&mdash;yea, even all things which should come upon the face of the\nearth, even until the elements should melt with fervent heat, and the earth should be wrapt\ntogether as a scroll, and the heavens and the earth should pass away\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5632\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5632)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5632)\">3 Ne. 26:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAll of that was written and given to the Nephites. We do not have that record, and the Lord\nsaid this&mdash;which is concerning us particularly&mdash;and Mormon wrote it: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And these things have I written, which are a lesser part of the things which he taught the\npeople; and I have written them to the intent that they may be brought again unto this people,\nfrom the Gentiles, according to the words which Jesus hath spoken.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And when they shall have received this, which is expedient that they should have first, to try\ntheir faith, and if it shall so be that they shall believe these things then shall the greater things\nbe made manifest unto them.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And if it so be that they will not believe these things, then shall the greater things be\nwithheld from them, unto their condemnation\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5633\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5633)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5633)\">3 Ne. 26:8-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI say that when the brother of Jared went on the mount, the Lord revealed the history of this\nearth to him from the beginning to the end thereof, but we do not have it. But when the\nNephites became righteous, after the visit of the Son of God, the Lord revealed that record to\nthem, and then when they began to fall away, he took the record away again and hid it up.\nHere is what the Lord says about it.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And after Christ truly had showed himself unto his people, he commanded that they should\nbe made manifest.\" (That is, the full record.)\n<\/p><p>\n\"And now, after that, they have all dwindled in unbelief; and there is none save it be the\nLamanites, and they have rejected the gospel of Christ; therefore I am commanded that I\nshould hide them up again in the earth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22230\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22230)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22230)\">Ether 4:2-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFor the sake of time I will skip a little and say that the Lord has promised that we can\nhave that hidden record when we are prepared to receive it. I will read it.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For the Lord said unto me: They shall not go forth unto the Gentiles until the day that they\nshall repent of their iniquity, and become clean before the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And in that day that they shall exercise faith in me, saith the Lord, even as the brother of\nJared did, that they may become sanctified in me, then will I manifest unto them the things\nwhich the brother of Jared saw, even to the unfolding unto them all my revelations, saith\nJesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of the heavens and of the earth, and all things that in\nthem are\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22231\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22231)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22231)\">Ether 4:6-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow the Lord has placed us on probation as members of the Church. He has given us the\nBook of Mormon, which is the lesser part, to build up our faith through our obedience to the\ncounsels which it contains, and when we ourselves, members of the Church, are willing to\nkeep the commandments as they have been given to us and show our faith as the Nephites did\nfor a short period of time, then the Lord is ready to bring forth the other record and give it to\nus, but we are not ready now to receive it. Why? Because we have not lived up to the\nrequirements in this probationary state in the reading of the record which had been given to us\nand in following its counsels.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, teach the men who hold the priesthood in their quorums. Teach the members of the\nChurch in their meetings, and also when you visit them in their homes as ward teachers.\nWhenever the opportunity presents itself, teach them to read and study in faith and prayer the\nrevelations the Lord has given us that we may not be deceived and led astray by false\nteachers.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have false teachers among us. We have apostates among us who are endeavoring to tear\ndown and destroy the kingdom of God, and they are disturbing a great many members of the\nChurch. Why? Because they haven't the faith nor the background in knowledge to resist these\nfalse teachers and their false doctrines.\n<\/p><p>\nLet me plead with the membership of this Church for humility, for faith, for more prayer,\nmore study, more love in their hearts for God their Eternal Father and his Son Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
