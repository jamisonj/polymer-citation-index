I wanted him to understand that he held a very special office that included the keys to preside over a quorum of the priesthood.

This ancient volume of holy scriptures is a sacred companion to the Bible, containing the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ. It also provides convincing evidence to the world that Joseph Smith is truly a prophet of God.

When Oliver Cowdery arrived in Harmony, Pennsylvania, on April 5, 1829, to serve as the Prophet\u2019s scribe, only a few pages of the final text had been translated. That evening Joseph and Oliver sat down together and discussed the Prophet\u2019s experiences long into the night. Two days later, on April 7, they commenced the translation of the work. Over the next three months, Joseph translated at an amazing rate\u2014approximately 500 printed pages in about 60 working days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p28\" class=\"\">Oliver wrote of this remarkable experience: \u201cThese were days never to be forgotten\u2014to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the <span class=\"emphasis\">inspiration<\/span> of heaven, awakened the utmost gratitude of this bosom!
