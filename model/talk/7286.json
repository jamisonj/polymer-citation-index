It was 1833, and an angry mob roared through the streets of Independence, burning property and wreaking havoc. In their path was the home of Brother William W. Phelps, where the printing press was kept. He had been printing revelations received by the Prophet Joseph Smith. The mob demolished the printing press and threw the wreckage into the street. However, they stacked up the printed pages in the yard so they could burn them later.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/your-light-a-standard-to-all-nations.p9\" class=\"\">Mary Elizabeth and Caroline had been hiding by the fence, frightened spectators to all this destruction. Even though she was terrified, Mary Elizabeth\u2019s eye was fixed on those precious pages. She and her sister ran out from their hiding place, gathered up the scriptures, and bolted. Some of the mob saw them and ordered them to stop. But the brave girls ran into a large cornfield, where they dropped breathlessly to the ground. They carefully laid the pages of revelations between the tall rows of corn and then covered the pages by lying on them. The relentless mobsters looked and looked for the girls, coming quite close at times, but never did find them. Eventually they gave up their search to see what further damage they could do to the town.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/your-light-a-standard-to-all-nations.p10\" class=\"\">I believe the light of the Lord directed Mary Elizabeth and Caroline as to what to do and where to go for safety.

Young Joan of Arc, one of the great heroines in history, became the unlikely standard-bearer for the French army in the Dark Ages, long before the gospel was restored. Joan had the Light of Christ and also the courage to follow its promptings and make a difference. Joan was a peasant girl who could neither read nor write, but she was bright. Long years of war with the English had impoverished and divided her country. At 17, sensing her life had a purpose, she left home, determined to help liberate her oppressed country. Naturally, people scoffed at her ideas and thought she was a little crazy, but in the end she persuaded them to let her have a horse and an escort to go and see the king.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/your-light-a-standard-to-all-nations.p14\" class=\"\">Young King Charles VII of France had heard about Joan and decided to test her. He slipped into the ranks of the army and let one of his trusted associates occupy the throne. When Joan came into the room, she barely acknowledged the man on the throne, but promptly walked up to Charles and curtsied to him as her king. This so impressed the king that he gave her command over his 12,000 troops. At first the French soldiers did not want to obey her, but when they saw that all who followed her succeeded and all who disregarded her failed, they came to look upon her as their leader.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/your-light-a-standard-to-all-nations.p15\" class=\"\">Clad in a suit of white armor and flying her own standard, Joan of Arc liberated the besieged city of Orleans in 1429 and defeated the English in four other battles. Twice she was wounded, but each time she recovered and went on fighting. Her orders seemed to be those of a military genius. She marched into the city of Reims and stood with sword and banner in hand while Charles was crowned king. She fought in the Battle of Paris until she was captured at Compi\u00e8gne by English allies, who sold her to the English for 16,000 francs. She was imprisoned, tried as a heretic, and then burned at the stake in 1431.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/your-light-a-standard-to-all-nations.p16\" class=\"\">Although this is a sad ending, it does not take away from Joan\u2019s greatness. She was courageous enough to follow the personal inspiration to which all of us are entitled. As the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith, \u201cI am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-26905_000_039\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"45156\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45156)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45156)\">D&amp;C 93:2<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/your-light-a-standard-to-all-nations.p17\" class=\"\">To other girls in the fifteenth century, Joan of Arc seemed to be very different. Sisters, don\u2019t be afraid to be different in our century! Sometimes we have to be different in order to maintain Church standards. So I repeat, don\u2019t be afraid to be different, but be as good as you can be. Many girls are concerned about their friends\u2019 conduct and style of dress. Such conduct may be motivated by a desire to be accepted by the peer group. Joan of Arc did not worry about what her friends did, but rather about what she knew she should do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/your-light-a-standard-to-all-nations.p18\" class=\"\">In our society today I see so many people who blame others for their failures.

It may be as simple as a smile. I recently read the account of a man in the northwest United States who used to drive past a bus stop on his way to work. He began to notice a young girl among some children waiting for the school bus. Even when it was raining, she would smile and wave as he drove by. He said: \u201cThe young girl was tall and slim and about 13 years old. She wore a mouthful of braces and I could see them glisten in the glare of my car lights.\u201d Her effort to be friendly gave his day a good start and was something he looked forward to.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/your-light-a-standard-to-all-nations.p20\" class=\"\">This man\u2019s name was Hankins, and he had a daughter, Cheryl, who was about the same age as the girl at the bus stop. One day Cheryl asked her parents\u2019 permission to attend an activity at a local church. A neighbor girl, Vicki, had invited her to attend. The activity was MIA, the forerunner to the Young Women program! Cheryl enjoyed MIA and after a while told her parents that Vicki was a Mormon. It wasn\u2019t long before Cheryl came home from school and said that Vicki was sending two young men over\u2014missionaries\u2014to tell the family about her Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/your-light-a-standard-to-all-nations.p21\" class=\"\">The elders arrived, taught them about the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith, and bore their testimonies of the Restoration of the gospel. As a family they began to read these new scriptures and were soon captivated by them. Mr. Hankins finally met Vicki. She was the smiling girl he had seen so many times at the bus stop. She was present when he and two other members of his family were baptized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/your-light-a-standard-to-all-nations.p22\" class=\"\">Looking back on Vicki\u2019s actions and those of other young people, Brother and Sister Hankins became convinced that \u201cthe greatest potential for missionary work lies in the youth of the Church.\u201d Brother and Sister Hankins have since served as missionaries themselves. They relied upon the referrals and good example that the youth supplied. Vicki\u2014the girl at the bus stop who smiled every day, even when it was raining\u2014changed their lives forever.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-26905_000_039\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See C.

The bridegroom came at the darkest hour, when least expected. It was midnight, and the foolish five had run out of oil.
