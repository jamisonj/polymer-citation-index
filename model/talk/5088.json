The Sabbath calls for constructive thoughts and acts, and if one merely lounges about doing nothing on the Sabbath, he is breaking it. To observe it, one will be on his knees in prayer, preparing lessons, studying the gospel, meditating, visiting the ill and distressed, sleeping, reading wholesome material, and attending all the meetings of that day to which he is expected. To fail to do these proper things is a transgression on the omission side.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Miracle of Forgiveness,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969, pp. 96\u201397.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-lords-day.p22\" class=\"\">Over a lifetime of observation, it is clear to me that the farmer who observes the Sabbath day seems to get more done on his farm than he would if he worked seven days.

I would counsel all students, if they can, to arrange their schedules so that they do not study on the Sabbath. If students and other seekers after truth will do this, their minds will be quickened and the infinite Spirit will lead them to the verities they wish to learn.

The reasons I think are at least threefold. The first has to do with the physical need for rest and renewing. Obviously God, who created us, would know more than we do of the limits of our physical and nervous energy and strength.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-lords-day.p32\" class=\"\">The second reason is, in my opinion, of far greater significance. It has to do with the need for regeneration and the strengthening of our spiritual being. God knows that, left completely to our own devices without regular reminders of our spiritual needs, many would degenerate into the preoccupation of satisfying earthly desires and appetites. This need for physical, mental, and spiritual regeneration is met in large measure by faithful observance of the Sabbath day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-lords-day.p33\" class=\"\">The third reason may be the most important of the three. It has to do with obedience to commandments as an expression of our love for God. Blessed are those who need no reasons other than their love for the Savior to keep his commandments. The response of Adam to the angel who asked Adam why he made a sacrifice unto the Lord is a model for all. Responded Adam, \u201cI know not, save the Lord commanded me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39800\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39800)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39800)\">Moses 5:6<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-lords-day.p34\" class=\"\">The prophet Samuel reminds us, \u201cTo obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2693\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2693)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2693)\">1 Sam. 15:22<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-lords-day.p35\" class=\"\">In this day of increasing access to and preoccupation with materialism, there is a sure protection for ourselves and our children against the plagues of our day.
