In giving his views on a question of present-day concern he made this comment: \u201cI am not a religious man, but there was something about the circumstances of the proposed action that did not strike me as being right.\u201d His comment made me wonder why he associated religion with the social and political subject he was talking about, and it also made me wonder why he thought he was not a religious person. The answer to these queries, I suppose, lies in the definition of religion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/true-religion.p4\" class=\"\">The word <span class=\"emphasis\">religion<\/span> has no one generally accepted definition. Sometimes it is used in reference to worship, whether it be public or private, and sometimes to distinguish between things sacred and those that are profane or worldly. Belief in the immortality of the soul is a concept that is looked upon by some as religious, and one of the most common uses of the term is the belief in deity or deities\u2014a worship of God. The word <span class=\"emphasis\">religion<\/span> is often associated with the pursuit of what is commonly called salvation, and sometimes with revelation from a divine source.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/true-religion.p5\" class=\"\">Not long after the organization of the Church, Joseph Smith published answers to a long list of questions that had been asked of him. One of the questions was this: \u201cWhat are the fundamental principles of your religion?\u201d To that question, Joseph Smith replied: \u201cThe fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that he died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 3:30.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/true-religion.p6\" class=\"\">On many subjects we are often able to find definitions in the scriptures, but it is interesting to note that even though we think of the Bible as a religious treatise, the word <span class=\"emphasis\">religion<\/span> does not appear in the Old Testament, and in the writings of the New Testament it is used on three occasions only. I would like to make reference to these three.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/true-religion.p7\" class=\"\">The first use of the word <span class=\"emphasis\">religion<\/span> is by Paul as he presented his defense before King Agrippa. He said to Agrippa: \u201cAfter the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8220\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8220)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8220)\">Acts 26:5<\/a><\/span>). He was referring to the three sects of the Jews: the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes. He said he lived a Pharisee\u2014the sect of the three that was the strictest in religious practices. Paul was not talking about a religious creed or a belief, but rather the form of worship, because the Jews placed great stress on practice rather than doctrine\u2014on ritualistic worship rather than a creed of belief.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/true-religion.p8\" class=\"\">The second use of the word <span class=\"emphasis\">religion<\/span> was also by Paul, in writing to the Galatians. He made this statement: \u201cFor ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews\u2019 religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23322\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23322)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23322)\">Gal. 1:13<\/a><\/span>). We well know of the persecutions inflicted by Paul upon those who followed Christ and professed to be Christians and wonder why he did these things. What caused him to take such a ruthless course? Paul answers these questions by stating that he had practiced the religion of his fathers\u2014a religion of iron rules, laws, and traditions inherited from his Hebrew lineage. These iron rules of practice are what caused him to relentlessly persecute the followers of Christ. Thus, in writing to the Galatians he referred to religion in the same manner as he did before King Agrippa, as rules of practice rather than doctrine or a creed of belief.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/true-religion.p9\" class=\"\">Now we come to the third instance in the New Testament of the use of the word <span class=\"emphasis\">religion.<\/span> It is in the Epistle of James, written \u201cto the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26294\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26294)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26294)\">James 1:1<\/a><\/span>), probably meaning to all Israel, in which he said: \u201cIf any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man\u2019s religion is vain\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26297\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26297)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26297)\">James 1:26<\/a><\/span>). James seems to be using the term <span class=\"emphasis\">religion<\/span> in the manner used by Paul, as being ritualistic or ceremonial\u2014that if a man is ritualistic in this manner, yet fails to be guarded in what he says, his rituals are in vain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/true-religion.p10\" class=\"\">James then very pointedly defines what he refers to as pure religion, as distinguished from forms of ritualistic worship and iron rules of practice as described by Paul. James said: \u201cPure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26298\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26298)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26298)\">James 1:27<\/a><\/span>). The wording is simple and unpretentious, yet the meaning is profound and has deep significance. The words \u201cvisit the fatherless and widows\u201d are a reminder that we should have compassion for our neighbor\u2014our fellowmen. This is the teaching of the Master in his frequent reference to love. The Lord said: \u201cThou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36608\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36608)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36608)\">Matt. 22:39<\/a><\/span>). This is what James was expressing\u2014a love for, and devotion to, God, by compassionate service to fellowmen. He used as examples the fatherless and the widows.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/true-religion.p11\" class=\"\">The second element of the definition of religion stated by James is to keep \u201cunspotted from the world.\u201d To be unspotted from the world simply means being unworldly and free from the pollution of sin and unrighteousness. Paul said something about this also in his writing to the Romans: \u201cBe not conformed to this world\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42887\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42887)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42887)\">Rom. 12:2<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/true-religion.p12\" class=\"\">In short, James tells us that true religion is a devotion to God, demonstrated by love and compassion for fellowmen, coupled with unworldliness. Such a statement seems too simple to be sufficient, but in its simplicity it speaks an important truth. Restated it may be said that true religion consists not only in refraining from evil (that is, remaining unspotted), but in deliberately and purposefully doing acts of kindness and service to others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/true-religion.p13\" class=\"\">King Benjamin recognized this principle as he spoke to his people from the tower. He reminded them that he had spent his days in their service and said: \u201cI do not desire to boast, for I have only been in the service of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/true-religion.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40446\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40446)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40446)\">Mosiah 2:16\u201317<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/true-religion.p15\" class=\"\">Matthew puts it this way: \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36619\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36619)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36619)\">Matt. 25:40<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/true-religion.p16\" class=\"\">The life of the Prophet Joseph Smith portrays these same attributes\u2014service to friends, to his fellowmen, to all mankind, and to his God. It was during the last two hours of his life, confined behind bars in Carthage, that his close friend, President John Taylor, sang a song to cheer him on that melancholy occasion. The song has a number of verses commencing with helping the unfortunate and sharing a crust with one perishing for want of bread.
