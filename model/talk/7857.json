The scripture says he came back a final time, \u201cabout the eleventh hour\u201d (approximately 5:00\u00a0p.m.), and hired a concluding number. Then just an hour later, all the workers gathered to receive their day\u2019s wage. Surprisingly, all received the <span class=\"emphasis\">same<\/span> wage in spite of the different hours of labor. Immediately, those hired first were angry, saying, \u201cThese last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10405_000_015\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122858\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122858)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122858)\">Matthew 20:1\u201315<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> When reading this parable, perhaps you, as well as those workers, have felt there was an injustice being done here. Let me speak briefly to that concern.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p7\" class=\"\">First of all it is important to note that <span class=\"emphasis\">no one<\/span> has been treated unfairly here. The first workers agreed to the full wage of the day, and they received it. Furthermore, they were, I can only imagine, very grateful to get the work. In the time of the Savior, an average man and his family could not do much more than live on what they made that day. If you didn\u2019t work or farm or fish or sell, you likely didn\u2019t eat. With more prospective workers than jobs, these first men chosen were the most fortunate in the entire labor pool that morning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p8\" class=\"\">Indeed, if there is any sympathy to be generated, it should at least initially be for the men <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> chosen who also had mouths to feed and backs to clothe. Luck never seemed to be with some of them. With each visit of the steward throughout the day, they always saw someone else chosen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p9\" class=\"\">But just at day\u2019s close, the householder returns a surprising fifth time with a remarkable eleventh-hour offer! These last and most discouraged of laborers, hearing only that they will be treated fairly, accept work without even knowing the wage, knowing that <span class=\"emphasis\">anything<\/span> will be better than nothing, which is what they have had so far. Then as they gather for their payment, they are stunned to receive the same as all the others! How awestruck they must have been and how very, very grateful! Surely never had such compassion been seen in all their working days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p10\" class=\"\">It is with that reading of the story that I feel the grumbling of the first laborers must be seen. As the householder in the parable tells them (and I paraphrase only slightly): \u201cMy friends, I am not being unfair to you. You agreed on the wage for the day, a good wage. You were very happy to get the work, and I am very happy with the way you served. You are paid in full. Take your pay and enjoy the blessing. As for the others, <span class=\"emphasis\">surely I am free to do what I like with my own money.<\/span>\u201d Then this piercing question to anyone then or now who needs to hear it: \u201c<span class=\"emphasis\">Why should<\/span> you <span class=\"emphasis\">be jealous because<\/span> I <span class=\"emphasis\">choose to be kind?<\/span>\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p11\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, there are going to be times in our lives when someone else gets an unexpected blessing or receives some special recognition. May I plead with us not to be hurt\u2014and certainly not to feel envious\u2014when good fortune comes to another person? We are not diminished when someone else is added upon. We are not in a race against each other to see who is the wealthiest or the most talented or the most beautiful or even the most blessed. The race we are <span class=\"emphasis\">really<\/span> in is the race against sin, and surely envy is one of the most universal of those.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p12\" class=\"\">Furthermore, envy is a mistake that just keeps on giving. Obviously we suffer a little when some <span class=\"emphasis\">misfortune<\/span> befalls <span class=\"emphasis\">us,<\/span> but envy requires us to suffer all <span class=\"emphasis\">good fortune<\/span> that befalls <span class=\"emphasis\">everyone<\/span> we know! What a bright prospect that is\u2014downing another quart of pickle juice every time anyone around you has a happy moment! To say nothing of the chagrin in the end, when we find that God really is both just and merciful, giving to all who stand with Him \u201call that he hath,\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-10405_000_015\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122859\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122859)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122859)\">Luke 12:44<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> as the scripture says. So lesson number one from the Lord\u2019s vineyard: coveting, pouting, or tearing others down does <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> elevate <span class=\"emphasis\">your<\/span> standing, nor does demeaning someone else improve your self-image. So be kind, and be grateful that God is kind. It is a happy way to live.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p13\" class=\"\">A second point I wish to take from this parable is the sorrowful mistake some could make if they were to forgo the receipt of their wages at the <span class=\"emphasis\">end<\/span> of the day because they were preoccupied with perceived problems <span class=\"emphasis\">earlier<\/span> in the day. It doesn\u2019t say here that anyone threw his coin in the householder\u2019s face and stormed off penniless, but I suppose one might have.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p14\" class=\"\">My beloved brothers and sisters, what happened in this story at 9:00 or noon or 3:00 is swept up in the grandeur of the universally generous payment at the end of the day. The formula of faith is to hold on, work on, see it through, and let the distress of earlier hours\u2014real or imagined\u2014fall away in the abundance of the final reward. Don\u2019t dwell on old issues or grievances\u2014not toward yourself nor your neighbor nor even, I might add, toward this true and living Church. The majesty of your life, of your neighbor\u2019s life, and of the gospel of Jesus Christ will be made manifest at the last day, even if such majesty is not always recognized by everyone in the early going. So don\u2019t hyperventilate about something that happened at 9:00 in the morning when the grace of God is trying to reward you at 6:00 in the evening\u2014whatever your labor arrangements have been through the day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p15\" class=\"\">We consume such precious emotional and spiritual capital clinging tenaciously to the memory of a discordant note we struck in a childhood piano recital, or something a spouse said or did 20 years ago that we are determined to hold over his or her head for another 20, or an incident in Church history that proved no more or less than that mortals will always struggle to measure up to the immortal hopes placed before them. Even if one of those grievances did not originate with you, it can end with you. And what a reward there will be for that contribution when the Lord of the vineyard looks you in the eye and accounts are settled at the end of our earthly day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p16\" class=\"\">Which leads me to my third and last point. This parable\u2014like all parables\u2014is not really about laborers or wages any more than the others are about sheep and goats. This is a story about God\u2019s goodness, His patience and forgiveness, and the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a story about generosity and compassion. It is a story about grace. It underscores the thought I heard many years ago that surely the thing God enjoys most about being God is the thrill of being merciful, especially to those who don\u2019t expect it and often feel they don\u2019t deserve it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p17\" class=\"\">I do not know who in this vast audience today may need to hear the message of forgiveness inherent in this parable, but however late you think you are, however many chances you think you have missed, however many mistakes you feel you have made or talents you think you don\u2019t have, or however far from home and family and God you feel you have traveled, I testify that you have <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> traveled beyond the reach of divine love. It is not possible for you to sink lower than the infinite light of Christ\u2019s Atonement shines.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p18\" class=\"\">Whether you are not yet of our faith or were with us once and have not remained, there is nothing in either case that you have done that cannot be undone.
