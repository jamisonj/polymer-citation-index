You may publicly profess that all is well and reject the efforts of others to help you with a comment that you know what you are doing and can handle it yourself. Yet, in quiet moments, you know you are miserable, lonely, and sometimes afraid. You avoid thinking too much about what you are doing. The walls seem to close in around you. You are driven by appetites that bring momentary physical response but are followed by periods of deep depression. Let me help you as we reason together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p5\" class=\"\">I need not define your specific problem to help you overcome it. It doesn\u2019t matter what it is. If it violates the commandments of the Lord, it comes from Satan, and the Lord can overcome all of Satan\u2019s influence through your application of righteous principles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p6\" class=\"\">Please understand that the way back is not as hard as it seems to you now. Satan wants you to think that it is impossible. That is not true. The Savior gave His life so that you can completely overcome the challenges you face.

Do you admit only to what is publicly seen and try to hide from others how really bad conditions are? Worst of all, do you lie to yourself, pretending that things are all right when they are not? That attitude prevents you from getting the help you need. It provides an invitation to more serious problems.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p8\" class=\"\">When you are honest with yourself, you may feel afraid. To change will require you to take an unfamiliar path, and it is uphill and narrow. The other is so inviting, but it leads to heartache. None of your partners in error will help you onto the upward path. They think only of themselves.

When you do something right, when you resist temptation, when you meet a goal, you will feel very good about it. It is a very different kind of feeling than you have when you violate commandments\u2014an altogether different feeling. It brings a measure of peace and comfort and provides encouragement to press on.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p11\" class=\"\">As you pray for help, the Lord will place in your path priesthood leaders who will counsel and friends who will give support if you\u2019ll let them. But remember, they can only help by your following the rules that Christ has set out for the journey. Any lasting improvement must come from your own determination to change.

If you were always forgiven for every mistake without effort on your part, you would never receive the blessings of repentance. If everything were done <span class=\"emphasis\">for<\/span> you, you wouldn\u2019t learn how to work, or gain self-confidence, or acquire the power to change.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p13\" class=\"\">Freedom from your transgression will come through sincere faith, true repentance, willing obedience, and the giving of self.

Because selfishness is at the root of your problem. Where selfishness and transgression flourish, the Spirit of the Lord can\u2019t enter your life to bless you. To succeed, you must conquer your selfishness. When your beacon is focused on self, it does little more than blind your vision. When turned outward through acts of kindness and love, it will light your path to happiness and peace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p15\" class=\"\">Your exercise of faith permits you to call upon the strength of the Lord when you need it.

It is unreasonable to expect to unravel it all at once. Start knot by knot, decision by decision, and be sure that while you are untying the knots, you don\u2019t let any more get put there through transgression.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p19\" class=\"\">This example suggests how your habit can be overcome.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"preamble\">Suppose a small child were to run in front of your car. What would you do? Careful analysis of each step taken will teach you how to overcome your serious habit:<\/p>\n    <ul class=\"bullet\"><li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>First your mind decides to stop. Nothing else can happen until that decision is made.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Then you take your foot off the accelerator.

Decide to stop what you are doing that is wrong. Then search out everything in your life that feeds the habit, such as negative thoughts, unwholesome environment, and your companions in mischief. Systematically eliminate or overcome everything that contributes to that negative part of your life. Then stop the negative things permanently.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p25\" class=\"\">Recognize that you\u2019ll go through two transition periods. The first is the most difficult. You are caging the tiger that has controlled your life. It will shake the bars, growl, threaten, and cause you some disturbance. But I promise you that this period will pass. How long it takes will depend upon the severity of your transgression, the strength of your determination, and the help you seek from the Lord. But remember, as you stand firm, it will pass.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p26\" class=\"\">The second period is not as intense. It is like being on \u201cbattle alert\u201d so that you can fend off any enemy attack. That, too, will pass, and you will feel more peace and will have increased control of your life. You will become free.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p27\" class=\"\">Once I had a measuring tape that didn\u2019t work. I decided to fix it. I began to remove the side cover plate to find what was wrong. In a few moments, I knew I was in trouble. Suddenly, the whole mechanism exploded in my hands. There were tape and spring flying in all directions. My efforts to put it all back together were frustrating and often painful. Irritated, I just about threw the whole thing away. Then I thought, \u201cSomeone designed this tape. If I can discover the principles that make it function, I can fix it.\u201d With greater patience, I began to examine the mainspring and found that if coiled in a certain way, instead of resisting and complaining, it easily responded. Soon the spring was coiled, carefully placed in its housing, the tape joined, the cover replaced, and it worked perfectly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p28\" class=\"\">So it is with you. When, through violation of God\u2019s laws, you cease to function properly, force and compulsion will not restore you. You must search out the Designer\u2019s plan. As you follow it, you will become more pliable. You can be \u201crepaired\u201d more easily, and you will function well again under His divine influence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p29\" class=\"\">The overcoming of serious transgression follows a pattern. First, and most difficult, is the internal battle, the crosscurrent of feeling, the anguish about being found out, the worry about the impact on other lives, and the fear of the unknown. This struggle is prolonged through indecision, and that means more pain and further damage. It can be cut short through decisive personal commitment to clean up your life, now. <span class=\"emphasis\">Right now.<\/span> Once that decision is made, there follow many individual decisions and acts, none of which is overpowering. Yet, taken together, they will kill the monster that\u2019s controlling your life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p30\" class=\"\">The most difficult part about changing is to make an unwavering decision to do it, and, when required, to enlist the help of your bishop. Once that beginning is made, you will find the rest of the path becomes easier than you imagined. Some days are more difficult than others, but the process becomes easier because through your use of agency, you qualify for the Lord\u2019s help, and He magnifies your efforts.

Rationalization leads you down blind alleys in life. It drains spiritual power. It barricades the path to happiness because it distorts your understanding of truth. Overcome rationalization with truth and positive decisions.

That will destroy your self-confidence and will weaken others\u2019 trust in you. It will discourage them from helping you. There is simply nothing good about cheating yourself by being disobedient to trust; there is no positive element of reinforcement that would otherwise come from obedience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p34\" class=\"\">To reach a goal you have never before attained, you must do things you have never before done.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/finding-the-way-back.p35\" class=\"\">Don\u2019t confront your problem armed with only your own experience, understanding, and strength.
