This angel appeared to him and revealed the location of ancient records which were inscribed on metallic plates and buried in a stone vault. In due time, the young prophet was given the plates and the means by which they were translated. The book was then published to the world as canonized scripture.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/joseph-smith-prophet-to-our-generation.p17\" class=\"\">Also, in harmony with the testimony of John, the book contains \u201cthe everlasting gospel.\u201d It is now preached by our missionaries to the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/joseph-smith-prophet-to-our-generation.p18\" class=\"\">We invite you to test the validity of our witness about the origin of the Book of Mormon.
