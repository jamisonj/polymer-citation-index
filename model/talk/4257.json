In another nation, our compassion was stretched almost to the breaking point as we yearned to help countless people in need. Young mothers with babies bundled on their backs begged for money while paddling their little sampan boats, which served both as their shelter and as their mode of transportation. And, oh, how our hearts ached for young men and women of another country who, one by one, were strapped as beasts of burden to wooden-wheeled carts heavily laden with weighty cargo.

As parents care for their children, they, in turn, may reciprocate when parents become less able. Family pride promotes solicitude for each member, taking priority over other assistance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/in-the-lords-own-way.p40\" class=\"\">If one\u2019s family can\u2019t help, the Lord\u2019s \u201cown way\u201d includes the Church organization. The bishop is assisted by priesthood quorums and good sisters of the Relief Society, organized to look \u201cto the wants of the poor, searching after objects of charity and \u2026 administering to their wants.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Handbook of the Relief Society,<\/span> 1931, p. 22.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/in-the-lords-own-way.p41\" class=\"\">Members of priesthood quorums and groups have a duty to rehabilitate, spiritually and temporally, their erring or unfortunate brethren.

This is part of the law of the gospel. Each of us truly can help the poor and the needy, now, and wherever they are.

May I share an illustration with you? Once, Sister Nelson and I were invited to the humble home of Polynesian Saints who had relatively recently joined the Church. By walking carefully on wooden planks, we approached their house, built on wooden piles emerging from the floor of the sea. We climbed a ladder to enter their little one-room dwelling. As we were invited to be seated on freshly woven grass mats, we could peek through holes in the floor and view sea water below. That home was starkly devoid of furniture, except for a used sewing machine provided by sisters of the Relief Society. But the love and warmth of this special family were apparent as our visit continued.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/in-the-lords-own-way.p52\" class=\"\">\u201cWe would like to sing for you,\u201d the father said through an interpreter. He put one arm about his wife and the other about the children, as did his wife.

Before we joined the Church, we had so little. Now we have so much!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/in-the-lords-own-way.p54\" class=\"\">While wiping tears from our moistened cheeks, Sister Nelson and I looked at each other, comprehending that the gospel brings spiritual wealth which may bear little relation, at first, to tangible abundance. Conversely, people with plenty can be spiritually poor. Yet the Lord is concerned for them all!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/in-the-lords-own-way.p55\" class=\"\">Missionary work throughout the world is part of his plan. It brings the light of the gospel to those who embrace the truth. Then, as Saints learn and obey the commandments of God, they will prosper. This promise has been recorded by prophets throughout time and in diverse places.
