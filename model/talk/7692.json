It comes from having a heart that is sensitive to the Holy Ghost. It comes from having a heart that can love. It comes from having a heart that will make and keep sacred covenants. It comes from a soft heart that can feel the power of the Atonement of Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p13\" class=\"\">This easiness to believe comes from the example of others who have soft hearts and who model this easiness to believe, such as Nephi and Lehi.

Likewise, many of us have embedded in our names a legacy of faith from ancestors who had soft hearts and found it easy to believe the word of God. Some of these were like my great-great-grandfather Ephraim\u00a0K. Hanks, who, when he found out his older brother had \u201cgone off with the Mormons,\u201d was determined to bring him back home. Not surprisingly, Ephraim moved to Nauvoo and was baptized soon after he heard his brother bear testimony of Joseph Smith and the restored gospel (see Richard\u00a0K.
