This is important to our happiness. Let us examine ourselves and, like pilots in the sky, take our bearings to see if we are on course financially. We must build upon sound principles. The bedrock principle of which I speak is that the responsibility for welfare rests with me and my family. In 1936 the First Presidency said in a great statement of purpose, \u201cThe aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves.\u201d (in Conference Report, Oct. 1936, p. 3.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p4\" class=\"\">Some of us are children of the Great Depression in the United States over fifty years ago. Most of us who passed through that period will never forget the difficult economic times almost everyone experienced. At that time many banks failed; people lost their life\u2019s savings; a great many were unemployed, and some of them lost their homes because they could not pay the mortgage. Many went hungry. If we didn\u2019t eat our oatmeal cereal for breakfast, we would often have it fried for lunch or dinner. Such widespread economic problems could come again. But any of us, at any time, could meet with a personal calamity, such as sickness or an accident, which could limit or destroy our income.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p5\" class=\"\">The purpose of the welfare program is to care for the poor and the needy and make the members of the Church, by their obedience to gospel principles, strong and self-reliant. At the center of caring for the poor and the needy in a worldwide church is a generous contribution to the fast offerings, and personal and family preparedness. At the very heart of taking care of our own needs is our own energy and ability, with help to and from our own families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p6\" class=\"\">I should like to discuss five prescriptions which, if followed, will make each of us better able to control our destinies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p7\" class=\"\"><span class=\"strong\">First prescription: Practice thrift and frugality. <\/span>There is a wise old saying: \u201cEat it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.\u201d Thrift is a practice of not wasting anything. Some people are able to get by because of the absence of expense. They have their shoes resoled, they patch, they mend, they sew, and they save money. They avoid installment buying, and make purchases only after saving enough to pay cash, thus avoiding interest charges. <span class=\"emphasis\">Frugality<\/span> means to practice careful economy. (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary,<\/span> 2d. college edition.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p8\" class=\"\">The old couplet \u201cWaste not, want not\u201d still has much merit. Frugality requires that we live within our income and save a little for a rainy day, which always seems to come. It means avoiding debt and carefully limiting credit purchasing. It is important to learn to distinguish between wants and needs. It takes self-discipline to avoid the \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d philosophy and to adopt the \u201csave now and buy later\u201d practice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p9\" class=\"\">There are some investment counselors who urge speculative credit practices described as \u201cleverage,\u201d \u201ccredit wealth,\u201d and \u201cborrow yourself rich.\u201d Such practices may work successfully for some, but at best they succeed only for a time. An economic reversal always seems to come, and many who have followed such practices find themselves in financial ruin and their lives in shambles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p10\" class=\"\">Elder Ezra Taft Benson stated: \u201cA large proportion of families with personal debt have no liquid assets whatsoever to fall back upon. What troubles they invite if their income should be suddenly cut off or seriously reduced! We all know of families who have obligated themselves for more than they could pay.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Pay Thy Debt, and Live,<\/span> Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year, Provo: 28 Feb. 1963, p. 10.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p11\" class=\"\">Owning a home free of debt is an important goal of provident living, although it may not be a realistic possibility for some. A mortgage on a home leaves a family unprotected against severe financial storms. Homes that are free and clear of mortgages and liens cannot be foreclosed on. When there are good financial times, it is the most opportune time to retire our debts and pay installments in advance. It is a truth that \u201cthe borrower is servant to the lender.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41582\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41582)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41582)\">Prov. 22:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p12\" class=\"\">Many young people have become so hypnotized by the rhythm of monthly payments they scarcely think of the total cost of what they buy. They immediately want things it took their parents years to acquire. It is not the pathway to happiness to assume debts for a big home, an expensive car, or the most stylish clothes just so we can \u201ckeep up with the Joneses.\u201d Payment of obligations is a sacred trust. Most of us will never be rich, but we can feel greatly unburdened when we are debt-free.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p13\" class=\"\"><span class=\"strong\">Second prescription: Seek to be independent. <\/span>The Lord said that it is important for the Church to \u201cstand independent above all other creatures beneath the celestial world.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18461\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18461)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18461)\">D&amp;C 78:14<\/a><\/span>.) Members of the Church are also counseled to be independent. Independence means many things. It means being free of drugs that addict, habits that bind, and diseases that curse.

Once in debt, interest is your companion every minute of the day and night; you cannot shun it or slip away from it; you cannot dismiss it; it yields neither to entreaties, demands, or orders; and whenever you get in its way or cross its course or fail to meet its demands, it crushes you.\u201d (in Conference Report, Apr., 1938, p. 103.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p16\" class=\"\">Extended economic dependence humiliates a man if he is strong, and debilitates him if he is weak.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p17\" class=\"\">Payment of our tithes and offerings can help us become independent.

It is my firm belief, after many years of close observation, that those who honestly pay their tithes and offerings do prosper and get along better in almost every way. It is my testimony that in discharging this debt to the Lord, one enjoys great personal satisfaction. Unfortunately this great satisfaction will be known only by those who have the faith and strength to keep this commandment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p19\" class=\"\"><span class=\"strong\">Third prescription: Be industrious. <\/span>To be industrious involves energetically managing our circumstances to our advantage.

It involves creativity. It also involves rest. It includes both aspects of Sabbath day observance. On the one hand, we are to labor six days. On the other hand, we are to rest one day.

Kimball counseled: \u201cI hope that we understand that, while having a garden, for instance, is often useful in reducing food costs and making available delicious fresh fruits and vegetables, it does much more than this. Who can gauge the value of that special chat between daughter and Dad as they weed or water the garden? How do we evaluate the good that comes from the obvious lessons of planting, cultivating, and the eternal law of the harvest? And how do we measure the family togetherness and cooperating that must accompany successful canning? Yes, we are laying up resources in store, but perhaps the greater good is contained in the lessons of life we learn as we live providently and extend to our children their pioneer heritage.\u201d (in Conference Report, Oct. 1977, p. 125; or <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1977, p. 78.)

Every father and mother are the family\u2019s storekeepers. They should store whatever their own family would like to have in the case of an emergency. Most of us cannot afford to store a year\u2019s supply of luxury items, but find it more practical to store staples that might keep us from starving in case of emergency. Surely we all hope that the hour of need will never come. Some have said, \u201cWe have followed this counsel in the past and have never had need to use our year\u2019s supply, so we have difficulty keeping this in mind as a major priority.\u201d Perhaps following this counsel could be the reason why they have not needed to use their reserve. By continued rotation of the supply it can be kept usable with no waste.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p26\" class=\"\">The Church cannot be expected to provide for every one of its millions of members in case of public or personal disaster. It is therefore necessary that each home and family do what they can to assume the responsibility for their own hour of need. If we do not have the resources to acquire a year\u2019s supply, then we can strive to begin with having one month\u2019s supply. I believe if we are provident and wise in the management of our personal and family affairs and are faithful, God will sustain us through our trials. He has revealed: \u201cFor the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18496\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18496)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18496)\">D&amp;C 104:17<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p27\" class=\"\">Much of our own well-being is bound up in caring for others.
