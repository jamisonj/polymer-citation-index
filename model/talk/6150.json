It is an exciting week of getting acquainted with grandchildren. For the past few years I have listened to their opportunities and challenges. They have let me know of the increased pressures of being in the world but not of the world. Movies, television, Internet, designer clothes, extreme fashions, Sabbath-breaking activities, et cetera, escalate the magnitude of their temptations. Moreover, peer pressures force difficult decisions about whether to follow the crowd or stand up for the principles taught by converted and committed parents and the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p6\" class=\"\">This year I decided to be a little more aggressive in counseling my grandchildren. I wanted to provide them with a framework to resist temptations and thrive in today\u2019s complex world. Our vacation at the lake extends for four days, so I decided to purchase a loose-leaf binder for each of them and include a topic for discussion for each day. Each insert included some scripture references and quotes that were intended to start fruitful discussions between the generations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p7\" class=\"\">On the first day, there was not much interest in discussions, but the momentum seemed to increase each day.

The nations of the earth, if they would continue to follow the ways of the Lord, could be a blessing to His children here.

We are expected to be subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, and obey, honor, and sustain the law (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"7104\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7104)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7104)\">A of F 1:12<\/a><\/span>).

We must also be prepared to make our contribution by giving service to others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p15\" class=\"\">The best way I know of to make a contribution to the land we live in is to be prepared for the future. The Lord has promised us if we are prepared we should have no fear. If we make an effort to obtain the best education available to us, we are in a better position to be self-sufficient and not to become a burden on the society in which we live.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p16\" class=\"\">I read in a newspaper a few weeks ago of the earning potential with increased levels of education. The difference between no high school degree and a high school graduate is an average income increase of 38 percent. From a high school diploma to some college, the increase is 20 percent, and from a high school diploma to a university degree, the increase is 56 percent. Yes, education does pay. It is never too early to determine the direction you want to prepare yourself for. Don\u2019t wait until you register for college to decide what you want to study. It is such a waste of time and money to attempt to pursue an education without having a definite goal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p17\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Topic number 2: Self-esteem.<\/span> In the eighth Psalm of David, he gave us a vision of who we are and the eternal opportunities which are ours.

Some have been blessed with the talent to sing, some to paint, some to speak, some to dance, some to create beautiful things with their hands, and others to render compassionate service. Some may possess many, others only a few. It matters not the size or the quantity but the effort we put forth to develop the talents and abilities we have received. You are not competing with anyone else. You are only competing with yourself to do the best with whatever you have received.
