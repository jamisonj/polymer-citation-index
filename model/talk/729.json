I take the privilege of letting my first words be those\nof appreciation.  I bear my testimony to the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  I pray\ndaily to a personal God.  I bear testimony to the divine mission of Jesus Christ, of Joseph\nSmith, and of President David O. McKay.  I never utter these words and bear this testimony\nbut something fine, something worthy within me swells my bosom and makes me proud, and\nyet extremely humble.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful for this song, \"Come, come, ye Saints\" that has just been sung.  It truly is a\nclassic among the Latter-day Saint people.  And if President Clark will permit, I would love\nto read part of his eloquent tribute to this glorious, west land of pioneers.  After expressing himself in his\nbook, <i>To Them of the Last Wagon<\/i>, he finishes with these words: \n<\/p><p>\nLog cabins grew into adobe houses and these into buildings of brick and stone.  A mighty\nTemple, dedicated to the work of the lord, rose in their midst, carved from the granite of\ncanyon walls, the first of eight that this people were to build to the salvation of their dead.  \nMeetinghouses everywhere welcomed the worshiper. Stores, banks, factories, mines, mills,\nsmelters, came into being.  Flocks and herds peopled the ranges.  Schools and colleges came\nearly and multiplied.  The hive of industry became the symbol of a great commonwealth. \nFaith and strength and righteousness bore their fruit of comfort and safety and the joy of\nliving.\n<\/p><p>\nAll through the years the people have been blessed, even in their most dire need, blessed, they\nfeel, beyond all other peoples on earth&mdash;blessed in their right to get and safely to keep the\nfruits of their own labors: blessed in their right peaceably to assemble, to discuss their\ngrievances, to speak fully their minds, to print without let or hindrance what they thought and\nsaid: blessed to live under a reign of law and order: blessed to worship God according to the\ndictates of their consciences under the law of the land.\n<\/p><p>\nSo we honor these men and women of iron will, of surpassing spirituality, of a trusting,\nliving, simple faith.  They have done their work: they have earned their reward, which God is\nbestowing upon them. None can rob them of the fruits of their labors.  They are secure.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now the natural, obvious question: \n<\/p><p>\nWhat of us?  Can we keep and preserve what they wrought?  Shall we pass on to our children\nthe heritage they left us, or shall we lightly fritter it away?  Have we their faith? . . . Can we\ndo the thousands of little and big things that made them the heroic builders of a great church,\na great commonwealth?  (<i>To Them of the Last Wagon<\/i>, pp. 43-45.)\n<\/p><p>\nI bow in reverence, I humbly pray it shall ever be kept alive within my heart, a deep and\nabiding appreciation for that glorious sacrifice of men and women.  I caught a bit of the spirit\nof it last month when I toured the Southwest Indian Mission.  It was great to be down on the\nSan Juan, down on the Colorado.  It was great to see far-off on the cliff yonder, miles away,\nto see four great stalwart trees that the Pioneers had planted years ago. It humbled me greatly\nto stand at the graveside of those who sacrificed in the opening up of that great western\ncountry. Somehow I wished that I might have lived with them.\n<\/p><p>\nOne day on this recent trip of the Southwest Indian Mission, a Navajo Indian boy, with a\ngroup of his little friends, was being taken to Southern California to live for the winter in the\ncomfortable homes of Latter-day Saint people, to enjoy their hospitality and spiritual\nfriendship.  One little fellow with a little shattered suitcase was crying while his Navajo\nmother was drying her eyes, yet stoically standing by his side without a word to say, and\nanother son, not so small, he was about sixteen years of age, courageously stood by. Great\nthings have been accomplished by the boys of fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen: these are great\nyears in a young man's life, and \"Benjamin,\" the older Navajo boy, put his hand on the head\nof his little brother and said, \"We don't cry.\" That was all.  The little fellow braced himself to\nwhat was to him a great task, leaving mother and the other children.  They drove away to a\nnew home.\n<\/p><p>\nThank God for \"Come, come, ye Saints.\" Thank God for the people who pioneered the great\nwasteland of the Southwest and in many places restored it.  I have in my heart also great\ngratitude toward the leadership of these early days in our Church.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Brigham Young and Joseph Smith met for the first time, here are the words describing\nthat meeting: \n<\/p><p>\nWe proceeded to Kirtland and stopped at John P. Greene's, who had just arrived there with\nhis family. We rested a few minutes, took some refreshments and started to see the Prophet.\nWe went to his father's house and learned that he was in the woods chopping. We\nimmediately repaired to the woods, where we found the Prophet, and two or three of his\nbrothers, chopping and hauling wood.  Here my joy was full [said Brigham Young] at the\nprivilege of shaking the hand of the Prophet of God, and receiving the sure testimony, by the\nspirit of prophecy, that he was all that any man could believe him to be as a true prophet\n(<i>DHC<\/i>, I, p. 297, Note).\n<\/p><p>\nGreatness meets chopping wood.  No pomp, no ceremony!  Brigham Young receives the true\ntestimony.\n<\/p><p>\nBe thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy\nprayers (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13315\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13315)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13315)\">D&amp;C 112:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay I note other great attributes of the Latter-day Saint people:\n<i>A great heritage, a humble, noble leadership; an all-participating membership.<\/i>  My, how we should thrill.  It was inspiring\nto me yesterday, when President McKay said: \"Every member of this Relief Society Singing\nMothers Chorus has one other Church service job besides singing in this chorus.\" How lovely\nit is&mdash;<i>nearly all members participating<\/i>.  That is the Latter-day Saint way.\n<\/p><p>\nDrive on the hillside here in Salt Lake City, if you have not done it before, and see the\nPrimary Hospital, built for little children.  It is a beautiful structure, and as you drive along\nthink of its being built by pennies and the love of people and children&mdash;<i>an all-participating membership!<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nFinally, these few words: The great objective, said President Richards to us the other day, of\nthis conference, is the building of the kingdom of God on earth.  Yes, missionaries by the\nthousands, the welfare program reaching out its aims to help and bless, temples being erected\nthroughout the world, as we labor we are blessed.\n<\/p><p>\n\"There are bridges, young men and young women, to be built, and we will build them.  There\nare houses to make and we will light their windows. There are those who suffer, and we will\nease their sorrow.  There are divine blessings ever hovering about us.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI humbly pray that we may worthily continue these great blessings, in the name of Jesus\nChrist.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
