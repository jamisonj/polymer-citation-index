A woman\u2019s voice said, \u201cBrother Monte Brough, would you hold the phone a moment? President Hinckley would like to speak with you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/a-willing-heart.p5\" class=\"\">I said, \u201cPresident Hinckley!\u201d in order to gain some attention from my rather raucous family. They quieted rather quickly, I can tell you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/a-willing-heart.p6\" class=\"\">President Hinckley came on the phone and said, \u201cBrother Brough, would it be convenient for you to come and see me?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/a-willing-heart.p7\" class=\"\">In a rather stilted way, I responded for a moment or two to a couple of questions, then said, \u201cPresident Hinckley, you have given me a rather frightening phone call.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/a-willing-heart.p8\" class=\"\">He said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about it.

I would like to use that experience to bear my testimony. A rather severe tornado hit the area. It was severe enough that it came to the attention of the nightly news broadcast over the national networks to California, Arizona, Utah, and Idaho. Before long, the telephone started ringing in our office there at the mission home. This went on for two or three hours, with parents calling from many areas wondering about their Johnny or Richard.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/a-willing-heart.p11\" class=\"\">I recall later walking across the parking lot from the mission office to the mission home saying to myself, \u201cYou know these Mormon mothers. They just won\u2019t undo the apron strings. They just won\u2019t let their boys go.\u201d As I walked into the mission home, the phone again was ringing. I picked up the phone and guess who? My mother! She was wondering how her missionary was doing under these circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/a-willing-heart.p12\" class=\"\">I learned a great and deep lesson. A mother\u2019s love and concern never ceases\u2014nor should it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/a-willing-heart.p13\" class=\"\">I have no memory of my father. I was not raised in a home where the priesthood was strong. A bishop in Randolph, Utah, and mission presidents later on are responsible for my being here tonight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/a-willing-heart.p14\" class=\"\">In reference to Elder Marvin J. Ashton\u2019s talk, I have work to do on my heart\u2014but one thing I do have is a willing heart. I am willing to do anything and everything that I can to help in this great cause. I bear witness that I know this is God\u2019s work. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
