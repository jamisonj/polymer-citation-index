We were worshipping our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and honoring his resurrection. We were also thanking God, as we have done today on this special day of prayer, for the liberation of Kuwait and the hope of lasting peace in the Persian Gulf area with the returning of troops to their homelands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p4\" class=\"\">When Christ was born to this world, angels proclaimed, \u201cPeace on earth, good will toward men.\u201d (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32412\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32412)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32412)\">Luke 2:14<\/a><\/span>.) Yet in the two thousand years since that proclamation there has been little peace in the world. Even with the successful cessation of major hostilities in the Gulf, there still remains an uneasy peace between some nations and great unrest within other nations. Just as Christ\u2019s atonement has saved us from both physical and spiritual death, the peace of which the Savior of mankind spoke is also both physical and spiritual.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p5\" class=\"\">Today I\u2019d like to speak about this spiritual peace offered by Christ in the Sermon on the Mount, when he gave us the beautiful beatitude about peace and peacemakers. The entire sermon is a blueprint for us to use in our personal path towards perfection, as well as a pattern of the many attributes and qualities we must develop in our eternal quest to approach the perfection and peace Jesus personifies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p6\" class=\"\">I like to think of when the sermon was first taught. In my mind\u2019s eye, I see a scene of peaceful beauty: I envision an afternoon in early April. The sky is softening toward dusk, with not even a breeze. White, wispy cirrus clouds stand almost motionless in the clear blue sky. And below, on the coast of the Sea of Galilee, soft waves lap against moored fishing boats. A great crowd assembles on the side of the hill. Eager listeners sit on the grass or stand amidst the rocks and early spring flowers. All are hushed and thoughtful as every face is lifted up, every eye looking towards the Lord, and every ear listening as the Savior tells them what they need to do in order to have peace in their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p7\" class=\"\">Tenderly Christ speaks: \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37370\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37370)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37370)\">Matt. 5:9<\/a><\/span>.) Another Bible translator quotes the Savior, saying, \u201cHappy are those who <span class=\"emphasis\">make<\/span> peace.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The New Testament in Modern English,<\/span> trans. J. B. Phillips, New York: The Macmillan Co., 1958, p. 9; italics added.) Either way, we focus on the strong verb <span class=\"emphasis\">make<\/span> as in \u201cmake peace\u201d or \u201cpeacemakers.\u201d To follow Christ and bring forth the blessings of heaven, we must actively make peace in the world, in the community, in the neighborhood, and above all, in the home we live in.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p8\" class=\"\">In the meridian of time, many expected Christ to take a political stand against Roman rule and offer peace to the oppressed people. Christ did indeed offer peace, but it was not external or political; rather, the peace Christ taught was internal and personal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p9\" class=\"\">I would like to share an incident which took place during the Vietnam War. There were some who were convinced that the United States was engaged in a noble and justifiable war. However, public opinion was changing, and there was opposition which argued that the U.S. should pull out of Vietnam.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p10\" class=\"\">President Harold B. Lee was the President of the Church at the time. While at an area conference in another country he was interviewed by reporters from the international news services. One reporter asked President Lee, \u201cWhat is your church\u2019s position on the Vietnam War?\u201d Some recognized the question as a trap\u2014one which could not be answered without a very real risk of being misunderstood or misinterpreted. If the prophet answered, \u201cWe are against the war,\u201d the international media could state, \u201cHow strange\u2014a religious leader who is against the position of the country he is obliged to sustain in his own church\u2019s articles of faith.\u201d On the other hand, if President Lee answered, \u201cWe are in favor of the war,\u201d the media could question, \u201cHow strange\u2014a religious leader in favor of war?\u201d Either way, the answer could result in serious problems regarding public opinion both inside and outside the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p11\" class=\"\">President Lee, with great inspiration and wisdom, answered as would a man who knows the Savior: \u201cWe, together with the whole Christian world, abhor war. But the Savior said, \u2018In me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation.\u2019\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29531\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29531)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29531)\">John 16:33<\/a><\/span>.) And then the prophet quoted that other comforting scripture from John: \u201cPeace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29526\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29526)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29526)\">John 14:27<\/a><\/span>.) President Lee then explained: \u201cThe Savior was not talking about the peace that can be achieved between nations, by military force or by negotiation in the halls of parliaments. Rather, he was speaking of the peace we can each have in our own lives when we live the commandments and come unto Christ with broken hearts and contrite spirits.\u201d (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1982, p. 70.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p12\" class=\"\">A tender, sweet story about receiving peace from the scriptures appeared in the January 1991 <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> submitted by Sister Carole Seegmiller. Using a few excerpts, I quote from her article: \u201cDad decided that our family should begin an intensive study of the scriptures to help my brother Bruce prepare for his mission. Dad\u2019s goal was to read the entire Book of Mormon before Bruce left, tape-recording our voices as we went along. \u2026 We would take turns reading a chapter [each]. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cThe family finished the Book of Mormon a few months later. \u2026 So Dad decided we should read and record the four Gospels from the New Testament. I complained this time, telling Dad that I didn\u2019t see the point: we could buy audiotapes of professionals reading the scriptures\u2014and they sounded a lot better than we did. Still Dad persisted. \u2018Carole, one day these tapes will be a great blessing to us.\u2019 \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cI began to enjoy these times together with the family. I especially liked to hear Dad share his personal insights about a passage. Soon I began to sense the peace that comes through studying the scriptures. We finished reading the four Gospels shortly before Bruce left for the Missionary Training Center. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cAfter Bruce left, I noticed how comforting the tapes were to Dad. He often listened to them, partly just to hear Bruce\u2019s voice, I thought, since they had been very close. Sometimes at night Dad would fall asleep listening, and I would smile to myself as I heard the familiar click-click-click of the recorder that had run to tape\u2019s end. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen Bruce had been gone for more than a year, Dad died quietly of a heart attack. \u2026 All of our family members \u2026 gathered except Bruce, who had determined to finish his mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cThat evening, after [the funeral] \u2026 , I was feeling low. I went upstairs to Dad\u2019s room and dejectedly sat down at his desk. I noticed his well-used tape recorder lying nearby; inside was one of our tapes of the New Testament, which Dad must have listened to the very night before he died. I began rewinding the tape, stopping it at random, hoping to find solace in hearing the gentle resonance of Dad\u2019s voice. \u2026 I sat upright as my father spoke from the tape:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/peace.p18\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.

The roots might be in one\u2019s own life or in the life of a loved one. The causes can be sin, failure to live the commandments of God, selfishness, pride, lack of love, lack of commitment, lack of willingness to make sacrifices for others, or even just being an innocent victim.
