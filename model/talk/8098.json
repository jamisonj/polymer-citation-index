She had grown up in the Church, with parents who taught her the gospel. She attended Primary, Young Women, and seminary. She loved to learn and discover truths. Her constant quest was to know <span class=\"emphasis\">why.<\/span> Elder Russell\u00a0M. Nelson has said, \u201cThe Lord can only teach an inquiring mind.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-12455_000_035\">4<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Russell\u00a0M.

But as the questions grew harder, so did the answers. And sometimes there were no answers\u2014or no answers that brought peace. Eventually, as she sought to find answers, more and more questions arose, and she began to question some of the very foundations of her faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/returning-to-faith.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">During this confusing time, some of those around her said, \u201cJust lean on my faith.\u201d But she thought, \u201cI can\u2019t. You don\u2019t understand; you\u2019re not grappling with these issues.\u201d She explained, \u201cI was willing to extend courtesy to those without doubts if they would extend courtesy to me.\u201d And many did.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/returning-to-faith.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">She said, \u201cMy parents knew my heart and allowed me space. They chose to love me while I was trying to figure it out for myself.\u201d Likewise, this young mother\u2019s bishop often met with her and spoke of his confidence in her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/returning-to-faith.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">Ward members also did not hesitate to give love, and she felt included. Her ward was not a place to put on a perfect face; it was a place of nurture.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/returning-to-faith.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">\u201cIt was interesting,\u201d she remembers. \u201cDuring this time I felt a real connection to my grandparents who had died. They were pulling for me and urging me to keep trying. I felt they were saying, \u2018Focus on what you know.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/returning-to-faith.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">In spite of her substantial support system, she became less active. She said, \u201cI did not separate myself from the Church because of bad behavior, spiritual apathy, looking for an excuse not to live the commandments, or searching for an easy out. I felt I needed the answer to the question \u2018What do I really believe?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/returning-to-faith.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">About this time she read a book of the writings of Mother Teresa, who had shared similar feelings. In a 1953 letter, Mother Teresa wrote: \u201cPlease pray specially for me that I may not spoil His work and that Our Lord may show Himself\u2014for there is such terrible darkness within me, as if everything was dead. It has been like this more or less from the time I started \u2018the work.\u2019 Ask Our Lord to give me courage.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/returning-to-faith.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">Archbishop P\u00e9rier responded: \u201cGod guides you, dear Mother; you are not so much in the dark as you think. The path to be followed may not always be clear at once. Pray for light; do not decide too quickly, listen to what others have to say, consider their reasons. You will always find something to help you. \u2026 Guided by faith, by prayer, and by reason with a right intention, you have enough.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-12455_000_035\">5<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[In <span class=\"emphasis\">Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light; The Private Writings of the Saint of Calcutta,<\/span> ed.

She could take one simple step forward in faith\u2014and then another. She could focus on the truths she did believe and let those truths fill her mind and heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/returning-to-faith.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">As she reflected back, she said, \u201cMy testimony had become like a pile of ashes. It had all burned down. All that remained was Jesus Christ.\u201d She continued, \u201cBut He does not leave you when you have questions. When anyone tries to keep the commandments, the door is wide open. Prayer and scripture study became incredibly important.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/returning-to-faith.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">Her first step to rebuild her faith was to start with basic gospel truths. She bought a Primary songbook and began reading the words of the songs. They were treasures to her. She prayed for faith to lift the heaviness she felt.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/returning-to-faith.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">She learned that when she came up against a statement that caused her to doubt, she \u201ccould stop, look at the whole picture, and make the gospel personal.\u201d She said, \u201cI would ask, \u2018Is this the right path for me and my family?\u2019 Sometimes I would ask myself, \u2018What do I want for my children?\u2019 I realized I want them to have temple marriages. That\u2019s when belief came back to my heart.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/returning-to-faith.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">Elder Jeffrey\u00a0R.

She had focused on studying the New Testament to better understand the Savior. \u201cBut eventually,\u201d she said, \u201cI found myself back in the Book of Mormon because I loved what I felt when reading about Jesus Christ and His Atonement.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/returning-to-faith.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">She concluded, \u201cYou have to have your own spiritual experiences with the truths in that book,\u201d and she was having them.
