Youth is a period of timelessness when the horizons of age seem too distant to be noticed.

And so, though many self-styled authorities justify these practices as a normal release, the Church condemns them. \u2026 Such unholy practices were condemned by ancient prophets and are today condemned by the Church.\u201d (Spencer W.
