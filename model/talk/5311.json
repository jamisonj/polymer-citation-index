As a step in the pattern used by the First Presidency to call, through inspiration, full-time missionaries, each week some of the Twelve review from five hundred to eight hundred recommendations from all over the world. Each call and assignment is made by the Spirit through the Lord\u2019s Apostles. Each candidate\u2019s history is a vignette of sacrifice, devotion, testimony, and faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p4\" class=\"\">Some who do not understand our spiritual roots are baffled by our missionary program. They cannot believe young women are willing to devote one and a half years and young men two years to teach religious principles under a rigorous daily schedule with the highest standards of personal discipline while forgoing dating and all other private interests. Nor can they fathom why such youth work to finance their missions, at times with the help of family or friends, when they cannot choose where or with whom they will serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p5\" class=\"\">Such youth are joined by couples who leave comfortable homes, grandchildren, and recreation, often multiple times, for distant parts of the world to live under the most humble circumstances. A few learn a foreign language; many experience vastly different cultures, accepting challenges they are not sure they can cope with. Yet these youth and couples return from service given at great personal sacrifice, thanking the Lord for the privilege. There is nothing like it in the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p6\" class=\"\">What creates this valiant force of over forty-eight thousand missionaries voluntarily serving others? Whence cometh their strength? The answer lies in the <span class=\"emphasis\">power of correct principles.<\/span> I will explain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p7\" class=\"\">Man has always benefited from obedience to true principles. The fearless Polynesians in precarious craft crossed an immense ocean for destinations thousands of miles away. That feat was accomplished not by chance but by adherence to sound principles of celestial navigation. They prepared carefully and did not succumb to temptations to deviate from their course or delay en route. In like manner, you and I can be assured of reaching worthy objectives in life by understanding and consistently following correct principles rooted in revealed truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p8\" class=\"\">Principles are anchors of safety. They are like the steel anchors a mountaineer uses to conquer otherwise impossible cliffs. They will help you have confidence in new and unfamiliar circumstances. They will provide you protection in life\u2019s storms of adversity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p9\" class=\"\">All of the self-inflicted tragedy that occurs today from violation of the Lord\u2019s commandments could be avoided by careful, consistent observance of revealed truth. The productive power of correct principles can make your life a joyous, satisfying experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p10\" class=\"\">We can understand what motivates missionaries to sacrifice to serve others by examining their early youth. Proverbs records this principle: \u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41637\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41637)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41637)\">Prov. 22:6<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p11\" class=\"\">When, as mothers, you are consistently in the home, at least during the hours the children are predominantly there, you can detect the individual needs of each child and provide ways to satisfy them. Your divinely given instincts help sense a child\u2019s special talents and unique capacities so that you can nurture and strengthen them. Consider these examples of how compassionate love and sensitivity of parents, particularly mothers, bless children\u2019s lives:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p12\" class=\"\">A mother overheard her son, four, tell his brother, six, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in Jesus.\u201d The brother responded, \u201cYou have really hurt my feelings.\u201d Sensing a need, the mother reinforced the younger boy\u2019s understanding of the Savior. She placed a picture of the Redeemer in his room and continued to teach all of her children more about the Master. Sometime later, the younger son commented, \u201cMom, you\u2019re my best friend\u2014next to Jesus.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p13\" class=\"\">Another lovely mother has consistently read scriptures to her children to teach them truth. While overseas with no satisfactory schools, she spent much time and energy painstakingly tutoring them\u2014with amazing results. Once the father went to help their five-year-old daughter with evening prayer. He found her kneeling, sharing her tender feelings with her Heavenly Father. Sensing his presence, she looked up. He said, \u201cDo you know how wonderful it makes Father in Heaven feel when you talk to Him?\u201d She responded, \u201cOh, Daddy, I will always talk to my Father in Heaven.\u201d Such is the pure heart of a five-year-old that has been carefully, spiritually nurtured.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p14\" class=\"\">Another mother read gospel stories to her children from a young, formative age. Once, as she read of the crucifixion of the Savior, her two-and-a-half-year-old son sobbed. She realized that he was a spiritually sensitive child. Through the years that child has become a righteous, disciplined young man who loves the Lord and keeps His commandments. Profanity, so prevalent today, is particularly offensive to him. As he shuns it and other evils, he is criticized for being too \u201cchurchy.\u201d While it is difficult now, as he continues his resolve to be righteous, he will become a powerfully strong husband, father, and leader.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p15\" class=\"\">When two-year-old Clayton overheard the family sharing feelings about his grandmother serving in Swaziland, Africa, his little heart was touched. Often he would fold his arms, bow his head, and say, \u201cGam-ma on mission. Jesus. Amen.\u201d When she returned, he did not recognize her until she said, \u201cThis is your missionary grandma.\u201d Instantly, he broke into a smile, ran, and threw his arms around her. Each grandchild now wants to be a missionary.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p16\" class=\"\">What enduring fruits will result from seeds of truth you carefully plant and thoughtfully cultivate in the fertile soil of your child\u2019s trusting mind and heart? Recently I reviewed the history of many missionaries and found a powerful correlation between exceptional missionaries and mothers who chose to remain home, often at great financial and personal sacrifice. With the names changed, I share excerpts of bishops\u2019 and stake presidents\u2019 comments about real missionaries. It is but a fraction of the many thousands of examples available. They reflect honor to mothers who sacrificed to remain home for their children\u2019s benefit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cKevin is one of the finest young men I have known.

He also said, \u201cWe realize \u2026 that some of our choice sisters are widowed and divorced and that others find themselves in unusual circumstances where, out of necessity, they are required to work for a period of time. But these instances are the exception, not the rule.\u201d (Ezra Taft Benson, <span class=\"emphasis\">To the Mothers in Zion,<\/span> pamphlet, 1987, pp. 5\u20136.) You in these unusual circumstances qualify for additional inspiration and strength from the Lord. Those who leave the home for lesser reasons will not.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p35\" class=\"\">Parents, don\u2019t make the mistake of purposefully intervening to soften or eliminate the natural consequences of your child\u2019s deliberate decisions to violate the commandments.

Is your life unconsciously fueled with the burning desire for more things that could compromise eternal relationships and the molding of a child\u2019s developing character? You must be willing to forgo personal pleasure and self-interest for family-centered activity, and not turn over to church, school, or society the principal role of fostering a child\u2019s well-rounded development. It takes time, great effort, and significant personal sacrifice to \u201ctrain up a child in the way he should go.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41638\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41638)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41638)\">Prov. 22:6<\/a><\/span>] But where can you find greater rewards for a job well done?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p38\" class=\"\">You may not have the blessing of being raised in an understanding family, yet your use of correct principles will mold, strengthen, and give purpose to your lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-power-of-correct-principles.p39\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith\u2019s inspired statement, \u201cI teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves,\u201d still applies. (Quoted by John Taylor, in <span class=\"emphasis\">Millennial Star, <\/span>15 Nov. 1851, p. 339.) The Lord uses that pattern with us. You will find correct principles in the teachings of the Savior, His prophets, and the scriptures\u2014especially the Book of Mormon. While easy to find, true principles are not easy to live until they become an established pattern of life. They will require you to dislodge false ideas. They can cause you wrenching battles within the secret chambers of your heart and decisive encounters to overcome temptation, peer pressure, and the false allure of the \u201ceasy way out.\u201d Yet, as you resolutely follow correct principles, you will forge strength of character available to you in times of urgent need. Your consistent adherence to principle overcomes the alluring yet false life-styles that surround you.
