And further, if he was accepted of God,<span class=\"footRef\">3<\/span> what were the ordinances performed further than the\n  offering of the firstlings of the flock?<span class=\"footRef\">4<\/span><\/p>\n  <div class=\"topic \">The Lord Spake to Abel<\/div>\n  <p class=\"std\">It is said by Paul in his letter to the Hebrew brethren, that Abel obtained witness that he was\n  righteous, God testifying of his gifts.<span class=\"footRef\">5<\/span> To whom did God testify of the gifts of Abel, was it to Paul?\n  We have very little on this important subject in the forepart of the Bible. But it is said that Abel\n  himself obtained witness that he was righteous. Then certainly God spoke to him: indeed, it is said\n  that God talked with him;<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> and if He did, would He not, seeing that Able was righteous deliver to\n  him the whole plan of the Gospel? And is not the Gospel the news of the redemption?<span class=\"footRef\">7<\/span> How could\n  Abel offer a sacrifice and look forward with faith on the Son of God for a remission of his sins, and\n  not understand the Gospel? The mere shedding of the blood of beasts or offering anything else in\n  sacrifice, could not procure a remission of sins, except it were performed in faith of something to\n  come; if it could, Cain&rsquo;s offering must have been as good as Abel&rsquo;s. And if Abel was taught of the\n  coming of the Son of God, was he not taught also of His ordinances? We all admit that the Gospel\n  has ordinances, and if so, had it not always ordinances, and were not its ordinances always the same? <\/p>\n  <div class=\"topic \">Gospel Ordinances from the Beginning<\/div>\n  <p class=\"std\">Perhaps our friends will say that the Gospel and its ordinances were not known till the days of\n  John,<span class=\"footRef\">8<\/span> the son of Zacharias, in the days of Herod, the king of Judea.<span class=\"footRef\">9<\/span> But we will here look at this\n  point: For our own part we cannot believe that the ancients in all ages were so ignorant of the system\n  of heaven as many suppose, since all that were ever saved, were saved through the power of this\n  great plan of redemption,<span class=\"footRef\">10<\/span> as much before the coming of Christ as since; if not, God has had<\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110259\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110259)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110259)\">Heb. 11:4<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">2. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"111942\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 111942)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(111942)\">Alma 13:16<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">3. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"109364\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 109364)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(109364)\">Rom. 12:1<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"109386\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 109386)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(109386)\">Rom. 14:18<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110423\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110423)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110423)\">1 Pet. 2:5<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">4. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"105983\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 105983)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(105983)\">Gen. 4:4<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">5. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110260\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110260)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110260)\">Heb. 11:4<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">6. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"116779\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 116779)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(116779)\">Moses 5:17,26<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">7. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"116651\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 116651)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(116651)\">D&amp;C 138:19,57<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">8. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107943\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107943)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107943)\">Matt. 11:12<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">9. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108393\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108393)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108393)\">Luke 1:5<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">10. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112151\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112151)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112151)\">Alma 34:31<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
