I trust the Lord will bless us while I talk to you.

P.

If it is to be rescued, it must be done by men of integrity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p10\" class=\"\">To accomplish this tremendous task, the Lord has called his priesthood.

We must not fail him. We must be boys and men of integrity. Our individual exaltation depends upon our proving to the Lord that we will at all hazards and under all circumstances faithfully discharge the trust he has placed in us. (See <span class=\"emphasis\">History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,<\/span> 3:380.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p12\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that absolute integrity must precede the promise of eternal life. He said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cAfter a person has faith in Christ, repents of his sins, and is baptized for the remission of his sins and receives the Holy Ghost, \u2026 then let him continue to humble himself before God, hungering and thirsting after righteousness, and living by every word of God, and the Lord will soon say unto him, Son, thou shalt be exalted.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p14\" class=\"\">This promise is to come, however, only after \u201cthe Lord has thoroughly proved him, and finds that the man is determined to serve him at all hazards.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 3:380.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p15\" class=\"\">We have among our leaders in the Church, in all callings of the priesthood from deacons to apostles, examples of brethren whose performance demonstrates this integrity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p16\" class=\"\">President Kimball, for example. Throughout the years he has been a pattern of integrity. No one doubts that he would discharge the sacred trust the Lord has placed upon him at the peril of his life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p17\" class=\"\">President Tanner likewise. As a matter of fact, his performance throughout distinguished careers of business and government has been so circumspect and courageous that his associates refer to him as \u201cMr. Integrity.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p18\" class=\"\">I shall now call attention to some circumstances in which this matter of integrity is involved. Here is an account that you bearers of the Aaronic Priesthood might think about:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cFour Latter-day Saint boys set out from a Utah city on a cross-country trip. They had saved all their money during the last year of high school for this purpose, and now that graduation was over, they packed their suitcases into the trunk of their car and said good-byes to worrying parents and envious friends. It was a matter of considerable celebration when they crossed the Utah State line and entered into another state. They pulled up alongside the highway and got out to see how it felt to be in new surroundings. A certain thrill of excitement was noted by each of the young travelers and a sense of adventure led them to great speculation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cThey had agreed to send their parents a postcard every other day to indicate their whereabouts, and had promised to send a collect telegram if they ran into any trouble. One of the boys commented that it felt real good to be on his own and not be under the necessity of getting advance approval from someone for every move he made. Another suggested that they must act like seasoned travelers and not impress others as country boys on their first junket away from home. As a follow-up, this same boy proposed to his friends that they forget all about being Mormons for the duration of their adventure. Asked why by the other three puzzled boys, he said that they could now afford to \u2018let their hair down\u2019 and sample some of the excitement enjoyed by other people, not of the Mormon Church. \u2018Anyway,\u2019 he argued, \u2018what difference will it make? Nobody out here in the world knows us or cares anything about our church connections.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cThe thrill of the new experience weighted their judgment, and the group made an agreement to give it a try. They decided to announce themselves to the world as students from the East who had been to school in Utah for a short time. Their Utah license plates made this necessary.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cNightfall on the first day of the journey found them at a famous tourist attraction spot, and they made arrangements for camping near the resort. After the evening meal they gathered at the large hotel for the night\u2019s entertainment. No sooner had they arrived when the ringleader of the boys suggested that they begin here and now sampling the things they had so long been denied by strict parents and teachers. The first thing that caught their eyes was a large neon sign at the far end of the lounge. It read, \u2018Bar\u2014beer, cocktails.\u2019 Thinking it a moderate nod in the direction of \u2018sinning just a little bit,\u2019 they agreed to go into the bar and order a glass of beer for each one. There was a nervous air about them as they entered the gaudily lighted bar and surveyed the counters loaded with intriguing bottles of liquor. The boy who had been delegated to give the order lost his voice on the first try and had to swallow hard to get out an understandable, \u2018Four glasses of beer, please.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cWhat the beer lacked in palatability, the atmosphere and thrill more than made up. They grew bolder and began to talk of the next adventure they would undertake. The talk was growing racy when suddenly a well-dressed man entered the bar and walked straight toward their table. The look on the stranger\u2019s face and the determined pace at which he walked toward them left the boys completely unnerved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen the man reached the table at which the boys were sitting, he extended his hand to one of them and said, \u2018I beg your pardon, but aren\u2019t you George Redford\u2019s son from Utah?\u2019 The boy was speechless and terrified. His fingers froze around the base of the glass of beer and he answered in a wavering voice, \u2018Why, yes, sir, I am.\u2019 \u2018I thought I recognized you when you came in the lobby of the hotel,\u2019 the stranger continued. \u2018I am Henry Paulsen, vice-president of the company your dad works for, and I met you and your mother last winter at a company dinner at the Hotel Utah. I have never forgotten how you explained your Mormon priesthood to one of the other executives of our company who asked you what it meant to be a Mormon boy. I must say I was a little surprised to see you head for the bar, but I suppose that with Mormons as well as non-Mormons, boys will be boys when they\u2019re off the roost.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cThese boys had heard a sermon they would never hear duplicated in the pulpit. They were sick, ashamed, and crestfallen. As they left their half-filled glasses and walked out through the hotel lobby, they had the feeling that everyone was looking at them. The cover of darkness was kind as they made their way to their camp. \u2018You just can\u2019t win,\u2019 said the boy who had proposed their dropping their true identity, trying to ease the tension. \u2018I\u2019m not so sure,\u2019 replied the boy to who the stranger had spoken. \u2018If we have any sense left, we can make this experience into the most winning lesson of our lives.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p26\" class=\"\">Here is another experience\u2014an experience of President Joseph F. Smith reported by the late President Charles W. Nibley, which you young elders might ponder to your profit:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cAnother incident which I have heard him relate,\u201d says Brother Nibley, speaking about President Joseph F. Smith, who was the president of the Church and father of our late president, Joseph Fielding Smith, \u201cwhich shows his courage and integrity, occurred when he was returning from his mission to the Sandwich Islands, in the fall of 1857. He came home by way of Los Angeles, by what was called the Southern Route. In that year Johnston\u2019s Army was on the move for Utah, and naturally enough there was much excitement and bitterness of feeling concerning the \u2018Mormons.\u2019 In southern California, just after the little train of wagons had traveled only a short distance and made their camp, several anti-\u2018Mormon\u2019 toughs rode into the camp on horseback, cursing and swearing and threatening what they would do to the \u2018Mormons.\u2019 Joseph F. was a little distance from the camp gathering wood for the fire, but he saw that the few members of his own party had cautiously gone into the brush down the creek, out of sight. When he saw that, he told me,\u201d says Brother Nibley, \u201cthe thought came into his mind, \u2018Shall I run from these fellows? Why should I fear them?\u2019 With that he marched up with his arm full of wood to the campfire where one of the ruffians, still with his pistol in his hand, shouting and cursing about the \u2018Mormons,\u2019 in a loud voice said to Joseph F.:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p28\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018Are you a \u2018Mormon?\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the answer came straight, \u2018Yes, siree; dyed in the wool; true blue, through and through.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cAt that the ruffian grasped him by the hand and said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p31\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018Well, you are the ---- ---- pleasantest man I ever met! Shake, young fellow, I am glad to see a man that stands up for his convictions.\u2019\u201d (Joseph F. Smith, <span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Doctrine,<\/span> Deseret Book Co., 1939 ed., p. 518.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p32\" class=\"\">Abraham Lincoln demonstrated his great integrity in his famous house-divided speech. John Wesley Hill, in his book <span class=\"emphasis\">Abraham Lincoln\u2014Man of God,<\/span> says: \u201cLincoln showed his independence and tenacity of purpose when he wrote his address accepting the nomination for United States Senator. \u2026 This is known as \u2018The House Divided Against Itself\u2019 speech. It embodied the historic declaration that the Union could not exist \u2018half slave and half free.\u2019 To his friend, Jesse K. Dubois, Lincoln said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p33\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018I refused to read the passage about the house divided against itself to you, because I knew you would ask me to change or modify it, and that I was determined not to do. I had willed it so and was willing, if necessary, to perish with it. I would rather be defeated with this expression in the speech \u2026 than to be victorious without it.\u2019\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Abraham Lincoln\u2014Man of God,<\/span> New York and London: G. P. Putnam\u2019s Sons, 1927, p. 151.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p34\" class=\"\">Now it took real courage for Lincoln to leave that \u201chalf slave and half free\u201d sentence in his speech. He was ambitious, and it seemed that through the Senate was the way to the presidency, but the political climate at the time was not ready for the stand he took on that issue. The probability was that the statement would mean defeat in his race for the Senate, and that\u2019s what it turned out to be. All this Lincoln well knew; nevertheless, he had the integrity to act in harmony with his convictions. Although his course did shut the door to the Senate, fortunately for the country, it later opened the door to the presidency.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p35\" class=\"\">President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., was a man of like integrity. As a young man he presided for a short time over the Southern Branch of the State Normal College in Cedar City, Utah. He developed a great interest in that institution.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p36\" class=\"\">\u201cTwo years later \u2026 his help was solicited to give encouragement to members of the legislature to provide the funds which had been requested by the institution.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p37\" class=\"\">Responding by letter he \u201cexplained in utter frankness and candor that he could not support the \u2026 request\u201d for $100,000.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p38\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018\u2026 Frankly and freely,\u2019 he said, \u2018I believe you are asking too much. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p39\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018\u2026 I have thought the matter over very carefully, and have not been able to see my way clear to honestly recommend to your representatives the appropriation \u2026 you ask. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p40\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018If you would say that you will drop the $100,000 and work for the $54,000 you may count on my active cooperation to the very limit of my poor ability; but if you still reach after the larger amount, you will at once see it will be better if I keep quiet; and I promise you that I shall do that.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/integrity.p41\" class=\"\">\u201cThe frankness in this letter was to become a distinguishing characteristic of [President] Clark\u2019s correspondence and dealings with men throughout his long career. Although his recommendations many times did not contain what others had hoped to receive, nonetheless his candor and complete honesty contributed greatly to men\u2019s confidence in him for they knew they could depend upon him to say what he really thought.\u201d (David H.
