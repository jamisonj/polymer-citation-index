So she and Jeanne walked slowly, noticing Heavenly Father\u2019s creations: the rocks on the mountain peak above them and the flowers all around them. Jeanne later said, \u201cIt really didn\u2019t take me long to forget about my goal of hiking to the peak, for it soon became an adventure of another kind\u2014an adventure to point out the beauties along the path, many of which I would have missed had I just hiked to reach the goal of Malan\u2019s Peak.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/general-relief-society-meeting\/we-have-great-reason-to-rejoice.p17\" class=\"\">As Jeanne and Ashley continued hiking, far behind the rest of the group, they were joined by Emma, another young woman in the ward, who had decided to wait and walk with them.
