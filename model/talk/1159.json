I am grateful that I had the\nopportunity with you of raising my hand in sustaining the officers presented here today. With\nall my heart and soul I sustain the President of our Church, President David O. McKay, as the\nprophet, seer, and revelator of the Lord. With all my soul I love him and honor him and am\nvery grateful for his leadership.\n<\/p><p>\nI am thankful for these men who have been sustained with him. Our hearts all go out to\nPresident Clark who is not here; our faith and prayers likewise. I am thankful for the great\nwork that President Moyle is doing. I am thankful that President Brown has been called to his\nposition.\n<\/p><p>\nI am very grateful indeed that Gordon Hinckley has been called into the twelve. I have known\nGordon most of his life and a good part of mine. We grew up together in the First Ward in\nLiberty Stake. His father was our stake president for much of the time. His father was as\nclose to me as my own father nearly, and I loved him as a father, and still do.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I welcome these other brethren, and these sisters, and I join with all of you in wishing the\nvery best for these who have been released. I express sincere appreciation for the remarkable\nwork they have done.\n<\/p><p>\nIn one of the recent editions of the <i>US News and World Report<\/i>, the editors commented upon\nthe troublemaking propensities of Mr. Khrushchev. They said that great as is the Berlin crisis,\nit will not be our last one. There will be others, and still others after that, because Mr.\nKhrushchev is determined to cause turmoil wherever and whenever he can. They branded him\nas a persistent troublemaker, and said that he seems to have no other purpose than to cause\nunpleasantness, misery, and contention.\n<\/p><p>\nThe world is becoming more and more resentful of the constant trouble-making of this man.\nInternational quarreling and bitterness are indeed affecting the nerves of all mankind.\nInhuman treatment, the urge to take advantage of others, cruelty, lying,\nmisrepresentation, deceit, and dishonor are sickening to the hearts of most people. Every\nhonest person condemns the duplicity of Mr. Khrushchev. Everyone resents his\ntrouble-making, his unpleasantness, his inhumanity. It is so deliberate, so coldly calculated. It\nseems clearly evident that an evil spirit motivates this man.\n<\/p><p>\nBut let us stop for a moment and think about that spirit. It is evil enough in Khrushchev, and\nwe are very prompt in condemning it in him, and yet, how do we regard that same spirit\nwhen it appears in smaller circles and not upon the broad stage of international politics? How\ndo we regard unpleasantness, contention, deceit, misrepresentation, cruelty, and dishonor in\nour communities here at home, for instance? Or among our immediate friends? Or in our\noffice or shop? Or even in our family circle?\n<\/p><p>\nAre these evil tactics any less despicable at home than on the world scene? Are they any less\nevil if found in ourselves than when exhibited by Mr. Khrushchev? Is quarreling among\nnations any worse than quarreling among members of a family, except as to the number of\npeople involved? Is it any worse for Khrushchev personally to assail the President of the\nUnited States than for a husband to be cruel to his wife or child? Could our President be any\nmore offended by Khrushchev's insults than a wife who is insulted and humiliated by a\nthoughtless or vicious husband?\n<\/p><p>\nMost of us hate Mr. Khrushchev's wickedness, but do we excuse similar traits of character\nwhen found in ourselves? Let me read from a letter I received recently.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I am writing to ask if there is some way you can help me. My husband and I were married a\nlittle over ten years ago. For the first year we got along all right, but when our first child\ncame my husband began to change. I really believe he was jealous of the attention I gave to\nmy little infant child. He was very upset when the baby cried, especially at night. Once he\neven slapped the tiny baby's face. I ran to take the baby from him, and he struck me so hard\nthat he knocked me down.\n<\/p><p>\n\"It has been like that in our home ever since. We have not had a pleasant hour in months. My\nhusband never smiles anymore. When he comes home from work a spirit of gloom and hatred\ncomes into the house with him. My little boy, now nearly nine, is afraid of his dad and runs\ninto the bedroom whenever his father comes home. My little girl whimpers at his sight. I have\nreached the point where I feel I must choose between my husband and my peace of mind.\nThe doctor says that if I stay with him my children and I will all be nervous wrecks. What do\nyou think we should do?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen I received this from a young woman seventeen years of age. \"I have decided to run\naway from home. I can't stand my father's cruelty any longer. I have tried to get my mother\nto leave home with me, but she won't. She is superstitious about divorce and would rather die\nthan go through a divorce court. Why must we have such trouble in our home? I always\nthought home was a place to enjoy.\"\n<\/p><p>\nA young woman came into my office one day, and she was the saddest-looking girl I have\never seen. She and her mother did not get along well. They had entirely different ideas on\nnearly every subject. She said her mother tries to run her life for her, tries to make all of her\ndecisions, chooses her friends, and even decides what clothes she should wear. This girl\nplanned to leave home to escape the constant quarreling that goes on in that home I did not\nhear the mother's side of the story, but I am sure she has one. It takes two to make a quarrel.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I think of the divorce problems which are prevalent in so many homes, when I think of\nthe conflict between parents and children, when I hear inflammatory remarks from men and\nwomen who should know better, when I see the pugnacious attitude of some who seem to\nenjoy being bullies in their own homes, when I see how man's inhumanity to man makes so\nmany others mourn even close about us, I wonder if we really are a peace-loving people.\n<\/p><p>\nI wonder how much we Americans really believe in the teachings of the Prince of Peace. I\nalmost wonder if we believe more in the trouble-making philosophy of Khrushchev than we\ndo in the peace philosophy of Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are supposed to be a Christian nation. Then why don't we act as Christians should? Why\ndo so many act more like Khrushchev than they do like Christ? If we profess to believe in the\nteachings of Jesus, why don't we obey them? Do we think professions are enough? Must we\nonly pretend to be Christians?\n<\/p><p>\nAre the works of Christianity no longer important? Do we really believe Jesus when he said,\n\"Blessed are the peacemakers\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35088\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35088)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35088)\">Matt. 5:9<\/a><\/span>)?\nIf we do, then why do we not do more to establish\npeace in our own personal circles, in our relationships with our wives and husbands and\nchildren? Why don't we plan for and promote courtesy, love, and kindness in our homes? Is\nfamily tension any more to be desired than world tension? Must we have either or both?\n<\/p><p>\nIs an evil dictator any worse in a nation than in a family, so far as the affected people are\nconcerned?\n<\/p><p>\nIs it a sign of strength to be quarrelsome and unpleasant? Does might make right in a nation\nor in a shop or in a family? Are any of us so blind that we think that one member of the\nfamily can always be right and nobody else? Can we be so deceived by our egotism that we\nsuppose that like the king we can do no wrong, that we can be domineering and tyrannical in\nour own little circle with impunity?\n<\/p><p>\nIf you quarrel with your wife, have you thought that you might be motivated by the same\nspirit which moves Khrushchev when he quarrels with the President of the United States?\n<\/p><p>\nIf you are contentious in your family, or quarrelsome with your neighbors, or even with your\nbrethren and sisters in the Church, have you thought that you might be motivated by the same\nspirit which also moves Khrushchev? How different from him are we if the same evil spirit\nmotivates us both?\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Savior came among the Nephites after his resurrection in Palestine, he taught these\nearly Americans a most important lesson on this point. Said he: \". . . there shall be no\ndisputations among you, as there have hitherto been; \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of\ncontention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another;\nbut this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5628\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5628)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5628)\">3 Ne. 11:28-30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLet us think seriously about that scripture: the spirit of contention is the spirit of the devil,\nwho is the father of contention! Can we suppose that any of us can do the work of Christ if\nwe have the spirit of contention in our hearts or in our homes? Can we do the work of God\nby the spirit of the devil?\n<\/p><p>\nWe are engaged in the Lord's work. Then we should be guided by the Spirit of the Lord and\nnot by some contrary spirit. We should not invite into our homes the spirit of Satan himself\nby engaging in family quarrels, contention, and arguments.\n<\/p><p>\nNo one needs to be grouchy. No one needs to be unpleasant. Everyone can control his\nemotions if he wants to, just as he can control his appetites.\n<\/p><p>\nPeople can be kind if they want to be kind. They can be considerate if they want to be. They\ncan be peaceful if they would but try. They can be thoughtful and considerate of others if\nthey but have the desire. Why even Khrushchev can smile and polish apples when he wants\nto.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we expect to do the work of Christ, let us follow the Savior's teachings.\n<\/p><p>\nHe is the Prince of Peace. Then should we not be peacemakers?\n<\/p><p>\nHe is the Author of mercy. Then should we not be merciful?\n<\/p><p>\nHe is the personification of love. Then should we not practice the principles of love which he\ngave us?\n<\/p><p>\nHow can we forget the words of Paul?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become\nas sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Charity never faileth . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these\nthree; but the greatest of these is charity\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"342\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 342)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(342)\">1 Cor. 13:1,8,13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd what is charity? It is the pure love of Christ\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38284\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38284)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38284)\">Moro. 7:47<\/a><\/span>). Has it any place in our lives? In our\nhomes? In our family circles?\n<\/p><p>\nDo we have love at home? If we are without it, are we truly practicing our religion? What\nqualifies us as followers of Christ? The Lord gave the answer to the Prophet Joseph Smith in\nthese words: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And faith, hope, charity and love, . . . qualify him for the work\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13956\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13956)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13956)\">D&amp;C 4:5<\/a><\/span>). Then he added\ntemperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, humility. Is there any godliness in a\nfamily quarrel? Or any kindness or charity or mercy?\n<\/p><p>\nEliminate unkindness from the homes of America and we will pretty well eliminate divorce\nfrom this land.\n<\/p><p>\nIn this day of trouble it ill becomes any of us to pattern our lives and our habits after the arch\ntroublemaker of the world. He is contentious, he is quarrelsome, he is bitter, he is cruel. Do\nwe want to be like him?\n<\/p><p>\nIs it not better to remember our own religion and develop without ourselves the spirit of love\nand kindness and mercy? Isn't it better to have love at home than a house full of bitterness,\nquarreling, and broken hearts?\n<\/p><p>\nIsn't there room for courtesy and consideration in our homes? Should not a man be as\ncourteous to his wife after marriage&mdash;ten years, twenty years after marriage&mdash;as he was\nduring his courting days?\n<\/p><p>\nShould we not learn to love our neighbor as ourselves, and is not wife or husband our closest\nneighbor?\n<\/p><p>\nShould not the spirit of prayer, the Spirit of God, pervade our homes instead of the spirit of\nbitterness and strife? Ask yourself what spirit is in your home, and ask yourself whose path\nyou wish to follow. Will it be that of Khrushchev, or of Christ?\n<\/p><p>\nGod give us the wisdom and the courage to be kind, I pray in Jesus' name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
