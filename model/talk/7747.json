The early members of the Church had endured tremendous adversity as the Restoration of the gospel unfurled. They had been driven from their homes, persecuted, and hounded. They had suffered untold hardships as they crossed the plains. But now they were at last in \u201cthe right place.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/our-very-survival.p6\" class=\"\">And yet the winter of 1848 had been extremely harsh. The winter had been so cold that some people\u2019s feet had been badly frozen. A spirit of uneasiness began to descend upon the Saints. Some Church members declared that they would not build their homes in the valley. They wanted to remain in their wagons, for they were sure that Church leadership would herald them on to some better location. They had brought seeds and fruit plants, but they dared not waste them by planting in the barren desert wasteland. Jim Bridger, a well-known explorer of the time, told Brigham Young he would give a thousand dollars for the first bushel of corn raised in the Salt Lake Valley because, he said, it could not be done.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-09211_000_016\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Bryant\u00a0S.

Many Church members had faith in Brigham Young\u2019s prophecies, while others remained skeptical and left for what they assumed would be a better life. Yet history has shown that every prophecy Brigham Young declared has come to pass. The valley did blossom and produce. The Saints prospered. The winter of 1848 was a great catalyst for the Lord to teach His people a valuable lesson. They learned\u2014as we all must learn\u2014that the only sure and secure road to protection in this life comes through trusting in and obeying the counsel from the prophets of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/our-very-survival.p13\" class=\"\">Surely one of the crowning blessings of membership in this Church is the blessing of being led by living prophets of God.

We would do well to search out answers to our problems and questions by investigating what the Lord has revealed through His prophets. With that same technology today, we have at our fingertips access to the words of the prophets on nearly any subject. What has God taught us about marriage and the family through His prophets?
