It has been stated by one of our leading men that God is &#x201C;a business God,&#x201D; and many remarks have been made concerning that expression by persons opposed to us, with the desire of turning it to ridicule. It has not been stated by any of our brethren that God is <span class=\"italic\">only<\/span> a business God, but the remark was made with reference to some of his attributes and of His works. The people of the present day who profess to believe in God, generally speaking, have very little idea in regard to what He is. They consider that He is incomprehensible. Their ideas concerning Him are very vague, and the attempts which have been made to explain God to the children of men, by persons who claim to be teachers of religion, and to have authority to speak in the name of the Lord, are of such a char<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"18b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0018.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;18b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9510\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>acter that no one can understand them. The reason of this is because those persons who have attempted to make an explanation have not understood the subject themselves; and when a person does not understand a thing it is very difficult for him to try and make somebody else understand it. Now, I do not pretend to say that there is anybody living who fully and entirely comprehends God; but there are many people living who have some definite ideas concerning Him, concerning His attributes, concerning His ways, concerning His will; and what they understand they are at liberty to declare and to try and make other people understand, particularly if they are called upon by the Lord, and authorized by Him so to do. People very frequently refer to that passage of Scripture which says: &#x201C;God is a Spirit,&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"69097\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 69097)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(69097)\">John 4:24<\/a><\/span> and as their notions concerning what spirit is, are not very clear, that passage of Scripture does not make very plain to their understanding what God is.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129154\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129154)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129154)\">John 4:26 (JST)<\/a><\/span> People, generally speaking, have an idea that spirit is something intangible, something that cannot  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"19a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0019.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;19a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9509\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>be comprehended, nor seen, nor handled; that it is far different in every respect from anything that is material; in fact, the philosophers and theologians call spirit &#x201C;immaterial substance.&#x201D; Now, this is for want of knowing better.

Now, who can understand these contradictions which are to be found in the creeds of modern Christendom? The Athanasian Creed was read in the Church of England, as it is called, when I was a boy, and I believe it is now. I think the American Episcopal Church has discarded it, which was very sensible. It says: <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n93\"> &#x201C;Whosoever will be saved, before all things he must hold the Catholic faith, which faith except he do keep whole and undefiled he shall, without doubt, perish everlastingly.&#x201D; And the Catholic faith is this: &#x201C;That we worship one God in Trinity, and trinity in unity, neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance. For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost, but their glory is equal, and their majesty co-eternal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such the Holy Ghost. The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God; and yet there are not three Gods, but one God. The Father is Lord, the Son is Lord, and the Holy Ghost is Lord, and yet there are not three Lords, but one Lord.
