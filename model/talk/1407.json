Eldon Tanner, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1965, pp. 93-96<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nIt's good to be here, my brethren, and to partake of the Spirit that has been here with us this\nevening and to hear the admonition which is good for all of us. All I wish to say on the Word\nof Wisdom this evening is to tell you an experience which I told you once before. When I\nwas driving along and had two young men with me in my car, and a young man thumbed a\nride with us, I asked the boys who were with me if we should take him with us, and they said\nyes. I picked him up, and after we had driven along a little way he said, \"Do you mind if I\nsmoke in your car?\" I said, \"No, not at all if you can give me any good reason why you\nshould smoke.\" And I said, \"I will go farther than that.\" (I was stake president at this time.)\n\"If you can give me a good reason why you should smoke, I will smoke with you.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWell, these two young men looked at me and wondered. We drove on for some distance,\nabout twenty minutes, I think, and I turned around and said, \"Aren't you going to smoke?\"\nAnd he said, \"No.\" I said, \"Why not?\" And he said, \"I can't think of a good reason why I\nshould.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI would like that word to go to all of our young men, and when you can think of a good\nreason, and only when you can, then begin to smoke.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Read the Book of Mormon Before Christmas<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAt the priesthood meeting in October, I reminded you that President Joseph Fielding Smith\nhad said a year before that we should all read the Book of Mormon. I said that I had read it,\nand I appealed to all under the sound of my voice to read the Book of Mormon before\nChristmas. I am happy to report that I received letters, telegrams, and people told me orally as\nthey met me on the street, as they came into my office, and over the telephone, from some\nyoung boys in Montreal, Canada, to the General Authorities who said, \"I read the Book of\nMormon as you asked me to do, and I appreciated this challenge and have enjoyed reading\nthe Book of Mormon.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow I have two letters here that I should like to read to you: \"Marg and I have accepted your\nchallenge to reread the Book of Mormon and have extended it to include Steve. We have\nspent several pleasant evenings taking turns reading to each other and explaining passages to\nSteve. Though he is only eight he grasps the story very clearly. It gives him an opportunity to\nlearn new words and meet new ideas that will be of value to him throughout his life. We are\nenjoying this rich experience and thank you for the challenge.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnother letter which I received: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Dear President Tanner,\n<\/p><p>\n\"I am the young boy, twelve years of age, you challenged to read the Book of Mormon after\nGeneral Priesthood outside the temple grounds on the sidewalk by the drinking fountain.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I want to thank you for the challenge. It was a great opportunity for me to work to\naccomplish the goal set by you, and it strengthened my testimony of the gospel a great deal.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I would have written to you sooner, but I had some passages and some scriptures to\nmemorize for my certificate of award.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I know that the Book of Mormon is true, and it has helped me to become a better boy.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI might say that I received written replies from 261, and I am sure there were many more\nwho did not take the time to write, and I didn't expect anyone to write.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Great Commandments: Love God and Neighbor<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow this evening I had hoped to talk to you for a little while on the answer that Jesus gave to\nthe lawyer who, tempting him, said,\n<\/p><p>\n\"Master, which is the great commandment in the law?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy\nsoul, and with all thy mind.\n<\/p><p>\n\"This is the first and great commandment.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35493\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35493)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35493)\">Matt. 22:36-39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI won't have time to deal with that as it refers to \"thy neighbor,\" other than I would like to\nsay this: I should like you to include as your first neighbor the neighbor to whom you are\nmost directly responsible, and that is the neighbor who lives in your house with you, your\nwife and your children.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Wife, Your Neighbor<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, I have had a number of women in my experience come to me because they were\nnot loved in the home. That is just too bad. It is a condition that just cannot exist where we\nhave the priesthood at the head of the home. Surely a man thinks as much of his wife as he\ndoes of someone else who comes into the home, and surely he is prepared to treat her with\nthe same courtesy, the same consideration, as he would a stranger coming into the home. Yet\nI remember as a boy going to homes where that was not true. And I remember going into\nhomes where it was true, and the difference in those homes was very noticeable.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, if I gave you any challenge tonight, it is to go home and, when you go into the\nhouse, express appreciation to that wife who is there, and let those children know that you\nlove them, and don't be afraid to do it.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Goodwill, a Missionary Essential<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I was in the mission field interviewing missionaries I thought it was a very important\nthing for them to have love in their hearts if they were going to preach the gospel and be\nrepresentatives, ambassadors, of the Lord Jesus Christ, and I asked those missionaries every\ntime if they loved the Lord, and they said yes. And I said, \"How does he know?\" And they\nsaid, \"Well, we have told him.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord said, \"If you love me, you will keep my commandments\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28203\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28203)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28203)\">John 14:15<\/a><\/span>). That's\nthe way he knows. Then I asked those boys, \"How many of you love your mothers?\" There\nwasn't an exception. I said, \"How many times have you told your mother you love her?\" And\non many occasions the answer was, \"I don't know when I told her or how many times I have\ntold her,\" or, \"I don't think I ever told my mother I love her.\"\n<\/p><p>\nImagine, any young man, an elder, out representing this Church, having never told his mother\nthat he loved her. Do you know why he hasn't? Because his father didn't tell his wife that he\nloved her.\n<\/p><p>\nI felt like writing to the fathers of those boys every time, but each time I had that boy\npromise me that he would sit down and write a letter and say, \"Mother, I love you,\" and tell\nher why he loved her. It is so important, brethren. Don't let another day go by without telling\nyour wife you love her, how fortunate you are to have her, how much you think of her. And\ndo what you can to make her believe it. Be the same with your children. \"There is beauty all\naround when there's love at home.\" Be courteous. Be considerate. Be kind. I don't know of\nanything that is more important, and I think I am agreeing with the Lord when he says the\nsame thing, \"And the second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35500\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35500)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35500)\">Matt. 22:39<\/a><\/span>), and\nsurely the most important neighbor is the one who lives with you in your home.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Commandment-keeping, Evidence of Love<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow, if we love the Lord God with all our hearts and with all our souls and with all our\nminds, as he said we will keep his commandments. And we who hold the priesthood of God\nhave a covenant from the Lord which we read in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 84,\nverses 33 to 40: \n<\/p><p>\n<b>Covenant of the Priesthood<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and\nthe magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit,\" as Brother Hanks said, \"unto the\nrenewing of their bodies.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhat an example we have before us tonight. \"They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron\nand the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord; \n<\/p><p>\n\"For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me; \n<\/p><p>\n\"And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father; \n<\/p><p>\n\"And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father\nhath shall be given unto him.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI hope every stake president in this Church, when he interviews a young man who is to be\nadvanced in the priesthood and ordained an elder, reads this covenant and explains it to him:\n\"And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore, all those who receive the priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father,\nwhich he cannot break, neither can it be moved\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14622\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14622)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14622)\">D&amp;C 84:33-40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWho cannot break? The Lord cannot break. That is the only thing I know the Lord cannot do,\nis break a covenant that he has made with his people; and when he says, \"All that I have is\nthine\" (see (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14625\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14625)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14625)\">D&amp;C 84:38<\/a><\/span>),\nI would like to know, my brethren, what more we could ask for; and\nall we need to do is to keep the commandments and magnify our priesthood. Accept\nresponsibility, brethren, and when you accept responsibility, carry out the responsibility that is\nplaced upon you.\n<\/p><p>\nIt has been a great strength to my testimony, to my appreciation of what this Church means\nand the strength it has as I have interviewed men to be set apart to preside over missions and\nover stakes, and those who have been chosen to be bishops. Since being in this office and\ninterviewing men for any of these offices, I have never had an individual, regardless of his\ncondition, but who has said, \"If this is a call, I will go when you want me to go, where you\nwant me to go, and remain as long as you want me to stay.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren, what a testimony! I am sure all of us would do the same thing, but as Brother\nSill says, it isn't a big redwood tree that is going to trip us up; it's the underbrush in life. Any\nof us would accept the great call, but will we live every day, magnifying our priesthood and\ndoing what the Lord wants us to do?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>World's Greatest Brotherhood<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I want to give you this thought, brethren, that we who hold the priesthood of God are\nmembers of the greatest brotherhood in the world. We are expected to love one another and\nnot judge our brother. If anyone here tonight has ill feelings or aught against his brother, I\nurge, as the Savior has admonished, that we all forgive one another\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14602\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14602)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14602)\">D&amp;C 64:9<\/a><\/span>) and show our love for\nhim. No matter who you are, ill feelings or a desire to hinder or hurt your brother will canker\nyour soul, keep you from enjoying the Spirit of the Lord as you could if you would love and\nforgive. Under no conditions should anyone holding the priesthood wish to harm or hurt his\nbrother. We must keep that in mind.\n<\/p><p>\nComing back to this thought that I expressed, if we love the Lord, we will keep his\ncommandments (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28204\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28204)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28204)\">John 14:15<\/a><\/span>),\nwe will accept calls that come to us and magnify the priesthood and carry\nout the responsibility.\n<\/p><p>\nNow in closing I should like to read a letter that I received from a young doctor. This is\ndated January 26, 1965: \n<\/p><p>\n\"It has been a little over a year since you set me apart to my calling on the priesthood\ncommittee. I have been so thrilled with the experiences of the past year and the tremendous\nblessings that this calling has brought into my life and that of my family, as well as my\nassociates at the clinic, that I thought I would like to write you concerning two or three of\nthese items.\n<\/p><p>\n\"In your blessing to me, the promise was made that my practice would not suffer during my\nabsences from it. During the past year, my calling took me away from the practice 84 days.\nAn additional six days were spent attending the April and October conferences, all of which\nmade a total of 90 days absence.\"\n<\/p><p>\nListen, brethren: \"As I mentioned to you before, my colleagues are very willing to support me\nor any of us in church responsibilities and were pleased to vicariously share the experiences\nand blessings I enjoyed. During our business meeting earlier this month, at which time we\nmade an accounting of our past year's production, we were all surprisingly shocked to see\nthat in spite of my absences, my gross production was the highest of all the partners. During\nlast year, my admissions to the hospital also outnumbered each of the other partners, and for\nthat matter, all of the doctors in the community. During the year 1964, I had no deaths in my\npractice. Certainly the windows of heaven (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32788\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32788)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32788)\">Mal. 3:10<\/a><\/span>)\nhave been opened unto me and unto my associates\nin that we have never prospered better as a family or as a clinic than we have during the past\nyear! It is a testimony to all of us of how the Lord blesses us for living the law of\nconsecration in even a small way.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Again, I am thrilled with this calling and the opportunity to serve the Lord and you brethren\nand appreciate very much this privilege.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, may we realize what a great privilege it is for us to hold the priesthood of God,\nwhich is the power of God to act in his name, and may we magnify our calling, that it may\nbe possible for us to enjoy immortality and eternal life, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
