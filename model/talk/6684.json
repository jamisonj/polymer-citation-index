So many athletes with years of preparation came together to compete, hoping to win. As young women in the Church, you too are preparing and competing for a medallion as the Spirit burns brightly within you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/strengthen-home-and-family.p6\" class=\"\">The Young Women program can provide a wonderful training ground to help each of you reach your goals, and the Young Women theme is a constant reminder that we are not alone in the competition.

One of the most meaningful gifts is your ability to \u201cstrengthen [your] home and family,\u201d a new phrase which has been added to the Young Women theme. Do you recognize these words? One of the assignments given us as girls and women in the kingdom is to love and strengthen our families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/strengthen-home-and-family.p8\" class=\"\">Tonight it is my prayer that the Spirit will burn within you, that you will have a greater desire to strengthen your family now and prepare for your future family. The scriptures are filled with ways to teach us how to strengthen our families. There is no greater teacher than the Savior. As you study His teachings and follow His example, you can make your family life better. Let\u2019s talk about three principles that will help you strengthen your home and family:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<ul class=\"bullet\"><li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Nurturing<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sacrifice<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Prayer<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ul><div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Nurturing<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/strengthen-home-and-family.p13\" class=\"\">Who doesn\u2019t enjoy playing with a small child or holding a newborn baby in their arms? As women, we were born with a natural ability to love and nurture others. To nurture means to support each other, to encourage each other, to nourish and love each other. Are we doing this in our families?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/strengthen-home-and-family.p14\" class=\"\">The Savior Himself taught us to nurture. Many times He said, \u201cHow oft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have nourished you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5397\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5397)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5397)\">3 Ne. 10:4<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/strengthen-home-and-family.p15\" class=\"\">As you gather together in your family, you can do so much to invite a spirit of unity. When was the last time you put your arms around your mom or dad and thanked them for all they do? Parents do most of the nurturing, but they need to be nurtured too.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/strengthen-home-and-family.p16\" class=\"\">As women, we can gather our little chickens under our wings with love and tenderness. Recently I watched a young mother talk to her two-year-old child. When she was crying and the mother couldn\u2019t understand what she wanted, the mother said, \u201cDon\u2019t cry. Use your words. Tell me what\u2019s bothering you.\u201d She had shown such respect for this two-year-old baby that the baby stopped crying and \u201cused her words.\u201d This young mother is learning how to nurture.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/strengthen-home-and-family.p17\" class=\"\">When our Father in Heaven introduced the Savior to the world, He demonstrated good nurturing by using a soft voice. The language of the scripture says, \u201cThey heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; \u2026 and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; \u2026 notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5398\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5398)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5398)\">3 Ne. 11:3<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/strengthen-home-and-family.p18\" class=\"\">In our homes, this can be a model for the way we talk to our family members. Let us not use a loud voice but a soft voice when we talk to those we love. This is the way Heavenly Father speaks to His children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Sacrifice<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"preamble\">The second principle is sacrifice. As young women, you are learning to sacrifice every day. We are so impressed with all the good things you are doing:<\/p>\n      <ul class=\"bullet\"><li>\n\t  <span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>You tend after school when your mothers need to work.

He knows what you\u2019re going through. He understands how hard it is for you to make sacrifices. The Savior taught us to sacrifice. He sacrificed His life for all mankind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/strengthen-home-and-family.p25\" class=\"\">After He was resurrected, the first thing He taught the Nephites was how He had sacrificed. He said: \u201cI have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me. \u2026 I have suffered the will of the Father in all things\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5399\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5399)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5399)\">3 Ne. 11:11<\/a><\/span>). He had done what Heavenly Father wanted Him to do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/strengthen-home-and-family.p26\" class=\"\">Heavenly Father wants us to create a righteous family. Becoming a wife and mother may limit your career opportunities, but it can be so rewarding. As a young mother, I remember playing a song for my little girls while they danced around the room.

During much of that time, He focused on prayer. Did you know that in chapters 17 through 20 of Third Nephi, prayer is mentioned about 44 times? Many times He commanded the people to pray. He knelt on the ground and prayed for them. He taught them how to pray. He blessed the little children and prayed unto the Father for them. He commanded them to always pray in their hearts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/strengthen-home-and-family.p41\" class=\"\">Perhaps during a Mutual activity you could bring your scriptures, read those four chapters aloud, and underline when the word <span class=\"emphasis\">prayer<\/span> is mentioned\u2014sharing stories and testimonies on the power of prayer. I promise that you will feel the Spirit of the Lord and develop a stronger testimony of prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/strengthen-home-and-family.p42\" class=\"\">Our prophets have said that they don\u2019t worry about the youth who pray twice a day. Now, if they don\u2019t worry about us, then we don\u2019t need to worry about ourselves, as long as we sincerely pray twice a day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/strengthen-home-and-family.p43\" class=\"\">Listen to a wonderful story by the mother of the Prophet Joseph Smith about the night he went to get the gold plates. She writes: \u201c[That night] I sat up very late. \u2026 About twelve o\u2019clock Joseph came to me and asked me if I had a chest with a lock and key. \u2026 And not having one I was greatly alarmed. \u2026 But Joseph \u2026 said, \u2018Never mind, I can do very well \u2026 without it\u2014be calm\u2014all is right.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/strengthen-home-and-family.p44\" class=\"\">Shortly after, Joseph and Emma left, taking a horse and wagon. Now listen to what his mother says: \u201cI spent the night in prayer and supplication to God, for the anxiety of my mind would not permit me to sleep.\u201d The pleadings of a mother, a righteous daughter of God, comforted the Prophet and protected the gold plates. Over the years, her constant prayers helped strengthen her home and family (see Lucy Mack Smith, <span class=\"emphasis\">History of Joseph Smith, <\/span>ed. Preston Nibley [1979], 102).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"preamble\">How can you use prayer to strengthen your family? Because Heavenly Father loves you so, He wants you to talk to Him.
