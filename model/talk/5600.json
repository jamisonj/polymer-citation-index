Upon the shoulders of the Twelve must the responsibility of leading this church henceforth rest until you shall appoint others to succeed you\u201d (Draft Declaration of the Twelve Apostles, reporting March 1844 meeting of Twelve, Brigham Young Papers, LDS Church Archives).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/the-shield-of-faith.p10\" class=\"\">Individually and collectively the Twelve hold the keys and have confirmed the authority to exercise all of the keys upon the senior Apostle, the one man who is to preside over the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/the-shield-of-faith.p11\" class=\"\">The Lord has provided a system in which there is no aspiring, no maneuvering for position or power, not even a hint of soliciting for votes or cultivating influence.
