They need to see us cheerfully and willingly giving of our time and talents to the building of the Lord\u2019s kingdom here on earth.

It stated that when a mother or a father consistently reads to a child, the child enters school at a much higher level and excels in reading during these early grades. If there is a direct correlation between the early training a child receives from parents and the rapidity with which a child learns, how important would it be, then, for us to spend time reading the gospel of Jesus Christ to our children, to imbue and instill in them, in their tender and early years, faith in the gospel of our Lord and Savior?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/train-up-a-child.p29\" class=\"\">The second principle President McKay outlined for us is <span class=\"emphasis\">obedience.<\/span> President Joseph Fielding Smith has said: \u201cOf course there should be prayer and faith and love and obedience to God in the home. It is the duty of parents to teach their children these saving principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, so that they will know why they are to be baptized and that they may be impressed in their hearts with a desire to continue to keep the commandments of God after they are baptized, that they may come back into his presence. Do you, my good brethren and sisters, want your families, your children; do you want to be sealed to your fathers and your mothers before you? \u2026 If so, then you must begin by teaching at the cradle-side. You are to teach by example as well as precept.\u201d (in Conference Report, Oct. 1948, p. 153.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/train-up-a-child.p30\" class=\"\">I remember being impressed one time with the need to teach obedience. I was on a new job working long hours, and I guess I was somewhat neglectful of my family. My son seemed to crave more time and attention. He was finding all sorts of ways to attract my attention. One day when I came home, his mother had him prepared to take me downstairs to see what mischief he had recently created. As we descended the stairs, he sheepishly opened the door to our food storage room. There I found he had been using his dart set to practice his marksmanship on our food storage. He caught my attention all right, and made me realize he was looking for the metes and bounds we expected of him in our family government. When they were outlined, and when I gave him the proper attention, then he was very obedient. How important it is that we teach obedience early in the lives of our children, especially to the commandments of the Lord!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/train-up-a-child.p31\" class=\"\">Finally, President McKay taught us the necessity of <span class=\"emphasis\">love.<\/span> I\u2019ve always been impressed with the fact that when the Lord was teaching His disciples in those final hours of His earthly ministry as they met in the Last Supper, after teaching service by the washing of their feet, His next instructions concerned love.

It stated \u201cthat the climate of our times tends to support the idea that love is a seasonal monsoon: it comes, it blows fiercely; it goes by. That is too bad, because a child needs the kind of love that is as trustworthy as the rising of the sun. If a child is to grow up to truly join the human race, he needs to know how to keep love alive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/train-up-a-child.p34\" class=\"\">\u201cA child should learn not merely to love, but to be a loving person\u2014to make love his stance in the world. \u2018Love\u2019 may come and go, but a loving person, like the sun itself, never loses his or her sustaining warmth.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Reader\u2019s Digest,<\/span> June 1981, p. 164.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/train-up-a-child.p35\" class=\"\">Sometime ago I remember reading about an experiment with chickens. I do not remember the source. Young pullets, as they grew in their life cycle, were given all of the food they needed to eat, without being required to make an effort to obtain it. Then as the pullets matured, they were turned out into the chicken coop, where they had to scratch for their food. A chicken who had never been taught how to scratch as a pullet would mature without learning this ability and would literally starve to death, even though just below the surface of the ground was all the food it needed to sustain life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/train-up-a-child.p36\" class=\"\">Then the article went on to compare this example with a child who was not taught the ability to love early in its life.
