We have an assurance that the cause is just and worthy. But, above all, we have a knowledge that God lives and is in his heavens and that his Son Jesus Christ has laid out a plan for us which will bring us and our loved ones eternal life if we are faithful. That life will be a busy, purposeful life with accomplishments and joys and development.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/the-cause-is-just-and-worthy.p6\" class=\"\">If you can think of the greatest real joys that have ever come to you in this life, then think of the next life as a projection of this one with all the purposeful things multiplied, enlarged, and even more desirable. All in these associations of our lives here have brought to you development and joy and growth and happiness. Now when life ends, we shall return to a situation patterned after our life here, only less limited, more glorious, more increased joys.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/the-cause-is-just-and-worthy.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cAnyone can build an altar,\u201d said John Henry Jowett; \u201cit requires a God to produce the flame. <span class=\"emphasis\">Anyone can build a house; we need the Lord [and parents] for the creation of a home.<\/span>\u201d (John Henry Jowett, \u201cGod in the Home,\u201d in <span class=\"emphasis\">A Treasury of Inspiration,<\/span> Ralph L.

The Lord has given me dreams which to me are just as real and as much from God as was the dream of King Nebuchadnezzar, which was the means of saving a nation from starvation, or the dream of Lehi who through a dream led his colony out of the old country across the mighty deep to this promised land, or any other dreams that we might read in the scriptures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/the-cause-is-just-and-worthy.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cIt is not out of place for us to have important dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then more than 40 years ago I had a dream which I am sure was from the Lord. In this dream I was in the presence of my Savior as he stood mid-air. He spoke no word to me, but my love for him was such that I have not words to explain. I know that no mortal man can love the Lord as I experienced that love for the Savior unless God reveals it to him. I would have remained in his presence, but there was a power drawing me away from him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/the-cause-is-just-and-worthy.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cAs a result of that dream, I had this feeling that no matter what might be required of my hands, what the gospel might entail unto me, I would do what I should be asked to do even to the laying down of my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/the-cause-is-just-and-worthy.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd so when we read in the scriptures what the Savior said to his disciples, \u2018In my Father\u2019s house are many mansions: \u2026 I go to prepare a place for you \u2026 that where I am, there ye may be also.\u2019 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28797\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28797)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28797)\">John 14:2\u20133<\/a><\/span>.)
