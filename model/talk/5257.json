The prayers have been sincere and from the heart, the music and singing have lifted us heavenward and given us an upward reach we thought perhaps was beyond our grasp.

His ready smile, the wave of his hand, the declarations of truth that have marked his influence have been missed. However, President Benson, we are pleased and grateful that you have been a part of the conference through television. Our hearts go out to you in the passing of your beloved eternal companion, Flora. How thankful we are for the sacred covenant that binds you two sweethearts together for all eternity! The entire Church joins in a mighty prayer to our Heavenly Father that you may be cradled in the palm of His hand and blessed according to your need and His divine purposes. We sustain you. We follow you. We love you\u2014our Prophet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/at-parting.p6\" class=\"\">President Benson revered President David O.
