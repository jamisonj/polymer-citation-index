President Hugh\u00a0B. Brown, formerly a member of the Twelve and a counselor in the First Presidency, provided a personal experience. He told of purchasing a rundown farm in Canada many years ago. As he went about cleaning up and repairing his property, he came across a currant bush that had grown over six feet (1.8 m) high and was yielding no berries, so he pruned it back drastically, leaving only small stumps. Then he saw a drop like a tear on the top of each of these little stumps, as if the currant bush were crying, and thought he heard it say:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/as-many-as-i-love-i-rebuke-and-chasten.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cHow could you do this to me?

The commanding general said in essence, \u201cYou deserve the appointment, but I cannot give it to you.\u201d What President Brown had spent 10 years hoping, praying, and preparing for slipped through his fingers in that moment because of blatant discrimination.

If we are open to it, needed correction will come in many forms and from many sources. It may come in the course of our prayers as God speaks to our mind and heart through the Holy Ghost (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122176\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122176)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122176)\">D&amp;C 8:2<\/a><\/span>). It may come in the form of prayers that are answered no or differently than we had expected.

Apostles, prophets, patriarchs, bishops, and others have been put into the Church today, just as anciently, \u201cfor the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122177\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122177)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122177)\">Ephesians 4:12<\/a><\/span>). Perhaps some of the things said in this conference have come to you as a call to repentance or change, which if heeded will lift you to a higher place. We can help one another as fellow Church members; it is one of the primary reasons that the Savior established a church. Even when we encounter mean-spirited criticism from persons who have little regard or love for us, it can be helpful to exercise enough meekness to weigh it and sift out anything that might benefit us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/as-many-as-i-love-i-rebuke-and-chasten.p26\" class=\"\">Correction, hopefully gentle, can come from one\u2019s spouse. Elder Richard\u00a0G. Scott, who just addressed us, remembers a time early in his marriage when his wife, Jeanene, counseled him to look directly at people when he spoke to them. \u201cYou look at the floor, the ceiling, the window, anywhere but in their eyes,\u201d she said. He took that gentle rebuke to heart, and it made him much more effective in counseling and working with people. As one who served as a full-time missionary under then-President Scott\u2019s direction, I can attest that he does look one squarely in the eye in his conversations. I can also add that when one needs correction, that look can be very penetrating.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/as-many-as-i-love-i-rebuke-and-chasten.p27\" class=\"\">Parents can and must correct, even chasten, if their children are not to be cast adrift at the mercy of a merciless adversary and his supporters. President Boyd\u00a0K. Packer has observed that when a person in a position to correct another fails to do so, he is thinking of himself. Remember that reproof should be timely, with sharpness or clarity, \u201cwhen moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122178\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122178)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122178)\">D&amp;C 121:43<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/as-many-as-i-love-i-rebuke-and-chasten.p28\" class=\"\">Remember that if we resist correction, others may discontinue offering it altogether, despite their love for us.
