He told us of his experience in working to rehabilitate men in the state penitentiary. A mother had asked him to reach out to her boy who was in prison.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/coming-through-the-mists.p19\" class=\"\">In approaching the young man, Brother Smith was rudely rebuffed: \u201cLeave me alone,\u201d was the tone. However, Brother Smith noticed a rather crude painting in the prison one day and on inquiry learned that this young man had drawn it. This inspired a new approach:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/coming-through-the-mists.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cDid you paint that picture?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/coming-through-the-mists.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cYes, I did it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/coming-through-the-mists.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cI was impressed with it.

Brother Smith brought it with him to our sacrament meeting, and so I have seen it. It is, of course, the picture of Lehi\u2019s dream.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/coming-through-the-mists.p34\" class=\"\">Now, will you try to see the picture in your own imagination? All you who have read 1 Nephi, chapter 8, will recall the scene. If you have not read it, I wish you would do so and get the feeling and the vision of this picture.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/coming-through-the-mists.p35\" class=\"\">The description is as follows: First, Lehi wandering through a dreary waste, then coming to a spacious field; the tree with the most desirable fruit to be happy, the love of God; Lehi\u2019s desire to share the fruit with his family; the rebellion of two of his sons; the pressing forward of many people to receive the fruit; the mists of darkness, which arose to obscure the path; the river of water along the path, which could mean destruction; the rod of iron, which represented security in staying on the path; the huge building across the river filled with scoffing people; the susceptibility of those who had followed the path to succumb to the scorn and pride of those of the world; and the wandering away of those who had partaken of the fruit of the tree of life into forbidden paths of destruction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/coming-through-the-mists.p36\" class=\"\">I know of no more graphic description of the condition of those who call themselves Latter-day Saints in relation to the influences of the world than this great vision. This story is reality. It is a great prophesy. It is a vivid warning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/coming-through-the-mists.p37\" class=\"\">Let me complete the story of the young man in prison. Brother Smith pointed to an angel the young man had painted hovering over the chasm of filthy water and asked him: \u201cWhere did you get that angel? I don\u2019t remember any angel when I read about the picture.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/coming-through-the-mists.p38\" class=\"\">The young man replied: \u201cI know. I put it there. It is my angel. As I painted the picture, I began to realize that God had placed an influence in my way which could bring me to safety and redeem me from the course I have been pursuing.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/coming-through-the-mists.p39\" class=\"\">This experience, of course, was the beginning of his recovery.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/coming-through-the-mists.p40\" class=\"\">Yes, the voices and enticements of the world make good seem evil and evil, good. The false attractions to engage in immorality, to view that which is forbidden on your home video, to seek unbounded pleasure as if God did not exist, are, in reality, the yawning pit of hell, set there by the one who will try to bind you with his awful chains.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/coming-through-the-mists.p41\" class=\"\">I learned once upon a time to fly airplanes. The instructor was flying straight and level. On the horizon was a range of mountains. Then he did something like this [demonstration of snap roll and spin] and I saw the mountain rise up and stand on end. It turned upside down and then continued to its normal position. He put the plane into a spin, and as we were falling and gyrating, I looked below and saw the whole earth turning as if it were a huge wheel. The vision was vivid. It looked so real. I have performed these maneuvers many times since: the snap roll and the spin. If I were to do them today, I could no longer make the mountain turn over or the earth gyrate. Why? Because experience has taught me reality, and now I cannot be deceived.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/coming-through-the-mists.p42\" class=\"\">Reality for members of the Church is: \u201cJesus Christ is the Son of God.
