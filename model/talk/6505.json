It was a dreary, rainy day, which tended to underscore the pain and suffering which had occurred there. The memorial features a 400-foot reflecting pool. On one side of the pool are 168 empty glass and granite chairs in honor of each of the people killed. These are placed, as far as can be determined, where the fallen bodies were found.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/compassion.p8\" class=\"\">On the opposite side of the pool there stands, on a gentle rise of ground, a mature American elm tree\u2014the only nearby tree to survive the destruction.

Upon the arrival of a passing caravan of merchants, Joseph\u2019s brothers determined to sell Joseph rather than leaving him to die.
