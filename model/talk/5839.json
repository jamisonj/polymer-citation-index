Honesty is more than not lying. It is truth telling, truth speaking, truth living, and truth loving. John, a nine-year-old Swiss pioneer child who was in one of the handcart companies, is an example of honesty. His father put a chunk of buffalo meat in the handcart and said it was to be saved for Sunday dinner. John said, \u201cI was so very hungry and the meat smelled so good to me while pushing at the handcart that I could not resist. I had a little pocket knife. \u2026 Although I expected a severe whipping when father found it out, I cut off little pieces each day. I would chew them so long that they got white and perfectly tasteless. When father came to get the meat he asked me if I had been cutting off some of it. I said \u2018Yes. I was so hungry I could not let it alone.\u2019 Instead of giving me a scolding or whipping, father turned away and wiped tears from his eyes.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-96911_000_018\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[In LeRoy R.

My husband had worked hard on his studies and went to attend his first examination. The honor system was expected behavior at the medical school. The professor passed out the examination and left the room. Within a short time, students started to pull little cheat papers out from under their papers or from their pockets. My husband recalled his heart beginning to pound as he realized it is pretty hard to compete against cheaters. About that time a tall, lanky student stood up in the back of the room and stated: \u2018I left my hometown and put my wife and three little babies in an upstairs apartment and worked very hard to get into medical school. And I\u2019ll turn in the first one of you who cheats, and <span class=\"emphasis\">you better believe it!\u2019<\/span> They believed it.

One cold night at Chanute Field, Illinois, I was given all-night guard duty. As I walked around my post, I meditated and pondered the whole miserable, long night through. By morning I had come to some firm conclusions. I was engaged to be married and knew that I could not support my wife on a private\u2019s pay. In a day or two, I filed my application for Officer\u2019s Candidate School. Shortly thereafter, I was summoned before the board of inquiry. My qualifications were few, but I had had two years of college and had finished a mission for the Church in South America.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/honesty-a-moral-compass.p14\" class=\"\">The questions asked of me at the officers\u2019 board of inquiry took a very surprising turn.

He did not look like he prayed very often. I pondered. Would I give him offense if I answered how I truly believed? I wanted to be an officer very much so that I would not have to do all-night guard duty and KP and clean latrines, but mostly so my sweetheart and I could afford to be married.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/honesty-a-moral-compass.p16\" class=\"\">I decided not to equivocate. I admitted that I did pray and that I felt that officers might seek divine guidance as some truly great generals had done.

I suspected that the men who were asking me this question did not live by the standards that I had been taught. The thought flashed through my mind that perhaps I could say that I had my own beliefs, but I did not wish to impose them on others. But there seemed to flash before my mind the faces of the many people to whom I had taught the law of chastity as a missionary. In the end I simply said, \u201cI do not believe there is a double standard of morality.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/honesty-a-moral-compass.p19\" class=\"\">I left the hearing resigned to the fact that these hard-bitten officers would not like the answers I had given to their questions and would surely score me very low.
