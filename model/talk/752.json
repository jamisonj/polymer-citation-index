As the animal upon which he\nrode had been designated in their literature as the \"ancient symbol of Jewish royalty\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43068\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43068)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43068)\">Zech. 9:9<\/a><\/span>)\nand their acquaintanceship with the might of His Messianic power impressed the\nappropriateness of his kingly right to such an entry, they cast their garments before him and\ncast palm branches and other foliage in His path as though carpeting the way of a king. What\nmight at first have been but the humble testimony of a faithful few, increased into a mighty\nchorus of voices as the multitude shouted in harmony: \n<\/p><p>\nBlessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosanna, to the Son of David\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34718\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34718)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34718)\">Matt. 21:9<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33091\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33091)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33091)\">Mark 11:9-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then perhaps as they remembered the angels' announcement to the shepherds on the night\nof His birth, they reverently repeated the theme of the angles' song: \"Peace in heaven, and\nglory in the highest\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31415\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31415)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31415)\">Luke 19:38<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd again, probably remembering the charge he had give His disciples\nto carry on after he would be taken from them, and as a supplication for their Master and\nthose who would carry on after His ascension, as well as in the remembrance of the ancient\nprophets whom they revered, came the expressions of adulation from the multitude: \"Blessed\nis he that cometh in the name of the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34719\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34719)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34719)\">Matt. 21:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAt the commencement of His ministry, He seemingly had seldom, and then only guardedly,\ndeclared that He was the Christ who should take away the sins of the world, but now His\nearthly ministry was reaching a consummation and His fearful agony on the cross was near. It\nseemed altogether appropriate that He should now demonstrate His kingly place as the King\nof Kings and the Prince of Peace. Thus demonstrated, His devoted disciples could thereafter\nlikewise bear witness to the divinity of His mission as the Savior of man and the \"rock\" upon\nwhich His church was to be founded in the Meridian of Times.\n<\/p><p>\nThere was an <i>occasion<\/i> during His ministry when His chiefest Apostle, Peter, had fervently\ndeclared his faith and testimony of the divinity of the mission of the Master: \"Thou art the\nChrist, the Son of the Living God.\" The Lord had replied to Peter by declaring, \"flesh and\nblood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven\" and that upon \"this\nrock\" or in other words, the revealed testimony of the Holy Ghost, the revelation that Jesus is\nthe Christ&mdash;His Church is founded and \"the gates of hell shall not prevail against it\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34711\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34711)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34711)\">Matt. 16:16-18<\/a><\/span>). It was of\nthis same foundation upon which the Church was laid to which the Apostle Paul made\nreference when he wrote to the Ephesian Saints: \"Now therefore, ye are no more strangers and\nforeigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God; And are built upon\nthe foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21679\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21679)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21679)\">Eph. 2:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the few minutes allotted to me in this brief Church of the Air address, I would like to\nmake some explanation as to just \"how blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord,\"\nfrom that day even to the present time.\n<\/p><p>\nAt the commencement of His ministry, the Master chose twelve men whom he separated from\nthe rest by the name, Apostles. These were to be special witnesses of the sanctity of His life,\nand of His divine mission, and to be responsible for transmitting to the latest posterity, a\ngenuine account of His doctrines, and principles, and ordinances essential to the salvation of\nthe human soul. History records that these men, as judged by worldly standards, were\n\"illiterate, poor, and of mean extraction.\" It would seem that He avoided using in this\nministry, persons endowed with the advantages of fortune or birth or enriched with the\ntreasures of eloquence or learning, lest \"the fruits of their embassy, and the progress of the\ngospel should be attributed to human and natural causes.\" Mosheim.\n<\/p><p>\nTrue servants in the Kingdom of God, when properly authorized, received an endowment of\nholy power except for which their ministry would be as the \"tinkling of brass and the\nsounding of cymbals\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"263\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 263)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(263)\">1 Cor. 13:1<\/a><\/span>).\nThis heavenly endowment to His chosen Twelve, came as a result of\nthree sacred experiences. First, they were baptized of water, maybe by John the Baptist, or\npossibly as the only ones He did baptize, by the Master, himself, for John records that He and\nHis disciples were in Judea \"and there He tarried with them, and baptized\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27635\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27635)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27635)\">John 3:22<\/a><\/span>). Then He \"breathed on them and\nsaid unto them, receive ye the Holy Ghost\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27667\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27667)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27667)\">John 20:22<\/a><\/span>),\nwhich in all likelihood was the\nconfirmation and the commission to receive the Holy Ghost, or the baptism of the Spirit, by\nthe laying on of hands for that was the procedure followed thereafter by His disciples.\n<\/p><p>\nThe meaning of this baptism of water and of the Holy Ghost by one who comes in the name\nof the Lord, is best understood by the words of a prophet on the Western Continent.\nAddressing a group of baptized converts he said this: \"There is no other name given whereby\nsalvation cometh; therefore I would that you should take upon you the name of Christ, all of\nyou that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should, be obedient unto the end of\nyour lives (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40269\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40269)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40269)\">Mosiah 5:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe third of the remarkable spiritual experiences to which the disciples were privileged is thus\ndescribed by the Master, himself: \"Ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained\nyou&mdash;that whatsoever ye should ask the Father in my name He may give it you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27653\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27653)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27653)\">John 15:16<\/a><\/span>).\nTry to imagine if you can, be \"called\" by the Master and \"ordained\" under His hands. That\nthese ordinations resulted in an endowment of power from on high as well as giving authority\nto act officially as the Lord's representatives, is well attested by the miraculous events that\nfollowed, which made of them, \"men different\" because of that divine commission.\n<\/p><p>\nNot alone were these special apostolic witnesses to receive and enjoy these heavenly gifts.\nThey were commissioned to transmit them by ordinations to others who had received the\nwitness of the divine mission of the risen Lord. Acting by authority of their priestly office, it\nwas as though the Lord were saying as He did through a prophet in recent times: \"And I will\nlay my hand upon you by the hand of my servant . . . and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13365\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13365)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13365)\">D&amp;C 36:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe historians have given us a summary and a thrilling description of how men so chosen and\nso ordained <i>were<\/i> blessed with heavenly gifts because they \"came in the name of the Lord.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAfter the departure of Jesus from them, he gave them the first proof of that majesty and\npower by which he was exalted, by the radiant gift of the Holy Ghost upon them on the day\nof Pentecost according to His promise . . . Dr. Mosheim in his Ecclesiastical history writes\nthat \"no sooner had the apostles received this special gift, this celestial guide, than their\nignorance was turned into light, their doubts into certainty, their fears into firm and invincible\nfortitude, and their former backwardness into an ardent and inextinguishable zeal.\"  The\ngrowth of the Church among the Gentile nations during this period was most phenomenal.\nHow was it possible that a handful of apostles, who as fishermen and publicans could engage\nthe learned and the mighty as well as the simple and those of low degree to forsake their\nreligion and embrace a new religion? There can be but one answer to that question. There\nwere undoubted marks of a celestial power, perpetually attending their ministry. There was in\ntheir very language an \"incredible energy or amazing power of sending light into the\nunderstanding and conviction of the heart.\" (Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History, Vol. 1 pp.\n56-58)  Then the historians enumerate the miracles, the gift of prophecy, the power of\ndiscernment, a contempt for riches, and a serene tranquility in the face of death, all the while\nmaintaining their lives above reproach, and then conclude with this declaration: \"Thus were\nthe messengers of the divine Savior, the heralds of his spiritual and immortal kingdom,\nfurnished for their glorious work as the voice of ancient history so loudly\ntestifies.\" (Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History, Vol. 1 pp. 56-58.)\n<\/p><p>\nAs we review again the matchless and unselfish devotion of these early prophets and martyrs\nto the gospel of Christ, may we bow in reverence and repeat with a greater appreciation and\ncomprehension as with the multitude in Jerusalem on the occasion of the triumphal entry the\nwords: \"How blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34720\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34720)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34720)\">Matt. 21:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe place of these heaven-endowed messengers who represent the Lord in every dispensation\nof the gospel upon the earth may be illustrated by an incident related by a traveler in northern\nEurope. Our traveler was leaving by boat from Stockholm, Sweden out into the Baltic Sea. To\ndo so, the boat had to pass through a thousand or more islands. Standing on the forward deck,\nthe traveler found himself becoming impatient because of what seemed to him to be a careless\ncourse. Why not a course near to this island or another and more interesting than the one the\npilot had chosen? Almost in exasperation he was saying to himself, \"What's wrong with the\nold pilot?  Has he lost his sense of direction? Suddenly he was aware of markers along the\ncharted course which appeared as mere broom handles sticking up in the water. Someone had\ncarefully explored these channels and had charted the safest course for ships to take. So it is\nin life's course on the way to immortality and eternal life: \"God's engineers\" by following a\nblueprint made in heaven, have charted the course for safest and happiest passage and have\nforewarned us of the danger areas.\n<\/p><p>\nHow dreary and frustrated is the human soul who not only does not come \"in the name of the\nLord,\" but who disregards the guideposts marked out by \"God's engineers\" of the above\nillustration! Of this the Apostle to the Gentiles wrote: \"If in this life only we have hope in\nChrist, we are of all men most miserable\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"265\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 265)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(265)\">1 Cor. 15:19<\/a><\/span>).\nThat misery certainly can only be\nmatched in him who in this life, has no faith or hope in Christ. Without such faith, man is, as\nsomeone has said, \"but a creature of circumstance.\" Truly, as the Master instructed his faithful\nPeter, His Church, the true religion in which He was the \"chief cornerstone\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21680\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21680)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21680)\">Eph. 2:20<\/a><\/span>) was to be built\nupon a \"rock\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34712\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34712)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34712)\">Matt. 16:18<\/a><\/span>),\nthe rock of revelation. All others are tossed about by storm on the waves of time.\n<\/p><p>\nBut what strength and fortitude comes to him who puts his trust in the Lord! I recently heard\na missionary for the Church tell of an incident which occurred in an atheist-dominated\ncountry. A young student with a fervent belief in God and in the mission of the Savior of the\nworld was ridiculed and abused by her teacher who scorned the idea of a God. As a\npunishment, the teacher required that she write twenty times, \"There is no God.\" The young\nstudent refused. In a rage the teacher demanded that she write her denial of God, fifty times\nand added, as a veiled threat, \"If you don't, something terrible will happen.\" That night\nmother and daughter fasted and prayed far into the night to that God whom they could not\nand dared not deny. When school time came the next morning, mother and daughter went to\nsee the teacher. The school convened and the teacher had not arrived. As they waited, the\nprincipal of the school came to inform them that the teacher had died suddenly in the night of\na heart attack. Something terrible had happened but not to this young girl who came without\nfear \"in the name of the Lord.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, which is commemorated on this Sunday was in\ntruth but a prelude to the greater day of triumph only a few days distant. Before His\ncrucifixion, He had spoken of His personal triumph over worldly things, when He said: \"In\n<i>me<\/i> ye might have peace. In the <i>world<\/i> ye have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have\novercome the world\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27657\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27657)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27657)\">John 16:33<\/a><\/span>).\nBut there was yet that <i>greater day<\/i> of <i>victory<\/i> when he\ntriumphed over death and opened the way to a universal resurrection. The Apostle Paul in\nexultation wrote to the Corinthians: \"Death is swallowed up in victory&mdash;O death where is thy\nsting? O grave where is thy victory? . . . Thanks be to God which giveth us the victory\nthrough our Lord Jesus Christ\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"269\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 269)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(269)\">1 Cor. 15:54-57<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nToday as did they in past dispensations, we declare \"The fundamental principles of our\nreligion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets concerning Jesus Christ, that He died,\nwas buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which\npertain to our religion are only appendages to it.\" (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 121.)\n<\/p><p>\nO that the inhabitants of an unrepentant world would humble themselves and with faith in the\nRedeemer of mankind join in the chorus of the multitude who welcomed the Master into the\nHoly City, \"Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord! Hosanna to the Son of\nDavid. Peace in heaven and glory in the highest. Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the\nLord\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34721\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34721)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34721)\">Matt. 21:9<\/a><\/span>).\nFor that I pray humbly in the name of the King of Kings, Jesus Christ, Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
