It is a time to soberly contemplate doctrines of the gospel and the purposes for the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/funerals-a-time-for-reverence.p23\" class=\"\">Except where burial is prohibited by law, we are counseled to bury our dead.

It helps console the bereaved and establishes a transition from mourning to the reality that we must move forward with life.

Music should be used at the beginning of the service prior to the opening prayer and possibly after the invocation also, as in our Sunday meetings. The closing portion of the funeral likewise should follow our customary pattern of having a final musical number immediately before the concluding prayer. Where feasible, a choir could very well be used on the musical program.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/funerals-a-time-for-reverence.p34\" class=\"\">\u201cWith respect to speaking, it should be kept in mind that funeral services provide an excellent opportunity for teaching the basic doctrines \u2026 in a positive manner. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/funerals-a-time-for-reverence.p35\" class=\"\">\u201cFollowing these suggestions will help to keep our services in line with our established pattern and will avoid practices now so commonly followed elsewhere.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Priesthood Bulletin,<\/span> Apr. 1972.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/funerals-a-time-for-reverence.p36\" class=\"\">Bishops always show tender regard for the family of the deceased, and insofar as their requests accord with established policy, they may willingly be met. On occasion a family member has suggested, sometimes even insisted, that some innovation be added to the funeral service as a special accommodation to the family. Within reason, of course, a bishop may honor such a request. However, there are limits to what may be done without disturbing the spirituality and causing it to be less than it might be. We should remember, too, that others attending the funeral may suppose that innovation is an accepted procedure and introduce it at other funerals. Then, unless we are careful, an innovation which was allowed as an accommodation to one family in one funeral may come to be regarded as expected in every funeral.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/funerals-a-time-for-reverence.p37\" class=\"\">Occasionally a mortician, out of a desire to be of help and not understanding the doctrines and procedures of the Church, will alter a funeral service. Bishops should remember that when funerals are held under priesthood auspices the service should conform to the instructions given by the Church. We should regard the bishop rather than the family or the mortician as the presiding authority in these matters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/funerals-a-time-for-reverence.p38\" class=\"\">In recent years, there has been a tendency to stray from the accepted pattern for funerals. Sometimes the casket is kept open during the funeral, and members are expected to file by at the close of the funeral. And, instead of the simple family prayer, talks, and even musical numbers, have been added at the closing of the casket or at the cemetery before the grave is dedicated. I do not refer to graveside services which may on occasion take the place of a formal funeral. I refer to those alterations of the approved simple agenda for funerals.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/funerals-a-time-for-reverence.p39\" class=\"\">When innovations are suggested by family members, morticians, or others, which are quite out of harmony with that agenda, the bishop should quietly persuade them to follow the established pattern.
