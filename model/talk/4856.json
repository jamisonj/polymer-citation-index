They said, \u2018Let there be heat and cold,\u2019 and it was so. They said, \u2018Let there be spring and summer, autumn and winter,\u2019 and it was so.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p6\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018Who will redeem the earth, who will go forth and make the sacrifice for the earth and all things it contains?\u2019 The Eldest Son said: \u2018Here am I\u2019: and then he added, \u2018Send me.\u2019 But the second one, which was \u2018Lucifer, [a] Son of the Morning,\u2019 said, \u2018Lord, here am I, send me, I will redeem every son and daughter of Adam and Eve that lives on the earth, or that ever goes on the earth.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 says the Father, \u2018that will not answer at all. I give [unto] each and every individual his agency; all must use that in order to gain exaltation in my kingdom; inasmuch as they have the power of choice they must exercise that power. They are my children; the attributes which you see in me are in my children and they must use their agency. If you undertake to save all, you must save them in unrighteousness and corruption.\u2019\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> sel. John A.

We are witnessing today remarkable events occurring throughout the world: evidence of the strength of man\u2019s desire for freedom. The history of man\u2019s mortal experience would indicate that the desire to be free has spiritual roots.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p8\" class=\"\">There is an innate, overwhelming, compelling desire to be free. This desire seems to be more precious than life itself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p9\" class=\"\">Another desire we carry from the preexistence is to know who we are and where we came from and what our opportunities are in this great eternal plan. Answers to these questions can really only be found in the gospel of our Lord and Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p10\" class=\"\">As we hear the cries for help from those who are just now trying to deal with their newly found freedom, trying to use it and understand it, we can turn to the scriptures and read how the Lord prepared another nation for their freedom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p11\" class=\"\">The scriptures record that Israel had lived in the land of Egypt for 430 years. For a time they had prospered under the leadership of Joseph. The account reads:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cNow there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cCome on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22978\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22978)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22978)\">Ex. 1:6\u201310<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p17\" class=\"\">Then the narrative continues to tell how the Israelites were placed in bondage and became slaves to the Egyptians. Moses was raised up, trained, and charged with the responsibility of freeing them from bondage and leading them to their own promised land. His task was difficult, for Israel had lived about two centuries in slavery; they had been taught many of the idolatrous practices prominent in the land in that day. It would have been impossible for Moses to lead his people without the direction of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p18\" class=\"\">As a way of rebuilding their faith and reminding them who was their true God, Moses was instructed to establish certain principles and practices with them to help them to return to the true doctrine. First, the Lord directed them to construct a tabernacle, which would be moved about with them from place to place as they journeyed towards their promised land. This was to be a house of worship, where their sacred observances could be held. It was to be used by those who were willing to abide by the Lord\u2019s law.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p19\" class=\"\">When the children of Israel were disobedient, the privilege of enjoying the blessings of having the tabernacle in their midst was removed from them. We read:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the Lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22985\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22985)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22985)\">Ex. 33:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p21\" class=\"\">When the children of Israel again found favor in the sight of the Lord, the tabernacle was moved with them from place to place as they went about their quest for the promised land. It led them by day and was their security by night.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p22\" class=\"\">Later, when they reached their homeland, King Solomon built a magnificent temple on Mount Zion in Jerusalem where they could continue to enjoy an official house of worship. Israel worshiped in Solomon\u2019s Temple for 350 years. But they failed to be faithful, and dissension caused conflict in the tribes. This so weakened Israel that when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, made war on them, he was able to defeat them and looted the temple and destroyed it. Israel lost not only their place of worship but for many, their homes, for Nebuchadnezzar carried them off to Babylonia as his captives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p23\" class=\"\">In addition to the tabernacle as a place of worship, the Lord gave to them His written law contained on tablets of stone. These commandments were written by the finger of the Lord. They were kept for guidance and direction. The Ten Commandments [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"22980\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22980)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22980)\">Ex. 20:3\u201317<\/a><\/span>] were the basis of Hebrew law. Four of them have to do with our attitude toward God; the remaining six with our attitude toward our fellowman. Reverence for God was a basis for the Ten Commandments. Here was a foundation on which to build a society of law and order.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p24\" class=\"\">The Lord had another way of reminding Israel of the blessings He had given them. He had them establish religious customs, that became a part of their everyday life to signify the ways through which they could express their faith in God. Israel refused to abandon these practices even after being taken into captivity. They conceived that God\u2019s domination was not limited by national or political boundaries, and they would not give up their faith even though they struggled in a strange land. Deprived of their temple, they still had their law and their religious customs to worship their God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p25\" class=\"\">Now, most of us will not be called to help nations organize newly found freedoms, but all of us can be involved by making certain the light of freedom burns brightly within our own souls. We can be certain that, by our actions, we are examples of how freedom should be enjoyed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p26\" class=\"\">Following the pattern that the Lord established for ancient Israel, He has commanded us to build houses of worship for the purpose of having a place where the gospel can be taught. After understanding is achieved, we can enter into covenants with Him to be obedient to His will and, in turn, receive His promised blessings as a result of our faithfulness. We have temples\u2014they now dot the maps of nations\u2014here the worthy can enter, worship, be taught, and make covenants to serve God and abide by His law.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p27\" class=\"\">From the very beginning of man\u2019s existence on earth, he has been taught that he must be obedient to law.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cThere is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated\u2014<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19349\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19349)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19349)\">D&amp;C 130:20\u201321<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p30\" class=\"\">Prophets through the ages have taught us to be obedient to the laws of the Lord, and these laws are the foundation of our existence here and will bring order out of chaos.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p31\" class=\"\">President Wilford Woodruff once taught us:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cThe God of heaven, who created this earth and placed his children upon it, gave unto them a law whereby they might be exalted and saved in a kingdom of glory.

Whatever law anyone keeps, he is preserved by that law, and he receives whatever reward that law guarantees unto him. It is the will of God that all his children should obey the highest law, that they may receive the highest glory that is ordained for all immortal beings. But God has given all his children an agency, to choose what law they will keep.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,<\/span> sel. G.

Weekly we should observe the Sabbath day by attending our meetings, especially sacrament meeting, and behave appropriate to the activities that are proper for the Lord\u2019s day. We should also gather our families together in weekly family home evenings. Perhaps it would also be appropriate to have a date with our wives each week, to remind us of the great blessing they are in our lives. Monthly we should fast and pay our tithes and offerings to the Lord. Semiannually, we should make listening to the messages delivered at general conferences a family tradition. We should organize, annually, family reunions to keep alive our great gospel heritage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p35\" class=\"\">Other traditions which should continually be part of our lives are receiving father\u2019s blessings, patriarchal blessings, missionary preparation, temple preparation, and regular temple attendance where possible, and being together as family units on those occasions when sacred ordinances are performed in behalf of a family member.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/family-traditions.p36\" class=\"\">If we will build righteous traditions in our families, the light of the gospel can grow ever brighter in the lives of our children from generation to generation.
