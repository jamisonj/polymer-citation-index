This is the dispensation of the fulness of times, a time when the keys of all former dispensations have been given to the prophets of the restoration; a time when God has spoken from the heavens, angels have appeared to man; a time when men and women have the Holy Ghost conferred upon them. Moroni has said that by the power of the Holy Ghost we may know the truth of all things. There is need for this great power in the earth today\u2014this steering power. It is our duty and responsibility to live worthy of the blessings that we enjoy. Where much is given, much is required. We are required to live exemplary lives, to keep the commandments of the Lord, and it is also our responsibility to carry the true gospel message to all mankind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/eternal-joy-is-eternal-growth.p5\" class=\"\">A prophet of the Book of Mormon said: \u201c\u2026 men are, that they might have joy.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3858\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3858)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3858)\">2 Ne. 2:25<\/a><\/span>.) Pleasure is not necessarily joy. Lehi was undoubtedly not speaking of temporary pleasure, but of eternal joy. In referring to man he was not limiting his existence to mortality. He was speaking of eternal man. Man can have joy in accomplishment, particularly eternal accomplishment. If he fails to live in such a way as to receive the blessing of eternal life in the kingdom of his Father, he will reap misery and disappointment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/eternal-joy-is-eternal-growth.p6\" class=\"\">The Lord showed unto Abraham the intelligences that were organized before the world was.

Likewise if I desire to purchase a home, an automobile, or whatever it may be. If I seek intellectual values, I must pay the price by study, research, by devoted effort and ofttimes sacrifice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/eternal-joy-is-eternal-growth.p14\" class=\"\">The same is true of spiritual values. One cannot expect to inherit eternal life if he is not willing to pay the price and to do the things required for such salvation and exaltation. We are told that \u201cthere is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated\u2014And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15824\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15824)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15824)\">D&amp;C 130:20\u201321<\/a><\/span>.)

Death before that time was a matter of serious concern. The grave seemingly had won a victory. There was indeed the sting of death. His offering made it possible for us to come forth from the grave, to break the bondage of the tomb. He bought us with a price, the price being his own blood. He has also set the price which we must pay in order to obtain salvation in his presence and that of our Heavenly Father, and that price is the keeping of his commandments. Those commandments are God\u2019s laws\u2014nature\u2019s laws too\u2014and the breaking of them brings penalties; observance brings the promised blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/eternal-joy-is-eternal-growth.p16\" class=\"\">The Lord has told us, \u201c\u2026 my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36080\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36080)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36080)\">Matt. 11:30<\/a><\/span>.) This does not mean that one can receive exaltation in the kingdom of our Heavenly Father at bargain prices. There are those who offer such bargains, but one gets merely what he pays for. If we are to attain eternal life in our Father\u2019s kingdom, it is not sufficient that we have mere passive belief in our Lord and Savior and his great redeeming sacrifice. Surely one cannot expect to receive the greatest blessings that the Father has in store for his faithful children by paying bargain prices.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/eternal-joy-is-eternal-growth.p17\" class=\"\">There are those who seem to take the attitude that inasmuch as they have been baptized by immersion and by one having proper authority, and have had hands laid upon their heads for the reception of the Holy Ghost, their salvation is assured. Others seem to think that if they have had the priesthood conferred upon them, there is nothing further required at their hands. Aren\u2019t we as badly mistaken when we fail to live the life of a Latter-day Saint, after we come into the Church, as are those who think that mere belief in the Lord is sufficient? Where much is given, much is required, and if after the light of Christ comes into our souls we allow that light to become dimmed, we are under greater condemnation than those who have not had the light.

Like Israel of old, we are a peculiar people. We are peculiar in the sense that we believe in constant revelation from God and that he is revealing to us his truth. The ultimate goal of life is to assist in the fulfillment of God\u2019s plan for his children, the salvation of human souls, and that, of course, pertains to our own souls also. It is our responsibility to bring a knowledge of these things to our Father\u2019s children wherever they may be, to bring to them a living knowledge of the truth.
