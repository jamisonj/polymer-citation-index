I pray for divine help, that I may be made equal to such an opportunity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p5\" class=\"\">A mere 20 years ago you had not yet commenced your journey through mortality. You were still in your heavenly home. There you were among those who loved you and were concerned for your eternal well-being. Eventually, earth life became essential to your progress. Farewells were no doubt spoken, and expressions of confidence given. You gained bodies and became mortal, cut off from the presence of your Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p6\" class=\"\">A joyous welcome, however, awaited you here on earth. Those first years were precious, special years. Satan had no power to tempt you, for you had not yet become accountable. You were innocent before God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p7\" class=\"\">Soon you entered that period some have labeled \u201cthe terrible teens.\u201d I prefer \u201cthe terrific teens.\u201d What a time of opportunity, a season of growth, a semester of development\u2014marked by the acquisition of knowledge and the quest for truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p8\" class=\"\">No one has described the teenage years as being easy. They are often years of insecurity, of feeling as though you just don\u2019t measure up, of trying to find your place with your peers, of trying to fit in. This is a time when you are becoming more independent\u2014and perhaps desire more freedom than your parents are willing to give you right now. They are also prime years when Satan will tempt you and will do his utmost to entice you from the path which will lead you back to that heavenly home from which you came and back to your loved ones there and back to your Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p9\" class=\"\">The world around you is not equipped to provide the help you need to make it through this often-treacherous journey. So many in our society today seem to have slipped from the moorings of safety and drifted from the harbor of peace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p10\" class=\"\">Permissiveness, immorality, pornography, drugs, the power of peer pressure\u2014all these and more\u2014cause many to be tossed about on a sea of sin and crushed on the jagged reefs of lost opportunities, forfeited blessings, and shattered dreams.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p11\" class=\"\">Is there a way to safety? Is there an escape from threatened destruction? The answer is a resounding <span class=\"emphasis\">yes<\/span>! I counsel you to look to the lighthouse of the Lord. I have said it before; I will say it again: there is no fog so dense, no night so dark, no gale so strong, no mariner so lost but what the lighthouse of the Lord can rescue. It beckons through the storms of life. It calls, <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cThis way to safety. This way to home.\u201d<\/span> It sends forth signals of light easily seen and never failing. If followed, those signals will guide you back to your heavenly home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p12\" class=\"\">I wish to talk with you tonight about three essential signals from the Lord\u2019s lighthouse which will help you to return to that Father who eagerly awaits your triumphant homecoming. Those three signals are <span class=\"emphasis\">believe, obey,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">endure.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p13\" class=\"\">First, I mention a signal which is basic and essential: <span class=\"emphasis\">believe.<\/span> Believe that you are a daughter of Heavenly Father, that He loves you, and that you are here for a glorious purpose\u2014to gain your eternal salvation. Believe that remaining strong and faithful to the truths of the gospel is of utmost importance. I testify that it is!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p14\" class=\"\">My young friends, believe in the words you say each week as you recite the Young Women theme. Think about the meaning of those words. There is truth there. Strive always to live the values which are set forth. Believe, as your theme states, that if you accept and act upon those values, you will be prepared to strengthen your home and your family, to make and keep sacred covenants, to receive the ordinances of the temple, and to eventually enjoy the blessings of exaltation. These are beautiful gospel truths, and by following them, you will be happier throughout your life here and hereafter than you will be if you disregard them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p15\" class=\"\">Most of you were taught the truths of the gospel from the time you were a toddler. You were taught by loving parents and caring teachers. The truths they imparted to you helped you gain a testimony; you believed what you were taught. Although that testimony can continue to be fed spiritually and to grow as you study, as you pray for guidance, and as you attend your Church meetings each week, it is up to you to keep that testimony alive. Satan will try with all his might to destroy it. Throughout your entire life you will need to nurture it. As with the flame of a brightly burning fire, your testimony\u2014if not continually fed\u2014will fade to glowing embers and then cool completely. You must not let this happen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p16\" class=\"\">Besides attending your Sunday meetings and your weeknight activities, when you have the chance to be involved in seminary, whether in the early morning or in released-time classes, take advantage of that opportunity. Many of you are attending seminary now. As with anything in life, much of what you take from your seminary experience depends on your attitude and your willingness to be taught. May your attitude be one of humility and a desire to learn. How grateful I am for the opportunity I had as a teenager to attend early-morning seminary, for it played a vital role in my development and the development of my testimony. Seminary can change lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p17\" class=\"\">Some years ago I was on a board of directors with a fine man who had been extremely successful in life. I was impressed with his integrity and his loyalty to the Church. I learned that he had gained a testimony and had joined the Church because of seminary. When he married, his wife had been a lifelong member of the Church. He belonged to no church. Through the years and despite her efforts, he showed no interest in attending church with his wife and children. And then he began driving two of his daughters to early-morning seminary. He would remain in the car while they had their class, and then he would drive them to school. One day it was raining, and one of his daughters said, \u201cCome in, Dad. You can sit in the hall.\u201d He accepted the invitation. The door to the classroom was open, and he began to listen. His heart was touched. For the rest of that school year, he attended seminary with his daughters, which led eventually to his membership and a lifetime of activity in the Church. Let seminary help build and strengthen your testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p18\" class=\"\">There will be times when you will face challenges which might jeopardize your testimony, or you may neglect it as you pursue other interests. I plead with you to keep it strong. It is your responsibility, and yours alone, to keep its flame burning brightly. Effort is required, but it is effort you will never, ever regret. I\u2019m reminded of the words of a song written by Julie de Azevedo Hanks.

You will be tempted, sometimes by individuals you had thought friends.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p30\" class=\"\">Some years ago I spoke to a Mia Maid adviser who told me of an experience she had with one of the young women in her class. This young woman had been tempted time and time again to leave the pathway of truth and follow the detour of sin. Through the constant persuasion of some of her friends at school, she had finally agreed to follow such a detour. The plan was set: she would tell her parents she was going to her activity night for Young Women. She planned, however, to be there only long enough for her girlfriends and their dates to pick her up. They would then attend a party where alcoholic beverages would be consumed and where the behavior would be in complete violation of what this young woman knew was right.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p31\" class=\"\">The teacher had prayed for inspiration in helping all her girls but especially this particular young woman, who seemed so uncertain about her commitment to the gospel. The teacher had received inspiration that night to abandon what she had previously planned and to speak to the girls about remaining morally clean. As she began sharing her thoughts and feelings, the young woman in question checked her watch often to make sure she didn\u2019t miss her rendezvous with her friends. However, as the discussion progressed, her heart was touched, her conscience awakened, and her determination renewed. When it came, she ignored the repeated sound of the automobile horn summoning her. She remained throughout the evening with her teacher and the other girls in the class. The temptation to detour from God\u2019s approved way had been averted. Satan had been frustrated. The young woman remained after the others had left in order to thank her teacher for the lesson and to let her know how it had helped her avoid what might have been a tragic outcome. A teacher\u2019s prayer had been answered.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p32\" class=\"\">I subsequently learned that because she had made her decision not to go with her friends that night\u2014some of the most popular girls and boys at school\u2014the young woman was shunned by them and for many months had no friends at school. They couldn\u2019t accept that she was unwilling to do the things they did. It was an extremely difficult and lonely period for her, but she remained steadfast and eventually gained friends who shared her standards. Now, several years later, she has a temple marriage and four beautiful children. How different her life could have been. Our decisions determine our destiny.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p33\" class=\"\">Precious young women, make every decision you contemplate pass this test: \u201cWhat does it do to me? What does it do for me?\u201d And let your code of conduct emphasize not \u201cWhat will others think?\u201d but rather \u201cWhat will I think of myself?\u201d Be influenced by that still, small voice. Remember that one with authority placed his hands on your head at the time of your confirmation and said, \u201cReceive the Holy Ghost.\u201d Open your hearts, even your very souls, to the sound of that special voice which testifies of truth. As the prophet Isaiah promised, \u201cThine ears shall hear a word \u2026 saying, This is the way, walk ye in it.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-10405_000_048\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"123223\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123223)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123223)\">Isaiah 30:21<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/believe-obey-and-endure.p34\" class=\"\">The tenor of our times is permissiveness.
