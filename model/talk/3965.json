And I begin with a parable; and then I have a test for you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p4\" class=\"\">Imagine that our bishop has appointed you and me to plan a picnic for all of the ward members. It is to be the finest social in the history of the ward, and we are to spare no expense.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p5\" class=\"\">We reserve a beautiful picnic ground in the country. We are to have it all to ourselves; no outsiders will interfere with us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p6\" class=\"\">The arrangements go very well, and when the day comes, the weather is perfect. All is beautifully ready. The tables are in one long row. We even have tablecloths and china. You have never seen such a feast. The Relief Society and Young Women have outdone themselves. The tables are laden with every kind of delicious food: cantaloupes, watermelon, corn on the cob, fried chicken, hamburgers, cakes, pies\u2014you get the picture?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p7\" class=\"\">We are seated, and the bishop calls upon the patriarch to bless the food. Every hungry youngster secretly hopes it will be a short prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p8\" class=\"\">Then, just at that moment there is an interruption. A noisy old car jerks into the picnic grounds and sputters to a stop close to us. We are upset. Didn\u2019t they see the \u201creserved\u201d signs?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p9\" class=\"\">A worried-looking man lifts the hood; a spout of steam comes out. One of our brethren, a mechanic, says, \u201cThat car isn\u2019t going anywhere until it is fixed.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p10\" class=\"\">Several children spill from the car. They are ragged and dirty and noisy. And then an anxious mother takes a box to that extra table nearby. It is mealtime. Their children are hungry. She puts a few leftovers on the table. Then she nervously moves them about, trying to make it look like a meal for her hungry brood. But there is not enough.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p11\" class=\"\">We wait impatiently for them to quiet down so that we can have the blessing and enjoy our feast.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p12\" class=\"\">Then one of their little girls spies our table. She pulls her runny-nosed little brother over to us and pushes her head between you and me. We cringe aside, because they are very dirty. Then the little girl says, \u201cUmmm, look at that. Ummm, ummm, I wonder what that tastes like.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p13\" class=\"\">Everyone is waiting. Why did they arrive just at that moment? Such an inconvenient time. Why must we interrupt what we are doing to bother with outsiders? Why couldn\u2019t they have stopped somewhere else? They are not clean! They are not like us. They just don\u2019t fit in.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p14\" class=\"\">Since the bishop has put us in charge, he expects us to handle these intruders. What should we do? Of course, this is only a parable. But now for the test. If it really happened, my young friends, what <span class=\"emphasis\">would<\/span> you do?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p15\" class=\"\">I will give you three choices.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p16\" class=\"\">First, you could insist the intruders keep their children quiet while we have the blessing. Thereafter we ignore them. After all, we reserved the place.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p17\" class=\"\">I doubt that you would do that. Could you choke down a feast before hungry children? Surely we are better than that! That is not the answer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p18\" class=\"\">The next choice. There is that extra table. And we do have too much of some things. We could take a little of this and a little of that and lure the little children back to their own table. Then we could enjoy our feast without interruption. After all, we earned what we have. Did we not \u201cobtain it by [our own] industry,\u201d as the Book of Mormon says?

There is a better answer. You already know what it is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p20\" class=\"\">We should go out to them and invite them to come and join us. You could slide that way, and I could slide this way, and the little girl could sit between us. They could all fit in somewhere to share our feast. Afterward, we will fix their car and provide something for their journey.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p21\" class=\"\">Could there be more pure enjoyment than seeing how much we could get those hungry children to eat? Could there be more satisfaction than to interrupt our festivities to help our mechanic fix their car?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p22\" class=\"\">Is that what you would do? Surely it is what you <span class=\"emphasis\">should<\/span> do.

Then Peter had a vision. He saw a vessel full of all kinds of creatures and was commanded to kill and to eat. But he refused, saying they were common and unclean. Then the voice said, \u201cWhat God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.\u201d (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"8284\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8284)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8284)\">Acts 10:9\u201316<\/a><\/span>.)

When I was of missionary age, when I was your age, young men could not be called to the mission field. It was World War II, and I spent four years in the military. But I did do missionary work; we did share the gospel. It was my privilege to baptize one of the first two Japanese to join the Church after the mission had been closed twenty-two years earlier. Brother Elliot Richards baptized Tatsui Sato. I baptized his wife, Chio. And the work in Japan was reopened. We baptized them in a swimming pool amid the rubble of a university that had been destroyed by bombs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p38\" class=\"\">Shortly thereafter I boarded a train in Osaka for Yokohama and a ship that would take me home. Brother and Sister Sato came to the station to say good-bye. Many tears were shed as we bade one another farewell.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p39\" class=\"\">It was a very chilly night. The railroad station, what there was left of it, was very cold. Starving children were sleeping in the corners. That was a common sight in Japan in those days. The fortunate ones had a newspaper or a few old rags to fend off the cold.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p40\" class=\"\">On that train, I slept restlessly. The berths were too short anyway. In the bleak, chilly hours of the dawn, the train stopped at a station along the way. I heard a tapping on the window and raised the blind. There on the platform stood a little boy tapping on the window with a tin can. I knew he was an orphan and a beggar; the tin can was the symbol of their suffering. Sometimes they carried a spoon as well, as if to say, \u201cI am hungry; feed me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p41\" class=\"\">He might have been six or seven years old. His little body was thin with starvation. He had on a thin, ragged shirt-like kimono, nothing else. His head was shingled with scabs. His one jaw was swollen\u2014perhaps from an abscessed tooth. Around his head he had tied a filthy rag with a knot on top of his head\u2014a pathetic gesture of treatment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p42\" class=\"\">When I saw him and he saw that I was awake, he waved his can. He was begging. In pity, I thought, \u201cHow can I help him?\u201d Then I remembered. I had money, Japanese money. I quickly groped for my clothing and found some yen notes in my pocket. I tried to open the window. But it was stuck. I slipped on my trousers and hurried to the end of the car. He stood outside expectantly. As I pushed at the resistant door, the train pulled away from the station. Through the dirty windows I could see him, holding that rusty tin can, with the dirty rag around his swollen jaw.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/feed-my-sheep.p43\" class=\"\">There I stood, an officer from a conquering army, heading home to a family and a future.
