Jerry\u2019s father was a Baptist minister; his mother, a Methodist minister. One day Jerry\u2019s close friend Pricilla shared with him the pain she felt from the death of her child during childbirth and a bitter divorce that occurred shortly thereafter. Struggling as a single mother, Pricilla has four children\u2014three daughters and a son. As she opened her heart to Jerry, she confessed that she was thinking of taking her own life. With all the strength and love Jerry could muster, he tried to help her understand that her life had value. He invited her to attend his church, but Pricilla explained that she had given up on God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/ask-the-missionaries-they-can-help-you.p19\" class=\"\">Jerry did not know what to do. Later, while watering trees in his yard, this man of faith prayed to God for guidance. As he prayed, he heard a voice in his mind saying, \u201cStop the boys on the bikes.\u201d Jerry, a little bewildered, wondered what this meant. As he reflected on this impression, he gazed up the street and saw two young men in white shirts and ties riding bicycles toward his home. Stunned by this \u201ccoincidence,\u201d he watched them ride by. Then, realizing that the situation required him to act, he shouted out, \u201cHey, you, please stop!
