I also wish to express to each of you my gratitude for\nyour kindness to us when we come out to your stake conferences. I do humbly ask our Father\nin heaven to guide what I say this afternoon.\n<\/p><p>\nTWO GREAT COMMANDMENTS\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Son of Man was upon the earth some two thousand years ago teaching the gospel, a\ncertain lawyer came to him and asked a question. He asked: \"Master, which is the greatest\ncommandment in the law?\" The Savior answered and said: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and\nwith all thy mind.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the first and great commandment.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\n<\/p><p>\nOn these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34365\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34365)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34365)\">Matt. 22:36-40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Son of Man on that occasion declared that the very foundation of all religious life, the\nvery foundation and the heart of the worship of God was love&mdash;a love for God and a love\nfor our fellow men. In fact, his whole message throughout his three years of ministry upon\nthis earth was centered in the great law of love.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE LAW AND THE PROPHETS\n<\/p><p>\nThe last part of Jesus' statement to the lawyer, \"upon these two commandments hang all the\nlaw and the prophets,\" can be explained as follows. In the days of the Savior, the Hebrew\nscripture was divided into three main divisions. The first division was called the \"Torah\" or\n\"Law.\" It was composed of the five books of Moses. The second division was called the\n\"Prophets.\" It consisted of the teachings of the major and minor prophets and some of the\nhistorical books. The third division was called the \"Writing.\" It was composed of the\nremainder of the Old Testament books as we have them today.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Law and the Prophets were very highly canonized, or, in other words, accepted as\nscripture or as the Word of God in the days of the Savior. The Writings were in the process\nof being canonized at that time. Therefore, when Jesus Christ said, ''On these two\ncommandments hang all the law and the prophets,\" he was saying, \"On these two\ncommandments hang all the teachings of the Holy Scriptures.\" In fact, in answer to the\nlawyer's question, \"Which is the greatest commandment in the law?\" Jesus\nquoted, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\" from Deuteronomy 6:5\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21212\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21212)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21212)\">Deut. 6:5<\/a><\/span>), and, \"thou shalt love\nthy neighbor as thyself,\" from Leviticus 19:18\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30885\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30885)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30885)\">Lev. 19:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nCOMMANDMENT OF LOVE\n<\/p><p>\nIn the very beginning, the Only Begotten Son of God gave the commandment of love to\nFather Adam and has repeatedly revealed throughout the generations that we should love God\nand that we should love our fellow men. In fact, this dispensation we are living in is the\nDispensation of the Fullness of Times, wherein all things are to be restored: therefore, the\nLord told the Prophet Joseph Smith:\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, I give unto them a commandment, saying thus: Thou shalt love the Lord\nthy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of\nJesus Christ thou shalt serve him.\n<\/p><p>\nThou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12795\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12795)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12795)\">D&amp;C 59:5-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI think that the modern revelation is even more beautifully stated than the one recorded in the\nNew Testament.\n<\/p><p>\nCRITERIA OF LOVE\n<\/p><p>\nHow do we know when we love God with all of our hearts? What criteria do we have by\nwhich we can judge? The Savior himself gave us the criteria. He said, \"If ye love me, keep\nmy commandments\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27451\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27451)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27451)\">John 14:15<\/a><\/span>).\nTherefore, only to the extent that we keep the\ncommandments that God has given us do we love the Eternal Father and his Only Begotten\nSon.\n<\/p><p>\nThe night before the Savior's crucifixion, he gave his great last known discourse and\ninstructions to his Apostles. Some of the most beautiful sentiments found in the New\nTestament were recorded by John in his report of what occurred on that occasion. I would\nlike to quote just a few lines from that wonderful discourse.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.\n<\/p><p>\nIf ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my\nFather's commandments, and abide in his love.\n<\/p><p>\nThese things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your\njoy might be full. [ . . . ] This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I\nhave loved you.\n<\/p><p>\nGreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\n<\/p><p>\nYe are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.\n<\/p><p>\nThese things I command you, that ye love one another\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27455\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27455)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27455)\">John 15:9-14,17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has also re-revealed in modern days the criteria by which we can tell whether we\nlove God or not. He said to the Prophet Joseph Smith&mdash;and of course that commandment is\nto us through the Prophet&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nIf thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my commandments\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12786\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12786)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12786)\">D&amp;C 42:29<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNotice the phrase, \"<i>keep all my commandments<\/i>.\" Our promise of exaltation in the presence of\nGod is based on that phrase.\n<\/p><p>\nCOMMANDMENTS\n<\/p><p>\nNow the commandments are very numerous, and we haven't time to discuss them in detail on\nthis occasion. You know them as well as I do. But I would just like to call to mind a few of\nGod's commandments to us. We have the great law of tithing, wherein the Lord has declared\nthat if we do not pay one-tenth of all that we possess to him, we rob God. Among the other\ngreat commandments are the law of chastity and the Word of Wisdom. These laws pertain to\nkeeping our bodies clean and pure. There are also the laws and commandments pertaining to\nhonesty, love, charity, patience, kindness, reverence, and numerous others. In fact, the Lord\nhas said that if we receive exaltation in his kingdom, we will do so only on condition that we\nrender obedience to \"every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12814\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12814)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12814)\">D&amp;C 84:44<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to emphasize the fact that today is the day for Latter-day Saints to prepare to\nmeet God by keeping all of his commandments, lest the night cometh wherein we cannot\nrepent. If we do not render obedience now, we might find ourselves at the judgment day in\nthe condition that the lady found herself in a dream, as reported by one of the stake presidents\nat a conference I attended in Salt Lake City about a year ago. I do not recall the stake, and so\nI don't know which stake president to give credit to for this story.\n<\/p><p>\nSTORY OF THE TEAPOT\n<\/p><p>\nHe reported that there was a certain lady living in his ward who had joined the Church over\nin Europe when she was a Girl; and like many of the European people she had formed the\nhabit of drinking tea. After she joined the Church of Jesus Christ, like quite a few Mormons\n(I am sorry to say) she continued the habit of drinking tea. She reared a large family. Her\nchildren married. Her husband died, and she became a widow. And then she became a temple\nworker. Day after day she went to the temple, and no doubt the consciousness of the\ntea-drinking habit she had bore rather heavily on her mind or on her conscience. One night\nshe had a dream. She dreamed that she died and that she passed on into the other world.\nThere she came into the presence of the Savior, the Prophet Joseph Smith, and many other\ngreat and good people who had lived on this earth and whose lives had been such that they\nwere now worthy to become celestial beings. Very sweet, serene, and happy were the feelings\nthat she experienced there In fact, there were no words to describe how beautiful the\nconditions were there, until she looked down into her hand and saw her old\ndirty, black teapot. Then her happiness turned to sorrow and shame. She immediately looked\nall around in the heavenly realm for some place to hide that teapot, but she couldn't find any\nplace. She had to hang on to it. Then she awoke. Cold drops of perspiration were running\ndown her face. She got out of bed, turned the light on, dressed, and went in the other room.\nThere on her stove sat her old dirty teapot. She picked it up, went down to the back of the lot\nand threw it into the Jordan River, and she said, \"There! I am not going to take you to heaven\nwith me.\"\n<\/p><p>\nMy brothers and sisters, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, now is\nthe time for you and me to get rid of all of our old dirty, black teapots. In other words, we\nshould get rid of all our sins. We should repent, as Brother Romney just pointed out in his\naddress, and show God that we love him with all our hearts, with all our mind, and with all\nour strength.\n<\/p><p>\nLOVE OF NEIGHBOR\n<\/p><p>\nWe shall now devote our attention to the second great commandment, \"Thou shalt love thy\nneighbor as thyself\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34368\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34368)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34368)\">Matt. 22:39<\/a><\/span>).\nI do not know whether each of us has thought of this idea very much or\nnot. A man cannot love God with all of his heart unless he loves all of his fellow men with\nall of his heart. If a man says that he loves God and does not love his fellow men, according\nto the teachings of the prophets, that man is a liar. He is not telling the truth. For example,\nJohn made this very unusual and wonderful statement: \n<\/p><p>\nBeloved, let us love one another; for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born\nof God, and knoweth God.\n<\/p><p>\nHe that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.\n<\/p><p>\nIf a man say. I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his\nbrother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd this commandment have we from him. That he who loveth God love his brother\nalso (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1029\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1029)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1029)\">1 Jn. 4:7-8,20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nANALYZE THE HEART\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I would like to ask every one of us this afternoon to analyze his or her heart for a\nmoment or two and see if we really love our fellow men. If we do love them, let us see how\ndeep our love is for them. The commandment is to love our neighbors as much as we love\nourselves. I know that is most difficult to do. The first law of nature is the law of self\npreservation, and people pretty generally follow that first law. In fact, I think the most\nimportant person to almost everybody in this world is himself or herself.\n<\/p><p>\nA good Latter-day Saint husband may think he loves his wife with all his heart. He may think\nhe loves her more than he loves himself, but if he happens to express an idea that she doesn't\nagree with and she voices her disagreement, then his hair immediately stands on end. He\nbuilds up all sorts of arguments against her in defending his own position. In\nfact, he feels a resentment in his heart.\n<\/p><p>\nToo many people&mdash;and I mean, definitely, too many Latter day Saints&mdash;gloat over the sins\nof their unfortunate neighbors. In fact, it seems to build them up a little bit to learn that\nsomebody else has made worse mistakes than they. If the telephone rings and the party on the\nother end of the line tells the story that he has heard about a sin committed the previous night\nby one of his neighbors the one who received the telephone call immediately goes over to his\nnext-door neighbor and says, \"Did you hear what happened last night?\" Then he repeats the\naccount of the unfortunate happening and greatly exaggerates the story. Is that true love? Is\nthat charity? It is not!\n<\/p><p>\nTrue and pure love and charity are found where a mother and father are concerned. In the\ncases where parents of sinful children are concerned, the parents don't go to the telephone and\ntell their neighbors, but they go to their private chambers. There they wet their pillows with\ntheir tears, and they pray to God that he will save their son or their daughter from sin and\nfrom the ways of error into which he or she has fallen.\n<\/p><p>\nLETTER OF THE LAW\n<\/p><p>\nOfttimes you and I have met members of our Church who seem to live all the letter of the\nlaw. They pay their tithes and offerings, they keep the Word of Wisdom, and they attend\nChurch regularly. In fact one would think that they were excellent Latter-day Saints. Yet too\nmany of these people have professional jealousy cankering their hearts. They have envy,\nstrife, malice, and even hatred in their hearts. They fail to treat the ones with whom they\nassociate with love and with charity. They don't express the Golden Rule in the way they\ntreat the ones with whom they work and associate. Yet they claim to love God. John declared\nthat such individuals are liars and that they cannot love God and at the same time hate their\nfellow men. Now to what extent are we guilty?\n<\/p><p>\nLOVE OF ENEMIES\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior not only taught that we should love our friends, but he also taught that we should\nlove our enemies. To quote: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd behold it is written also, that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy;\n<\/p><p>\nBut behold I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to\nthem that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5504\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5504)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5504)\">3 Ne. 12:43-44<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIs that teaching going too far? Can we really love our enemies? I would answer that if we get\nthat godliness in our hearts, the pure love of Jesus Christ that we should have, we can love\nour enemies.\n<\/p><p>\nMany of the great prophets have demonstrated that they could love their\nenemies. Jesus Christ demonstrated far beyond the shadow of a doubt that he could love his\nenemies. For example, a few days prior to his crucifixion, you recall that the Son of God and\nhis Apostles were in Jerusalem. He knew that the Jews were going to betray him and that he\nwas going to be crucified. On that occasion he felt greatly concerned about what was going to\nhappen to the Jews because they had rejected him and the gospel which he had proclaimed.\nHe prophesied regarding the calamities which would come upon his people, and then he\nlamented as follows: \n<\/p><p>\nO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent\nunto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen\ngathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!\n<\/p><p>\nBehold, your house is left unto you desolate\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34371\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34371)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34371)\">Matt. 23:37-38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nEXAMPLE OF JESUS\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then Jesus told his Apostles about the great calamities that would come upon his people\nand upon the remainder of the inhabitants of the earth before his second coming. The\nscriptures report that the Son of God was touched so deeply on certain occasions because of\nthe sins of the people and the calamities that would befall them that \"Jesus wept\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27437\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27437)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27437)\">John 11:35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHow many of us are so concerned about the sins of the people of our home towns that after\nwe have done all we can to teach them the way of eternal life, we then sit upon a hill\noverlooking our home town and weep? I am afraid that very few of us do that. We do not\nhave that much charity; we do not have that much feeling; we do not have that much love in\nour hearts for those who fall into transgression.\n<\/p><p>\nI firmly believe that when Jesus Christ was hanging on the cross he showed the greatest\nexpression of love that has ever been shown in history. He was suffering the terrific pain\nwhich accompanies crucifixion. The jeering multitude was down below the cross, saying, \"If\nthou be the Son of God, come down from the cross\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34390\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34390)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34390)\">Matt. 27:40<\/a><\/span>).\nThe ordinary man would\nhave cursed the taunters and revilers, but the Only Begotten Son of God while suffering such\nexcruciating pain and reviling merely cast his eyes toward heaven and prayed,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . Father, forgive them: for they know not what they do\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31268\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31268)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31268)\">Luke 23:34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis great example of love reminds me of the martyrdom of Stephen. While the Jews were\nstoning him to death, the scripture reports: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their\ncharge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7644\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7644)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7644)\">Acts 7:60<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNEEDED QUALITIES\n<\/p><p>\nAll Latter-day Saints who work in the Church and hold any Church position must love God;\nand if we are going to be acceptable to him, we must love our fellow men. In fact, we have\nreceived a divine commission in our day. It applies to the General Authorities of the Church,\nto all the stake presidents, bishops of wards, and to all stake, ward, and branch officers and\nteachers. This is the word of the Lord: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd no one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love, having\nfaith, hope, charity, being temperate in all things, whatsoever shall be entrusted to his\ncare (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12767\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12767)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12767)\">D&amp;C 12:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe greatest poem that I know of devoted to the subject of love or charity was written by\nApostle Paul. It is found in First Corinthians, chapter thirteen\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"187\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 187)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(187)\">1 Cor. 13:1-13<\/a><\/span>).\nTime will not permit a\ndiscussion of that great poem here. Suffice it to say that Paul mentioned a lot of godly\nattributes that we might possess. And then he summarized by saying that if we possess all of\nthose godly attributes and have not charity, we are nothing. He put charity and love as the\ngreatest of all attributes.\n<\/p><p>\nTEACHINGS OF MORMON\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to quote from Mormon the great teachings he gave on love and charity. He\nwrote.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again, behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be\nmeek, and lowly in heart.\n<\/p><p>\nIf so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is acceptable before God, save the meek and\nlowly of heart, and if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power\nof the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity: and if he hath\nnot charity he is nothing, wherefore he must needs have charity.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh\nnot her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but\nrejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth\nall things.\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity\nnever filth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things\nmust fail&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nBut charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and who so is found\npossessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart,\nthat ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all the true\nfollowers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he\nshall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this\nhope; that we may be purified even as he is pure\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38244\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38244)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38244)\">Moro. 7:43-48<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn conclusion, my beloved brothers and sisters, I humbly ask our Father in heaven that he will\nlet a rich abundance of his Holy Spirit enter our hearts; that the pure love of Jesus Christ\nmight dwell in our hearts; that we might do away with all envy and strife; that we might be\nfilled with love; that we might really love the Lord our God with all our\nhearts, might, mind, and strength; that we might really and truly serve God in the name of\nJesus Christ and love our neighbors as ourselves. This I ask in the name of our Lord and\nSavior Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
