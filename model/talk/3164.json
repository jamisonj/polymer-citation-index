Wells. That was forty-two and a half years ago. In that talk, Brother Wells explained that \u201cbetween individuals we draw up an instrument and we sign it, and have it signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of witnesses, and then go before a notary public or a justice of the peace and make oath in order to make it binding, and in order that it may be still more so, laws are passed imposing penalties for breach of contract. These are in the nature of covenants which men make with their fellowmen.\u201d (In Conference Report, Apr. 1936, p. 41.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/caring-for-the-poor-a-covenantal-obligation.p7\" class=\"\">With respect to Church covenants, he said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/caring-for-the-poor-a-covenantal-obligation.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cWe should do the right, and if we do the Lord is bound, under the covenant that he has made with us. If we shall do all things whatsoever the Lord our God shall command us, there shall be glory added upon our heads forever and ever. That is the promise; it is God\u2019s covenant. We are a covenant people, and that covenant has been restored to the earth with the restoration of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord, and all things whatsoever the Lord our God shall command us are embodied in that glorious Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/caring-for-the-poor-a-covenantal-obligation.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cObedience, then, to the Gospel \u2026 will entitle us to eternal glory, worlds without end.

The Lord\u2019s promise, conditioned upon such obedience, is the gift of eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/caring-for-the-poor-a-covenantal-obligation.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cWhat must we then think,\u201d continued Brother Wells \u201cof a covenant where God himself is the party of the first part? Such a covenant God has made with every one of us. He has entered into an agreement with us. If you will do all things which the Lord your God shall command you; if you will do his will, you shall have glory added upon your heads forever and ever. That is the pledge, and God keeps his covenant and we should do the same.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/caring-for-the-poor-a-covenantal-obligation.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cHow do we enter into that covenant? Not by signing a written instrument. True. But in a most impressive manner and a most authoritative manner. The Lord commissions his servants, bestows upon them his priesthood and authorizes them to perform sacred ordinances, the same as if he had signed it in person. They call attention to the necessity of following the Lord Jesus Christ and obeying his Gospel, doing all things whatsoever the Lord shall command us. That is the contract, and we enter into it in a most solemn way. What is the formality of it, if not by writing with pen and ink? It is by baptism by immersion for the remission of sins. What a wonderful and impressive formality! Could anything be more so? In baptism by immersion we symbolize both death and life, for as the Apostle Paul explains: \u2018We are buried with [Christ] by baptism into death\u2019 and brought forth out of the watery grave in likeness of his glorious resurrection.\u201d (In Conference Report, Apr. 1936, p. 41.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/caring-for-the-poor-a-covenantal-obligation.p14\" class=\"\">This explanation of the significance of the baptismal covenant has remained vivid in my mind for all these forty years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/caring-for-the-poor-a-covenantal-obligation.p15\" class=\"\">I have also been impressed by Alma\u2019s explanation of the baptismal covenant:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/caring-for-the-poor-a-covenantal-obligation.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold,\u201d said he to the assembled believers, \u201chere are the waters of Mormon \u2026 and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another\u2019s burdens, that they may be light;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/caring-for-the-poor-a-covenantal-obligation.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cYea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life\u2014<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/caring-for-the-poor-a-covenantal-obligation.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cNow I say unto you,\u201d continued Alma, \u201cif this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a <span class=\"emphasis\">covenant<\/span> with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/caring-for-the-poor-a-covenantal-obligation.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now when the people had heard these words, they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/caring-for-the-poor-a-covenantal-obligation.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now it came to pass that Alma took Helam, he being one of the first, and went and stood forth in the water, and cried, saying: O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/caring-for-the-poor-a-covenantal-obligation.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when he had said these words, the Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he said: Helam, I baptize thee, having authority from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a <span class=\"emphasis\">covenant<\/span> to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body; and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the foundation of the world.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40454\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40454)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40454)\">Mosiah 18:8\u201313<\/a><\/span>; italics added.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/caring-for-the-poor-a-covenantal-obligation.p22\" class=\"\">In light of these revelations, it seems inevitable to me, as it did to Brother Wells, that every person who is baptized and receives the gift of the Holy Ghost, which seals the ordinance, is under solemn covenant with the Lord to obey his commandments.
