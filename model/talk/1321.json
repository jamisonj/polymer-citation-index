Critchlow, Jr., <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1964, pp. 29-32<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nOnce, as my wife and I were observing our wedding anniversary quietly at home I called\nacross a room to her facetiously: \"Mama, where will we be one million years from now?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Oh, pshaw,\" she said&mdash;just like that, without as much as a glance in my direction. She was\nbusy frosting a cake. Then, all of a sudden, she startled me. Laying down her spatula, she\nturned and came toward me, and, grasping the lapels of my coat, she pulled herself up on her\ntoes and with her lips close to mine, she said tenderly: \"I only know I want to be with you,\none million years from now. And may I have the boys (our two sons) home for breakfast\nevery Tuesday, just as we do now? And may I have all of the grandchildren home for\nThanksgiving? And may I have a big Christmas tree and logs in the fireplace and all of the\nfamily home for Christmas&mdash;just as we do now? And may I have a big home with lots of\nrooms in it? And will you keep saving up for it&mdash;just as you are now? Promise me, promise\nme, say yes, say yes, right now say yes.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSo, I said \"yes.\" I was trapped&mdash;and I promised, and I sealed the promise with a kiss. Well,\nshe fairly pounded the promise out of me with her fists, still clenching the lapels of my coat.\nBesides, a promise with a million years to make it good didn't seem to bother me at that\nmoment and, thinking out loud, I said, \"If I save only one dollar a year over a million years, I\ncould save a million dollars and that should buy a mansion.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"That's what I want;\" she said, \"a mansion. Jesus said 'In my Father's house are many\nmansions' (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28126\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28126)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28126)\">John 14:2<\/a><\/span>)\nand we'll need one&mdash;a big one for our spirit children. I hope we\nhave many of them. Daddy, your family may not all be raised&mdash;one million years from now.\nYou see, dear,\"&mdash;she was still talking, and now there was no trace of facetiousness in her\nspeech&mdash;\"my love for you is eternal, as is my love for our children&mdash;those with us now and\nthose to come hereafter. I want an eternal family. I want to share with you eternal life. Please\nbuild for all of us a 'mansion in the sky.' Save up for it please.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Eternal Life<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThose last three short sentences:&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nMy love for you is eternal . . .<br \/>\n      I want an eternal family . . .<br \/>\n      I want to share with you eternal life&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\ncomprise the prettiest speech my wife ever meant to make. Factually she didn't speak them&mdash;save\nin her heart, but she did inspire them. The melody was hers; I added the lyrics. What a\nmelody of love for couples contemplating  marriage vows&mdash;husbands and wives&mdash;others&mdash;who\nwill pause to ponder on what eternity may hold for them, future-wise.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay must have pondered on eternity, else why did he write: \"love is as eternal as\nthe spirit of man. . . if earthly things are typical of heavenly things, in the spirit world we\nshall recognize our loved ones and know them as we loved them here. . . .Why should death\nseparate you when love will continue after death?\" (Dedicatory speech&mdash;Swiss Temple.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith, pondering eternity, said he expected \"to take his relatives and\nfriends by the hand, and embrace them. Father, son, mother, daughter, brother, sister, wife,\nchildren&mdash;these all would be as dear in the Hereafter as here.\" (<i>Joseph Smith an American Prophet<\/i>,\nJohn Henry Evans, p. 261.)\n<\/p><p>\nParley P. Pratt, also pondering eternity, wrote: \"The order of God's government, both in time\nand in eternity, is patriarchal; that is, it is a fatherly government. Each father who is raised\nfrom the dead and made a partaker of the celestial glory in its fullness will hold lawful\njurisdiction over his own children and over all the families which sprang of\nthem to all generations, forever and ever.\" (<i>The Improvement Era<\/i>, August 1961, p. 580.)\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay, Joseph Smith, and Parley P. Pratt were obviously speaking of souls who\nfaithfully observe the laws and ordinances of the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nMy bride and I, pondering eternity, decided, of course, on a temple marriage. Our children\ncame to us under that marriage covenant. The plans for building a \"mansion in the sky\" we\nfound in the gospel plan&mdash;and in that plan we learned how to build, also how to save to\ninsure eternal love and eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nMy wife, in her pretended pretty speech, pleasingly disclosed what the gospel may do for\nfaithful, covenanted children hereafter, or future-wise.\n<\/p><p>\nPertinent to that future state, the Apostle Paul made this cheerful comment: \". . . God, that\ncannot lie, promised before the world began\", \". . . in the hope of eternal life\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43036\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43036)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43036)\">Titus 1:2<\/a><\/span>) things that\n\"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of men, the things which\nGod hath prepared for them that love him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"381\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 381)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(381)\">1 Cor. 2:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSuppose we now come down out of the \"clouds of heaven\" and pull our thoughts away from\n\"mansions in the sky\" and focus them for a minute or two on the blessings which the gospel\nholds for us present-wise, right here and now.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Blessings of the Present<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFirst on my list I've placed:\n<\/p><p>\nThe privilege of associating and fellowshipping with good friends and you great leaders. This\nis a blessing we usually take for granted. I have found such leaders and friends in every stake\nand mission in which I've visited. And how I have enjoyed them.\n<\/p><p>\nOpportunities for service is another very special privilege and blessing.\n<\/p><p>\nHappiness, a by-product of service, naturally follows opportunity for service. Only those who\nhave served will appreciate this blessing. Returned missionaries attest this enthusiastically.\n<\/p><p>\nHealth through obedience to the gospel's law of health, the Word of Wisdom&mdash;is a blessing\nsometimes lightly appreciated.\n<\/p><p>\nMinistrations of the Holy Ghost, to acquaint me with truth and to comfort me in trials and\nsorrows, are blessings I wish I had time to explore with you.\n<\/p><p>\nPeace of mind is another blessing which I must explore briefly.\n<\/p><p>\nOnce when Dr. Joshua Loth Liebman was a young man, he \"undertook to draw up a catalogue\nof the acknowledged 'goods' of life . . . I set down,\" he said, \"my inventory of earthly\ndesirables: health, love, beauty, talent, power, riches, and fame.... When my inventory was\ncomplete I proudly showed it to a wise elder . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"'An excellent list,' he said, 'and set down in not-unreasonable order. But . . . you have\nomitted the most important element of all . . . lacking which . . . your list [becomes] an\nintolerable burden.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"With a pencil stub he crossed out my entire schedule. Then . . . he wrote down three\nsyllables: <i>peace of mind<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Peace of Mind<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"'This is the gift that God reserved for His special prot\u00e9g\u00e9s,' he said. 'Talent and health He\ngives to many. Wealth is commonplace, fame not rare. But peace of mind . . . He bestows it\ncharily.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"'This is no private opinion of mine,' he explained. 'I am merely paraphrasing from the\nPsalmist . . . God, Lord of the Universe . . . heap worldly gifts at the feet of foolish men . . .\nGive me the gift of the Untroubled Mind.'\" (Liebman, Joshua Loth, <i>Peace of Mind<\/i>, New\nYork: Simon and Schuster, 1946, pp. 3-4.)\n<\/p><p>\nDr. Liebman may yet discover that the gift of an untroubled mind, like happiness, is a\nby-product of gospel living. I do sincerely believe the gospel of Jesus Christ is a certain, a\nsure, and a true source of peace of mind.\n<\/p><p>\nOur Heavenly Father wants his children to be happy, to have joy and untroubled minds. He\ndidn't send us to earth to be rid of us. He loves us. He doesn't always love the things we do,\nbut he does love us, and he has provided for us a program, a recipe, if you please, for our\nhappiness and peace of mind. We call it the gospel of Jesus Christ, a few\nclear, concise, simple laws which if observed will provide the joy he intended for us.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . men are, that they might have joy,\" said an ancient prophet\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3720\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3720)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3720)\">2 Ne. 2:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Fullness of Joy<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJesus said, \"These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that\nyour joy might be full\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28136\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28136)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28136)\">John 15:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe great American prophet Joseph Smith wrote: \"Happiness is the object and design of our\nexistence, and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it\"\n(<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>, p. 255).\n<\/p><p>\nTrodding that gospel path I have found happiness and peace of mind. I commend that path to\nDr. Liebman and to others as a \"sure fire\" remedy for troubled minds.\n<\/p><p>\nThe gospel answers satisfactorily for me problems which have piqued man's curiosity and\npeace of mind throughout the ages, such as why I am here, from whence I came, and my\nstatus after death. The gospel has resolved these problems for me&mdash;it will for all who accept\nit.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Blessings of the Priesthood<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe opportunity to have the priesthood is, in my humble opinion, perhaps the greatest\nblessing to accrue to me by virtue of the gospel and my membership in the Church.\nAppraising this blessing our Lord and Savior said:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . all they who receive this priesthood receive me . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;\n<\/p><p>\n\"And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father\nhath shall be given him\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14425\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14425)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14425)\">D&amp;C 84:35,37-38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nObviously, all that the Father hath will not accrue to men here in this mortal sphere of\neverlasting life, but when did our Father ever place a limit on the number of blessings mortal\nmen might receive in time and place of need provided they honor their priesthood?\n<\/p><p>\nTo Jesus was given the assignment of organizing or creating the world. He was also given the\nresponsibility of carrying out his Father's program here on earth. To assist him in his\nadministrative duties he has chosen administrative assistants and made them officers in his\nkingdom. These are they who hold the priesthood. He has also provided, all through the ages,\ndirect lines of communication to his prophets, the higher officers in his kingdom, for\nconveying instructions in matters concerning his kingdom. He has also set up transmission\nlines and service leads through which the power of God (priesthood) may flow to all of his\nofficers.\n<\/p><p>\nThe power of priesthood is not in his officers but through them just as the power of electricity\nis not in the wire but through it. Carelessness around electric power lines can be suddenly\nlethal. Carelessness around priesthood power lines can be slowly lethal, producing a lingering,\nwithering, spiritual death.\n<\/p><p>\nThe genius of man, employing the great power called electricity, has made possible the\ntransmission and reception of sound and sight all over and around the world&mdash;perhaps\nbeyond&mdash;who knows. The sets employed are the telegraph, the telephone, radio, and TV. But\nthe genius of man is dwarfed by the omnipotence of God, who, employing that great power of\nGod&mdash;priesthood, has created sets that are truly \"out of this world,\" for out of this world and\nfar beyond, even nigh unto Kolob where God dwells, their messages are beamed. We call\nthese marvelous sets, mortal bodies, my body, your bodies.\n<\/p><p>\nThese souls can dial God in anytime, anyplace, in any circumstances by merely saying, \"Our\nFather who art in heaven\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35320\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35320)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35320)\">Matt. 6:9<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd there will never be a busy line, never any interference, never\na line out of order. God always hears and answers the prayers of the faithful.\n<\/p><p>\nHis messages to his children usually come by inspiration or revelation. Oral messages are not\nalways exclusively for his prophets.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen these human receiving sets are energized with priesthood, by the laying on of\nauthoritative hands, the communication lines are activated and the\ntransmission lines are opened to permit the flow of priesthood power. And by that power the\nsick are blessed, the sorrowful are comforted, the abilities of officers to serve are\nstrengthened. Men are thus empowered and magnified in their callings.\n<\/p><p>\nThe gospel and my church membership afford me the opportunity to have the priesthood. It is\na very choice blessing.\n<\/p><p>\nMy list of gospel blessings is not exhausted&mdash;far from it. Time, however, forbids exploring\nthem.\n<\/p><p>\nI began this talk with a fanciful little speech by my wife on what the gospel may hold for her\nfuture-wise. I added a few things, but only a few, to show what the gospel has done for me\nand may do for you present-wise. May I conclude with a word or two about what the gospel\nteaches about our blessings, past-wise, pre-natal, or pre-earth. A comment by Father Abraham,\nuttered nearly 4,000 years ago, should suffice:\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Intelligence Before the World Was<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham the intelligences that were organized before the\nworld was, and among all these were many of the noble and great ones;\n<\/p><p>\n\"And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he\nsaid: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits and he saw that\nthey were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen\nbefore thou wast born.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were\nwith him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and\nwe will make an earth whereon these may dwell;\n<\/p><p>\n\"And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their\nGod shall command them;\n<\/p><p>\n\"And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first\nestate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and\nthey who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here\nam I, send me. And another answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I\nwill send the first.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the second was angry, and kept not his first estate, and, at that day, many followed after\nhim.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And then the Lord said: Let us go down, And they went down at the beginning, and they,\nthat is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens and the earth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7232\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7232)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7232)\">Abr. 3:22-28<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7237\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7237)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7237)\">Abr. 4:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith has supplemented Abraham's comment with this informative\nsentence:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that\npurpose in the Great Council of heaven before the world was\"\n(<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>, p. 365.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Minister to the Inhabitants of the World\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThese comments by Abraham and Joseph Smith give unspeakable joy to my soul, and they\nfirm up my peace of mind no end because they give assurance that: I, along with you, was\njudged worthy to come to earth in the flesh. We were reserved to come in the greatest\ndispensation of them all&mdash;the \"Dispensation of the Fullness of Times.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe who bear the priesthood were ordained in the Great Council of Heaven \"to minister to the\ninhabitants of the world.\" Thus the gospel has taught me about great blessings which accrued\nto me before I came to earth&mdash;pre-natal, pre-mortal, pre-earth or past-wise as I have already\ncalled it\n<\/p><p>\nSo past-wise, present-wise, future-wise or any-wise or way I look at it, the gospel is very dear\nto me. It truly is a program for happiness and peace of mind. It is the Great Physician's\nunfailing prescription for troubled souls. It's precious. I love it. I love its author, and I bear\nmy solemn witness that he is the Son of God, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
