No, they won't. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n2329\"> Well, you see it is all flowing in our legitimate channel. If God has ten thousand children, or a million, or ten millions, and all partake of one spirit, and they are one, does he not love them all? Yes, he does. But if one steps aside from the path marked out, will he love him? No, he won't. But if the ignorant sin and go astray, he may send a messenger after them and get them back. He may rejoice over them and pity them when they are away, and rejoice over them when they come back. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n2330\"> Now, brethren and sisters, consider these principles: weigh them well in your minds; for the greatest evil that I know of in this people is the little bickerings in families. I am happy to say that even this evil is diminishing; yet there should be none at all. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n2331\"> The spirits of men and women should ever be guided and tempered by the Holy Ghost; and I believe that the desire and intention of a large majority of the people are to keep the spirit of their superiors and of their God&#x2014;to drink it and live by it. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n2332\"> Would to God that all the women that are adopted into families would partake of the spirit of their husbands, if they are upright men. They have no right to an independent standard, anymore than I have a right to a standard independent of the Holy Ghost. I should have an independence to turn away from all sin; for that is the Spirit of God, and that is the right kind of independence, and that is the only kind that is justifiable. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n2333\"> I feel, brethren and sisters, that I should not go amiss&#x2014;that I should not go astray from the path of duty, <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"283b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD05\/JoD05_0283.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;283b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/2093\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> were I to call upon families to repent of their sins in this respect. I have laid before you, this morning, some of the greatest evils there are in families&#x2014;an unwillingness of the members of those families to keep the spirit of their head. Some of them are unwilling to do it: it is too much the case. I only direct these remarks where they are applicable; and therefore those to whom they do not apply will not take them: and perhaps there will be some to whom they are applicable that will say, I do not believe that doctrine. To such I would say, You are the very one; you are the very character to repent and submit yourself to the proper government of God. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n2334\"> In relation to murmuring against God, brethren and sisters, do you not know that the Israelites were reproved and that they were slain because they murmured against their God?<span class=\"citation\" id=\"54731\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 54731)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(54731)\">Num. 14:27-29<\/a><\/span> Well, now, in the same light do families stand who murmur against their head and partake not of the spirit of their head; for, say the Scriptures, &#x201C;Whoso will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"71418\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 71418)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(71418)\">Acts 3:23<\/a><\/span> Remember that it is by patient continuance in welldoing that we seek for honor, happiness, and eternal life&#x2014;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"72263\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 72263)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(72263)\">Rom. 2:7<\/a><\/span>by patient continuance all the time, and not when we come into trying places to turn aside; but to abide in the covenants and be patient, seeking for honor, immortality, and eternal life. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n2335\"> Well, now, you brethren, do not you go home and say that just suits me&#x2014;that is my doctrine, and take liberty thereby to tyrannize over your families. If it just suits you, and if it is your doctrine, all right. But one thing let me tell you&#x2014;Seek the spirit of your head; and if you will do that, you will never take advantage of the remarks of the servants of God to mistreat your women. But, at the same time, the principle must be laid open before  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"284a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD05\/JoD05_0284.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;284a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/2092\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>you, so that you can understand it.

There are a great many things in which we have improved; and in respect to the things of which I have spoken, there is no doubt but you have greatly improved; but I tell you there is room for a mighty stride of improvement in this respect. This is the way I feel about it. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n2338\"> I do not wish to divide your attention upon a thousand things, but I wish to call your attention to this thing and say, Repent of all your deviations from the path of duty; and I believe that you know this is a true doctrine&#x2014;that you are satisfied that it is true. Cast away from you every feeling of rebellion and of murmuring that will lead you to oppose your legitimate head, and drink down the spirit of your superiors, and abide by it; and then you are one: and when you are one, God can love you all at the same time. Why, when I love a person, I not only love the head, but I love the face, the hands, the feet, and all the members of that body. Well, then, if we are all members of the body, does not God love us all? Certainly he does. Then away with the idea that a man cannot love but one object at a time: away with this, I say, and let us all be one. Then if any part of us is loved, we are all loved. I believe that I have said all <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"284b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD05\/JoD05_0284.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;284b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/2092\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> that I wanted to say. May God bless you and save us all in his kingdom! Amen. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n2339\"> There is one word more that I want to say, and it is right in connection with what I have said. I won't turn your minds away from what has been spoken; but I want to tell you that brother Brigham, brother Heber, and brother Daniel's responsibilities laid upon them make them feel more than any other men can feel. They are enough to burst iron hearts, aside from their family responsibilities. Pray, therefore, that their strength may be equal to their day; and while you pray for them, work to your prayer. And if you ask, &#x201C;How shall I work to it?&#x201D; I will tell you. If you get some little difficulty on your mind, you Bishops, you Elders, you members, do not run to brother Brigham, to brother Heber, nor to brother Daniel. You have prayed to God that their burdens may be lightened; then do not throw your troubles upon them, but pray to God to nerve their bodies and their spirits, and to give them power and strength sufficient for their day. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n2340\"> You would not say to the mule or jackass that is bending beneath his burden, &#x201C;Oh! Poor animal!&#x201D; And then jump on to him yourself: you would not do that. Then, when you see the Presidency of our Church&#x2014;our leaders&#x2014;when you see them bowed down, if you cannot go to do them any good, do not go to them with any of your petty troubles and difficulties. We want all these miserable petty cases put away or settled between parties and their Bishop, and mercifully relieve our head from unnecessary, petty, and vexatious troubles. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n2341\"> God bless us and enable us all to do so, through Jesus Christ! Amen. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
