We who would attend the temple must be living in a manner which helps us be worthy to enter and fully partake of the feast of which he spoke.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p16\" class=\"\">We examine our worthiness to enter the temple in our annual temple recommend interviews with priesthood leaders. Our signature, with theirs, on our temple recommend testifies of our worthiness to enter the temple. How important it is to be completely honest with our bishop.

We apply the Lord\u2019s direction by ensuring that our hearts are pure by examining our lives before we approach His house. Where there is an unresolved sin, we should take the necessary penitent action to clear it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p21\" class=\"\">We should also examine our relationships with our brother, or sister, or wife, or husband, or child, or parent, or anyone else who might have \u201cought against us.\u201d We should repair and strengthen any damaged relationship, then come to the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p22\" class=\"\">The truly humble and obedient take this preparation a step further. They clear their hearts of any feelings which may be out of harmony with the sacred environment and sacred experiences they will encounter in the temple. They will be mindful that feelings of anger, hostility, fear, frustration, haste, or any preoccupation with matters outside the temple will interfere with their ability to fully partake of the feast available within the temple\u2014which is a feast of the Spirit. Those kinds of feelings are left outside the temple when we enter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p23\" class=\"\">A temple is a place in which those whom He has chosen are endowed with power from on high\u2014a power which enables us to use our gifts and capabilities with greater intelligence and increased effectiveness in order to bring to pass our Heavenly Father\u2019s purposes in our own lives and the lives of those we love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p24\" class=\"\">As he dedicated the cornerstone of the Salt Lake Temple on April 6, 1853, President Brigham Young made this observation about the endowment:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cYour <span class=\"emphasis\">endowment <\/span>is, to receive all those ordinances in the House of the Lord, which are necessary for you, after you have departed this life, to enable you to walk back to the presence of the Father, passing the angels who stand as sentinels, \u2026 and gain your eternal exaltation in spite of earth and hell.\u201d (in <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses, <\/span>2:31.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p26\" class=\"\">We receive the blessings of which President Young spoke when we are endowed.

Whitney spoke more fully than others. Those who receive most understand the teaching methods the Lord uses in the temple. They bring to the temple hearts and minds prepared to participate in the Lord\u2019s way of learning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p28\" class=\"\">Others receive less and may be somewhat disappointed in their temple experience; perhaps they do not understand how the Lord teaches us in His house. Elder John A. Widtsoe said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cWe live in a world of symbols. No man or woman can come out of the temple endowed as he should be, unless he has seen, beyond the symbol, the mighty realities for which the symbols stand.\u201d (\u201cTemple Worship,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine, <\/span>Apr. 1921, p. 62.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p30\" class=\"\">If you may have been somewhat confused, unclear, or concerned about your temple experience, I hope you will return again and again. When you return, come with an open, seeking, contrite heart, and allow the Spirit to teach you by revelation what the symbols can mean to you and the eternal realities which they represent. Elder Widtsoe thoughtfully provided some counsel about how you might do this. He spoke of the Prophet\u2019s first vision as a model of how revelation, in the temple and elsewhere, is received.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cHow do men receive revelations?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow did the Prophet Joseph Smith obtain his first revelation, his first vision? He desired something. In [a grove of trees], away from human confusion, he summoned all the strength of his nature; there he fought the demon of evil, and, at length, because of the strength of his desire and the great effort that he made, the Father and the Son descended out of the heavens and spoke eternal truth to him.\u201d (Ibid., p. 63.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p32\" class=\"\">Elder Widtsoe observed that it was the strength of Joseph\u2019s desire and the great effort which enabled him to receive his vision of the Father and the Son. Desire and effort are likewise required if we would receive revelation to understand the ordinances of the endowment. He wrote: \u201cRevelation \u2026 is not imposed upon a person; it must be drawn to us by faith, seeking and working. \u2026 To the man or woman who goes through the temple, with open eyes, heeding the symbols and the covenants, and making a steady, continuous effort to understand the full meaning, God speaks his word, and revelations come. \u2026 The endowment which was given by revelation can best be understood by revelation; and to those who seek most vigorously, with pure hearts, will the revelation be greatest.\u201d (Ibid.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p33\" class=\"\">To understand the things of God requires a continuance effort, a pure and receptive heart, and an open mind.

What person would not want these blessings, as expressed by the Prophet Joseph Smith at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple. He said: \u201cWe ask thee, Holy Father, that thy servants may go forth from this house armed with thy power, and that thy name may be upon them, and thy glory be round about them, and thine angels have charge over them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19710\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19710)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19710)\">D&amp;C 109:22<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p37\" class=\"\">When you return from the temple, share with your children and loved ones at home your feelings about what you experienced.

Do you remember any of the words of the ceremony? Do you recall sacred feelings, a glimpse of eternal promises? Can you feel again the power that created a relationship which will transcend death? Can you recall the feeling of love of our Heavenly Father for you and your companion, which was manifest on that occasion?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p42\" class=\"\">If time and the realities of everyday life have eroded your recollections of what you felt and received when you were sealed, you should return to the temple and participate again as proxies for the departed in that same sealing ordinance.
