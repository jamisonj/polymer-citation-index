A friend told me that there are 37 new TV series being inaugurated this fall. As he has read the reviews, he has found few if any of them that he would want his children to watch. Most of the sitcoms, dramas, and reality shows contain immorality, violence, and subtle ridicule of traditional values and traditional families. Each year the new shows seem to get worse, pushing the envelope of what the public will accept. What comes out of Hollywood, off the Internet, and in much of today\u2019s music creates a web of decadence that can trap our children and endanger all of us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/let-our-voices-be-heard.p5\" class=\"\">Church leaders have the responsibility to speak out on moral issues and to counsel individuals and families. The family is the basic unit of society; it is the basic unit of eternity. Thus, when forces threaten the family, Church leaders must respond.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/let-our-voices-be-heard.p6\" class=\"\">The family is at the heart of Heavenly Father\u2019s plan because we are all part of His family and because mortality is our opportunity to form our own families and to assume the role of parents. It is within our families that we learn unconditional love, which can come to us and draw us very close to God\u2019s love. It is within families that values are taught and character is built. Father and mother are callings from which we will never be released, and there is no more important stewardship than the responsibility we have for God\u2019s spirit children who come into our families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/let-our-voices-be-heard.p7\" class=\"\">Within this context of the preeminent importance of families and the threats families face today, it is not surprising that the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles used strong words in the proclamation to the world on families: \u201cWe warn that individuals \u2026 who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God. Further, we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-23911_000_007\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Oct. 1998, 24; <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1995, 102.]<\/span><\/sup> One such prophet was Malachi, who admonished parents to turn their hearts to their children and children to their parents, lest the whole earth be cursed (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32695\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32695)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32695)\">Mal. 4:6<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/let-our-voices-be-heard.p8\" class=\"\">To these warnings, ancient as the Old Testament and current as the proclamation on the family, I add my own voice of warning, specifically concerning today\u2019s media and the powerful negative effect it can have on families and on family life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/let-our-voices-be-heard.p9\" class=\"\">Because of its sheer size, media today presents vast and sharply contrasting options. Opposite from its harmful and permissive side, media offers much that is positive and productive. Television offers history channels, discovery channels, education channels. One can still find movies and TV comedies and dramas that entertain and uplift and accurately depict the consequences of right and wrong. The Internet can be a fabulous tool of information and communication, and there is an unlimited supply of good music in the world. Thus our biggest challenge is to choose wisely what we listen to and what we watch.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/let-our-voices-be-heard.p10\" class=\"\">As the prophet Lehi said, because of Christ and His Atonement, we are \u201cfree forever, knowing good from evil,\u201d able to act for ourselves rather than be acted upon, \u201cfree to choose liberty and eternal life \u2026 or to choose captivity and death\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3406\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3406)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3406)\">2 Ne. 2:26\u201327<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/let-our-voices-be-heard.p11\" class=\"\">The choices we make in media can be symbolic of the choices we make in life.

In the virtual reality and the perceived reality of large and small screens, family-destructive viewpoints and behavior are regularly portrayed as pleasurable, as stylish, as exciting, and as normal. Often media\u2019s most devastating attacks on family are not direct or frontal or openly immoral. Intelligent evil is too cunning for that, knowing that most people still profess belief in family and in traditional values. Rather the attacks are subtle and <span class=\"emphasis\">amoral<\/span>\u2014issues of right and wrong don\u2019t even come up. Immorality and sexual innuendo are everywhere, causing some to believe that because everyone is doing it, it must be all right.

The long-cherished values of abstinence from intimate relationships before marriage and complete fidelity between husband and wife after marriage are denigrated and derided. Children and youth are confused and misled by the deviant behavior they see demonstrated by so-called stars they admire and want to emulate.

As I said once before, when you stop and think about it from a diabolically tactical point of view, fighting the family makes sense to Satan. When he wants to disrupt the work of the Lord, he doesn\u2019t poison the world\u2019s peanut butter supply, thus bringing the Church\u2019s missionary system to its collective knees. He doesn\u2019t send a plague of laryngitis to afflict the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. He doesn\u2019t legislate against green Jell-O and casseroles. When evil wants to strike out and disrupt the essence of God\u2019s work, it attacks the family. It does so by attempting to disregard the law of chastity, to confuse gender, to desensitize violence, to make crude and blasphemous language the norm, and to make immoral and deviant behavior seem like the rule rather than the exception.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/let-our-voices-be-heard.p23\" class=\"\">We need to remember Edmund Burke\u2019s statement: \u201cThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-23911_000_007\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Attributed in John Bartlett, comp., <span class=\"emphasis\">Familiar Quotations,<\/span> 15th ed.
