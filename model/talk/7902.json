I share with you narrative from the Book of Mormon describing Helaman and his 2,000 stripling soldiers. This scripture will provide insight into the character of those ancient young men\u2014and inspiration for you, latter-day young men. I quote a favorite scripture: \u201cAnd they were all young men, and they were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all\u2014they were men who were true at all times.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10411_000_022\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"123386\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123386)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123386)\">Alma 53:20<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Courage, strength, activity, and truth\u2014what admirable traits!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.p6\" class=\"\">I would like to focus on the first trait that describes them: \u201cvaliant for courage.\u201d To me, this describes the conviction of these young men to courageously do what is right, or as Alma describes, \u201cto stand as witnesses of God at all times \u2026 and in all places.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-10411_000_022\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"123387\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123387)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123387)\">Mosiah 18:9<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> The 2,000 stripling soldiers had countless moments to demonstrate their courage. Each of you will also have defining moments in your life requiring courage. A friend of mine, John, shared with me one of those moments in his life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.p7\" class=\"\">Some years ago, John was accepted at a prestigious Japanese university. He would be part of the international student program with many other top students from around the world. Some enrolled with a hope to deepen their understanding of the culture and language, others viewed it as a stepping-stone to an eventual profession and employment in Japan, but all had left home to study in a foreign country.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.p8\" class=\"\">Soon after John\u2019s arrival, word of a party to be held on the rooftop of a private residence spread among the foreign student population. That evening, John and two friends made their way to the advertised address.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.p9\" class=\"\">Following an elevator ride to the top floor of the building, John and his friends navigated the single narrow stairway leading to the rooftop and began mingling with the others. As the night wore on, the atmosphere changed. The noise, music volume, and alcohol amplified, as did John\u2019s uneasiness. Then suddenly someone began organizing the students into a large circle with the intent of sharing marijuana cigarettes. John grimaced and quickly informed his two friends that it was time to leave. Almost in ridicule, one of them replied, \u201cJohn, this is easy\u2014we\u2019ll just stand in the circle, and when it is our turn, we\u2019ll just pass it along rather than smoke it. That way we won\u2019t have to embarrass ourselves in front of everyone by leaving.\u201d This sounded easy to John, but it did not sound right. He knew he had to announce his intention and act. In a moment he mustered his courage and told them that they could do as they wished, but he was leaving. One friend decided to stay and joined the circle; the other reluctantly followed John down the stairs to board the elevator. Much to their surprise, when the elevator doors opened, Japanese police officers poured out and hurried to ascend the stairs to the rooftop. John and his friend boarded the elevator and departed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.p10\" class=\"\">When the police appeared at the top of the stairs, the students quickly threw the illegal drugs off the roof so they wouldn\u2019t be caught. After securing the stairway, however, the officers lined up everyone on the roof and asked each student to extend both hands. The officers then walked down the line, carefully smelling each student\u2019s thumbs and index fingers. All who had held the marijuana, whether they had smoked it or not, were presumed guilty, and there were huge consequences. Almost without exception, the students who had remained on the rooftop were expelled from their respective universities, and those convicted of a crime were likely deported from Japan. Dreams of an education, years of preparation, and the possibility of future employment in Japan were dashed in a moment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.p11\" class=\"\">Now let me tell you what happened to these three friends. The friend who stayed on the roof was expelled from the university in Japan to which he had worked so hard to be accepted and was required to return home. The friend who left the party that night with John finished school in Japan and went on to earn degrees from two top-tier universities in the United States. His career took him back to Asia, where he has enjoyed immense professional success. He remains grateful to this day for John\u2019s courageous example. As for John, the consequences in his life have been immeasurable. His time in Japan that year led him to a happy marriage and the subsequent birth of two sons. He has been a very successful businessman and recently became a professor at a Japanese university. Imagine how different his life would have been had he not had the courage to leave the party on that important evening in Japan.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-10411_000_022\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Personal story told to author.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.p12\" class=\"\">Young men, there will be times when you, like John, will have to demonstrate your righteous courage in plain view of your peers, the consequence of which may be ridicule and embarrassment. Additionally, in your world, skirmishes with the adversary will also be fought on a silent, solitary battlefield in front of a screen. Technology with its substantial benefits also brings challenges not faced by generations before you. A recent national survey found that today\u2019s teens are tempted at alarming levels each day not only in schools but also in cyberspace. It revealed that teens who were exposed to images of drinking or drug use on social networking sites were three to four times more likely to use alcohol or drugs. Commenting on the survey, a former U.S. cabinet secretary stated: \u201cThis year\u2019s survey reveals a new kind of potent peer pressure\u2014digital peer pressure. Digital peer pressure moves beyond a child\u2019s friends and the kids they hang out with.

But remember that the Savior himself was tormented, ridiculed, spat upon, and finally crucified because he would not waver in his conviction.
