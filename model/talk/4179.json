She was one of those nice but unnoticed girls who don\u2019t become much but a face on a yearbook page and a name on the rolls. Her family was poor, and they lived out of town. She was not part of the \u201cin crowd,\u201d and the only time her name came up in a conversation of other students was in that mocking, sarcastic way that seems funny when you are young, insecure, and need to ridicule someone else to take the pressure off yourself. Her name became synonymous with anything dumb or out of style. If a thing was unacceptable or ridiculous, the students called it \u201cFerny.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p4\" class=\"\">Young people can be so cruel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p5\" class=\"\">It was an annual tradition in the school to recognize the student who showed the most school spirit and support for the athletic teams. When the assembly came to honor that student, as expected, they called out the name of one of the more popular girls in the school. She bounced up the aisle smiling and waving to all her friends. But then a miracle happened. As she took the stage, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t accept this award. Yes, I have loved the teams and cheered for them at every game. But Fern has come to every game, too. I came in a nice, warm car surrounded by my happy friends. She came alone and walked all the way\u2014two and a half miles\u2014sometimes in the rain or snow. She had to sit by herself, but I don\u2019t know anyone who cheered with as much spirit as Fern. I would like to nominate her for the most enthusiastic student in the school.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p6\" class=\"\">Fern was escorted to the stage to a spontaneous standing ovation from her fellow students.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p7\" class=\"\">Youth can be so kind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p8\" class=\"\">Fern is a mature woman today, her hair streaked with gray.

To take the hand of another at the risk of your own popularity takes a mature, Christlike love. Yet our Savior made no distinction between young and old when he declared, \u201cAs I have loved you, \u2026 love one another.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29254\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29254)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29254)\">John 13:34<\/a><\/span>.) How desperately we need that kind of caring in our world today!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p12\" class=\"\">Young people are being hit on all sides by open and subtle attacks on their faith, their ideals, their morality, their self-confidence, even their identity. The typical teenager is pictured as being of the \u201cME\u201d generation: self-centered, turned inward, unfeeling toward others, seeking immediate self-gratification. Though some young people might fit that description, and many others are struggling and failing in the battle of life, others are winning in spectacular ways. Young men and women are accomplishing things today we used to assume it took a lifetime to do. In science, literature, the arts, social, civic, and spiritual work, we can point with pride to millions of talented teenagers who have set lofty goals and are working to attain them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p13\" class=\"\">The question is, How can we help those who are stumbling to lock arms with those who are striding confidently up the road of life?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cPositive peer pressure,\u201d as the social scientists call it, may be the salvation of this generation. If this be true, think how admirably suited our Aaronic Priesthood quorums and our Young Women classes are to offer such meaningful service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p15\" class=\"\">In her talk, Marianne said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cMost of us have a difficult time resisting those who have a genuine love for us. Such people have a way of becoming important to us because we know we are genuinely important to them. The cry of youth today is for genuine concern and for meaningful relationships with our peers. \u2026 And when I speak of meaningful relationships, I think immediately of the Golden Rule, \u2018Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cAs teenagers, that is a difficult thing to do. Charity for those outside of our circle of friends is difficult to comprehend when we feel so comfortable within the confines of our \u2018group.\u2019 But if we look at the life of our Savior, we see that He didn\u2019t leave His \u2018group,\u2019 the Apostles, or those friends about Him. He merely opened His arms to all who would listen. He increased His fold. So \u2026 we do not have to leave our group to learn to care for the feelings of our peers. We just need to open our arms and increase our friendships.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p18\" class=\"\">Marianne Mortensen was right on target.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p19\" class=\"\">There is another side to this matter of rendering service to others, not just to our peers, and it applies to those of us who are struggling to find our way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p20\" class=\"\">As a boy I sought happiness as the world measures it.

To my surprise, despite the discouragement, the disappointments, and the plain hard work associated with my missionary labors, I was happy. It was then I learned that happiness is really a by-product of service. As I forgot my own desires, my own weaknesses and frailties in my missionary service, I began to understand King Benjamin\u2019s profound counsel to his people. \u201cAnd behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40567\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40567)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40567)\">Mosiah 2:17<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p22\" class=\"\">That is why a missionary can return from the toughest experiences of his life and report, \u201cThese have been the happiest two years of my life!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p23\" class=\"\">A life can never be happy that is focused inward.

As they left the school, with mashed potatoes, gravy, and assorted vegetables in their hair and on their outfits, one girl, touched by the sweetness of the \u201cchild\u201d she had fed, said, \u201cI\u2019ll never forget Billy.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In a recent letter to the editor, I read:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cOne is continually hearing about the \u2018Terrible Teenagers\u2019 with their obnoxious dress and deplorable actions.

Brent Collette told a stirring story:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p39\" class=\"\">\u201cRonny was not just shy; he was downright backward. As a 17-year-old high school senior, Ronny had never really had a close friend or done anything that included other people. He was famous for his shyness. He never said anything to anybody, not even a teacher. One look at him told you a great deal of the story\u2014inferiority complex. He slumped over as if to hide his face and seemed to be always looking at his feet. He always sat in the back of the class and would never participate. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p40\" class=\"\">\u201cIt was because of Ronny\u2019s shyness that I was so astonished when he started coming to my Sunday School class. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p41\" class=\"\">\u201cHis attendance in my class was the result of the personal efforts of a classmate, Brandon Craig, who had recently befriended Ronny. Boy, if there had ever been a mismatch, this was it. Brandon was \u2018Mr. Social.\u2019 A good head taller than Ronny, he was undisputedly the number one star of our high school athletics program. Brandon was involved in everything and successful at everything. \u2026 He was just a neat boy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p42\" class=\"\">\u201cWell, Brandon took to little Ronny like glue. Class was obviously painful for Ronny, but Brandon protected him like the king\u2019s guard. I played a low profile\u2014no questions, just a quick smile and once a pat on the back. Time seemed to be helping, but I often wondered if Brandon and company (the rest of the class certainly played it right) would ever be able to break the ice. That\u2019s why I was so shocked when Brian, the class president, stood before our Sunday School class one Sunday afternoon and boldly announced that Ronny would offer the opening prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p43\" class=\"\">\u201cThere was a moment of hesitation; then Ronny slowly came to his feet. Still looking at his shoes, he walked to the front of the room. He folded his arms (his head was already bowed.) The class was frozen solid. I thought to myself, \u2018If he does it, we\u2019ll all be translated.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p44\" class=\"\">\u201cThen almost at a whisper I heard, \u2018Our Father in Heaven, thank you for our Sunday School class.\u2019 Then silence\u2014long, loud silence!

I opened an eye and looked up to make my way to Ronny. But Brandon beat me to it. With an eye still open I watched six-foot-four Brandon put his arm around his friend, bend down and put his chin on Ronny\u2019s shoulder, then whisper the words of a short, sweet prayer. Ronny struggled for composure, then repeated the prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p47\" class=\"\">\u201cBut when the prayer was over, Ronny kept his head bowed and added: \u2018Thank you for Brandon, amen.\u2019 He then turned and looked up at his big buddy and said clear enough for all to hear, \u2018I love you, Brandon.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/as-i-have-loved-you.p48\" class=\"\">\u201cBrandon, who still had his arm around him, responded, \u2018I love you too, Ronny.
