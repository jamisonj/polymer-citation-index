One of our daughters had a golden investigator named JieLei. This young adult woman obeyed each new commandment she was taught, no matter how difficult. She was a student struggling to make ends meet financially, but she began paying her tithing when she learned about that law. Her part-time job required her to work on Sunday, but she had the courage to ask her employer if he could change her hours to another day so that she could attend sacrament meeting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/stand-as-a-witness.p8\" class=\"\">In spite of her diligence, JieLei still did not have a firm testimony of the Book of Mormon. Our daughter and her companion knew that she needed a witness from the Spirit to confirm its truth, so they prepared a lesson for her about the Holy Ghost. As they worked on it, somehow it didn\u2019t feel quite right. When they prayed about it, they felt impressed to go a different direction, to give a lesson instead about Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/stand-as-a-witness.p9\" class=\"\">When the appointed meeting came, these missionaries began teaching JieLei about Jesus Christ. Tears started streaming down her cheeks. She kept asking, \u201cWhat is this I am feeling?\u201d Then they bore witness to her that it was the Spirit. Exactly what they had wanted to have happen did happen. It was then that our daughter remembered that one of the great roles of the Holy Ghost is as a testifier of Christ. Jesus Himself said, \u201cThe Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, \u2026 shall testify of me.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-02205_000_041\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"51661\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51661)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51661)\">John 14:26<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51663\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51663)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51663)\">15:26<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Our daughter realized that as she stood as a witness of Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost confirmed it.

One refused to watch a pornographic movie at a friend\u2019s house when he was only 11; another refused to look with classmates at pornographic magazines. Both were ostracized socially for some time thereafter. Another child refused to succumb to bad, crass, vulgar language in her work environment. One refused liquor that his friend had stolen out of his parents\u2019 locked cabinet. Another, who was the only Latter-day Saint member in her class, stood to give an English-class presentation and ended up fielding questions about the Book of Mormon.

When she opened it, there were two men in white shirts and ties, and one of them introduced himself as her bishop. He said that as he was praying, he had felt inspired to ask her to teach Young Women. She told him that she had been baptized at age 10 but had never been active. He seemed undeterred as he showed her the manual and explained where they met on Wednesday night. Then she emphatically said, \u201cI can\u2019t teach 16-year-olds; I\u2019m inactive, and besides I smoke.\u201d Then he said, \u201cYou won\u2019t be inactive anymore, and you have until Wednesday to quit smoking.\u201d Then he left.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/stand-as-a-witness.p22\" class=\"\">She said, \u201cI remember shouting in the air in anger, but then I couldn\u2019t resist the urge to read the manual.

I had never been scared of anything before. I had grown up in the slums, been in detention once myself, and rescued my father from the \u2018drunk tank.\u2019 And all of a sudden there I was at Mutual being introduced as the new Laurel adviser. I sat before two Laurels and gave the lesson word for word, even the parts that said \u2018Now ask them\u00a0\u2026\u2019 I left immediately after the lesson and cried all the way home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/stand-as-a-witness.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cA few days later there was another knock at the door, and I thought, \u2018Good.

They invited me to go to church with them on Sunday, which I did. I liked those girls. They began by teaching me about the Church, the ward, the class.
