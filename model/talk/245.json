Petersen, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1946, pp. 167-172<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI rejoice with you in the return of our Latter-day Saint Servicemen from their many\nassignments overseas. I am grateful for the strength they will bring to us in our various\norganizations in the wards and stakes. I sincerely hope that every returning Latter-day Saint\nserviceman will resume his activity in the Church without delay.\n<\/p><p>\nCONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR SERVICEMEN\n<\/p><p>\nThese servicemen have accomplished some great things during the last few years. They have\nrendered great service to the Church and likewise to their country. In the main, they have\nbeen true to the standards they have been taught. I am sure they have been loyal and patriotic,\nfighting in defense of freedom. It has been a great sacrifice for our one hundred thousand\nservicemen under the Stars and Stripes, to leave their homes and schools, their work, and their\nfamilies. But it has been a greater sacrifice for those who have borne the brunt of battle, for\nmany of our boys have been wounded, some of them severely. Some of our boys are blind;\nsome have suffered severe nervous and mental injuries; and there are those among them who\nwill never walk again.\n<\/p><p>\nMany have died. We at <i>The Deseret News<\/i> have endeavored to determine about how many\nLatter-day Saint servicemen were killed in the war. Our study is as yet incomplete, but if we\nwere to estimate the total for the whole Church, based upon the figures that have thus far\nbeen compiled, the number of Latter-day Saint servicemen who have given their lives in this\nwar would exceed five thousand. Our hearts go out in deepest sympathy to the families thus\nbereft.\n<\/p><p>\nThose boys fought and died that their families at home might enjoy peace and safety. They\ndied, also, in the cause of freedom, in the cause of free agency, freedom of action, free\nenterprise if you please. In spite of the sacrifices these boys have made, together with the\nthousands of other Americans who have died in defense of liberty, there are still those in our\nland to whom freedom means nothing. There are influences and movements and groups and\norganizations within the borders of the United States which today, if they could, would rob us\nall of our free agency.\n<\/p><p>\nLatter-day Saints, of all people, should stand firm in defense of freedom. Free agency has a\nspecial meaning to us. We know that without free agency there would be no progress. We all\nknow that the gospel itself is based upon the principle of free agency. Yet there are some\namong us who have allowed themselves to slip to one side or the other, and they need to\nreorient themselves in line with the divine revelations we have received concerning the\nprinciple of freedom.\n<\/p><p>\nAMERICA, A LAND OF DESTINY\n<\/p><p>\nLet us look for a moment at one or two of the phases of freedom that are so important to us.\nMost of us believe that America is a promised land, a land of destiny, and so it is. But what\nis that destiny?\n<\/p><p>\nAnciently, the Lord made it known that the gospel would be restored in these last days; that it\nshould come forth after a period of apostasy and that it should come forth upon this land of\nAmerica. It was necessary that the gospel should come forth under a free form\nof government in order that the modern people of God could carry on their\nwork without regimentation or restriction, and, therefore, God dedicated America to freedom.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Savior was among the Nephites, he predicted the coming forth of the Gentiles upon\nthis land; he told about the coming forth of the gospel itself and said: \"For it is wisdom in the\nFather that they [the Gentiles] should be established in this land, and be set up as a free\npeople by the power of the Father, that these things\"&mdash;meaning the gospel principles&mdash;\"might\ncome forth from them,\" that is, from the believing of the Gentiles, \"unto a remnant of your\nseed, that the covenant of the Father may be fulfilled which he hath covenanted with his\npeople, O house of Israel\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5468\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5468)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5468)\">3 Ne. 21:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFREEDOM ESSENTIAL FOR RESTORATION OF GOSPEL\n<\/p><p>\nNote that language if you will. The Gentiles were to come forth upon this land of America.\nThey were to be set up as a free people. They were to be thus established by the power of the\nFather, and the purpose of it all was that the gospel might come forth and be preached to the\nchildren of men in order that God could fulfill the covenant that he had made \"with his\npeople, O house of Israel.\" And why was freedom so necessary in connection with the\nrestoration of the gospel and its promulgation among the children of men? In order that those\nto whom the gospel would be restored might have the freedom of speech to preach the gospel;\nthe freedom of the press to publish the gospel; freedom of assembly so they could gather\ntogether in congregations and worship the Lord; and religious freedom so that they could\nworship God according to the dictates of their own conscience.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Joseph F. Smith discussed this subject in this way:\n<\/p><p>\nThis great American nation the Almighty raised up by the power of his omnipotent hand, that\nit might be possible in the latter day for the kingdom of God to be established in the earth. If\nthe Lord had not prepared the way by laying the foundations of this glorious nation, it would\nhave been impossible (under the stringent laws and bigotry of the monarchical governments of\nthe world) to have laid the foundations for the coming of his great kingdom\n(<i>Gospel Doctrine<\/i>, p. 409).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd along the same line, President Brigham Young said:\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe that the Lord has been preparing that when he should bring forth his work, that,\nwhen the set time should fully come, there might be a place upon his footstool where\nsufficient liberty of conscience should exist, that his Saints might dwell in peace under the\nbroad panoply of constitutional law and equal rights. In this view we consider that the men in\nthe Revolution were inspired by the Almighty to throw off the shackles of the mother\ngovernment, with her established religion. For this cause were Adams, Jefferson, Franklin,\nWashington, and a host of others inspired to deeds of resistance to the acts\nof the King of Great Britain (<i>Discourses<\/i>, p. 359).\n<\/p><p>\nSo Spoke Brigham Young.\n<\/p><p>\nDid our American colonist feel that they were assisted by the Almighty in winning\nindependence from their mother country? They certainly did and so expressed themselves.\nAmong them was George Washington who, in the inaugural address he delivered on April 30,\n1789, said this:\n<\/p><p>\nNo people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the\naffairs of men more than those of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced\nto the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of\nProvidential agency.\n<\/p><p>\nCONSTITUTION WRITTEN UNDER INSPIRATION\n<\/p><p>\nBut merely to be given their independence did not mean that they were set up as a new\nnation. A government must be established. Did God follow through and fulfill the prophecy in\nthe Book of Mormon as uttered by his Beloved Son to the Nephites? He did by raising up and\ninspiring the men who drafted the form of government for this land. He inspired those men to\nwrite the Constitution of the United States and that Constitution is the means by which God\nwrote into the law of this land the principles of free agency. So the Lord said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another. And for this purpose\nhave I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up\nunto this very purpose (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12294\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12294)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12294)\">D&amp;C 101:79-80<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd, furthermore, not only did the Lord raise up these men and inspire them to write free\nagency into the government of this land, but he declared his intention that the elders of this\nChurch should defend that Constitution and the freedoms and the rights allowed us in that\ngreat document. And so he said, \"that law of the land, which is constitutional,\" and I call your\nattention to the phraseology:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . that law of the land which is constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in\nmaintaining the fights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is justifiable before me.\nTherefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my church, in befriending that law\nwhich is the constitutional law of the land; And as pertaining to law of man, whatsoever is\nmore or less than this, cometh of evil\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12287\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12287)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12287)\">D&amp;C 98:5-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn regard to that last sentence, it is my interpretation that laws which are not in harmony with\nthe principle of free agency and therefore not in harmony with the spirit of the Constitution,\n\"cometh of evil.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen the Lord continues:\n<\/p><p>\nI, the Lord God, make you free, therefore ye are free indeed: and the law&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nthat is the constitutional law&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nalso maketh you free. Nevertheless, when the wicked rule the people mourn\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12288\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12288)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12288)\">D&amp;C 98:8-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOUR OBLIGATION TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so the Lord seems to teach us that it is a part of our religion to preserve and fight for\nand defend the Constitution of the United States with all its rights and freedoms as provided\ntherein. It was with this thought in mind that President Heber J. Grant said:\n<\/p><p>\nFrom my childhood days I have understood that we believe absolutely that the Constitution of\nour country is an inspired instrument, and that God directed those who created it and those\nwho defended the independence of this nation. Concerning this matter it is my frequent\npleasure to quote the statement by Joseph Smith, regarding the Constitution: \"The Constitution\nof the United States is a glorious standard; it is founded in the wisdom of God. It is a\nheavenly banner; it is, to all those who are privileged with the sweets of liberty, like the\ncooling shades and refreshing waters of a great rock in a weary and thirsty land. It is like a\ngreat tree under whose branches men from every clime can be shielded from the burning rays\nof the sun.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen, President Grant continues, after quoting the Prophet:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd such the Constitution of the United States must be to every faithful Latter-day Saint who\nlives under its protection (<i>Gospel Standards<\/i>, pp. 128-129).\n<\/p><p>\nBrigham Young also believed that it was part of our religion to defend the Constitution of the\nUnited States. Said he:\n<\/p><p>\nWe mean to sustain the Constitution of the United States and all righteous laws. We will cling\nto the Constitution of our country, and to the government that reveres that sacred charter of\nfreemen's rights; and it necessary, pour out our best blood for the defense of every good and\nrighteous principle.\n<\/p><p>\nHe continues:\n<\/p><p>\nTo accuse us of being unfriendly to the Government, is to accuse us of hostility to our\nreligion, for no item of inspiration is held more sacred with us than the Constitution under\nwhich she acts (<i>Discourses<\/i>, pp. 358-359).\n<\/p><p>\nAt another time, with this same thought in mind, Brigham Young again spoke and said:\n<\/p><p>\nHow long will it be before the words of the prophet Joseph will be fulfilled? He said if the\nConstitution of the United States were saved at all it must be done by this people. It will not\nbe many years before these words come to pass. When the Constitution of the United States\nhangs, as it were, upon a single thread, they will have to call for the \"Mormon Elders to save\nit from utter destruction; and they will step forth and do it. . . . if it is sustained on this land\nof Joseph, it will be done by us and our posterity (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, pp. 360-361).\n<\/p><p>\nDIVINE PRINCIPLE OF FREE AGENCY\n<\/p><p>\nI appeal to every Latter-day Saint to accept the divine principle of free\nagency and to adopt it in his life. I appeal to you to remember this principle when you are\nconfronted by organizations and groups and movements in this country, which are now arising\nand assuming great power. Before you become engulfed in them, measure their practices and\ntheir purposes by the measuring rod of free agency, and you remember that God said it is not\nright that any man should be in bondage one to another\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12293\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12293)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12293)\">D&amp;C 101:79<\/a><\/span>). Remember, also, what Richard Evans\ntold you yesterday, that it is not right that we should be commanded in all things\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12255\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12255)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12255)\">D&amp;C 58:26<\/a><\/span>), and don't\nyou allow yourself to be commanded in all things by any group or agency. You preserve the\nfree agency that God has given to you, because if you don't you will suffer all the days of\nyour life.\n<\/p><p>\nYou remember that you are to be true to the Constitution of the United States. I appeal to you\nto accept as the word of God, the declaration that appears in the revelation in section one\nhundred one of the D&amp;C, wherein the Lord says he did raise up men and inspired them to\nwrite the Constitution (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12295\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12295)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12295)\">D&amp;C 101:80<\/a><\/span>).\nI appeal to you, every one, to be true to the trust that God has placed\nin you, to preach the gospel throughout the world, as has been declared here today. But\nremember that you cannot preach that gospel without freedom of speech, and you cannot\npublish that gospel without freedom of the press, and you cannot gather together in\ncongregations without freedom of assembly, and you cannot worship the Lord your God\naccording to the dictates of your own conscience\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6616\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6616)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6616)\">A of F 1:11<\/a><\/span>)\nwithout freedom of religion. And remember\nthat every time you give up any of your freedoms, whether it be to some economic or\npolitical group, or to any other group, you jeopardize these four freedoms of which I have\nspoken.\n<\/p><p>\nI appeal to you to accept as the word of God that which I have quoted to you which says that\nyou, the elders of Israel, are justified by God in defending your constitutional privileges. I\nappeal to you to be true to your one hundred thousand sons who have fought for liberty, to\nthe eight thousand of your sons who have been wounded and bled in battle. Do not betray the\nfive thousand Latter-day Saint boys who died that freedom might live. Remember that you\nhave a responsibility to preserve freedom in America. Remember always the glorious prayer\nthat is written into the last stanza of \"America\" which was sung so beautifully this morning by\nthe Tabernacle choir.\n<\/p><p>\nOur father's God! to thee, <br \/>\nAuthor of liberty,<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;        To thee we sing; <br \/>\nLong may our land be bright <br \/>\nWith freedom's holy light! <br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;        Protect us by thy might Great God, our King.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that we may have the courage and the wisdom to accept the truth, that the truth may\nkeep us free (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27235\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27235)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27235)\">John 8:32<\/a><\/span>),\nand I ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
