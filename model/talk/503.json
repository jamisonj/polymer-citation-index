My soul has been subdued and my heart made tender through\nthe passing of our great leader, President George Albert Smith. I have mingled feelings of\nhumility, sadness, and gratitude, at the passing of a prophet of God. All Israel, I am sure, has\nbeen weeping. And yet, back of it all has been a feeling of thanksgiving for the life of this\ngreat man. The Lord said in this dispensation: \n<\/p><p>\nThou shalt live together in love, insomuch that thou shalt weep for the loss of them\nthat die . . . (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12885\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12885)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12885)\">D&amp;C 42:45<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so it is fitting that we should have sadness in our hearts and should weep at the passing\nof one we love, and one whom the Lord loves and has magnified. He was a man without\nguile, and as President McKay said this morning, with Christlike attributes.\n<\/p><p>\n\"A REAL MAN\"\n<\/p><p>\nSince Wednesday night there have been going through my heart and through my mind, these\nlines under the caption, \"A Real Man\": \n<\/p><p>\nMen are of two kinds, and he<br \/>\nWas of the kind I'd like to be.<br \/>\nSome preach their virtues, and a few<br \/>\nExpress their lives by what they do.<br \/>\nThat sort was he. No flowery phrase<br \/>\nOr glibly spoken words of praise<br \/>\nWon friends for him. He wasn't cheap<br \/>\nOr shallow, but his course ran deep,<br \/>\nAnd it was pure. You know the kind.<br \/>\nNot many in a life you find<br \/>\nWhose deeds outrun their words so far<br \/>\nThat more than what they seem, they are.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are two kinds of lies as well: <br \/>\nThe kind you live, the ones you tell.<br \/>\nBack through his years from age to youth<br \/>\nHe never acted one untruth.<br \/>\nOut in the open light he fought<br \/>\nAnd didn't care what others thought<br \/>\nNor what they said about his fight.<br \/>\nIf he believed that he was right.<br \/>\nThe only deeds he ever hid<br \/>\nWere acts of kindness that he did.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat speech he had was plain and blunt.<br \/>\nHis was an unattractive front.<br \/>\nYet children loved him; babe and boy<br \/>\nPlayed with the strength he could employ<br \/>\nWithout one fear, and they are fleet<br \/>\nTo sense injustice and deceit.<br \/>\nNo backdoor gossip linked his name<br \/>\nWith any shady tale of shame.<br \/>\nHe did not have to compromise<br \/>\nWith evil-doers, shrewd and wise,<br \/>\nAnd let them ply their vicious trade<br \/>\nBecause of some past escapade.\n<\/p><p>\nMen are of two kinds, and he<br \/>\nWas of the kind I'd like to be.<br \/>\nNo door at which he ever knocked<br \/>\nAgainst his manly form was locked.<br \/>\nIf ever man on earth was free<br \/>\nAnd independent, it was he.<br \/>\nNo broken pledge lost him respect,<br \/>\nHe met all men with head erect,<br \/>\nAnd when he passed I think there went<br \/>\nA soul to yonder firmament<br \/>\nSo white, so splendid, and so fine<br \/>\nIt came almost to God's design.\n<\/p><p>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;              &mdash;Edgar A. Guest<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Used by kind permission of the author. Copyright, Detroit <i>Free Press<\/i>.)\n<\/p><p>\nTRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT SMITH\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless the memory of President George Albert Smith. I am grateful beyond my words of\nexpression for the close association which I have had with him in the last few years. I am\ngrateful that my family has lived in the same ward and has come under the benign influence\nof his sweet spirit. I shall never cease to be grateful for the visits he made to my home while\nI was serving as a humble missionary in the nations of war-torn Europe at the end of World\nWar II. Particularly am I thankful for a visit in the still of the night when our little one lay at\ndeath's door. Without any announcement, President Smith found time to come into that home\nand place his hands upon the head of that little one, held in her mother's arms as she had\nbeen for many hours, and promise her complete recovery. This was President Smith, he\nalways had time to help, particularly those who were sick, those who needed him most.\n<\/p><p>\nLast Monday evening at the Lion House, there was held a party for those who had served on\nthe general boards of M.I.A. in years past under the leadership of Brother George Q. Morris\nand Sister Lucy Grant Cannon. It was to have been an April Fool party, a fun party, but the\ngathering turned out to be a spontaneous meeting of tribute to the man who, probably as\nmuch as any other who has ever lived, inspired and loved the youth of Zion. I wish you could\nhave heard the tribute paid by dear Sister Ruth May Fox, ninety-seven years of age, as she\nstood on her feet and bore testimony to the worth of President Smith and the inspiration\nwhich he has been to the youth of Zion through all the days of his life.\n<\/p><p>\nI wish you could have sat with me the past two years in close association with the National\nExecutive Board of the Boy Scouts of America and heard leaders of industry, financiers,\nbusiness executives, and leaders in the professions speak of the fine life of President George\nAlbert Smith. Their first words after greeting were usually, \"How is my good friend, George\nAlbert Smith?\" Many of them would add, \"A man of God, if there ever was one.\" Then as we\nparted they often said, \"Take my love and greetings to President George Albert Smith.\" He\nloved all men. They reciprocated that love. What an example he has set for us all, my\nbrothers and sisters, in this spirit of love, fellowship, and brotherhood!\n<\/p><p>\nSAVING OF SOULS\n<\/p><p>\nHis great objective has been to help save the souls of the children of men. You remember, the\nLord said to the Prophet Joseph: \n<\/p><p>\nRemember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God; \n<\/p><p>\nFor, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered\nthe pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12873\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12873)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12873)\">D&amp;C 18:10-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord said to Moses: \n<\/p><p>\nFor behold, this is my work and my glory&mdash;to bring to pass the immortality and\neternal life of man (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38989\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38989)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38989)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis is our first interest as a Church&mdash;to build character, to save and exalt the souls of the\nchildren of men. President Smith was interested in this project above all others. He realized\nthat in the youth of Zion there must be established real character as the one thing they can\ntake with them into the world to come; that they must prepare themselves here for exaltation.\nI am grateful that he had faith in them. I am grateful for the inspiration that he brought to the\nyouth of Zion. Yes, we do have faith in them. We have faith that they will carry on, that they\nwill measure up, that they will maintain the standards of the past, the standards of their\nparents and their grandparents. It often would grieve President Smith when he would hear\npeople discredit the youth of the Church and suggest at one time that what they need is a few\nmore models and not so many critics.\n<\/p><p>\nI have faith in the youth of Israel, my brothers and sisters, inspired in large measure by\nPresident Smith. I have seen them in action, as you have. I rejoice to see our missionaries go\nout into the world, to meet them on the street corners and hear them bearing testimony to the\ntruth of this great latter-day work. I thrill as I see them in action on the basketball floor. I\nthrilled with them as they received what was probably the last telegram which President Smith\nsent, which went to our B. Y. U. basketball boys back in Madison Square Garden. I am\nstirred as I see our boys out in the service of their country, maintaining the standards of the\nChurch and living the gospel in the face of temptation, sin, and evil all around them.\n<\/p><p>\nCOMMENTS OF CHAPLAIN\n<\/p><p>\nI recall an incident which occurred shortly after World War II. With the president of the\nNorthwestern States Mission, I was making a tour of that mission, and we were up in Alaska.\nWhile there we visited one of the camps and held a meeting with our servicemen in the little\narmy chapel. I noted as the service progressed that sitting down in the far corner of the\nbuilding at a table was a Protestant chaplain. Apparently, he was trying to give the impression\nthat he was working, but we could tell he was listening to every word that was said in that\nservice. This one group of servicemen led the singing, offered the prayers, administered the\nsacred emblems and bore testimony. As we finished our meeting and were leaving the\nbuilding, I went over to the chaplain to express gratitude for the use of the building. As I did\nso, he said in substance, \"I wonder if you realize the kind of young men you have represented\nhere in this camp. They are truly a marvelous group of boys.\" Then he went on to say, \"They\ndon't need a chaplain; any one of them could take my place.\" I thanked him for the\ncompliment and started leaving when he added, \"One other thing. I have two boys of my\nown&mdash;eleven and thirteen&mdash;and you know, I couldn't wish anything better for them than that\nwhen they grow a little older, they become members of your Church and develop into the\nkind of young manhood I have seen represented here in your group of Mormon boys.\"\n<\/p><p>\nFAITH IN YOUTH\n<\/p><p>\nMy brethren and sisters, it is my conviction that the finest group of young people that this\nworld has ever known anything about has been born under the covenant into the homes of\nLatter-day Saint parents. I have a feeling that in many cases at least these choice spirits have\nbeen held back to come forth in this day and age when the gospel is upon the earth in its\nfullness, and that they have great responsibilities in establishing the kingdom. I presume that\nno generation has faced more serious difficulties than they face. They live in an age which\nseems to question all the standards of the past, and which is discarding many of those\nstandards. Yes, they live in a period when even some spiritual leaders, so-called, point out\nthat the question of smoking, drinking, and carousing has no relationship to salvation, that\nthese are personal matters.\n<\/p><p>\nI have the conviction that these young people, if they have the benefit and blessing of the full\nprogram of the Church, are going to come through, in spite of the temptations, with colors\nflying in a way that will make us proud of them. However, they will need more than material\nthings. They are going to need more than real estate, stocks and bonds, life insurance, or even\ndemocracy. They are going to need a sane spiritual foundation, if they endure, if they are\ngoing to be able to live clean and to maintain the standards of the Church. God expects great\nthings of them. He expects them to develop into noble characters, into good\ncitizens&mdash;citizens which may eventually provide in part, at least, the leaven which may help to save this\ngreat nation. He expects them to live clean even in a wicked world. He expects them to grow\nup with a testimony of the gospel. He expects these young men to live so that they can\nreceive the holy Melchizedek Priesthood and so that eventually they can be married in the\ntemple of God to worthy companions for time and eternity. He also expects them to know the\nglorious blessings of honorable parenthood and eventually to be exalted in the celestial\nkingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nCHURCH PROGRAM\n<\/p><p>\nI am convinced, my brethren and sisters, that we have in the Church the finest program\navailable anywhere to help bring about these objectives, if our children are only put in touch\nwith this program. I am thinking now of the blessings which come to our children in the full\nand rich program of the Primary. They have just held a convention here on this block. Are we\nmissing any of our children? Is the Primary program reaching them? And the same with the\nSunday School. Are our children in Sunday School? Are they being taught the gospel in the\nSunday School classes? Are our boys and girls attending M.I.A.? Are our boys receiving and\nenjoying the rich blessings of the program provided through the scouting and Explorer\nprogram? Are they being ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood, and are they active in the rich\nprogram which is provided?\n<\/p><p>\nTITHING\n<\/p><p>\nI know that the one great reason why President Smith has been so active for many years in\nthe scouting program is the fact that the ideals of scouting follow closely the ideals of the\nChurch. The scouting program is not a substitute for the Aaronic Priesthood program. The\nmost important possession that a boy can have is the Aaronic Priesthood. But scouting is a\nsupplementary, a complementary program. It works hand in hand with the program of the\nPrimary Sunday School, and the Aaronic Priesthood, and is an important and vital part of our\nprogram for our boys.\n<\/p><p>\nScouting is dedicated to a four-fold program: First, it teaches the boy his duty to\nGod&mdash;reverence, observance of the Sabbath, and the maintenance of the spiritual standards and\nideals of his Church. Second, it teaches duty to country&mdash;true patriotism&mdash;a love for the\nconstitution, for our free institutions and our American way of life. I was thrilled as I stood in\nValley Forge last summer facing over forty-seven thousand representative boys as they saw\ndepicted before their eyes that terrible winter of 1777-8 when Washington and his bedraggled\nforces all but perished there in Valley Forge. These boys' hearts were touched as they saw the\nfather of their country leave his troops and go off into the trees in the snow and bow in\nhumble prayer before the Almighty that this young nation might be preserved. This was part\nof the two-year Boy Scout theme to \"Strengthen the Arm of Liberty.\" Third, it teaches the\nvalue of service to others&mdash;willing, unselfish service, and that the greatest among them must\nbe the servant of all&mdash;symbolized by the \"good turn.\" Fourth, it teaches duty to self&mdash;that\nthey must keep themselves physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight. They must\nbe prepared for any eventuality to serve themselves, their Church, and their country.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is held up before them the Scout oath and the Scout laws, which focus attention on\nthose things that are worth while&mdash;that a Scout must be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly,\ncourteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, reverent. To be a good scout he must\nbe faithful in his religious duties. Scouting provides a program of training and experience. It\nis a program for character development. It is a supplementary educational program, a program\nof citizenship training and vocational exploration. Many boys have found their vocations\nthrough this program&mdash;through the 111 merit badges which are concentrated courses in\nvocational guidance in fifteen different active fields. Scouting teaches boys the crafts and the\nskills and to do something useful with their hands.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, in view of the richness of the scouting program and the fact that these ideals coincide\nwith the ideals of the Church, President Smith has urged our full support in these words:\n\"<i>It is my desire to see scouting extended to every boy in the Church<\/i>.\" Under his leadership and\ninspiration the Church has moved forward to an enviable position with something over 2290\nscouting and Explorer units, an increase of 180 during this past calendar year. But there are\nstill approximately fifteen percent of our boys who are not enjoying the benefits of the\nscouting and Explorer program.\n<\/p><p>\nLEADERSHIP NEEDED\n<\/p><p>\nOne of our great needs, of course, is effective leadership. Some of our boys are not being\nreached by this program. Some are not being reached by the Aaronic Priesthood program.\nSome of them are missing the benefits and blessings of Primary. It is largely a question of\nleadership. Boys want the scouting program, we want them to have it; and if we have the\nright kind of leadership through real boys' men, they'll have it, enjoy it, and receive the\nblessings which come from the program. The responsibility rests with the priesthood&mdash;stake\npresidencies and bishoprics&mdash;to see that this leadership is provided and that every boy is\nreached.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, my brothers and sisters, we have a well-rounded program for the youth of the\nChurch. And we are not dealing with ordinary young people. We are working with choice\nspirits who need the full Church program. We want them to have the benefit of this program\nin its fullness, that they might develop into the kind of young men and young women which\nthe Lord would have them become. Of course, these programs are not ends in themselves.\nThey are tools. They are a means to an end. The end is the salvation and exaltation of God's\nchildren.\n<\/p><p>\nBut these programs are not optional programs. They are the youth program of the Church,\napproved by the leadership thereof. May God bless us, my brethren and sisters, that as leaders\nin Israel we may have the power and the inspiration to make our young people want to enjoy\nthe full program of the Church offered through the Sunday School, the Primary, the M.I.A.,\nand the Aaronic Priesthood program, that they might eventually meet the expectations of their\nparents, their Church leaders, and our Heavenly Father. God bless us to this end. God bless\nthe youth of Israel everywhere, that they may grow and develop into sterling characters,\nfaithful and true to this great latter-day work, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
