The sun was scorching the highway to the point that the heat waves became visible. Nevertheless, I was confident and comfortable because I had just purchased a brand-new car, fresh from the factory, with a big motor and plenty of power to conquer the elements and allow me to travel briskly in air-conditioned comfort.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p4\" class=\"\">Suddenly, I noticed that the temperature in my new car had begun to climb and the big motor began to show signs of strain. When the temperature gauge got to the danger point, I pulled the car over to the side of the road in the hope that with my very limited knowledge of mechanics I could discover what was wrong with the car. I must admit I was rather disgusted to think that something could stop my big new car. It wasn\u2019t long after I had lifted the hood that I discovered, to my amazement, that a myriad of colorful little butterflies had collected on the radiator, choked off the cooling process, and stopped the car. I was then struck with the realization of how a few hundred little butterflies, in their collective strength, could master the immense horsepower of the motor. No, it wasn\u2019t an eagle, a hawk, or anything else more or less justifiable, but just a couple hundred little butterflies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p5\" class=\"\">This incident made me think about what often happens in our own lives. I thought about the tremendous potential that exists in each one of us, potential that can direct us to eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p6\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph Smith said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cHere, then, is eternal life\u2014to know the only wise and true God; and you have got to learn how to be Gods yourselves, and to be kings and priests to God, the same as all Gods have done before you, namely, by going from one small degree to another, and from a small capacity to a great one; from grace to grace, from exaltation to exaltation, until you attain to the resurrection of the dead, and are able to dwell in everlasting burnings, and to sit in glory, as do those who sit enthroned in everlasting power. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p8\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 [You] shall be heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ.

This commandment involves much more than just resting from our labors. Keeping the Sabbath day holy inherently builds spiritual character and prepares us for what is to come. By observing this commandment, we will have power over evil; we will be more capable of keeping the commandments of the Lord and maintaining ourselves unspotted from the sins of the world.

The sacred covenant made by the members of the Church at baptism should be the prevailing thought and feeling in our hearts and minds as we partake of the sacrament. If we can achieve this, we will always have the Spirit of the Lord with us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p14\" class=\"\">No member of the Church can ignore or simply put aside the weekly renewal of this covenant and pretend to maintain the Spirit. If we really understand the purpose of our sacrament meetings, we will attend them not just to hear someone speak, which is of course important, but to renew the sacred covenants made with our Father in Heaven in the name of his son, Jesus Christ. Those who make a habit of not attending this weekly service, and fail to repent, put in great danger their spiritual stability and welfare.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p15\" class=\"\">Have we ever stopped to think what it means to our salvation when we neglect prayer, or don\u2019t develop daily from our prayers repeatedly gratifying experiences?

The raised hand becomes a symbol of the covenant we make to support them. Each time we criticize or condemn them, we become literally covenant breakers. President Joseph F. Smith made the following comment about this problem:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cThe moment a man says he will not submit to the legally constituted authority of the Church, whether it be the teachers, the bishopric, the high council, his quorum, or the First Presidency, and in his heart confirms it and carries it out, that moment he cuts himself off from the privileges and blessings of the Priesthood and Church, and severs himself from the people of God, for he ignores the authority that the Lord has instituted in his Church.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Doctrine,<\/span> 5th ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939, p. 45.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p21\" class=\"\">I have had innumerable experiences listening to the reasons people have for not paying their tithing, most of which are just cases of a simple lack of faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p22\" class=\"\">I remember once in 1957, while I was acting as a new president of a branch in Argentina, I decided to interview the members with respect to the importance of paying tithing. I found myself talking with one good brother of the branch whose name was Jose, who had difficulty paying his tithing. I asked him bluntly, \u201cBrother Jose, why don\u2019t you pay your tithing?\u201d I\u2019m sure Jose didn\u2019t expect me to be so direct.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p23\" class=\"\">After a moment of silence he responded: \u201cAs you know, President, I have two children. The wage of a laborer is very low. This month I have to buy my children shoes to go to school; and, mathematically, I just don\u2019t have enough money.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p24\" class=\"\">In an instant response, I said, \u201cJose, I promise you that if you pay your tithing faithfully, your children will have their shoes to go to school, and you will be able to pay for all the needs of your home. I don\u2019t know how he will do it, but the Lord always keeps his promises. Besides that,\u201d I added, \u201cIf you still find that you don\u2019t have enough money, I will give you back what you paid in tithing from my own pocket.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p25\" class=\"\">On the way home, I wondered if what I had done was the right thing. Here I was, recently married, just getting started in my career, and faced with my own economic problems. I began to worry about my own shoes, let alone those of Jose\u2019s family! Even though when I got home my dear wife wholeheartedly supported me and reassured me that everything would be all right, I must say that that night nobody prayed harder for Brother Jose\u2019s economic welfare than I did.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p26\" class=\"\">One month later, I once again sat down with Jose. Though the tears in his eyes almost made it impossible for him to speak, he said: \u201cPresident, it is incredible. I paid my tithing; I was able to meet all of my obligations, and I even purchased the new shoes for my children, all without an increase in my wage. I know that the Lord keeps his promises!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p27\" class=\"\">Jose remains to this day a faithful tithe payer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p28\" class=\"\">Up until now, I have mentioned only a few of the problems arising from the little \u201cbutterflies\u201d that we find in our eternal pathway. Of course, there are many more. We could mention, for example, the lack of self-control that leads many people to break the Word of Wisdom; the various excuses for not complying with the program of personal and family preparedness; the lack of encouragement and the apathy with regard to our genealogical responsibilities; the failure to return often to the temples of the Lord to do the necessary work for our kindred dead; in some cases the lack of interest, in other cases the fear, that precludes many from participating in missionary work. These are only examples of a list that goes on and on.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-little-things-and-eternal-life.p29\" class=\"\">It is highly probable that we will never lose our status as members of the Church simply for not adhering to one or more of the aforementioned commandments.
