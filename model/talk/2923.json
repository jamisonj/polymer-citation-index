It goes like this: \u201cGod moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform.\u201d I would like to refer today to a few of the wonders that the Lord has performed and is performing in order to prepare for that glorious coming of His Only Begotten Son as the prophets have foretold. I may repeat some of the things that have been said in this conference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/god-moves-in-a-mysterious-way-his-wonders-to-perform.p9\" class=\"\">I first refer to the statement of Malachi when the Lord, speaking through the prophet Malachi, said that He would send His messenger to prepare the way for His coming, and that He would come swiftly to His temple; and who could abide the day of His coming, because He would be as refiner\u2019s fire and fullers\u2019 soap.

Now obviously that had no reference to His first coming, when He was born as a humble babe in Bethlehem, for He didn\u2019t come to His temple swiftly, and He didn\u2019t come cleansing or purifying. But we are told that when He comes in the latter days the wicked will cry out to the rocks, \u201cFall on us, and hide us \u2026 from the wrath of the Lamb.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42498\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42498)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42498)\">Rev. 6:16<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/god-moves-in-a-mysterious-way-his-wonders-to-perform.p10\" class=\"\">Obviously, when the Lord sends a messenger to prepare the way before Him, that messenger can be none other than a prophet. When He came in the meridian of time, the Lord sent John the Baptist, and Jesus bore witness that there was no greater prophet in Israel than John the Baptist.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/god-moves-in-a-mysterious-way-his-wonders-to-perform.p11\" class=\"\">We have heard here today from Brother Derrick about the bringing forth of the boy Joseph Smith as a prophet of the Lord, visited by the Father and the Son back in 1820. If we could realize how this world has changed in the past 200 years because of the coming of the Father and the Son to usher in this dispensation as compared with the centuries preceding\u2014why didn\u2019t it happen 500 years ago or a thousand years ago?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/god-moves-in-a-mysterious-way-his-wonders-to-perform.p12\" class=\"\">But we are living in the day of preparation, and the Lord has sent his messenger to prepare the way, and He gave unto him the keys to organize His Church and kingdom and to establish the holy priesthood and the power of the apostleship, such as existed in the church in the primitive days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/god-moves-in-a-mysterious-way-his-wonders-to-perform.p13\" class=\"\">Then there are the words of Paul. He said that the Lord has revealed the mystery of His will, \u201cThat in the dispensation of the fulness of times [<span class=\"emphasis\">and we live in that dispensation<\/span>] he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21897\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21897)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21897)\">Eph. 1:10<\/a><\/span>.) Isn\u2019t that something to think about, when you hear that the Lord will reveal the mystery of His will? And that the mystery of His will has been revealed to His modern prophets of this day?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/god-moves-in-a-mysterious-way-his-wonders-to-perform.p14\" class=\"\">And we have truths that no other church in this world knows anything about\u2014we are the only church in the world that has a program to unite all that is in the kingdom of heaven with the kingdom of God here on this earth, looking to the final winding-up scenes when all the kingdoms of this world and the world to come will be under the supervision of our great King, the Savior of the world. Well, they are just some of the little things that need to be done. Now there are many other prophecies foretelling His second coming.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/god-moves-in-a-mysterious-way-his-wonders-to-perform.p15\" class=\"\">When Moroni visited the Prophet Joseph three times during the night, when he was only eighteen years old and had no church organization, Moroni quoted some of the prophecies that were yet to be fulfilled in the preparation; and one was from the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, where the Lord said that He would \u201cset his hand again the second time to gather scattered Israel, and that He would bring in the dispersed of Judah, and He would \u201cset up an ensign for the nations.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25492\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25492)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25492)\">Isa. 11:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>.) That He has done through the gathering of the Latter-day Saints to these valleys of the mountains as a witness that He has gathered scattered Israel. And now Judah is being gathered back to her native land after centuries\u2014two thousand years of wandering and persecution\u2014and now Israel has a nation of her own. All of this is but fulfillment of the prophecies that were to precede the coming of the Savior in the latter days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/god-moves-in-a-mysterious-way-his-wonders-to-perform.p16\" class=\"\">Then Isaiah made another statement regarding the latter days. (It seems to me that he almost lived more in our day than the time when he was here upon the earth, because he saw so much of what would transpire.) He saw in the last days (and he names the <span class=\"emphasis\">last days<\/span>) that the mountain of the Lord\u2019s house would be established in the top of the mountains (and we are here) and that all nations would flow unto it. \u201cAnd many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25489\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25489)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25489)\">Isa. 2:3<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/god-moves-in-a-mysterious-way-his-wonders-to-perform.p17\" class=\"\">Thousands can testify how they have been gathered from foreign lands to these valleys of the mountains where this beautiful temple is. Just imagine the Saints starting to build an edifice like that when they had nothing but their hands with which to build it, and were a thousand miles from transportation. One of the first things that President Brigham Young did when they entered into this valley, a wilderness, was to put his cane on the spot where this temple was to be built. Well, Isaiah saw all of that thousands of years ago, and that is another of the preparatory things that the prophets have foreseen that were to precede His second coming.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/god-moves-in-a-mysterious-way-his-wonders-to-perform.p18\" class=\"\">Then we come back to the prophet Malachi again, and he said: \u201cI will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord [<span class=\"emphasis\">and we live in that day of preparation<\/span>]:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/god-moves-in-a-mysterious-way-his-wonders-to-perform.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32847\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32847)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32847)\">Mal. 4:5\u20136<\/a><\/span>.)

There are unseen powers that operate in this world on the hearts and minds of men that are as real as the sunshine is to the plants and the trees to help them grow, and the seeds to sprout, and so forth. Elijah did come; on the third day of April 1836 he appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple and brought back the keys of the turning of the hearts of the fathers who have passed away to their children here upon this earth, and the hearts of the children here to their fathers, and that in itself is one of the great miracles of all ages.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/god-moves-in-a-mysterious-way-his-wonders-to-perform.p21\" class=\"\">If you could just realize what has happened as a result of Elijah\u2019s coming! At that time there were no genealogical societies in the world, and now they are all over the world; and not only that but I had a newspaper that came to me from Indianapolis the other day and the whole front page of the paper was about the gathering of genealogy. It told about our Genealogical Department out here, and I checked with Brother Burton, and we have over 600 employees in that department, 80 men that are microfilming the records all over this land and in Europe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/god-moves-in-a-mysterious-way-his-wonders-to-perform.p22\" class=\"\">Then we have these great vaults out here in these granite mountains where these films are preserved.
