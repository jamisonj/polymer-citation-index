Critchlow, Jr., <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1965, pp. 36-40<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nThe Priesthood and Women\n<\/p><p>\nA good sister in the Church sent me a lengthy letter&mdash;a sort of diatribe, I would call it&mdash;on\nthe subject of priesthood. \"Why is it,\" she asked, \"that so many preachers cannot tell us what\nit [priesthood] is? . . . Please tell me something of its substance&mdash;its contents, etc. Describe it\n[meaning, I take it, What does it look like?]. Why can't I have it?\" And then, by inference,\nWhy am I a woman?\n<\/p><p>\nAnswering her, I wrote:\n<\/p><p>\nDear Sister . . . . :<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know.<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sincerely your brother,<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wm. J. Critchlow, Jr.\n<\/p><p>\nMy reply was obviously too brief and too curt; the page looked almost naked, so I added a\nline to lengthen it a bit:\n<\/p><p>\nDear Sister . . . . :<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; I do not know.<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm not supposed to know.<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sincerely your brother,<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wm. J. Critchlow, Jr.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then, to give it a little body, I added this postscript: \n<\/p><p>\nWhen He whose business priesthood is wants the sisters to have it, he will let his prophet\nknow, and until then there is nothing we can do about it.\n<\/p><p>\nI still didn't have the heart to mail it. What I finally did mail matched her letter space for\nspace, and page for page, with paragraphs to boot. It probably did not satisfy her questions,\nbut it did at least satisfy a principle called courtesy.\n<\/p><p>\nIf time permitted I would read to you the full text of the sister's letter. You will, I think, be\nable to fairly well surmise the nature of its content by the nature of my reply.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is my reply: (edited and supplemented for this talk) Dear Sister . . . . : \n<\/p><p>\nI do not know; the \"substance\" of priesthood and the forces that operate to produce its power\nare presently incomprehensible to me. I've never seen them, nor heard them, nor smelled\nthem, nor tasted them, nor touched them, but at times, officiating in the ordinances thereof,\nthey have touched me. Neither do I comprehend the substance of faith, \"the substance of\nthings hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24348\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24348)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24348)\">Heb. 11:1<\/a><\/span>),\nnor can I explain the forces\nthat operated when the Brother of Jared's faith removed the mountain Zerin\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22257\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22257)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22257)\">Ether 12:30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe power of faith and the power of God are twin-kindred, godly powers. No man has ever\nachieved in his mortal state the status of a god, acquiring all of our Father's knowledge,\nwisdom, and powers&mdash;Jesus not excepted. He came in the flesh endowed with godly powers\nand by those powers laid down his life and then took it up again. The \"substance\" of the\npriesthood power employed in his resurrection or the \"contents\" of the power of faith that\nmoved the mountain Zerin I simply do not understand, and it does not embarrass me to say I\ndo not know.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I'm not supposed to know&mdash;this I believe. God has purposely veiled some things in\nsecrecy. The \"substance\" of priesthood is presently veiled knowledge. Even so, God has not\ndenied men the right to use it. Similarly, he has not denied man the right to use that other\ngreat power we call electricity. Who knows what that great power actually is? Scientists\ncannot tell you its \"substance.\" They have never seen it, nor heard it, nor smelled it, nor\ntasted it; and they have so much respect for it that they avoid the risk of handling it\nunpreparedly. Carelessness around electric power lines can be suddenly lethal, yet for its\nmany beneficent uses you and I are most grateful.\n<\/p><p>\nMiracles are a product of priesthood power. Who knows the \"substance\" of a miracle? Who\nunderstands the forces that operate when the sick are healed? Did anyone with mortal eyes see\nthe forces that Jesus employed when he transformed water into wine? Mortal men, even those\nwho honor their priesthood, do not know the \"substance\" of a miracle, nor do some who treat\ntheir priesthood lightly fully realize that carelessness with priesthood power can be slowly\nlethal, producing a lingering, withering, spiritual death. The man who works with priesthood\npower or the man who works with electrical power&mdash;neither of them has the right to handle\neither power unpreparedly, unworthily. Some men \". . . do not learn this one lesson&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\n\"That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and\nthat the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of\nrighteousness\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14681\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14681)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14681)\">D&amp;C 121:35-36<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI wish I knew<br \/>\n        Why the man is I and the woman is you; <br \/>\n     Why I am gentile and my neighbor is Jew; <br \/>\n     Why some have lovely white-skin faces&mdash;others born in colored\n        races; <br \/>\n     Why some are sound in body and mind&mdash;others deformed and\n        some born blind; <br \/>\n     Why some live but a moment or so&mdash;others for years before they\n        go; <br \/>\n     Why some were born when our Lord held sway&mdash;others held for\n        this latter day; <br \/>\n     Why? I wish I knew.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>No Memory of Heavenly Home<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNo mortal man, regardless of his place and state of birth, is born with a memory of his\nheavenly home. God planned it that way purposely. And \"Eye hath not seen [purposely], nor\near heard [purposely], neither [has I entered into the heart of man\" [purposely] a knowledge\nof his future home, \"which God hath prepared for them that love him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"404\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 404)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(404)\">1 Cor. 2:9<\/a><\/span>). Jesus\nsaid, \"In my Father's house are many mansions\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28201\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28201)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28201)\">John 14:2<\/a><\/span>). The Prophet Joseph Smith\ncalled them \"kingdoms.\" In which of these kingdoms or subdivisions thereof did he go to\nprepare a place for you? Describe your mansion, if you can. Of what substance is it made?\nTell me about its contents. Tell me how God hears and answers your prayers. Tell me how\nmy body after death, its remains blown to the four corners of the world, will be restored in\nthe resurrection process, without the loss of a single hair. Surely God has denied his children\nhere on earth some knowledge of things that were, and things that are, and things to\nbe&mdash;purposely. And again, it does not embarrass me to say there are some things I do not know.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . when the Lord shall come, he shall reveal all things&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\n\"Things which have passed, and hidden things which no man knew, things of the earth, by\nwhich it was made, and the purpose and the end thereof&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\n\"Things most precious, things that are above, and things that are beneath, things that are in\nthe earth, and upon the earth, and in heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14664\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14664)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14664)\">D&amp;C 101:32-34<\/a><\/span>). In the meantime we must\nlive by faith.\n<\/p><p>\nBut this I do know: Priesthood is the power of God, presently and purposely denied to women\nfor reasons which he has not revealed. And when he whose business priesthood is wants the\nsisters to hold it, he will let his prophet know; and until then there is nothing we can do about\nit. And until the Lord or his prophet speaks, don't ever, Sister, make a pretense to priesthood\npower, and never simulate a priesthood ordinance.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Partners with God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nDid women by their own first choice choose to be partners with God in his creative\nprocesses? Faced with an alternative&mdash;partnership or priesthood&mdash;did you, Sister, pass up\npriesthood?\n<\/p><p>\nDid women by their own free choice choose to be the family heart rather than the family\nhead? Scripturally \"the husband is the head of the wife\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21781\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21781)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21781)\">Eph. 5:23<\/a><\/span>), and he is the family\npriest and spokesman. Did God, however, in his infinite wisdom purposely make mother the\nfamily heart, blessing her with subtle power to sway the head?\n<\/p><p>\n       \"There is a center in every home<br \/>\n        From which all joys must start.<br \/>\n        Where is that center?<br \/>\n        It is in the mother's heart.\"\n<\/p><p>\nGod, choosing woman to be his partner in the creative process, tucked away somewhere in\nher bosom a spark of his divine love, which later, at the time of motherhood, glows to\nbrilliancy in every mother's heart.\n<\/p><p>\nA poet sensed this seemingly divine gift of devotion when he wrote: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I feel that, in the Heavens above,<br \/>\n     The angels, whispering to one another,<br \/>\n     Can find, among their burning terms of love,<br \/>\n     None so devotional as that of 'Mother'.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;          (Edgar Allan Poe, \"To My Mother.\")\n<\/p><p>\nNow, Sister, faced with the alternative family head or family heart, did you turn down the\nhead? Faced again with a choice between mother's love or priesthood authority, did you pass\nup authority?\n<\/p><p>\nPossibly some other considerations influenced you to be woman rather than man. I've listed a\nfew suggestions. Now, which in this list of womanly virtues might possibly have influenced\nyour choice&mdash;if and when, of course, you had a choice? At the head of the list I have placed:\n<\/p><p>\nMotherhood&mdash;co-creator with God. \"Architects and builders of all humanity\" our mothers\nare.\n<\/p><p>\nMother's love&mdash;that very special kind for children&mdash;a spark of his divine love for his spirit\nchildren.\n<\/p><p>\nThe family heart&mdash;with subtle powers to sway the head.\n<\/p><p>\nThe teacher&mdash;if little children pray, give mother the credit. \"Train up a child in the way he\nshould go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41470\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41470)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41470)\">Prov. 22:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe dietician&mdash;lovingly concerned with the family health.\n<\/p><p>\nThe cook&mdash;employing her daughters in the art.\n<\/p><p>\nThe nurse&mdash;whose loving, tender care a man can never match.\n<\/p><p>\nThe expediter&mdash;lovingly supervising children's chores and study.\n<\/p><p>\nThe provoker&mdash;kindly provoking the husband to good works. (By Joseph Smith, \"Minutes of\nOrganization and Proceedings of the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo,\" March 17, 1842.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe psychiatrist&mdash;principally for her husband, for whom she is the receptacle of all his cares\nand most of his ill humor. Somewhere it is written that \"the virtues of the mothers shall be\nvisited on their children as well as the sins of the fathers.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe \"helpmeet\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23717\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23717)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23717)\">Gen. 2:18<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;\"Men\nundertake the doing and women the being. Man does, woman is.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAll of these virtues and functions label the mother the homemaker. God labeled the father the\nprovider or breadwinner when he made him the family head.\n<\/p><p>\nNow seriously, Sister, were you given a choice&mdash;as of right now, or perhaps a choice\nsometime in the dim premortal past&mdash;between homemaker or breadwinner, would you, or did\nyou at some time, choose to be the homemaker, choosing motherhood over fatherhood?\n<\/p><p>\nFathers, bearing the priesthood, are entitled to inspiration, but not all of them get it.\n<\/p><p>\nMothers, God's creation partners, are endowed with intuition, and they all seem to have it.\n<\/p><p>\nIntuition and inspiration are also twin, kindred powers. Intuition is innate. Inspiration is\nacquired. Women are not denied inspiration. Did God favor them by adding to their precious\nvirtues the extra gift of intuition? Could your awareness of this special gift possibly have been\na factor in your choice to be a woman?\n<\/p><p>\nGod made man the father, the head, the spokesman, the priest to rule over the family clan.\n<\/p><p>\nHe made woman the mother, the heart the helpmeet, a partner with him in his creation plan.\n<\/p><p>\nHe made man rugged, strong&mdash;the builder, provider, protector of the family living places.\n<\/p><p>\nHe made woman gentle, fair&mdash;the homemaker, lovemaker, peacemaker, endowed with\nheavenly graces.\n<\/p><p>\nGod made both to be happy in their respective places.\n<\/p><p>\nIf God made man \"a little lower than the angels\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41848\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41848)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41848)\">Ps. 8:5<\/a><\/span>),\nhe must then have made women his very angels.\n<\/p><p>\nDoes the lack of priesthood handicap you in teaching children in the home or in the\npriesthood auxiliaries? Does the loss of priesthood bar you from fellowshipping with sisters\nand priesthood in activities of the Church? Haven't the Relief Society, the YWMIA, and the\nPrimary organizations all prospered without priesthood teachers? Haven't the blessings of the\npriesthood always been shared with the wives, mothers, and daughters of men who hold and\nhonor their priesthood?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Blessings for Women<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe emancipation of women in this mortal sphere does not yet involve priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nWomen in our great nation enjoy civil rights and liberties like men: they can vote and run for\npublic offices like men: they can own property and drive cars like men; they can frequent\npublic places like men, they can work when, where, and if they please like men; they can\nsmoke, curse, and blaspheme the name of God like men; they can eat, drink, and be merry\nlike men; they can cut their hair like men and wear men's clothes. One thing they cannot do\nas men&mdash;they cannot violate the oath and covenant of the priesthood as some men who bear\nthe priesthood do. Maybe you should thank God for that. If that, dear Sister, gives comfort to\nyour soul, then let me disturb your comfort by reminding you that by reason of your temple\nexperience, you do have certain priesthood covenants to keep and to uphold. Had you\nforgotten them?\n<\/p><p>\nJust as that great unseen electrical power flows through wires to bless mankind, so does that\ngreat unseen priesthood power flow through ordained men to bless mankind. Can anyone\ncome close enough to its source to actually see and know it?\n<\/p><p>\nUnfortunately, some men have and then have turned away denying and repudiating it&mdash;even\nrebelling against the revealed truth. We call them sons of perdition.\n<\/p><p>\nThe husband is the family head for administrative purposes, solely.\n<\/p><p>\nHe is first among equals for the sake of order in the family, only.\n<\/p><p>\nFirst among two personalities, husband and wife, is the man.

Will a few others to whom\nI have read this letter please pardon the repetition.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Power of God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTo all others may I say: Priesthood is the power of God. Only through its saving ordinances\ncan one attain exaltation and eternal life. Priesthood is eternal. Concerning it God has\nrevealed: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord; \n<\/p><p>\n\"For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me; \n<\/p><p>\n\"And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father; \n<\/p><p>\n\"And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father\nhath shall be given unto him\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14624\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14624)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14624)\">D&amp;C 84:35-38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSurely man cannot receive all that God has, in this mortal world; but if one will honor his\npriesthood, there is good reason to believe that God will be merciful unto him in time of\nneed, in place of need, according to his need. This I believe, and to this I testify, in the name\nof Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
