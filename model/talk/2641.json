As the Church grew large, populous, and far-reaching, and realizing the cost of transportation from the far reaches of the earth to this conference, realizing the limitation on the facilities here even\u2014for we had long since filled this building\u2014we determined to take the conferences to the people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p5\" class=\"\">And so the first was held in Manchester, England; the second was held in Mexico City, Mexico; the next year we went to Munich, Germany; last year we went to Stockholm, Sweden; and this year we have been to Sao Paulo, Brazil and to Buenos Aires, Argentina and the states in South America.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p6\" class=\"\">We have been highly gratified with the reception. We have taken a group of the General Authorities and we have held for the local people a conference somewhat similar to this one. We have sustained the authorities of the Church; we have given to them the benefits that they might have received had they come to this conference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p7\" class=\"\">We expect to continue this program and to go to different parts of the world and take the messages and keep in close touch with the great numbers of people who are congregating in the far ends of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p8\" class=\"\">Recently we were in Brazil and then Argentina on successive weekends, and we came back with our hearts filled with gratitude at the attitudes and the spirits and the testimonies of those good people who came in large numbers, at some sacrifice, to those centers to hear the gospel from the leaders of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p9\" class=\"\">When we were in Sao Paulo, Brazil, we announced to those people that, subject to their willingness and their readiness to assist, we would build a holy temple in South America for all the South Americans at that time. Hopefully, in later years, other temples might be built for those who are farther away. The people received it with gratitude and great happiness, tears of joy and thankfulness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p10\" class=\"\">They have been coming as they could accumulate the funds for that long trip to the United States. They have been coming two, four, and six at a time to receive their endowments in the holy temple and to be sealed to their companions and to their families, and so to realize that they could have a temple close to home was a great joy to them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p11\" class=\"\">As we talked about financing it\u2014and we always give the local people the privilege of contributing toward it but the body of the Church, of course, makes the larger contribution\u2014they were anxious to do so. They were glad to pledge what they could toward building the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p12\" class=\"\">I was handed a little note this morning from one of the brethren who has spent much time in Brazil, and he said, \u201cIt has been reported to me that over 140 Brazilian members had already booked passage to come to this conference and to go to the temple. After you made the announcement to build a temple in Brazil, 70 cancelled their passage and pledged the fare to the building of the temple.\u201d It runs into tens and tens of thousands of dollars, as you would recognize.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p13\" class=\"\">We think that a wonderful demonstration. We are sad that they need to wait any longer for their temple privileges; but to the young people, time is not quite as crowding as it is to some of us older ones.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p14\" class=\"\">During this conference, you have heard many beautiful testimonies and sermons of great strength. We hope that the listening audience\u2014which could run into the millions\u2014may have been listening with pure hearts and receptive minds and that some of them may wish to join us in this great congregation now that is running into the millions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p15\" class=\"\">We know that it is true. We testify that to all the world. We hope that they will set aside any prejudices they might have had, or misconceptions, and that they might come to the fold of Jesus Christ where it is pure and undefiled.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p16\" class=\"\">During this conference the Brethren have spoken upon many subjects; and, all in all, they have covered quite well the fundamentals of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p17\" class=\"\">As we sat in a press conference a few days ago, I was asked by the pressmen, \u201cWhat situation exists in our society today which causes you the greatest concern?\u201d We had already discussed the problem of growth, for we are growing so rapidly it is a little difficult to keep the leadership ahead of the people; but we are, thankfully, making headway.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p18\" class=\"\">As I thought quickly over this matter, I attempted to answer the question, and I recalled the time when the world leadership was based in Assyria and Babylonia. I remember the Old Testament story of Belshazzar\u2014spoken of by President Romney in the priesthood meeting last night\u2014the son and successor of the famous Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, being the last reigning king before the conquest of Cyrus the Great. We remembered the unholy thefts of Nebuchadnezzar, when he defiled the sacred temple of Solomon in Jerusalem and took from that temple many costly and precious serving items. I noted that Belshazzar the king made a great feast, with a thousand of his lords. He drank wine before the thousand and with the thousand. To feed a thousand persons at a banquet is a herculean effort.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/why-do-we-continue-to-tolerate-sin.p19\" class=\"\">Not satisfied with the theft of the golden and silver vessels which his father had taken from the holy temple, which had already been dedicated to the Lord for His purposes, Belshazzar took the stolen vessels and filled them with intoxicating liquor, and invited into his chambers, not only the thousand of his lords, but his princes, his wives, and his concubines. His guests ate and drank, probably gave toasts to the gods of gold, the gods of silver, the gods of brass, the gods of iron, the gods of wood, and the gods of stone.
