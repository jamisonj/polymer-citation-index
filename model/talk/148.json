May I read\na story that was published in <i>The Reader's Digest<\/i> of April 1944:\n<\/p><p>\n\"THAT'S THE SPIRIT\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe bomber had been almost ripped apart by German cannon. The ball turret gunner was\nbadly wounded and stuck in the blister on the underside of the fuselage. Crew men worked\nfrantically to extricate the youngster but there was nothing they could do. They began to\njump.\n<\/p><p>\nThe terror-stricken lad screamed in fear, as he saw what was happening. The last man to jump\nheard the remaining crewman, a gunner, say, \"Take it easy, kid, we'll take this ride together.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd they took that ride of death together, and together they stood at the gates of God, the\nselfsame God who died for all men.\n<\/p><p>\nA PLEA FOR UNSELFISHNESS\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, in this hour of trial, we must all take the ride together, eschewing all selfishness and\npersonal advantage. You ask for a postwar program. The Lord gave it to us. It is as follows:\n<\/p><p>\nWo unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, for your riches will\ncanker your souls; and this shall be your lamentation in the day of visitation, and of\njudgment, and of indignation: The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not\nsaved!\n<\/p><p>\nWo unto you poor men, whose hearts are not broken, whose spirits are not contrite, and\nwhose bellies are not satisfied, and whose hands are not stayed from laying hold upon other\nmen's goods, whose eyes are full of greediness, and who will not labor with your own hands!\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11982\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11982)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11982)\">D&amp;C 56:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe blood of the rich men's sons and the blood of the poor men's sons commingle at this\nvery hour upon bloody battlefields in a brave endeavor to keep the temple of liberty inviolate\nand keep eternal those principles of freedom for which our forefathers bled and died.\n<\/p><p>\nIs it not possible for the rich man, the capitalist, and the laborer to meet at a round table\nconference and settle all these economic troubles? If they will meet in the spirit of Christ,\nthese things will be settled to the satisfaction of all concerned.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God send that day which the Nephite people enjoyed that golden era of two centuries,\nwhere in their industrial and social life all things were had in common; they lived in the\nprosperity of Christ; there were no rich and no poor\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6508\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6508)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6508)\">4 Ne. 1:3<\/a><\/span>).\nBanish selfishness from the world and\nthis blessed condition would be realized.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are in the midst of turbulent times. Reason is invited to give way to partisanship; but we\nmust not blind ourselves to the good of all the people of the United States. Let us pray with\nthe poet:\n<\/p><p>\nGod give us men. A time like this demands<br \/>\nStrong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands!<br \/>\nMen whom the lust of office does not kill;<br \/>\nMen whom the spoils of office cannot buy:<br \/>\nMen who possess opinions and a will;<br \/>\nMen who have honor, men who will not lie:<br \/>\nMen who can stand before a demagogue<br \/>\nAnd damn his treacherous flatteries without winking;<br \/>\nTall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog<br \/>\nIn public duty and in private thinking;<br \/>\nFor while the rabble, with their thumb-worn creeds,<br \/>\nTheir large professions and their little deeds,<br \/>\nMingle in selfish pride, lo Freedom weeps,<br \/>\nWrong rules the land, and waiting Justice sleeps.<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;                                      &mdash;J. G. Holland\n<\/p><p>\nMay God give us reason. May we in prayer approach him for guidance in temporal as well as\nin spiritual things, and may unselfishness rule the land, and rule in the hearts of men, that\nthese economic differences may be adjusted in the spirit of tranquility, reason and divine\njustice, and may we all take the economic ride together, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
