It\nseems incredible that there could be so much quiet and peace and comfort, yes, luxury, in this\npart of the world today, while in many other parts of the world people are suffering for the\nnecessities of life, and there appears to be no hope of peace in those sections, in fact, in any\nsection, for a long time.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are met this morning in worship. I see in the audience, today, prominent officials of the\nstate, our educational institutions, missionary representatives, and people from all parts of the\nChurch. I think I should mention this morning that we have here with us the grandson of a\ngreat friend of the Church in early days, Colonel Thomas L. Kane, who offered his life that\nhe might preserve the people in this valley, and the Lord preserved him to do his work, and\nhe returned home safely. Today we feel grateful that his grandson is here. We hope that he\nwill enjoy being with the people for whom his grandfather sacrificed so much.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was eighty-nine years ago that Colonel Kane visited here, but one hundred years ago the\nfirst general conference was held in this valley. I think you would like to know just about\nwhat happened.\n<\/p><p>\nEVENTS OF 100 YEARS AGO\n<\/p><p>\nThe conference meetings began on Sunday, October 3, and continued until Friday, October 8.\nDuring that period the weather in Salt Lake City was warm. Brigham Young was sustained as\nPresident of the whole Church. The Twelve Apostles were sustained with the exception of\nLyman Wight, who was left until he came in person, which he did not do. An epistle from\nthe Twelve was read by Parley P. Pratt and accepted by the Saints. Charles C. Rich and John\nYoung were elected counselors to President John Smith; Father John Smith, who was my\ngreat-grandfather, was sustained as president of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion, and as patriarch\nto the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nIt does not seem possible that we are talking about a hundred years ago. At that time Henry\nG. Sherwood, Thomas Grover, Levi Jackman, John Murdock, Daniel\nSpencer, Lewis Abbott, Ira Eldredge, Edson Whipple, Shadrach Roundy, John Vance, Willard\nSnow, and Abram O. Smoot were elected members of the high council. Charles C. Rich was\nalso elected chief military commander. Albert Carrington was elected clerk, historian and\ndeputy postmaster for the city. John Van Cott was elected marshal of the city&mdash;all this was\none hundred years ago!\n<\/p><p>\nSeveral companies of emigrating Saints arrived in Salt Lake City on Monday, October 4. The\npresidency of the stake and the high council met in Great Salt Lake City for the first time at 7\np.m., at which meeting they considered the advisability of building mills on City Creek and\non Mill Creek.\n<\/p><p>\nOn Tuesday the presidency of the stake and the high council met at 9 a. m. and appointed a\ncommittee to lay out farming land. The city had been surveyed, and they were now getting\nready to move out a little farther. Other companies of pioneers arrived in Salt Lake City on\nthis date.\n<\/p><p>\nThe presidency of the stake and high council met on October 6, and appointed a committee to\nsee that the fort had proper gates made for it. Also Henry G. Sherwood was continuing his\nsurvey.\n<\/p><p>\nNancy Rich, mother of Charles C. Rich, was buried beside the grave of Caroline Grant, a\nshort distance southeast of the Fort, which was out in the southwest part of the city.\n<\/p><p>\nThe last families of emigrating Saints arrived in Salt Lake City on Friday, October 8. There\nwere about two thousand people in the valley at this time.\n<\/p><p>\nI thought that this might bring to your minds some things that would be of interest to you. It\nis wonderful to think that this marvelous land we live in, then desert, now is as the garden of\nthe Lord, and to realize that our Heavenly Father preserved the people and opened the way\nfor them to multiply and increase until today we have here in this valley every comfort, every\nconvenience, almost every blessing that you can think of which is enjoyed in any part of the\nworld.\n<\/p><p>\nWALKING STICK OF THOMAS L. KANE\n<\/p><p>\nIn view of the visit here of the Honorable E. Kent Kane, the grandson of Colonel Thomas L.\nKane, I brought with me this walking stick which I hold in my hand. It was given to my\ngreat-grandfather, John Smith, by Colonel Kane as a result of their friendship. They were\ngreat friends before either came to Salt Lake Valley, having become acquainted during the\nexodus of our people from Nauvoo. This walking stick was handed down from John Smith, to\nGeorge A. Smith, my grandfather, then to John Henry Smith, my father, and then it came to\nme and has been passed down to my son, George Albert Smith, IV.\n<\/p><p>\nI thought it might be of interest to go back into that history, particularly in view of the fact\nthat we are honored by the presence of the grandson of the man who gave this cane. It came\nfrom the hickory grove at the Old Hermitage near Nashville. It was given by\nAndrew Jackson, the man who became president of the United States, and who owned the\nHermitage and lived there, to Thomas L. Kane, and he passed it to John Smith who became\nthe first president of the stake in this valley.\n<\/p><p>\nToday, instead of having only two thousand members of the Church in this valley, we have\nmore than four thousand missionaries of the Church in the world who are sharing the gospel\nof Jesus Christ with the children of men&mdash;the largest number that have ever been in the world\nat any one time.\n<\/p><p>\nTEMPLE SQUARE\n<\/p><p>\nHundreds of incidents could be narrated here, if there were time, that would be of interest to\nthis particular audience. Today we are met in the great Tabernacle that is known the world\nover because from this building each week for more than seventeen years has gone a\nbroadcast by the Tabernacle Choir and the great organ which has been carried to nearly all\nparts of the civilized world. This Tabernacle, of course, a hundred years ago had not been\nthought of. Since that time on this block we have the Tabernacle which holds 10,000 people\nand is one of the most delightful places in the world to meet in; we have the great temple; we\nhave the Bureau of Information; we have the little old log cabin that used to be over on First\nNorth Street, and the Assembly Hall, all in this ten acre square. And I call your attention to\nthe fact that the square is adorned, not only by these buildings, but by monuments and\nmarkers in honor of those who have passed on, and is beautified by gardens of flowers, and\nshrubs, and trees. It is one of the most attractive squares in all, the world.\n<\/p><p>\nRELIEF FOR EUROPEAN SAINTS\n<\/p><p>\nWord comes from our people in Europe. In many cases they are still having difficult times,\nbut they are faithful, in the main, to God and the Church, and the messages that they send us\nfrom time to time in expressing gratitude for food, clothing, and bedding we have sent them\nwarm our hearts.\n<\/p><p>\nIt may be of interest to you to know that since World War II closed, more than seventy-five\nmajor carloads of food and clothing and bedding have been shipped across the sea to those\nneedy people over there, without any expense to them whatsoever.\n<\/p><p>\nVISIT TO PRESIDENT TRUMAN\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the war was over, I went representing the Church, to see the president of the United\nStates. When I called on him, he received me very graciously&mdash;I had met him before&mdash;and I\nbefore&mdash;and I said: \"I have just come to ascertain from you, Mr. President, what your attitude\nwill be if the Latter-day Saints are prepared to ship food and clothing and bedding to\nEurope.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe smiled and looked at me, and said: \"Well, what do you want to ship it over there for?\nTheir money isn't any good.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI said: \"We don't want their money.\" He looked at me and asked: \"You don't mean you are\ngoing to give it to them?\"\n<\/p><p>\nI said: \"Of course, we would give it to them. They are our brothers and sisters and are in\ndistress. God has blessed us with a surplus, and we will be glad to send it if we can have the\nco-operation of the government.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe said: \"You are on the right track,\" and added, \"we will be glad to help you in any way we\ncan.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI have thought of that a good many times. After we had sat there a moment or two, he said\nagain: \"How long will it take you to get this ready?\"\n<\/p><p>\nI said: \"It's all ready.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe government you remember had been destroying food and refusing to plant grain during\nthe war, so I said to him:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Mr. President, while the administration at Washington were advising the destroying of food,\nwe were building elevators and filling them with grain, and increasing our flocks and our\nherds, and now what we need is the cars and the ships in order to send considerable food,\nclothing and bedding to the people of Europe who are in distress. We have an organization in\nthe Church that has over two thousand homemade quilts ready.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe group that sang for you this morning, the Singing Mothers of the Relief Society,\nrepresent that organization. They had two thousand quilts made by their own hands ready to\nship. The result was that many people received warm clothing and bedding and food without\nany delay. Just as fast as we could get cars and ships, we had what was necessary to send to\nEurope.\n<\/p><p>\nACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE LAST CENTURY\n<\/p><p>\nNow, we couldn't have done that a hundred years ago. We were seeking food ourselves. Our\npeople in this valley then were digging thistle and sego roots for food, and they were utilizing\nevery means possible to get food to keep the soul and body together. In a hundred years the\ndesert has been made to blossom as the rose\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25057\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25057)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25057)\">Isa. 35:1<\/a><\/span>).\nIn a hundred years the gospel has been preached\nto almost all nations of the earth where it would be received. In a hundred years the people\nhave been gathered from the various nations and have come here to Zion, and have settled\nand made homes. In Utah and Idaho, Nevada, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, Montana,\nCalifornia, and Oregon, the state of Washington and western Canada we have congregations\nas large as this that can be gathered together&mdash;members of the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints who have reason to thank God for the gospel of Jesus Christ revealed in this\nlatter-day, for without it there could have been no such a settlement, no such a gathering as\nhas been made by the people in this great western land.\n<\/p><p>\nSo this morning, brothers and sisters, we have much to be grateful for. Thanksgiving should\nfill our hearts. Here we are in this house that has been utilized now many, many years. I was\nin it myself in 1875; I was a little child then and used to play around here\non the great stones that were piled on this block when the temple was being built. Now they\nall have been finished and laid in place. The great organ was constructed and there have been\nhundreds of thousands of people worship God in this building under the influence of the spirit\nof our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE HANDCART PIONEERS\n<\/p><p>\nJust north of this building a monument is being completed this morning to the emigrants who\ncame into Salt Lake Valley, bringing all their earthly possessions in handcarts which were\npushed and pulled by members of the family. They walked approximately one thousand five\nhundred miles, coming from Iowa City, Iowa, to this place, and they suffered untold hardships\nalong the way. More than two hundred of them died on the way due to hunger, cold, and\nexhaustion, but their associates continued to arrive here eventually to make their homes.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, think what has happened. That same trip can be made from Iowa City into the valley of\nthe Great Salt Lake in comfort, having your meals en route prepared for you as you come\nflying through the air overlooking the country, and in seven hours the trip is completed. When\nthe handcart people came, it took weary months of time as it did with the ox team. Now we\nhave the railways with their fast trains; we have the automobile; we have the airplane, and in\naddition to that we have that wonderful device, the radio, over which the Tabernacle choir\nand organ have been singing to the world from this building each Sabbath day for seventeen\nyears, and by means of which people all over the country are listening in to this service today,\nhearing it probably just as plain in their own homes and in their churches as if they were\npresent with us. Surely, a marvelous work and a wonder\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25054\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25054)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25054)\">Isa. 29:14<\/a><\/span>) has been brought into the world.\n<\/p><p>\nThe scripture has been fulfilled, and today we humble members of the Church, men and\nwomen who enjoy almost every comfort that can be desired, all the necessities at any rate,\nassemble in the house of the Lord this morning. Here in quiet we commune together; we\nlisten to the strains of music; we offer prayers of thanksgiving and gratitude to our Heavenly\nFather; we listen to sermons that are delivered by men who have had experience in the\nworld&mdash;everyone of them has been a missionary in some form or another.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE INSPIRATION IN WORSHIP\n<\/p><p>\nThat reminds me of an incident that happened a long time ago. A Holland brother by the\nname of Folkers was living with his wife at my place, and they could not speak or understand\nthe English language. He used to go to the fast meetings, and when the other people talked,\nhe could not understand what they said. When they finished, he would get up and talk, and\nwe could not understand him. One day I asked him, \"Why do you go to the English-speaking\nservices? You cannot understand.\" It took me sometime to make him\nunderstand what I wanted to know. Finally he smiled and said: \"It is not what you hear that\nmakes you happy; nor what you see that makes you happy; it is what you feel, and I can feel\njust as well as anybody.\" And that is the thing I wanted to impress upon you this morning. In\nthis house, dedicated to the worship of our Heavenly Father, we not only can hear and see,\nbut we can also feel the inspiration of the hour and have our faith increased and our spiritual\nstrength renewed, not as a great group of strangers but as real brothers and sisters, children of\nthe Living God. We can be here together and surely have thanksgiving in our hearts to our\nHeavenly Father for the many, many blessings extended to us and the opportunities and\nprivileges that are ours.\n<\/p><p>\nTHANKSGIVING FOR BLESSINGS\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brothers and sisters, you have come here to wait upon the Lord\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25060\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25060)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25060)\">Isa. 40:31<\/a><\/span>), forget the problems on\nthe outside as far as you can and\n<\/p><p>\nCount your many blessings, name them one by one,\nAnd it will surprise you, what the Lord has done.\n<\/p><p>\nWe who are here as the descendants of those who came a hundred years ago to this valley can\nsee the hand of the Lord has been over the people. He has blessed us as few people in the\nworld have ever been blessed, and surely there will be in our hearts a feeling of gratitude and\nthanksgiving to him who is the Author of our being for all the blessings he has bestowed\nupon us.\n<\/p><p>\nI am so happy this morning to see Aunt Augusta Grant here. She has been coming to these\nconferences ever since she was able, and here in her later years she sits in our midst\nrepresenting a great family and bringing to our minds the fact that her husband not very long\nago stood where I am standing, delivering the message that the Lord had for us through him.\nThen when his work was completed, he was permitted to go to paradise.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord add his blessings. I pray that his Spirit may be in our hearts and in our homes,\nthat we may have love for our fellow men wherever they may be, that we may sincerely\ndesire to share the only message that will bring peace to the world, the gospel of Jesus Christ,\nwith our Father's other children, with the hope that enough of them will understand it and\nmake it their own that war may be at least withheld for some time and that we may go on\nhappily serving our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear you my testimony this morning that I know that God lives; I know that Jesus is the\nChrist; I know that Joseph Smith was his prophet, and I pray that all of us may have that\nassurance and so adjust our lives that when the time comes for us to go hence we shall find\nour reward is that of an inheritance in the celestial kingdom in the companionship of those we\nlove, to be with them forever, and I pray that it may be so, in the name of Jesus Christ, our\nLord. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
