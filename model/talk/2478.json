And together with the sacred history that surrounds their being given they constitute the scripture. The Bible is, of course, the best known example. In the Church we do something that very few do any more: We read the Bible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/we-believe-all-that-god-has-revealed.p8\" class=\"\">And we are blessed with other scriptures, also books of revelation: the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/we-believe-all-that-god-has-revealed.p9\" class=\"\">When we announce that we have scripture other than the Bible, we are asked of course, \u201cWell, where did you get these revelations?

We got them from somewhere. We say, \u201cHandle them; read them; test them.

And I would like to quote part of his parable:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/we-believe-all-that-god-has-revealed.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cA young man once long ago claimed he had found a large diamond in his field as he was ploughing. He put the stone on display to the public free of charge, and everyone took sides. A psychologist showed, by citing some famous case studies, that the young man was suffering from a well-known form of delusion. An historian showed that other men have also claimed to have found diamonds in fields and have been deceived. A geologist proved that there were no diamonds in the area but only quartz: The young man had been fooled by a quartz. When asked to inspect the stone itself, the geologist declined with a weary, tolerant smile, and a kindly shake of the head. An English professor showed that the young man in describing his stone used the very same language that others had used in describing uncut diamonds: He was, therefore, simply speaking the common language of his time. A sociologist showed that only three out of 177 florists\u2019 assistants in four major cities believed the stone was genuine. A clergyman wrote a book to show that it was not the young man but someone else who had found the stone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/we-believe-all-that-god-has-revealed.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cFinally an indigent jeweler \u2026 pointed out that since the stone was still available for examination the answer to the question of whether it was a diamond or not had absolutely nothing to do with who found it, or whether the finder was honest or sane, or who believed him, or whether he would know a diamond from a brick, or whether diamonds had ever been found in fields, or whether people had ever been fooled by quartz or glass, but was to be answered simply and solely by putting the stone to certain well-known tests for diamonds. Experts on diamonds were called in. Some of them declared it genuine. The others made nervous jokes about it and declared that they could not very well jeopardize their dignity and reputations by appearing to take the thing too seriously. To hide the bad impression thus made, someone came out with the theory that the stone was really a synthetic diamond, very skillfully made, but a fake just the same. The objection to this is that the production of a good synthetic diamond, for the farm boy, would have been an even more remarkable feat than the finding of a real one.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Lehi in the Desert and the World of the Jaredites,<\/span> Bookcraft, 1952, pp. 136\u201337.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/we-believe-all-that-god-has-revealed.p16\" class=\"\">The fact is that we have these books of scripture. We got them, I repeat, from somewhere.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/we-believe-all-that-god-has-revealed.p17\" class=\"\">Over the years, there have been many explanations and theories as to where they came from. These theories, which have been advanced, for the most part, by people who have never so much as read the books, generally group themselves under the idea that Joseph Smith produced them; that Joseph Smith authored them himself. He, then, deserves the blame.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/we-believe-all-that-god-has-revealed.p18\" class=\"\">This, however, lays far too much credit to him and makes all too much of him. This I cannot accept, for this would make him a genius beyond all measurements. I do not believe he was that. To assume that he produced them without help and without inspiration is preposterous.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/we-believe-all-that-god-has-revealed.p19\" class=\"\">The truth is, simply, that he was a prophet of God\u2014nothing more and not one whit less!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/we-believe-all-that-god-has-revealed.p20\" class=\"\">The scriptures did not come so much from Joseph Smith as they did through him. He was a conduit through which the revelations were given. He was otherwise an ordinary man, as were the prophets in ancient times and as are the prophets in our day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/we-believe-all-that-god-has-revealed.p21\" class=\"\">Some have alleged that these books of revelation are false, and they place in evidence changes that have occurred in the texts of these scriptures since their original publication. They cite these changes, of which there are many examples, as though they themselves were announcing revelation. As though they were the only ones that knew of them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/we-believe-all-that-god-has-revealed.p22\" class=\"\">Of course there have been changes and corrections. Anyone who has done even limited research knows that. When properly reviewed, such corrections become a testimony for, not against, the truth of the books.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/we-believe-all-that-god-has-revealed.p23\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph Smith was an unschooled farm boy. To read some of his early letters in the original shows him to be somewhat unpolished in spelling and grammar and in expression.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/we-believe-all-that-god-has-revealed.p24\" class=\"\">That the revelations came through him in any form of literary refinement is nothing short of a miracle. That some perfecting should continue strengthens my respect for them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/we-believe-all-that-god-has-revealed.p25\" class=\"\">Now, I add with emphasis that such changes have been basically minor refinements in grammar, expression, punctuation, clarification.

Do not belittle the possibility that many humble folk, young and old, possess such a testimony. Many possess a testimony that transcends the knowledge to be gained in academic and scientific fields.
