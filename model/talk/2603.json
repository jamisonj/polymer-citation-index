He had gone to the fields to talk with the Lord, to tell him that he had no more material possessions to sell or sacrifice or to use as collateral for borrowing. He needed to know how he could help his daughter go on a mission. The Lord, he said, told him to plant onions. He thought he had misunderstood. Onions would not likely grow in this climate, others were not growing onions, he had no experience growing onions. After wrestling with the Lord for a time, he was again told to plant onions. So he borrowed money, purchased seeds, planted and nurtured and prayed. The elements were tempered, the onion crop prospered. He sold the crop, paid his debts to the bank and the government and the Lord, and put the remainder in an account under her name\u2014enough to supply her wants on a mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/trust-in-the-lord.p33\" class=\"\">I will not forget the story or the moment or the tears in her eyes or the sound of her voice or the feeling in me as she said, \u201cBrother Hanks, I don\u2019t have any trouble believing in a loving Heavenly Father who knows my needs and will help me according to his wisdom if I am humble enough.

Nothing, not tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword, death, life, angels, principalities, powers, things present, things to come, height, depth, nor any other creature, could separate him from the love of Christ\u2014the love of God which is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
