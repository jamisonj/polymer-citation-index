You may not realize it, but when you are young you set the patterns that follow you throughout your entire life. It is so important that you set good patterns when you are young.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/personal-and-family-financial-preparedness.p9\" class=\"\">I am grateful that I had a father and mother who taught me as a boy the joy of work and the importance of paying my tithing and of spending less money than I made so that I could have something saved for my schooling and mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/personal-and-family-financial-preparedness.p10\" class=\"\">As a young boy, I raised chickens and sold eggs in the neighborhood, mowed lawns, worked in a warehouse and brickyard, and later sold printing. By working, I had my own money to spend, and I felt pretty grown-up. I paid my tithing, put some in a savings account for a mission and schooling, and the rest was mine to spend in any way I wanted to.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/personal-and-family-financial-preparedness.p11\" class=\"\">My parents taught me that tithing was a commandment of our Father in Heaven and a way for us to show our love for him and our appreciation for all the blessings he gives us. I still have a tithing receipt which was given to me when I was eight years old, and it is among my prized possessions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/personal-and-family-financial-preparedness.p12\" class=\"\">The younger a boy is when he learns these important lessons, the more they become a part of his life. I am sure that many of the blessings I have enjoyed throughout my life have come to me because as a boy I learned the importance of working and being thrifty, paying my tithing, and putting something away for my mission and schooling.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/personal-and-family-financial-preparedness.p13\" class=\"\">When a young man goes on a mission or to school and pays some of the cost, he generally works harder and is happier and more successful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/personal-and-family-financial-preparedness.p14\" class=\"\">Now, let me speak to you older priesthood bearers, as well as to the younger brethren.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/personal-and-family-financial-preparedness.p15\" class=\"\">Regardless of the difficulties existing in the world today, we as a people must recognize that we have been greatly blessed with the resources of this world.
