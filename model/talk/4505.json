He has always had the greatest confidence in their ability to do anything for which they are prepared. He taught a small son, age nine, how to manage a one-man sailboat, then let our son take the boat by himself out onto the lake. He joyfully sailed away, his bright life jacket and silhouette getting smaller and smaller against the horizon. Finally, we felt that Dave should make sure all was well, so in another little boat he sailed out to him. When he arrived Doug was sitting calmly in the boat, but he had forgotten how to turn it around! The thing I love was his response to his dad.

Many single sisters are living rich, full lives. They have made happy homes for themselves, their families, and friends. They serve as auxiliary leaders and teachers. They serve missions.

They make the world better for their being in it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/overcoming-challenges-along-lifes-way.p27\" class=\"\">There are those in this group who have never married, although most of them would like to do so.

Their challenges are many as they try to be both father and mother on what is most often a diminished income. If they are employed and trying to be self-reliant, there is great concern about quality child care. Even when their children are grown, single mothers are still mothers and share in the trials as well as the joys of their children.

Quite a long time later, after the spiritual healing had taken place and at the time of her baptism, she expressed great appreciation to a bishop who had shed tears of caring for her, even while being firm in the steps that must be taken; to a dear friend in Relief Society, who, she said, had helped her \u201cto understand and forgive all those who couldn\u2019t understand or forgive\u201d her; to those who had helped to keep her testimony strong in those quiet, desperate times when \u201ccoming home again\u201d seemed nearly impossible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/overcoming-challenges-along-lifes-way.p36\" class=\"\">I recently had a note from this friend, married now in the temple with a lovely family.

Pretending there is no problem, covering up for the behavior, or shielding the person from the consequences of that behavior will never solve the problem.

In Bruegel\u2019s painting, only his white legs are visible as he disappears into the green water.
