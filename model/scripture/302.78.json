[{"Verse":"0","Text":"<i>Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, March 1832. The order given of the Lord to Joseph Smith for the purpose of establishing a storehouse for the poor. HC 1:255\u2013257. It was not always desirable that the identity of the individuals whom the Lord addressed in the revelations should be known by the world; hence, in the publication of this and some subsequent revelations the brethren were referred to by other than their own names. When the necessity had passed for keeping the names of the individuals unknown, their real names were thereafter given in brackets. Since there exists no vital need today to continue the code names, the real names only are now used herein, as given in the original manuscripts.<\/i>"},{"Verse":"1","Text":"The Lord spake unto Joseph Smith, Jun., saying: Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God, who are ordained unto the high priesthood of my church, who have assembled yourselves together;"},{"Verse":"2","Text":"And listen to the counsel of him who has ordained you from on high, who shall speak in your ears the words of wisdom, that salvation may be unto you in that thing which you have presented before me, saith the Lord God."},{"Verse":"3","Text":"For verily I say unto you, the time has come, and is now at hand; and behold, and lo, it must needs be that there be an organization of my people, in regulating and establishing the affairs of the storehouse for the poor of my people, both in this place and in the land of Zion\u2014"},{"Verse":"4","Text":"For a permanent and everlasting establishment and order unto my church, to advance the cause, which ye have espoused, to the salvation of man, and to the glory of your Father who is in heaven;"},{"Verse":"5","Text":"That you may be equal in the bonds of heavenly things, yea, and earthly things also, for the obtaining of heavenly things."},{"Verse":"6","Text":"For if ye are not equal in earthly things ye cannot be equal in obtaining heavenly things;"},{"Verse":"7","Text":"For if you will that I give unto you a place in the celestial world, you must prepare yourselves by doing the things which I have commanded you and required of you."},{"Verse":"8","Text":"And now, verily thus saith the Lord, it is expedient that all things be done unto my glory, by you who are joined together in this order;"},{"Verse":"9","Text":"Or, in other words, let my servant Newel K.
