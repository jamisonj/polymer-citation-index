Such a view is irreconcilable with the teachings of Jesus and his apostles and of all that is left on record concerning the gifts and power of the Holy Ghost and its office among the children of men. On the contrary, all that is recorded leads us to suppose that if the Holy Ghost were to be bestowed upon an inhabitant of Europe, upon another person in Asia, another in Africa, and upon a fourth, in America, and again upon another on the islands of the sea, that these individuals were they to come together and converse upon the plan of salvation would entertain precisely similar views respecting that plan.

When men sought after Him in faith in the days of Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses and the prophets, and then again in the days of Jesus and His apostles, the same results followed the exercise of their faith. All may not have had direct and personal intercourse with Him, but all received the blessings they sought, and the guidance of His unerring wisdom has been granted unto them. This is proved from the first record made by Moses, down to the last made by John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos. We have no account of a generation, or of an individual, even, who served God and kept His commandments, that did not receive peculiar manifestations and blessings from Him. No one was left in doubt or darkness; no one had to be guided by tradition or by the teachings of others alone; but everyone, in every age and generation, received peculiar manifestations and blessings down to the time that John closed his record. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v12n1256\"> Seeing that this is the character of our Father in heaven and of the Gospel of His Son Jesus Christ, how is it that, today, there is opposition, strife, and uncertainty among those who call themselves the disciples of Jesus, if He is, as the Scriptures say, &#x201C;the same yesterday, today, and for<div class=\"hyphen\">-<span class=\"citation\" id=\"77367\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 77367)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(77367)\">Heb. 13:8<\/a><\/span><\/div><div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"365a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD12\/JoD12_0365.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;365a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9631\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>ever?&#x201D; This is an inquiry that every man, who professes any faith whatever, in Christ, should make, even if he does not endorse the idea that has been taught and testified to by the Latter-day Saints, viz., that God is a God of revelation, and that He has revealed Himself again in the latter days as He did in former days. For my part, with the view I now have respecting God, with the light that has been thrown upon my mind by the teachings of the Elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I could not be satisfied unless I had something more than the world say it is possible for men to obtain at the present time. I could not be satisfied with the records that we have in our midst containing the testimony of men who lived hundreds of years ago. I could not be satisfied to base my faith, and my hopes of salvation and future glory upon a testimony of what they realized any more than I could be satisfied when hungry by reading an account of a good meal partaken of by somebody else. I should want something more than this. I should want to know for myself that God is what others have said He is. I should want to know that He lives today, as He did 1,800 or 2,000 years ago, or as He did in the morning of creation. And if it were possible for men, by the exercise of faith, to obtain a knowledge for themselves, I would contend for that knowledge until I obtained it.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"78845\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 78845)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(78845)\">Jude 1:3<\/a><\/span> But the Lord be praised, we are not in this condition.

It ought to be a cause of thanksgiving, not only to the Latter-day Saints, but to every man who loves his fellow men, to witness that which is now being produced in the midst of the earth, the results of which we see in this Territory. I do not believe that a man who has any love for his fellow men can contemplate this condition of things without having his heart filled with joyous feelings. It is a source of wonder and gratitude to contemplate the fact that, a few years ago, a few apparently insignificant and illiterate men went forth bearing testimony that God had again spoken from the heavens, and had revealed the everlasting Gospel in its ancient purity and power, and that through this testimony thousands, from the various nations of the earth and the islands of the sea, have been gathered to these valleys, and are able to bear the same testimony. When I contemplate these facts my mind is swallowed up with admiration, and my heart is filled with gratitude and praise to our heavenly Father for the great work which He has founded and carried on successfully in the midst of the most determined opposition, and I feel that we, of all people now living, should thank and praise our Father and God that our lot has been cast upon the earth when these great events are in progress. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v12n1263\"> I know that the cry of &#x201C;delusion&#x201D; and &#x201C;false prophets&#x201D; is raised on  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"367a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD12\/JoD12_0367.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;367a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9629\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>every hand, and that the people, generally say, and have been saying for years, that &#x201C;the Latter-day Saints are deceived, and that their organization will speedily come to an end.&#x201D; Yet, despite these sayings, the work of God still goes on and is making rapid strides towards the fulfillment of that high destiny which its Author has predicted concerning it.

Scarcely a man whom he met would acknowledge that such a thing was possible or at all consistent with God's mode of dealing with the children of men in these days. It is true that he was successful in convincing a few that he had the testimony of Jesus. They obeyed God's doctrine taught to them and received the testimony; but for years after he started out to make this proclamation he had this kind of opposition to contend with.

I recollect very well the first time I got any intimation of it. I was on the Sandwich Islands on a mission; I had stepped into the house of a man who afterwards became a member of the Church. I happened to pick up a book, upon examining which, I found a good many things that struck me as being very strange. I thought, at first that it must be a work written by the  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"369a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD12\/JoD12_0369.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;369a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9627\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>Latter-day Saints; but I soon found that it was not. The argument of the writer was in favor of communication with the spirit world, through the ministering of angels, being as possible in these days as at former times. He used precisely similar arguments to those used by the Elders of this Church; and quoted largely from the Bible to prove that it had been quite common for men in ancient days to have such communications and to possess the gift of prophecy and the spirit of revelation, and he argued in favor of these modes of communication in these days. I was very much surprised at seeing such principles advocated by this book; but immediately, the recollection of Joseph's predictions flashed across my mind. I was but young at the time he made the remark, but I recollected it. I have had opportunities of watching the growth and development of this movement from that day to the present time. I have come in contact with many who profess to believe in spiritual communication; and in traveling through the United States at the present time you will find a great many individuals who entertain this belief. What has produced this change? Why, it is the very thing which Paul said would come. The people in his day would not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved, &#x201C;therefore&#x201D; said he, &#x201C;for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believe not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"75816\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 75816)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(75816)\">2 Thes. 2:11-12<\/a><\/span> They would not believe the testimony of the servants of God, therefore they were given up to hardness of heart and spiritual blindness.

In addition to this it is producing mental results of a wonderful and elevating character. It bestows upon those who obey its precepts heavenly knowledge, makes them wise in all things, causing them to become an infinitely better people than they were before.
