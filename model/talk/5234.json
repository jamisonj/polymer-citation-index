For a final song the director asked the children to sing \u201cI Am a Child of God.\u201d They quieted down, and for the first song of the entire session the voices unified in quality instead of quantity.

What a great burden of responsibility the Lord has placed upon us as parents: to take these children and lead them in the ways of holiness, to guide them through the perils of mortality, and to walk beside them on the straight and narrow path which leads to eternity. Yes, the responsibility is ours to teach them all they must do so that someday, as the mortal is changed to immortal, they will be prepared to return to the presence of the Father and dwell with him and their Elder Brother, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/born-of-goodly-parents.p10\" class=\"\">The Book of Mormon clearly shows the value of righteousness and dedication in parents.

Logic and physics tell us that we cannot pour a bucketful of water directly into a small glass. However, by using correct principles of transferring knowledge, the glass can be enlarged. Those principles are persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness and meekness, love unfeigned, kindness, and pure knowledge. They will enlarge the glass, which is the soul of the child, allowing that child to receive much more than the original bucketful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/born-of-goodly-parents.p18\" class=\"\">Behavioral psychologists have written libraries of books on this subject.

The words the scriptures use are \u201cto lift.\u201d The psychologists would say, \u201cReinforce the positive.\u201d The secret is simple. Always look for the good in the individual and lift, reinforce the positive by words and actions. Put-downs, words like \u201cstupid\u201d or \u201cdummy,\u201d or phrases like \u201cWhy can\u2019t you do anything right?\u201d destroy self-esteem and shouldn\u2019t be part of our vocabulary. It is impossible to emphasize the good in others if negative words or phrases are readily available on the tips of our tongues or expressed through our gestures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/born-of-goodly-parents.p20\" class=\"\">The plea behind the words \u201cWalk beside me, Help me find the way\u201d is this: \u201cLift me.
