This elderly\nstatesman, in explaining the reason for his determination and zeal told of an interview or\nrather a statement his own father&mdash;now long since dead&mdash;had made to his four his four sons\njust before he died. This is what the father said:\n<\/p><p>\nAmerica, with its government and constitution, is the greatest institution invented\nby the mind of man. If you let them touch a stick or stone of it, I will come back\nand haunt you.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I thought of that statement, my mind went back to our ancestors who pioneered in this\ndispensation even a greater constitution than that of this American nation, even the\nconstitution of the kingdom of God, which might be said to be another definition of the\ngospel of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the centennial year, the year just passed, we were reminded in pageant, in sermon, and\nin song, of our pioneers who came here and settled in these western valleys. We were\nreminded of their virtues, their accomplishments, and of the underlying principles that made\nthem willing to leave all that they possessed, and even willing to sacrifice their lives, if need\nbe to uphold and to maintain. As I remembered that and thought of the statement of this aged\nAmerican patriot, I wondered if we might not say:\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord help us to keep in memory our ancestors that we might be willing to\nuphold and sustain by our lives and all that we possess, that for which they gave\nso much.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF GATHERING\n<\/p><p>\nIf we thought deeply about the events of the centennial year, perhaps we were stirred by the\nrealization that we were but commemorating, the operation of a principle that is as old as the\nhuman family, a principle which has been invoked by the command of the Lord in every\ngospel dispensation. I refer to the principle of gathering.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first reference we have, in the revelations, to gatherings of the Lord's faithful people was\nthat spoken of when Adam gathered together his seven righteous sons, from Seth to\nMethuselah and all of their posterity, in the valley of Adam-ondi-ahman, and there he gave\nthem his last blessing and prepared them for the appearance of the Lord which they received\nat that time (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12524\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12524)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12524)\">D&amp;C 107:53-56<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI have thought it more than mere coincidence that one of the first martyrs in this dispensation,\nDavid W. Patten, a member of the Twelve Apostles, lost his life near the valley of\nAdam-ondi-ahman, that same valley in which Adam had gathered his posterity, which the\nLord had revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith was near Wight's Ferry, at a place called\nSpring Hill, Dayless County, Missouri. To me it has also been significant that this martyrdom\nresulted directly from the obedience of the Latter-day Saints to the commands that had been\ngiven to them to gather in certain places as members of the newly restored Church.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was the lament of the Master, just before his crucifixion:\n<\/p><p>\nO, Jerusalem, Jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are\nsent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a\nhen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34230\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34230)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34230)\">Matt. 23:37<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nApparently the Master was referring to the repeated revelations he had given to the prophets\nfrom Adam down to his time, in which he had told of not only the scattering of the children\nof Israel, but also of a subsequent gathering. To Jeremiah he had promised,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you\nunto Zion:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you\nwith knowledge and understanding\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26465\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26465)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26465)\">Jer. 3:14-15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo Ezekiel he said:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries\nwherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and\nwith fury poured out.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead\nwith you face to face (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23104\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23104)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23104)\">Ezek. 20:34-35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo the prophets Isaiah and Micah, he told of the time when,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the\nmountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25068\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25068)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25068)\">Isa. 2:2<\/a><\/span>;\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37877\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37877)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37877)\">Micah 4:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAn apt description of those who would be gathered thus, by command of the Lord, is given in\nthe parable of the Master, when he said that:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and\ngathered of every kind.\n<\/p><p>\nWhich, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered\nthe good into vessels, but cast the bad away\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34208\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34208)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34208)\">Matt. 13:47-48<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHE GATHERING IN THIS DISPENSATION\n<\/p><p>\nThe first command to gather, in this dispensation, was within six months after the Church was\norganized. The Prophet Joseph Smith, in announcing this revelation, made this significant\ndeclaration as recorded in the <i>History of the Church:<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\n. . . We soon found that Satan had been lying in wait to deceive, and\nseeking whom he might devour (<i>DHC<\/i> 1:109).\n<\/p><p>\nThe meaning of that revelation and the purpose of it all was explained in these words:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . and ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine elect\nhear my voice and harden not their hearts;\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore the decree hath gone forth from the Father that they shall be gathered\nin unto one place upon the face of this land, to prepare their hearts and to be\nprepared in all things against the day when tribulation and desolation are sent forth\nupon the wicked.\n<\/p><p>\nFor the hour is nigh and the day soon at hand when the earth is ripe; and all the\nproud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble; and I will burn them up saith\nthe Lord of Hosts, that wickedness shall not be upon the earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12437\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12437)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12437)\">D&amp;C 29:7-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThree years later the Lord again spoke upon this subject:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . It is my will, that all they who call on my name, and worship me according\nto mine everlasting gospel, should gather together, and stand in holy places\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12516\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12516)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12516)\">D&amp;C 101:22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThus, the Lord has said plainly to his Saints that the gathering was to prepare their hearts\n\"according to the everlasting gospel,\" and to be prepared in all things \"by standing in holy\nplaces.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSix years after the Church was organized, the keys of gathering were committed to Joseph\nSmith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple. The record of that marvelous restoration is\ngiven in these words:\n<\/p><p>\nAfter this vision closed, the heavens were again opened unto us; and Moses\nappeared before us, and committed unto us the keys of the gathering of Israel from\nthe four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the\nnorth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12528\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12528)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12528)\">D&amp;C 110:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe spirit of gathering has been with the Church from the days of that restoration. Those who\nare of the blood of Israel, have a righteous desire after they are baptized, to gather together\nwith the body of the Saints at the designated place. This, we have come to recognize, is but\nthe breath of God upon those who are converted turning them to the promises made to their\nfathers (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12422\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12422)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12422)\">D&amp;C 2:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPLACES OF GATHERING\n<\/p><p>\nBut the designation of gathering places is qualified in another revelation by the Lord to which\nI would desire to call your attention. After designating certain places in that day where the\nSaints were to gather, the Lord said this:\n<\/p><p>\nUntil the day cometh when there is found no more room for them; and then I have\nother places which I will appoint unto them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12515\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12515)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12515)\">D&amp;C 101:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThus, clearly, the Lord has placed the responsibility for directing the work of gathering in the\nhands of the leaders of the Church to whom he will reveal his will where and when such\ngatherings would take place in the future. It would be well&mdash;before the frightening events\nconcerning the fulfilment of all God's promises and predictions are upon us, that the Saints in\nevery land prepare themselves and look forward to the instruction that shall come to them\nfrom the First Presidency of this Church as to where they shall be gathered and not be\ndisturbed in their feelings until such instruction is given to them as it is revealed by the Lord\nto the proper authority.\n<\/p><p>\nREFUGE FROM THE STORM\n<\/p><p>\nAgain, in 1838, the Lord gave a further reason for the gathering:\n<\/p><p>\nVerily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the\nnations;\n<\/p><p>\nAnd that the gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her stakes, may be for\ndefense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without\nmixture upon the whole earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12538\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12538)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12538)\">D&amp;C 115:5-6<\/a><\/span>).\nWhy was this to be called a \"place of refuge\"\nand a \"place of safety\"? (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12452\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12452)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12452)\">D&amp;C 45:66<\/a><\/span>).\nSaid the Lord in another revelation,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . the glory of the Lord shall be there, and the terror of the Lord also shall be there,\ninsomuch that the wicked will not come unto it, and it shall be called Zion\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12453\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12453)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12453)\">D&amp;C 45:67<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe time when these things shall be would be as the Lord said, when:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . the wicked shall slay the wicked, and fear shall come upon every man;\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the saints also shall hardly escape; nevertheless, I, the Lord, am with them, and will\ncome down in heaven from the presence of my Father and consume the wicked with\nunquenchable fire (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12466\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12466)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12466)\">D&amp;C 63:33-34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnother and further reason for the gathering is given us with this revelation:\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, seeing that I, the Lord, have decreed all these things upon the face of the earth, I\nwill that my saints should be assembled upon the land of Zion;\n<\/p><p>\nAnd that every man should take righteousness in his hands and faithfulness upon his loins,\nand lift a warning voice unto the inhabitants of the earth; and declare both by word and by\nflight that desolation shall come upon the wicked\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12467\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12467)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12467)\">D&amp;C 63:36-37<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs we sit here today, we should be mindful of the fact that we are those of whom these\nrevelations have spoken. We are those who have been gathered from out of spiritual Babylon\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12569\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12569)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12569)\">D&amp;C 133:14<\/a><\/span>),\nor perhaps we represent the second or third or even the fourth or fifth generation of those\nwho heeded the call and felt the spirit of gathering. Just as was the case in the days of the\nProphet Joseph Smith, so in our day the leaders of the Church have told us that \"Satan has\nbeen lying in wait to deceive, and seeking whom he might devour\"\n<\/p><p>\nWARNING OF DANGERS\n<\/p><p>\nAs I have thought about these things, I have been sobered by the realization that during my\nlifetime three presidents of this Church have spoken upon those dangers which are within the\nChurch which are seeking to destroy us and to defeat the purpose of our gathering.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was President Joseph F. Smith who said:\n<\/p><p>\nThere are at least three dangers that threaten the Church within, and the authorities need to\nawaken to the fact that the people should be warned unceasingly against them. As I see these,\nthey are flattery of prominent men in the world, false educational ideas, and sexual impurity.\n<\/p><p>\nBut the third subject mentioned, personal purity, is perhaps of greater importance than either\nof the other two. We believe in one standard of morality for men and women. If purity of life\nis neglected, all other dangers set in upon us like the rivers of waters when the flood gates are\nopened (<i>Gospel Doctrine<\/i>, 1939 ed., pp. 312-313).\n<\/p><p>\nIt was President Grant during his declining years, who repeatedly&mdash;in all our conferences and\nin all his addresses&mdash;urged upon the Latter-day Saints to keep God's commandments, time and\nagain impressing upon us that there was no greater mission for him to perform, as the\nPresident of the Church, than to so warn the Latter-day Saints. By divine inspiration, he\ndirected a movement to build brotherhood in this day, designed to foster the greatest security\npossible in this material world. Much has been done to bring about the full purposes of the\nChurch welfare program, before it is too late, in order to provide that \"defense\" and that\n<\/p><p>\n. . . refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it will be poured out without mixture upon\nthe whole earth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12539\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12539)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12539)\">D&amp;C 115:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPresident George Albert Smith, who presides over us today, has repeatedly counseled the\nAuthorities of the Church and in his public addresses has spoken of the dangers that are\nconfronting the homes of our people today&mdash;the carelessness of marriage out of the Church\nand out of the temple, the lack of the sanctity of marriage, and a lack of an understanding of\nthe sanctity of the marriage covenant; the increase of divorce among us, the failure to hold\nsacred the covenants we have made in the House of the Lord. Well might we remember the\nwarning of the Lord to John, the Revelator, when he said:\n<\/p><p>\nBehold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk\nnaked, and they see his shame (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42193\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42193)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42193)\">Rev. 16:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs I think of the counsel of these, our leaders, that has been given us from time to time, I\nhave been reminded of a story told of a president of one of our great universities in Nova\nScotia who called his representatives to him and sent them out to teach a great principle to the\nhumble fishermen of that land. His parting counsel to them was: \"If you want to educate a\nman, you have to let him see a ghost.\"\n<\/p><p>\nDEFENSE AGAINST EVILS\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Latter-day Saints be haunted, if it need be, by the memory of those who pioneered\nthe work of gathering in this dispensation, and be haunted by the memory of the teachings\nand work of Adam and Moses; of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young and others of the\nprophets and the purposes for which the gospel has been restored, which the Lord told us in\nhis preface to the revelations was because he knew the calamities which were about to come\nforth upon the children of men (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12416\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12416)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12416)\">D&amp;C 1:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay we, as a people, see the \"ghost\" of our possibilities and that which we might be able to\naccomplish by our own strength and ability to stir us up to deeds of righteousness and to\nbuild a greater brotherhood to provide that defense against the evils which threaten to destroy\nour homes today.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we do all this in preparation for the coming of the Son of Man which, I pray God, may\nnot be long delayed. God speed us in that preparation while it is yet day and increase within\nus the testimony of the divinity of the work in which we are engaged. And as we may live in\nthe day when the terrors and trials and struggles, all foretold by the prophets, come to pass\nwhen \"fear shall be upon every man\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12465\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12465)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12465)\">D&amp;C 63:33<\/a><\/span>)\nand when it shall seem that there is no place safe upon\nthe earth, may the Latter-day Saints who are living the commandments of God be comforted\nagain by those words with which the Master has comforted those who have lived before us in\nsimilar times. \"Be humble, and the Lord will take you by the hand, as it were, and give you\nanswer to your prayers\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12532\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12532)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12532)\">D&amp;C 112:10<\/a><\/span>).\n\"Be still, and know that I am God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41748\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41748)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41748)\">Ps. 46:10<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12514\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12514)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12514)\">D&amp;C 101:16<\/a><\/span>).\nFor I bear you solemn witness\nthat I know these things told by the prophets are true. I know that those who have counseled\nus in our day of the dangers that are before us have spoken as the prophets of the Living God\nand I bear you this testimony humbly, in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
