My sister Sharon had a record she played over and over until she memorized the lines, and she still repeats them to me on occasion. It\u2019s about a young girl in a small mining town in Leadville, Colorado. She was found by some backwoods people, who raised her. They didn\u2019t know where she came from, but she had a drive and a hope inside of her that took her from that tiny mining town in Colorado to some of the most prestigious places in all of Europe. As her story unfolds, we learn of her dramatic experience on the ill-fated <span class=\"emphasis\">Titanic,<\/span> which sank to the bottom of the ocean with fifteen hundred people aboard. She managed to get into one of the lifeboats with a few others, and she began rowing. People were gripped with the fear of a watery grave. Many cried out in anguish, \u201cWe can\u2019t make it.\u201d But Molly never heard their cry, or if she did, she paid no attention, and she kept rowing and never gave up. The headlines of the <span class=\"emphasis\">New York Times<\/span> called her the \u201cUnsinkable Molly Brown.\u201d She was full of hope, and her unwavering hope inspired others with hope.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/a-time-for-hope.p23\" class=\"\">In the musical play, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Unsinkable Molly Brown,<\/span> we see Molly at first as a young, backwoods girl with few opportunities, no education, and no refinement. She is wrestling with her adopted brothers. They get her down. Her brother says, \u201cYou\u2019re down, Molly. You\u2019re down.\u201d And young Molly responds, \u201cI ain\u2019t down. I ain\u2019t down.

As a young girl, I remember standing at the kitchen window of our home and looking out, down the gravel road toward the east, as far out as I could see. On each side of the road was tall grass in the summer and deep snow in the winter, and only a few houses sprinkled along the way. I used to wonder, \u201cWhat is out there for me? Where do I belong?\u201d I\u2019m sure you must wonder that sometimes. At the end of our gravel road was the Indian reservation, and across the river a Hutterite colony. Things didn\u2019t seem too hopeful for me at that time. School had been very difficult for me. My friends were moving on without me, and I felt dumb. Do you have any idea what that feels like? It\u2019s awful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/a-time-for-hope.p32\" class=\"\">When I was twelve years old and feeling very discouraged after a long, hard winter, my mom and dad had a plan they worked out at some sacrifice that they hoped would give me hope. They determined to take me with them beyond our gravel road, out across the Canadian border, through the great states of Montana and Idaho, and eventually to Salt Lake City, Utah, the headquarters of the Church, to attend general conference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/a-time-for-hope.p33\" class=\"\">We arrived early on the first day of conference and waited in line, hoping to enter the great dome-shaped Tabernacle that I had only seen in pictures. I remember we had a seat right over there in the balcony on the left side where I could look down and actually see the prophet in real life and hear him speak, a thing I never dreamed would ever happen to me. When I heard the prophet of God speak at that time, I felt he was talking to me. The feeling I had was one of hope, and I began to understand about the real road to somewhere. I determined right then to plant my feet on that road\u2014the strait and narrow path leading to the celestial kingdom\u2014and never, never give up. I have come to know without any question that the gospel of Jesus Christ is the pathway to hope that leads us back to our Heavenly Father and our eternal home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/a-time-for-hope.p34\" class=\"\">Listen to our Father\u2019s promise to us.
