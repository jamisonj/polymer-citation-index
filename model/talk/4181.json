Jesus could have called upon legions of angels to bring Him down from the cross, but He did not. He endured to the end that we would have the benefits of the atoning sacrifice; that mercy could be brought into the world; that justice would be satisfied; that we might be resurrected; and that we might be able to earn, through our obedience, eternal life in the presence of God the Father and Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/lessons-from-the-atonement-that-help-us-to-endure-to-the-end.p25\" class=\"\">I had an experience recently which further illustrates these principles.
