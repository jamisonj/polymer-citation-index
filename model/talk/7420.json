They work hard and live quiet, peaceful lives separate from the world. Most of their food comes from their own farms. The women sew and knit and weave their clothing, which is modest and plain. They are known as the Amish people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-healing-power-of-forgiveness.p8\" class=\"\">A 32-year-old milk truck driver lived with his family in their Nickel Mines community. He was not Amish, but his pickup route took him to many Amish dairy farms, where he became known as the quiet milkman. Last October he suddenly lost all reason and control. In his tormented mind he blamed God for the death of his first child and some unsubstantiated memories. He stormed into the Amish school without any provocation, released the boys and adults, and tied up the 10 girls. He shot the girls, killing five and wounding five. Then he took his own life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-healing-power-of-forgiveness.p9\" class=\"\">This shocking violence caused great anguish among the Amish but no anger. There was hurt but no hate. Their forgiveness was immediate. Collectively they began to reach out to the milkman\u2019s suffering family. As the milkman\u2019s family gathered in his home the day after the shootings, an Amish neighbor came over, wrapped his arms around the father of the dead gunman, and said, \u201cWe will forgive you.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-00605_000_026\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[In Joan Kern, \u201cA Community Cries,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Lancaster New Era,<\/span> Oct. 4, 2006, p.
