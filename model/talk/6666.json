I share with you a touching account of a fine family that lived in the beautiful city of Perth, Australia. In 1957, four months before the dedication of the New Zealand temple, Donald Cummings, the father, was the president of the member district in Perth. He and his wife and family were determined to attend the dedication of the temple, although they were of very modest financial means. They began to pray, to work, and to save. They sold their only car and gathered together every penny they could, but a week before their scheduled departure, they were still 200 pounds short. Through two unexpected gifts of 100 pounds each, they met their goal just in time. Because Brother Cummings couldn\u2019t get time off work for the trip, he decided to quit his job.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/they-pray-and-they-go.p18\" class=\"\">They traveled by train across the vast Australian continent, arriving at Sydney, where they joined other members also traveling to New Zealand. Brother Cummings and his family were among the first Australians to be baptized for the dead in the New Zealand temple. They were among the first ones to be endowed in the New Zealand temple from far-off Perth, Australia. They prayed, they prepared, and then they went.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/they-pray-and-they-go.p19\" class=\"\">When the Cummings family returned to Perth, Brother Cummings obtained a new and better job.

Brother Krause, whose dedication to the Lord is legendary, is now 92 years of age.

He was immediately called to lead the Cottbus branch. Four months later, in November of 1945, the country still in ruins, district president Richard Ranglack came to Brother Krause and asked him what he would think about going on a mission. Brother Krause\u2019s answer reflects his commitment to the Church. Said he: \u201cI don\u2019t have to think about it at all. If the Lord needs me, I\u2019ll go.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/they-pray-and-they-go.p26\" class=\"\">He set out on December 1, 1945, with 20 German marks in his pocket and a piece of dry bread. One of the branch members had given him a winter coat left over from a son who had fallen in the war. Another member, who was a shoemaker, gave him a pair of shoes. With these and with two shirts, two handkerchiefs, and two pairs of stockings, he left on his mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/they-pray-and-they-go.p27\" class=\"\">Once, in the middle of winter, he walked from Prenzlau to Kammin, a little village in Mecklenburg, where 46 attended the meetings which were held. He arrived long after dark that night after a six-hour march over roads, paths, and finally across plowed fields. Just before he reached the village, he came to a large, white, flat area which made for easy walking, and he soon arrived at a member\u2019s home to stay the night.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/they-pray-and-they-go.p28\" class=\"\">The next morning the game warden knocked on the door of the member\u2019s house, asking, \u201cDo you have a guest?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/they-pray-and-they-go.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cYes,\u201d came the reply.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/they-pray-and-they-go.p30\" class=\"\">The game warden continued, \u201cThen come and take a look at his tracks.\u201d The large, flat area on which Brother Krause had walked was actually a frozen lake, and some time earlier the warden had chopped a large hole in the middle of the lake for fishing. The wind had driven snow over the hole and covered it so that Brother Krause could not have seen his danger. His tracks went right next to the edge of the hole and straight to the house of the member, without his knowing anything about it. Weighed down by his backpack and his rubber boots, he would certainly have drowned had he gone one step further toward the hole he couldn\u2019t see.

He had served long and had blessed ever so many lives. Years before, President Spencer W. Kimball shared with President Gordon B. Hinckley, Elder Bruce R.

President Kimball described how he interviewed, how he searched, and how he prayed, that he might learn the Lord\u2019s will concerning the selection.
