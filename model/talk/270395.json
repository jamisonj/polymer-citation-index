At 3:15 after the change of\n  guards, they, the guards, became more severe and threatening. About this time Elder Taylor sang&mdash;<i>A<\/i>\n  <i>Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief.<\/i> When he finished the song the Prophet requested him to sing it again,\n  which he did, reluctantly, as he did not feel like singing. At 4 p.m. Hyrum did some reading<span class=\"footRef\">2<\/span> to his\n  fellow prisoners. The guard was again changed, only eight men being stationed at the jail, the main\n  body of the Carthage Greys were in camp a quarter of a mile distant, on the public square. At 5 p.m.\n  the jailor, Mr. Stigall, suggested that the brethren return to the cell where they would be safer. The\n  Prophet turned to Dr. Richards and said, &ldquo;If we go into the cell, will you go in with us?&rdquo;  The Doctor\n  replied, &ldquo;Brother Joseph, you did not ask me to cross the river with you&mdash;you did not ask me to\n  come to jail with you&mdash;and do you think I would forsake you now? But I will tell you what I will\n  do; if you are condemned to be hung for treason, I will be hung in your stead,<span class=\"footRef\">3<\/span> and you shall go\n  free.&rdquo; Joseph said, &ldquo;You cannot.&rdquo; The Doctor said, &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">It was but a short time following this that there was a rustling at the door of the prison, the mob\n  had arrived and was bent on taking the lives of the prisoners, which, as we all know, they wickedly\n  did. The account of this tragedy is not to be related here. The reader is referred to the full account\n  of the awful and bloody deed as it is recorded in the <i>Documentary History of the Church.<\/i><\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"116544\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 116544)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(116544)\">D&amp;C 135:2<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">2. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112904\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112904)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112904)\">Ether 12:36-38<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"116560\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 116560)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(116560)\">D&amp;C 135:4-5<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">3. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108261\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108261)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108261)\">Matt. 26:35<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108590\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108590)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108590)\">Luke 22:33<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108787\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108787)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108787)\">John 13:37<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108827\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108827)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108827)\">John 15:13<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110605\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110605)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110605)\">1 Jn. 3:16<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
