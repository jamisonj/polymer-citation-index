McKay<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">(Read by his son, Robert R. McKay)<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">David O. McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1967, pp. 149-153<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nAs this great conference draws to a close, I bear testimony that our anticipations, our hopes,\nand our prayers that it might prove to be uplifting and inspirational have been realized.  May\nthere come into everyone's heart, and into all our homes, the true spirit of Christ, our\nRedeemer, whose reality, whose inspiring guidance I know to be real.\n<\/p><p>\nThe gospel is our anchor. We know what it stands for.  If we live it, feel it, and bear record\nto the world by the way we live, we will contribute to its growth and upbuilding. Speak well\nof it, of the priesthood, of the Authorities; let the standards of the gospel radiate in our lives.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Contribute to the better life<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe cannot go from this great conference without an added responsibility to contribute to a\nbetter life around us. As individuals, we must think nobler thoughts. We must not encourage\nvile thoughts or low aspirations.  We shall radiate them if we do.  If we think noble thoughts,\nif we encourage and cherish noble aspirations, there will be that radiation when we meet\npeople, especially when we associate with them.\n<\/p><p>\nThe gospel finds its greatest expression in the individual.  It finds expression in the home, as\nwe have heard in this conference.  Our homes radiate what we are, and that radiation comes\nfrom what we say and how we act in the home.  No member of this Church&mdash;husband,\nfather, or child&mdash;has the right to utter an oath in his home or ever to express a cross word to\nhis wife or to his children or to parents. We contribute to an ideal home by our character, by\ncontrolling our passions, our temper, by guarding our speech, because those things will make\nour homes what they are and what they will radiate to the neighborhood. Anger, hatred,\njealousy are but tools of destruction.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Radiation of divine influence<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior set us the example&mdash;always calm, always controlled, radiating something which\npeople could feel as they passed.  Remember the woman who touched his garment? The\nSavior felt something go from him (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31711\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31711)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31711)\">Luke 8:43-48<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;that radiation which is divine.\n<\/p><p>\nEach individual soul has that divine radiation.  The body is only the house in which we live. \nGod help us to radiate strength, control, love, charity (which is another name for love),\nconsideration, and best wishes for all human beings.  We should do what we can to produce\npeace and harmony, no matter what we may suffer.\n<\/p><p>\nWe leave this conference today with greater responsibility than ever before&mdash;as men of the\npriesthood, as women of the Church, and as the youth who are the leaders of tomorrow&mdash;to\nmake our homes such as will radiate to our neighbors harmony, love, community duties,\nloyalty.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd what is the responsibility which rests upon every member of the Church? Read the 107th\nsection of the Doctrine and Covenants, and there find enumerated the duties of the various\norganizations of the priesthood. In the 99th verse, we find the following: \n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Every man learn his duty\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is\nappointed, in all diligence\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15041\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15041)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15041)\">D&amp;C 107:99<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTwo principles in that admonition stand out as the duty of the officers to whom this\nrevelation was given: first, to learn&mdash;to know what one's duty is; and second, to act in all\ndiligence in the performance of duty.\n<\/p><p>\nTo know one's duty, to learn the truth, is the duty of every member of the Church, of every\nman and woman in the world.\n<\/p><p>\nAll mankind, I believe, are being impelled, lifted upward by that Spirit which makes them\ndesire the truth. There is a natural feeling which urges men and women toward truth; it is a\nresponsibility placed upon mankind. That responsibility rests upon members of the Church in\na greater degree than upon their fellowmen.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is no one great thing that we can do to obtain eternal life, and it seems to me that the\ngreat lesson to be learned in the world today is to apply in the little acts and duties of life the\nglorious principles of the gospel. Let us not think that because some of the things we have\nheard during this conference may seem small and trivial, they are unimportant. Life, after all,\nis made up of little things. Our life, our being, physically is made up here of little heartbeats. \nLet that little heart stop beating, and life in this world ceases.\n<\/p><p>\nThe great sun is a mighty force in the universe, but we receive the blessings of its rays\nbecause they come to us as little beams, which, taken in the aggregate, fill the whole world\nwith sunlight.\n<\/p><p>\nThe dark night is made pleasant by the glimmer of what seem to be little stars; and so the\ntrue Christian life is made up of little Christ-like acts performed this hour, this minute, in the\nhome, in the priesthood quorum, in the organization, in the town, wherever our life and acts\nmay be cast.\n<\/p><p>\nIn an article written at 88 years of age by Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick, New York City's\nRiverside Church minister, author of 35 books, and known nationwide for his Sunday\nbroadcasts and his dauntless dedication of his own life to the brotherhood of man and the\nFatherhood of God, when asked, \"Isn't it hard to believe there is a moral order in the universe\nwhen we look around us today?\" he said, \"No harder than it always has been.  There never\nwere any 'good old days.' The tragedy of the human heart has been the same since time\nbegan&mdash;the tragedy of man's blinding self-concern that prevents him from accepting God's\nways.\n<\/p><p>\n\"In this world if we want physical results, we must fulfill physical conditions.  If we want\nspiritual results, we must fulfill spiritual conditions.  This is the law of life, and it is both\nstern and magnificent. Modern religion says: Go out in God's world and fulfill His conditions. \nIf you want health, fulfill the conditions of health&mdash;physical, mental, and\nspiritual.  What a man sows he indeed reaps. Sow friendliness and reap friendship. Sow\nunselfishness and reap an enlarged life. Sow goodwill and reap a better world for our\nchildren.  Sow worship&mdash;the uplift of the heart toward the Highest&mdash;and reap openhearted\nresponsiveness to things Eternal.\" (<i>Reader's Digest<\/i>, October 1966, p. 71.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Gospel is established among men<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us and all the world to sense the reality that the gospel of Jesus Christ is established\namong men, and that through obedience to it the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of\nman may be realities to eve mother and father, every son and daughter.  God hasten the day\nwhen that testimony will be real in every heart.\n<\/p><p>\nThroughout this conference you have heard testimony from men who, with tears in their eyes,\nif you were close enough to see, their lips quivering with emotion, testified that they know\nthat God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that the Father and the Son appeared to the\nProphet Joseph Smith and gave instructions about organizing Christ's Church; and that Peter,\nJames, and John, who held the authority from the Christ himself, gave that authority in this\ndispensation; that the Melchizedek Priesthood was bestowed upon the Prophet Joseph and\nOliver Cowdery; that John the Baptist, who baptized Jesus Christ, bestowed the Aaronic\nPriesthood.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>My testimony<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nYou know that, and you know these men who have given you their testimonies during this\nconference. I give you my testimony that God lives; that he is close to us; that his Spirit is\nreal; that his voice is real; that Jesus Christ, his Son, stands at the head of this great work;\nand that no matter how much of the atheistic philosophy takes hold of the blinded boys and\ngirls and men who hear Satan's voice, the truth stands as declared by the Father and the Son\nto that boy Prophet.  You and I, and all true members of The Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints, have the responsibility to declare that truth to the world; and the world is\nfull of honest men and women waiting to hear that truth.  Let us not condemn them. \nCondemn the evil men who would blind them with their sophistry and with false reasoning.\nSome of our young boys are so blinded, but it is our duty as officers of the Church to lead\nthem from the things of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, what do we mean by the world?  It is sometimes used as an indefinite term.  I take it\nthat the world refers to the inhabitants who are alienated from the saints of God. They are\naliens to the Church, and it is the spirit of this alienation from which we should keep ourselves\nfree. We are told by Paul not to conform to the fashions of the world (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"465\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 465)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(465)\">1 Cor. 7:31<\/a><\/span>). Timothy was warned\nnot to partake of those things&mdash;the evils of the world&mdash;and to \"flee also youthful lusts: but\nfollow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure\nheart\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5169\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5169)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5169)\">2 Tim. 2:22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The pure in heart<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nPurity of heart! Zion is the pure in heart (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15018\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15018)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15018)\">D&amp;C 97:21<\/a><\/span>), we have been told, and the strength of this Church\nlies in the purity of the thoughts and lives of its members.  It is then that the testimony of\nJesus abides in the soul and strength comes to each individual to withstand the evils of the\nworld.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is the responsibility of every member of the Church to preach the restored gospel to every\nnation, kindred, tongue, and people, that the evils of the world may be met by the\ncounteracting forces of truth.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Quicken discernment and recognition of temptation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhen do temptations come?  They come to us in our social gatherings; they come to us at\nour weddings; they come to us in our politics; they come to us in our business relations; on\nthe farm, in the mercantile establishment. In the dealings in the affairs of life we find these\ninsidious influences working; and it is when they manifest themselves to the consciousness of\neach individual that the defense of truth ought to exert itself.  There may\nnever come a greater opportunity to defend this Church.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen that still small voice calls to the performance of duty, insignificant though it seems, and\nits performance unknown to anyone save the individual and God, he who responds gains\ncorresponding strength.  Temptation often comes in the same quiet way. Perhaps the yielding\nto it may not be known by anyone save the individual and his God, but if he does yield to it,\nhe becomes to that extent weakened and spotted with the evil of the world.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Beware hidden influences of evil<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt is the unseen influence at work in society that is undermining the manhood and womanhood\nof today.  It is these unseen influences that come from the world that overcome us when we\nare least prepared to defend ourselves.  When we do not withstand the encroachments of these\nevil influences, we weaken the possibility of defending the Church of Jesus Christ. This is an\nindividual work, and what the individuals are, that the aggregate is.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Divine blessings for righteousness<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you, my dear fellow workers.  Bless you in your homes. Make your faith shown by\nyour works in your home.  Husbands, be true to your wives, not only in act, but in thought;\nwives, be true to your husbands.  Children, be true to your parents; do not arrogate to\nyourselves that they are old-fashioned in their beliefs and that you know more than they do. \nGirls, follow that sweet mother and her teachings.  Boys, be true to your fathers, who want\nhappiness and success for you, which come only through living the principles of the gospel. \nStrangers, seeing such homes, will say, \"Well, if that is the result of Mormonism, I think it is\ngood.\" You will show by your faith and acts in everyday life what you really are.\n<\/p><p>\nTo no other group of men in all the world is given a better opportunity to serve mankind than\nthat which is afforded the elders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  To\nestablish salvation and peace to the extent of their individual efforts, their lives are dedicated.\nTo make the world a better or a safer or a fitter place for man, their talents and means are\nconsecrated.\n<\/p><p>\nJust to be associated with you, with men striving toward such an aim, is a joy, and to assist\nyou in this quest, an inspiration. Unselfishly you are trying to serve your fellowmen in love.\nYou are true followers of the Master, for to those who have the Christian faith, the most\nsublime of his teachings, and to him who penetrates its deepest sense, the most human of all\nis this: To save mankind, the Lord came to dwell among us in the form of man, and was\nwilling to make himself known by this&mdash;simple, though glorious, principle love.\n<\/p><p>\nThe animal world is filled with selfishness, each thing seeking its own life, its own\nperpetuation.  But Christ lived for love.  \". . . love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and\nwith all thy soul, and with all thy mind . . . And . . . thy neighbour as thyself\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35737\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35737)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35737)\">Matt. 22:37,39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless the elders and the sisters who, if not with perfect love, at least with a desire to\nbring joy and peace to others, are engaged in the noblest calling of life.  Worth servants of\nChrist you are!&mdash;our teachers, followers of the true Redeemer, our Lord. There is nothing\ngreater than this noble work, none more righteous.  Yours is the joy promised by the Savior,\nwho said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and\nbring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of\nmy Father!\n<\/p><p>\n\"And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the\nkingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14911\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14911)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14911)\">D&amp;C 18:15-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Blessing to hold and honor divine authority<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you men of the priesthood. May you hold it in dignity and \nrighteousness that comes from within, not from without.  To hold the priesthood of God by divine\nauthority is one of the greatest gifts that can come to a man. He is greatly blessed who feels\nthe responsibility of representing Deity.  He should feel it to such an extent that he is\nconscious of his actions and words under all conditions.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless our friends who are contributing to the advancement of this great Church.  We are\ngrateful for their friendship and goodwill.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us that we may go home with a firmer resolve than we have ever had before to live\nthe gospel of Jesus Christ, to be kind to our families and to our neighbors, to be honest in all\nour dealings so that men, seeing our good works, may be led to glorify our Father in heaven\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35681\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35681)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35681)\">Matt. 5:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI leave my blessings with you, with the sick and afflicted, with our men in the service, and\nwith our missionaries scattered around the world.  I pray that God's protecting care will be\nwith them wherever they are.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you officers and leaders, stake presidencies and bishoprics, of the Church.  May the\nlove of the Redeemer be in each heart, and that means that the love will be expressed in\nserving one another.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless these brethren of the General Authorities for their devotion and untiring efforts in\nfurthering his work on earth.  May they be blessed with increased health and strength to carry\non their great responsibilities throughout the world.\n<\/p><p>\nI know that God lives, that his Son Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, and that divine\nbeings restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith the gospel of Jesus Christ as he established\nit in the meridian of time.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear this testimony as we part this afternoon, and pray the blessings of the Lord to be upon\neach of you, that the influence of the priesthood quorums, of auxiliaries, and of the\nmissionaries may be more effective from this time forward than ever before in leading the\nhonest in heart of the whole world to turn their hearts to the worship of God and give them\npower to control the animal nature and live in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
