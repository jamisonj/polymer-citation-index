A morning prayer and an early search in the scriptures to know what we should do for the Lord can set the course of a day. We can know which task, of all those we might choose, matters most to God and therefore to us. I have learned such a prayer is always answered if we ask and ponder with childlike submission, ready to act without delay to perform even the most humble service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p19\" class=\"\">On many days, doing what matters most will not be easy. It is not supposed to be. God\u2019s purpose in creation was to let us prove ourselves. The plan was explained to us in the spirit world before we were born. We were valiant enough there to qualify for the opportunity to choose against temptation here to prepare for eternal life, the greatest of all the gifts of God. We rejoiced to know the test would be one of faithful obedience even when it would not be easy: \u201cAnd we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-00605_000_034\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50543\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50543)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50543)\">Abraham 3:25<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p20\" class=\"\">Hard as we knew the test would be, we felt joy because we had confidence that we could pass it. Our confidence came from knowing that Jesus Christ would come into the world as our Savior. He would overcome death. He would make it possible for us to be cleansed of our sins by qualifying for the effects of His Atonement.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p21\" class=\"\">We also knew some reassuring facts about what it would take to receive the purifying which we would need. Everything that cleansing would require\u2014baptism by authority, receiving the Holy Ghost under the hands of authorized priesthood bearers, remembering Him and therefore having His Spirit to be with us, and then keeping His commandments\u2014all would be possible for the humblest of us. It would not take superior intellect, nor would it take wealth, nor long life. And we knew that the Savior would draw us to Him and would have the power to help us when the test would be hard and the temptation to procrastinate great. Alma, the great prophet, described how Christ gained that ability:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-00605_000_034\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50288\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50288)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50288)\">Alma 7:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p24\" class=\"\">All of us will need His help to avoid the tragedy of procrastinating what we must do here and now to have eternal life. For most of us the temptation to delay will come from one or both of two feelings. They are polar opposites: one is to be complacent about what we have already done, and the other is to feel overwhelmed by the need to do more.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p25\" class=\"\">Complacency is a danger for us all. It can come to naive youth who feel that there will be plenty of time in the future for spiritual things. They might think that they have already done enough, considering the brief time they have lived. I know from experience how the Lord can help such a youth to see that he or she is in the midst of spiritual things, now. He can help you see that classmates are watching you. He can help you see that their eternal future is shaped by what they observe you do or not do. Your simple thanks for their influence for good on you can lift them more than you imagine. When you ask God, He can and will reveal to you the opportunities to lift others for Him, which He has placed around you from your infancy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p26\" class=\"\">Complacency can affect even the seasoned adult. The better and the longer you serve, the more likely that the tempter can place this lie in your mind: \u201cYou have earned a rest.\u201d You may have been the Primary president in your little branch twice. Or you may have worked long and hard on your mission and sacrificed so much to serve. Or perhaps you were the pioneer in the Church where you live. The thought may come: \u201cWhy not leave the service to the new people. I have done my part.\u201d The temptation will be to believe that you will return to serve again, someday.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p27\" class=\"\">The Lord can help you see the danger in taking a rest because you feel you have done enough. He helped me by letting me have a conversation with one of His aged servants. He was feeble, his body weakened by decades of faithful labor and by illness. His doctors no longer allowed him to leave his home. At his request, I reported a trip I had taken in the Lord\u2019s service, across several nations, in dozens of meetings, and in many private interviews, helping individuals and families. I told him of the gratitude people expressed to me for him and his many years of service. He asked me if I had another assignment soon. I told him about another long trip soon to come. He surprised me, and he gave me an inoculation against complacency which I hope will last forever, when he grabbed my arm and said, \u201cOh, please, take me with you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p28\" class=\"\">It is hard to know when we have done enough for the Atonement to change our natures and so qualify us for eternal life. And we don\u2019t know how many days we will have to give the service necessary for that mighty change to come. But we know that we will have days enough if only we don\u2019t waste them. Here is the good news:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the days of the children of men were prolonged, according to the will of God, that they might repent while in the flesh; wherefore, their state became a state of probation, and their time was lengthened, according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-00605_000_034\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50253\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50253)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50253)\">2 Nephi 2:21<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p30\" class=\"\">That assurance from the Master can help those of us feeling overwhelmed by our circumstances. In the hardest trials, as long as you have the power to pray, you can ask a loving God: \u201cPlease let me serve, this day. It doesn\u2019t matter to me how few things I may be able to do. Just let me know what I <span class=\"emphasis\">can<\/span> do. I will obey this day. I know that I can, with Thy help.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p31\" class=\"\">The quiet invitation to you may be to do so simple a thing as to forgive someone who has offended you. You can do that from a hospital bed. It may be to go to help someone who is hungry. You may feel overwhelmed by your own poverty and the labors of the day. But if you decide not to wait until you have more strength and more money, and if you pray for the Holy Spirit as you go, you will when you arrive know what to do and how to help someone even poorer than you are. You may find when you get there that they were praying and expecting that someone like you would come, in the name of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p32\" class=\"\">For those who are discouraged by their circumstances and are therefore tempted to feel they cannot serve the Lord this day, I make you two promises. Hard as things seem today, they will be better in the next day if you choose to serve the Lord this day with your whole heart. Your circumstances may not be improved in all the ways which you desire. But you will have been given new strength to carry your burdens and new confidence that when your burdens become too heavy, the Lord, whom you have served, will carry what you cannot. He knows how. He prepared long ago. He suffered your infirmities and your sorrows when He was in the flesh so that He would know how to succor you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/this-day.p33\" class=\"\">The other promise I make to you is that by choosing to serve Him this day, you will feel His love and grow to love Him more.
