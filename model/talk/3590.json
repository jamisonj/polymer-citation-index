And it is true that the God-given right to choose one\u2019s course of action is an indispensable prerequisite to such freedom. Without it we can scarcely enjoy any type of liberty\u2014political, economic, or personal. It is one of our greatest heritages. For it we are deeply indebted to our Father in Heaven, to the Founding Fathers, and to the pioneers. God gave it to man in the Garden of Eden.

The Founding Fathers, under the Lord\u2019s inspiration, wrote a guarantee of it into the fundamental law of the land. And the pioneers, led by the inspiration of heaven, gave their all to perpetuate it.

This they did while living under a government providing for the freest exercise of agency. \u201cTheir laws and their governments,\u201d says the record, \u201cwere established by the voice of the people, and they who chose evil were more numerous than they who chose good.\u201d Therefore, \u201cthey could not be governed by the law nor justice, save it were to their destruction.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24732\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24732)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24732)\">Hel. 5:2\u20133<\/a><\/span>.)

Notwithstanding Samuel\u2019s warning that a king would make servants of their children, lay heavy taxes and services upon their backs, and send them to war, \u201cthe people refused to obey the voice of Samuel, [saying,] Nay; but we will have a king over us;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-perfect-law-of-liberty.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cThat we also may be like all the nations.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2647\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2647)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2647)\">1 Sam. 8:19\u201320<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-perfect-law-of-liberty.p25\" class=\"\">Samuel therefore anointed Saul to be their king. In due time, just as Samuel had predicted, heavy burdens were laid upon them, their sons and daughters were made servants of the king, and war came. The nation was divided into two kingdoms, Israel and Judah, both of which were, in their turn, carried away into captivity. Not only did they lose their political freedom, but their very political existence as nations was terminated.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-perfect-law-of-liberty.p26\" class=\"\">We have a classic example of the loss of economic freedom by the misuse of free agency in the book of Genesis. The Egyptians, instead of exercising their agency to provide for themselves against a day of need, depended upon the government. As a result, when the famine came they were forced to purchase food from the government. First they used their money. When that was gone, they gave their livestock, then their lands; and finally they were compelled to sell themselves into slavery, that they might eat.

However, the free agency possessed by any one person is increased or diminished by the use to which he puts it. Every wrong decision one makes restricts the area in which he can thereafter exercise his agency. The further one goes in the making of wrong decisions in the exercise of free agency, the more difficult it is for him to recover the lost ground. One can, by persisting long enough, reach the point of no return. He then becomes an abject slave. By the exercise of his free agency, he has decreased the area in which he can act, almost to the vanishing point.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-perfect-law-of-liberty.p35\" class=\"\">Samuel, the Lamanite prophet, speaking to those who so persisted, said: \u201cIn the days of your poverty ye shall cry unto the Lord; and in vain shall ye cry, for your desolation is already come upon you, and your destruction is made sure; and then shall ye weep and howl in that day \u2026 and say: \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-perfect-law-of-liberty.p36\" class=\"\">\u201cO that we had repented in the day that the word of the Lord came unto us. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-perfect-law-of-liberty.p37\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are encircled about by the angels of him who hath sought to destroy our souls. \u2026 O Lord, canst thou not turn away thine anger from us?
