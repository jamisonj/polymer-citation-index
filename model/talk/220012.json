I sometimes think that if we were deprived for a little season of the privilege of meeting together, and partaking of those sacred emblems, we would attach more importance to our meetings and to the ordinances of the Lord's House. If we were deprived of the privilege of listening to the voice of the servants of God instructing us in our duties for a time, perhaps we would value their teachings more than we do. The absence of the music this afternoon from our large organ puts me in mind of this. I am sorry we cannot have music from the organ today. I like to hear the tones which come from that fine instrument, an organ built by the handiwork of the people of God, of this community, when played upon by a good musician. Perhaps if we are deprived of the use of that organ for a little while we will value it the more after the repairs are completed. So it is with our public gatherings; so it is with the various means of grace which are so abundantly bestowed upon us as the children of God. God has been very merciful to us in affording us so many privileges of instruction. All the time there is a voice saying, &#x201C;This is the way, walk ye in it.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"58955\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 58955)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(58955)\">Isa. 30:21<\/a><\/span> There is no need for any man or any woman among the Latter-day Saints to go astray for the lack of instruction.

We have our Sunday Schools to which we can send our little children that they may be taught in the way of life, and in the paths of holiness and virtue before the Lord. We have our Ward meetings on Sunday evenings, where we can meet together in a Ward capacity, and bear our testimony to the truth, or receive instructions from our Bishops and from the missionaries, who may visit us from time to time. And during the week we have many opportunities of assembling together, to hear the word of life, to talk to one another of the things of God, and be instructed in our various duties, both temporal and spiritual. Then we have the great privilege given us of God, that all the time we may draw near unto the throne of grace and receive for ourselves, individually as well as collectively, the power of the Holy Spirit to enlighten us in regard to the purposes of God, to strengthen us against sin, to enable us to cultivate the good that is in us, and grow up unto him who is our living head in all things, even the Lord Jesus.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"75272\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 75272)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(75272)\">Eph. 4:15<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v22n262\"> This is the greatest boon that could be conferred upon mortals while dwelling in the flesh, the gift of the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, the Spirit of truth,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"128525\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 128525)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(128525)\">John 15:26<\/a><\/span> which reveals unto men the things of the Father and of the Son,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"70485\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 70485)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(70485)\">John 16:13-15<\/a><\/span> which is a spiritual light to the inward being, which is the same to the spiritual nature of man as the light that streams from the sun is to the physical nature of man.

There is a way by which this gift of the Holy Ghost as a spirit of revelation to make manifest the things of the Father and of the Son, and make them plain to mortal men in the flesh can be obtained. What is it? It is pointed out very clearly in the Scriptures, but strange to say the great bulk of the people who profess to believe in the Scriptures, do not take that way when it is made plain to their understanding. In the first place, according to the Scriptures, men must believe in God. They cannot come to him without they believe in him. Faith must be quickened in the human heart, and all people have power to believe. When a servant of God, inspired by the Holy Spirit, preaches the word of life, those who are desirous of the truth will be stirred up into faith by the power of his testimony and his preaching, and the authority of the Priesthood he bears.
