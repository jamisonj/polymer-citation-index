Good-by,\n  Brother Cahoon, we shall see you again.&rdquo;  In a few minutes afterwards Joseph came from his family.\n  His tears were flowing fast. He held a handkerchief to his face, and followed after Brother Hyrum\n  without uttering a word.<\/p>\n  <hr class=\"centerQuarter\">\n  <p class=\"summary\">Late that night the Prophet and Patriarch were taken across the river by Orrin P. Rockwell preparatory to their start\n  towards the Rocky Mountains. Early the next morning other brethren joined them. That same morning a posse arrived\n  in Nauvoo to arrest Joseph Smith, but they did not find him, but they did succeed in creating fear in the hearts of some\n  of the timid. At one p.m. that day Orrin P. Rockwell, who had returned to Nauvoo, arrived with a letter from Emma\n  Smith, requesting the Prophet to return to Nauvoo. The Prophet and Patriarch with Willard Richards were in a room\n  where they had assembled provisions preparatory for their journey. Reynolds Cahoon informed the Prophet what the\n  troops intended to do and urged upon him to give himself up, inasmuch as the Governor had pledged his faith and the\n  faith of the state to protect him while he underwent a legal trial. The Prophet, however, knew that the word of the\n  Governor was not to be received in good faith. At this point our narrative continues.<\/p>\n  <hr class=\"centerQuarter\">\n  <div class=\"topic \">False Accusations<\/div>\n  <p class=\"std\">Reynolds Cahoon, Lorenzo D. Wasson and Hiram Kimball accused Joseph of cowardice for\n  wishing to leave the people, adding that their property would be destroyed, and they left without\n  house or home. Like the fable, when the wolves came the shepherd ran from the flock, and left the\n  sheep to be devoured.<span class=\"footRef\">5<\/span> To which Joseph replied: &ldquo;If my life is of no value to my friends it is of none\n  to myself.&rdquo;<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">Joseph said to Rockwell, &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; Rockwell replied, &ldquo;You are the oldest and ought\n  to know best; and as you make your bed, I will lie with you.&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> Joseph then turned to Hyrum, who\n  was talking with Cahoon, and said, &ldquo;Brother Hyrum, you are the oldest, what shall we do?&rdquo; Hyrum\n  said, &ldquo;Let us go back and give ourselves up, and see the thing out.&rdquo; After studying a few moments,\n  Joseph said, &ldquo;If you go back I<\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"116541\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 116541)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(116541)\">D&amp;C 135:1,6<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">2. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"106475\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 106475)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(106475)\">2 Kgs. 9:7<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">3. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108714\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108714)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108714)\">John 7:25<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108724\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108724)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108724)\">John 8:37,40<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110907\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110907)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110907)\">1 Ne. 2:1<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112761\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112761)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112761)\">4 Ne. 1:31<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">4. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110908\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110908)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110908)\">1 Ne. 2:2<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"111069\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 111069)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(111069)\">2 Ne. 1:3<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"111145\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 111145)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(111145)\">2 Ne. 5:5<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"111465\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 111465)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(111465)\">Omni 1:12<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112881\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112881)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112881)\">Ether 9:3<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"116072\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 116072)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(116072)\">D&amp;C 127:1<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">5. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107481\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107481)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107481)\">Ezek. 34:5,8<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108746\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108746)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108746)\">John 10:12<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">6. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"106886\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 106886)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(106886)\">Ps. 139:8<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
