During the night, darkness is everywhere and the vision of all is dimmed; none can see afar off. Though the heavens teem with stars\u2014an uncounted host of them\u2014and though the moon\u2014she who rules the night\u2014reflects her rays of borrowed light, yet the darkness is not pierced; the blackness of the night continues.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p9\" class=\"\">Deep shadows hide the beasts of forest and field. Wildcats stalk their prey in silence. Packs of hunger-maddened wolves strike terror in their victims as their howling calls draw nearer and nearer. Coyotes are baying in the distance; somewhere a lion roars; and in that deepest shadow a jackal lurks, awaiting his chance to steal the slain game of another. The terrors of the night are real.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p10\" class=\"\">But finally a distant dawn is heralded. The morning stars shine forth more brightly than their fellows. A few rays of light part the darkness of the eastern sky, a sky still spotted with clouds. Beyond the mountains, not many leagues away, a new day is gestating in the womb of nature. As the earth turns slowly on its decreed course, the dawn brightens; the light of the morning increases; darkness flees. The stars no longer shine; the moon hides her face; their reflected glimmerings no longer pierce the blackness of the night. The sun rises. The blazing light of heaven covers the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p11\" class=\"\">When the dawn comes and the sun shines, the doleful creatures of the night begin to retire. The lions return to their lair and the foxes to their holes; the baying of the coyotes is no longer heard; and the howling wolves are silent. The terrors that lurked in the shadows are now hidden in the rocks and in the caves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p12\" class=\"\">With the new dawn the flowers in the field and the trees in the forest take on new life. The oxen in their stalls and the sheep in their cotes awake from sleep, while the fowls of heaven sing praises to the Lord of Sabaoth, to the Creator of the first day. The blessings of life and light are everywhere seen. It is a new day\u2014a day of joy and rejoicing and light.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p13\" class=\"\">When the gospel sun went down almost two millennia ago, when the priesthood was taken away and a dreary dusk descended in the congregations that once had known light, when light and truth no longer shone forth from heaven, and when those on earth no longer were taught and directed by apostles and prophets, then spiritual darkness reigned. Darkness covered the earth and gross darkness the minds of the people.

The prophets and seers were silenced; the holy scriptures were no longer made available to the masses of men; none could see the way to perfection; none knew the way back to the Eternal Presence. Earth\u2019s pilgrims, walking in and by forbidden paths, were lost in the blackness of the night.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p15\" class=\"\">True, the heaven still teemed with stars, an uncounted host of them, for there were many wise and good people who reflected forth to others such light and truth and goodness as they had. And month after month a new moon arose to reflect such of heaven\u2019s truths as came by instinct and from reason. There was a St. Augustine, a Maimonides, a Joan of Arc, a Thomas More, a Michelangelo, a Galileo, a host of others\u2014each for the month when their moon shone\u2014who reflected such borrowed light as in their power lay. But the light of heaven no longer shed its rays on the strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p16\" class=\"\">And there were deep shadows in which the beasts of hell lurked. Lucifer did not sleep. At Nicaea and later by the pen of Athanasius he aided in the writing of creeds which debased the true gods of heaven and defined them as an incomprehensible spirit essence which fills the immensity of space.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p17\" class=\"\">By the word of Constantine he placed the subjects of a pagan empire into what men have since called the universal church. With the sword of Cortez he placed a cross in the hands of pagan people and named them Christians. By the mouth of Tetzel he sold indulgences so that men\u2019s sins could be forgiven for money, as they supposed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p18\" class=\"\">In Spain, in Mexico, and in Peru, he caused the evils of the Inquisition to flourish, and tens of thousands of earth\u2019s inhabitants were slain to keep down heresy, as they chose to call it. The Huguenots and other dissenters from the established order were murdered by the scores of thousands. The dominant religion of the day was one of fear, ignorance, and superstition; it was a religion, imposed by the sword, which denied the agency of man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p19\" class=\"\">It was a long, dark night. There were jackals in the shadows, wolves in the forests, coyotes everywhere. Lions roared and the fangs of the serpent sank again and again into human flesh. The black plague swept Europe. Wars were everywhere. Morality and decency had few supporters. The terrors of the night were real and the night was long\u2014long and dark and black.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p20\" class=\"\">But finally the heralds of a distant dawn came forth. There was a Calvin, a Zwingli, a Luther, a Wesley; there were wise and good men\u2014morning stars who shone more brightly than their fellows\u2014who arose in every nation. There were men of insight and courage who were sickened by the sins and evils of the night. These great souls hacked and sawed at the chains with which the masses were bound. They sought to do good and to help their fellowmen\u2014all according to the best light and knowledge they had.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p21\" class=\"\">In Germany and France and England and Switzerland and elsewhere groups began to break away from the religion of centuries past.

And in due course, by the power of the Father, a new nation was created, a nation \u201cconceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\u201d (Abraham Lincoln, Gettysburg Address.) The United States of America came into being. Beyond the mountains, now not many leagues away, a new day was gestating in the womb of nature.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p23\" class=\"\">As the earth continued to turn slowly and steadily on its decreed course, as the dawn brightened and the morning light increased, as the Constitution of the United States guaranteed religious freedom, as men were tempered in their feelings and began to view each other with more equity and fairness, as the Bible was published and read by more people, as darkness fled and light increased, the time for the rising of the gospel sun was at hand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p24\" class=\"\">When the set time had fully come\u2014when the day for the promised restoration of all things was at hand\u2014the Lord in heaven, in his infinite wisdom, mercy, and goodness, sent from the courts of glory that eternal spirit whose foreordained mission it was to usher in the dispensation of the fulness of times. Joseph Smith began his mortal life. It was December 23, 1805. The sun was then just hidden by the mountain peaks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-morning-breaks-the-shadows-flee.p25\" class=\"\">Then one glorious day in the spring of 1820\u2014our tradition says that it was on April 6\u2014the sun arose to view. The great God with the Lord Jesus at his right hand came down from heaven; stood personally in a grove of trees in western New York; called young Joseph by name; commanded him to join none of the churches of the day, for they were all wrong; told him that all their creeds were an abomination in the sight of heaven; and said that the professors of religion were all corrupt, that they drew near to the Lord with their lips, but their hearts were far from him, that they taught for commandments the doctrines of men, having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.

Once more there were visions and tongues and prophecies; the sick were healed, the lame walked, the blind saw, and the dead were raised.
