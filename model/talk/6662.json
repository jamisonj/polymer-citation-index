What a special blessing it is to bear the priesthood of God, which can only multiply our powers, abilities, and discernment. To illustrate the blessings received from this privilege, I would like to speak about two men of God, both of whom carried the name of Joseph.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/becoming-men-in-whom-the-spirit-of-god-is.p6\" class=\"\">My father had a unique experience when he was the age of a priest. There were no high schools where he lived, and he wanted an education. He received permission from his father to leave the farm and seek his education elsewhere, but he had to make it on his own. Arriving in Salt Lake City, he heard of an employment position being offered in the home of President Joseph F. Smith. He was hired to care for the prophet\u2019s two cows. In our family home evenings we would want Dad to relate experiences about his early life of living in the home of the prophet. We would hear him make reports like this:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/becoming-men-in-whom-the-spirit-of-god-is.p7\" class=\"\">Sister Smith instructed my father in his duties, explaining that the cows \u201cwere aristocrats, and you must treat them well. You are to keep them so clean and train them so well that if I should ever at any time conclude to move them into the parlor, they would be clean enough to enter.\u201d Dad said he understood milking but not laundering cows.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/becoming-men-in-whom-the-spirit-of-god-is.p8\" class=\"\">Before milking each morning and night, they were thoroughly washed and dried with hot water, soap, and towels prepared for that purpose. They were fed the best of hay and milked at exactly the same hour twice a day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/becoming-men-in-whom-the-spirit-of-god-is.p9\" class=\"\">In addition to his duties with the Smith family and their \u201caristocratic\u201d cows, my father was asked on occasion to do some housework. He would tell us stories like this: \u201cOne frosty morning I washed the steps leading to the official residence of the President of the Church. It nearly led to his downfall, for I let the water freeze before drying. Then I had to take boiling water and thaw the ice and take towels to dry the stones. The steps were nearly clean, but my classmates were passing on their way to school before the job was completed. It was a humbling experience.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/becoming-men-in-whom-the-spirit-of-god-is.p10\" class=\"\">By telling these stories, I don\u2019t want to leave you with the impression that my father was a male twin to Cinderella. The Smith family took this poor farm boy from Idaho into their home while he finished high school and attended the University of Utah. They included him in their family activities, around the dinner table, and at family prayer. My father shared with us his witness that the prophet Joseph F. Smith was truly a man of God: \u201cWhen I kneeled with the prophet, in family prayer, and listened to his earnest supplications for the blessings of the Lord upon his family and their flocks and their herds, I realized that those same humiliating cows were the subject of his blessings, my feet were brought solidly to earth. \u2026 Most great men I have known have been deflated by intimate contact. Not so with the prophet Joseph F. Smith. Every common everyday act added inches to his greatness. To me he was prophet even while washing his hands or untying his shoes.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/becoming-men-in-whom-the-spirit-of-god-is.p11\" class=\"\">The lessons learned taught us a great appreciation and love for a prophet of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/becoming-men-in-whom-the-spirit-of-god-is.p12\" class=\"\">My father\u2019s description of the prophet Joseph F.

I don\u2019t think my father ever imagined our modern-day computers that sit on small desks and have speeds measured in gigahertz, storage measured in gigabytes. I also don\u2019t think he ever imagined the evils that Satan can do with these same marvelous technologies. Through his evil ways, Satan has been able to spread many new, infectious viruses. These viruses will inflict great damage on our spirits if we do not have powerful ways of defending against them. This causes me to think of the greatest antivirus program of all\u2014that is the gift of the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/becoming-men-in-whom-the-spirit-of-god-is.p14\" class=\"\">About this gift, President Joseph F. Smith said: \u201c\u2018The gift of the Holy Ghost,\u2019 is a special blessing sealed upon baptized repentant believers in Jesus Christ, and is \u2018an abiding witness.\u2019 The spirit of God may be enjoyed as a temporary influence by which divine light and power come to mankind for special purposes and occasions. But the gift of the Holy Ghost, which was received by the apostles on the day of Pentecost, and is bestowed in confirmation, is a permanent witness and higher endowment\u201d (in James R. Clark, comp., <span class=\"emphasis\">Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,<\/span> 6 vols.

Then, all of us must rely on the gift of the Holy Ghost to guide us in discerning right from wrong. This is where the example of Joseph of Egypt helps instruct each of us. He was a man who relied on the Spirit of the Lord so completely that even a man who was blinded by the practice of idolatry, namely Pharaoh, recognized his unusual countenance and strength.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/becoming-men-in-whom-the-spirit-of-god-is.p16\" class=\"\">Let us try tonight to see what great messages we can gain from a study of great leaders we find in the scriptures.

In antediluvian times, when the lives of men were greatly prolonged, some were called to act at comparatively tender years.

Joseph was a member of a family that had 11 brothers\u201410 of them were older than he. His father seemed to favor him more than the others. He made Joseph a coat of many colors, let him remain at home, and instructed him occasionally to go out and check up on his brothers who were tending the flocks. Joseph also had dreams that seemed to put him in a place of authority ahead of his brothers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/becoming-men-in-whom-the-spirit-of-god-is.p19\" class=\"\">One day when Joseph was checking up on his brothers as they tended the flocks, they decided they\u2019d had about enough of Joseph and wanted to do away with him.
