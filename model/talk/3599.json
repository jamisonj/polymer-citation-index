I\u2019m just glad we\u2019re friends.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p4\" class=\"\">You know, conference is a great time for spiritual uplift, for association, and for wise counsel. With all the counsel I\u2019ve been hearing, I couldn\u2019t help but reminisce a little bit about the young athlete who attempted most all sports but had never tried skydiving. And so he took several theoretical courses in how to jump.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p5\" class=\"\">When the day came for the solo flight, he became a little fearful, so he approached his instructor and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to go through with this.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p6\" class=\"\">The instructor said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll protect you by putting two added parachutes on you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p7\" class=\"\">The plane took off and arrived at the three thousand foot level. With some fear and trepidation he was pushed out.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p8\" class=\"\">On the way down, at about two thousand feet, he remembered that that\u2019s when you pull the rip cord. He did so, and the chute didn\u2019t open. He pulled the second, and it didn\u2019t open. He pulled the third, and it didn\u2019t open.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p9\" class=\"\">To his amazement, at about that time he met in the air, coming up from the ground, another man. They passed on the way. The young parachutist shouted to his new friend, \u201cPardon me,\u201d he said, \u201cdo you know anything about parachutes?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cNo,\u201d his friend shouted back, \u201cwhat do you know about Coleman lanterns?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p11\" class=\"\">I suppose it seems all of us are in need of good counsel. Quite often parents and many young people ask the question, \u201cHow do you teach the gospel so that it\u2019s meaningful and applicable?\u201d Do you know, my brothers and sisters, that learning any concept or principle or changing any behavior pattern requires five important steps?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p12\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">First,<\/span> you have to expose a person. <span class=\"emphasis\">Second<\/span> is the law of repetition. <span class=\"emphasis\">Third<\/span> is to give understanding, the why. People of all ages want to know the whys of the gospel, not just the rules. This is the most important aspect of teaching because the <span class=\"emphasis\">fourth<\/span> step, that of conviction, and the <span class=\"emphasis\">fifth,<\/span> application, cannot occur until we understand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p13\" class=\"\">Too often our answers to young people\u2019s inquiries are \u201cWell, because the scriptures say so\u201d or \u201cThat is what the leaders tell us.\u201d Young people want to know why the scriptures say so and why the leaders are so concerned.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p14\" class=\"\">Let me just share a little personal experience that happened some years ago at the university.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p15\" class=\"\">I\u2019d been in a very special meeting with some young people. We had been talking about temple marriage. As we departed the session, I was walking with three young ladies, one of whom I knew quite well. I had become aware that she had been dating a boy out of the faith, and I just cautiously suggested to her that you tend to marry those you date. I said, \u201cI am planning on the day when I can perform your sealing in the temple.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p16\" class=\"\">She looked at me and she said, \u201cWell, I may not get married in the temple.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p17\" class=\"\">And I said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p18\" class=\"\">And she looked at me as only young people can, and said, \u201cWhy should I?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p19\" class=\"\">All right, mom and dad, teacher. What do you tell them?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p20\" class=\"\">Like most teachers, I paused to stall and think. Then, hoping for inspiration, I said, \u201cWell, why shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p21\" class=\"\">She looked at me and she said, \u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p22\" class=\"\">And I said, \u201cPlease.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p23\" class=\"\">She said, \u201cHow well do you know my father?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p24\" class=\"\">I said, \u201cReasonably well.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p25\" class=\"\">She said, \u201cMy dad puts on a pretty good front. Oh, he\u2019s a fine man, but he\u2019s a little hypocritical.\u201d She said, \u201cYou ought to see the way he treats my mom and us at home. And you know, my mom and dad were married in the temple. And I don\u2019t want a marriage like that.\u201d She said, \u201cHow well do you know Brother and Sister So-and-so?\u201d\u2014another acquaintance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p26\" class=\"\">I said, \u201cI know them.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p27\" class=\"\">She said, \u201cDid you know I babysit for them. They too are married in the temple, and I wouldn\u2019t care for a marriage like that.\u201d She said, \u201cHow well do you know Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so?\u201d This is a wonderful member of our community, not of our faith. Ten children. She said, \u201cI babysit that family too, and I\u2019d like a marriage like theirs.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p28\" class=\"\">Now what do you say, mom and dad? Teacher? The scriptures say so? Well, that\u2019s what the leaders teach. Young people are after whys and wherefores.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p29\" class=\"\">I was still a little puzzled. Standing nearby was another young lady. I turned to her and I said, \u201cHow do you answer that?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p30\" class=\"\">She was alert. She turned to her friend and she said, \u201cJan, you\u2019re not fair.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p31\" class=\"\">Jan said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p32\" class=\"\">She said, \u201cBecause you\u2019re judging the whole church by two or three examples that don\u2019t represent, necessarily, what we believe and teach or how we should live.\u201d She said, \u201cLet me ask you a question. When was the last time you had a little personal crisis, maybe a frustrating date, a test, a social situation that worried you a little bit, where your dad sensed it and came into your bedroom and sat on the edge of the bed and stroked your head and said, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t you like a blessing tonight?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p33\" class=\"\">Jan looked at her and said, \u201cWell, my dad doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p34\" class=\"\">The little girl said, \u201cMy dad does.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p35\" class=\"\">And then together they talked about how her dad regularly taught the family. An experience was shared regarding family prayer. She listed some eight or nine such moments without even pausing. I could see a little change in Jan\u2019s heart. You could see in Jan\u2019s eyes the expression, \u201cOh! I would like a husband like that.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p36\" class=\"\">I had the thrill some months later of performing that marriage, in the temple. I\u2019d like to think that night, a change occurred.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p37\" class=\"\">Most wrong choices before and after marriage are not made out of rebellion or intentional error but because of misinformation, miscommunication, and lack of understanding. In most cases, if couples truly understood the whats and the whys and the hows of eternal marriage, no one would have to talk them into the right choices. Indeed, no one would be able to talk them out of them!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p38\" class=\"\">Let me ask you young people a question: have you ever wondered why God would restrict us from some things, advise us strongly against them, warn us, even command us? Do you think his commandments are just arbitrary whims, artificial tests of some kind, generalities that are important for some people but not for others?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p39\" class=\"\">I don\u2019t think so! His commandments are <span class=\"emphasis\">loving counsel from a wise Father.<\/span> Our understanding and concept of God as a loving and personal Heavenly Father allows us no other definition. He gives us commandments for one reason only\u2014because he loves us and wants us to be happy. Chastity is a perfect example. God simply knows that virtue is its own reward, that the saving of oneself for one eternal partner makes that commitment more beautiful, more joyful. It is the simple question of whether you want a penny now or a diamond later. Any momentary pleasure that might result from a premarital relationship cannot be compared with the vastly greater joy of oneness in marriage. And the indulgence in the former can destroy the potential for the latter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p40\" class=\"\">Chastity is like money in the bank. As you save yourself you are <span class=\"emphasis\">saving<\/span> the joy of belonging to one and only one. You are saving the joy of being able to say, \u201cI am all yours, and I have never been anyone else\u2019s.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p41\" class=\"\">Some will ask, \u201cWhat if we already know who \u2018the one\u2019 is? What if the commitment is already there and we\u2019re just waiting for the ceremony?\u201d The answer is, <span class=\"emphasis\">it\u2019s not just a ceremony,<\/span> it\u2019s a covenant, both with God and with your partner, and <span class=\"emphasis\">waiting<\/span> shows the deepest love and respect for both.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p42\" class=\"\">Some will say, \u201cBut we love each other too much to wait.\u201d The answer is that there is no such thing as too much love and that it is too much selfishness, not love, that debates divine counsel and violates virtue.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p43\" class=\"\">Any love that is to become eternal must include respect, faith, trust, admiration, honor, and have spiritual and mental aspects as well as physical and emotional. No relationship, either temporal or eternal, can exist without these attributes. Every soap opera is filled with accurate illustrations of misery because these qualities are absent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p44\" class=\"\">If, in your case, the physical tends to dominate, all the more reason to bridle it and find the other dimensions. <span class=\"emphasis\">Bridle<\/span> is the word that wise father Alma used in counseling his son Shiblon, and the promise he attached is the key to understanding: \u201cBridle \u2026 your passions, that ye may be filled with love.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9352\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9352)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9352)\">Alma 38:12<\/a><\/span>.) Bridling increases strength, increases power, increases love. There are absolutely two ways you can control a horse. (We learned a little bit about horses last night.) One is to kill it; one is to bridle it. Alma never said kill your passions. The implication is <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> that passions are evil, that we shouldn\u2019t have them. On the contrary, we bridle something we love, something whose power we respect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p45\" class=\"\">A horse is stronger than a man, so the man bridles it, thus <span class=\"emphasis\">controlling<\/span> its power and using that power for good. Passions are stronger than we are, so we bridle them, thus controlling their power and using that power to strengthen a marriage and forge it into eternity. One has to know <span class=\"emphasis\">how<\/span> to bridle a horse or a passion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p46\" class=\"\">Remember, a physical relationship is simply too beautiful to squander, too wonderful to waste. It is the sterling silver too precious to tarnish before the beauty of the banquet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/teach-the-why.p47\" class=\"\">Let us remember that understanding \u201cthe why\u201d in learning is what develops proper attitudes or changes behavior. God grant us the wisdom to teach wisely and with understanding, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
