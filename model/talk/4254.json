After years of exercising military pomp and prowess and after extending his kingdom from Macedonia to Egypt and from Cyprus to India, he wept when there seemed to be no more world to conquer. Then, as evidence of just how ephemeral such power is, Alexander caught a fever and died at thirty-three years of age. The vast kingdom he had gained virtually died with him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/an-apostles-witness-of-the-resurrection.p4\" class=\"\">Quite a different young leader also died at what seems such an untimely age of thirty-three. He likewise was a king, a pupil, and a conqueror. Yet he received no honors from man, achieved no territorial conquests, rose to no political station. So far as we know, he never held a sword nor wore even a single piece of armor. But the Kingdom he established still flourishes some two thousand years later. His power was not of this world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/an-apostles-witness-of-the-resurrection.p5\" class=\"\">The differences between Alexander and this equally young Nazarene are many. But the greatest difference is in their ultimate victories. Alexander conquered lands, peoples, principalities, and earthly kingdoms. But he who is called the Perfect Leader, he who was and is the Light and Life of the world\u2014Jesus Christ the Son of God\u2014conquered what neither Alexander nor any other could defeat or overcome: Jesus of Nazareth conquered death. Against the medals and monuments of centuries of men\u2019s fleeting victories stands the only monument necessary to mark the eternal triumph\u2014an empty garden tomb.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/an-apostles-witness-of-the-resurrection.p6\" class=\"\">Last week, we and all the rest of the Christian world celebrated Easter. In our great general conference of the Church, we lengthen the Easter season today to remember him and honor this pivotal event in the lives of all mankind.
