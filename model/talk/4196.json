A wide range of opinions has been expressed regarding the extent to which these new disclosures should affect our perceptions of the traditional and scriptural accounts of Joseph\u2019s divine calling and his part in bringing about the restoration of the gospel and the church of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/by-their-fruits-ye-shall-know-them.p4\" class=\"\">In my remarks today I do not wish to make any assessment of the validity of the newly discovered documents nor the extent to which they might, in the eyes of some, affect the reconstruction of Church history. I would like, instead, to point to some ultimate tests that can be applied to determine the divine nature of any religious work. These are tests which the Lord himself prescribed. They overreach the tentative significance of any historical document that may survive the passage of time, whether it relates to specific events or to the people who participated in the events. The Lord\u2019s work is known by its fruits. Often, documents of historical interest reflect, at best, the way one individual recalls or perceives events or the actions and motives of those who participated in them. Such reflections may be interesting, but they may not always be accurate. They may even tell more about the one doing the reflecting than the one being reflected upon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/by-their-fruits-ye-shall-know-them.p5\" class=\"\">In any case, the Lord\u2019s test is the only one that will stand with the passage of time and reveal the truth about those who claim to do his work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/by-their-fruits-ye-shall-know-them.p6\" class=\"\">The Savior acknowledged that there would be imposters who would attempt to pass themselves off as his authorized representatives.

In our business dealings, are we fair and honest and prompt in meeting our obligations; is our word as good as our bond? Are our private and innermost thoughts free from the contaminations of the world? Do they reflect our absolute loyalty and fidelity to those with whom we have made eternal vows? Are we nourishing through prayer and a regular study of the Lord\u2019s revealed truths the spiritual and moral strength which is required in today\u2019s environment? In the entertainment and recreation we seek, are we keeping ourselves unspotted from the world and in harmony with the Lord\u2019s holy Sabbath?
