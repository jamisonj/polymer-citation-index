We are His spiritually begotten children. Knowing our relationship to God helps us better understand where we came from and what our eternal possibilities are. Knowing Him, we learn better how to approach Him and how we ought to live in order to please Him. Our earthly sojourn is part of a divine plan of happiness designed by Him, which beckons us to live by faith, to gain mortal experiences, and to become qualified through obedience and the power of the Atonement to return to His presence forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/words-to-live-by.p14\" class=\"\">We live in a world marked by great diversity: different lands, cultures, races, and languages. To some degree, at least, one must believe that this is the way God intended it to be. The gospel teaches us that, notwithstanding these differences, we are all children of the same Heavenly Father. The human race is one family, and we are all, therefore, brothers and sisters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/words-to-live-by.p15\" class=\"\">As siblings, we must see that our Heavenly Father loves His children equally, as any good earthly father would. Courtesy, kindness, generosity, and forgiveness are all elements of proper conduct among family members. Imagine the disappointment of a perfect, loving Father who sees His children treating each other badly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/words-to-live-by.p16\" class=\"\">Life is short. \u201cIt is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26045\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26045)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26045)\">James 4:14<\/a><\/span>). In the precious time that we have in mortality, there are many things to be done. Some of these things are more important than others, and we must make wise decisions.
