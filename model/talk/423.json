To me it is a high privilege\nto stand before this audience. I am extremely grateful to my Heavenly Father. I pray that he\nmay let me speak his word.\n<\/p><p>\nLOOK UP TO THE SPIRES\n<\/p><p>\nWhile coming over to this meeting this afternoon, I had quite an impressive incident happen\nto me. I greatly admire these grounds. I often chat with the men who make the flowers grow\nand bloom.\n<\/p><p>\nToday I met a familiar brother. I said: \"Well, I see you are working today.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Yes, Brother Kirkham.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Don't you ever get tired? I see you here early in the morning, and I have seen you here late\nat night.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Oh, yes, I get tired once in awhile, but the people enjoy the flowers, and once in awhile they\nlook up at the spires.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI would love to put it into the heart of every man and woman in this Church that they must\nnot grow weary. Way out in your own private lives, in service in the kingdom of God, it may\nbe that at times you may be weary, but I bear humble testimony because of what I have seen\nthroughout the stakes of Zion and especially in the missionary field, that men with whom you\nhave patience and with whom you patiently work, often \"look up to the spires.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI was deeply impressed at the Smithfield conference last Sunday. A fine young woman\nwas reporting her attendance at a state convention. One hundred and twenty young women\nhad been called to one of our large institutions from all parts of the state. They were studying\nAmerican citizenship opportunities. At the stake conference she was asked to make a report.\nShe did so, and it was helpful and inspiring. All at once I saw her grasp the pulpit, and with\nrare dignity she said to the audience: \"I want to bear my testimony.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen in beautifully chosen words, with deep humility, she declared her faith in God and her\ngratitude for her heritage, for the blessings she enjoyed.\n<\/p><p>\nBE UNAFRAID\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure with many of the words of warning that have come to us during this conference,\nand as we do face a world of great uncertainty, so great, and so fraught with possible\ndestruction we are almost frightened to speak about it at times, or they who know most about\nit are silent, and yet, in my humble thinking, I say, be unafraid. If we are living as we should\nlive, then there need be no fear. Our faith in God will give us strength, assurance, a sense of\nsafety and security. We need have no fear.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of our great American thinkers has said:\n<\/p><p>\nWe do not need to fear these things. We need to fear whether man has faith in\nGod.\n<\/p><p>\nGREATNESS IN YOUTH\n<\/p><p>\nAll my life I have labored with youth, in the out-of-doors, largely. My humble illustrations\ncome largely from that field. I know that deep within youth there is greatness. It is a natural\nlaw that the Lord will preserve the right and the truth, and soon you and I will pass this on to\nthe hands of a great generation of youth.\n<\/p><p>\nI stood a few years ago with a group of youth in Holland where the tulips grow. There were\nabout a hundred and fifty young American youths about me. We went down to see the\nloveliest tulip beds in the world. Flowers were not blooming in abundance then, but here and\nthere and in the hothouses there were some fine specimens. An elderly Dutch gardener came\nout when he saw we had arrived. I remember he held up a brown bulb and said: \"This will be\nmy prize winner at the fair.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAll we saw were the brown husks of the tulip bulb, but he saw beyond that. He saw the prize\nbulb at the Holland fair.\n<\/p><p>\nI appeal to you, do not neglect your duty to youth but have faith in them. They may look like\nbrown bulbs today, but they will be prize winners tomorrow. They are marching into the\ngreatest world and are the greatest generation, in my humble opinion, that the world\nhas ever seen. That is my faith. I only wish that I might march with\nthem and be a lad of twelve years.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord will be with them and strengthen them. They are magnificent. I have just left a\nhundred and seventy-five of them in the Northwestern States Mission. It was thrilling to catch\ntheir spirit and their hope and their devotion to the service of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nSUN ALWAYS THERE\n<\/p><p>\nOut in the Zuni Indian village one day I followed the runner who went out to give his daily\nceremony to the coming of the sun. On the hilltop he stretched forth his arms and chanted.\nWhen he started to return to the village, I walked over to him and said, \"It is cloudy this\nmorning. Do you always come?\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then he said, \"Oh, the sun is always there.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThat is it. \"The sun is always there.\" Let us have faith and know that the sun is always there.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to read one verse from Timothy:\n<\/p><p>\nFor God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a\nsound mind (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5102\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5102)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5102)\">2 Tim. 1:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis thought I would like to suggest in connection with youth and in connection with our own\nlives: There are many things that will give us inspiration and guidance. It is astonishing when\nyou hear men frankly and freely bear their testimonies&mdash;when the message came to their\nhearts, that was the moment when the Lord spoke to them. I pray that the Lord will quicken\nthe best within us. We are likely to refer to it as conscience. I believe that men and women\nwho live humbly and prayerfully may have within themselves the blessing of the Spirit of\nGod, the gift of the Holy Ghost, a power that will guide them, protect them, reveal to them\ntruth, give them knowledge throughout their days, for their own blessing and protection.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Somehow we must get back to God,\" said a great American, \"and that is very difficult for\nmodern minds who have lost simplicity.\" I shall read a few verses from the Ninetieth Psalm:\n<\/p><p>\nReturn O Lord...\n<\/p><p>\nO satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days\n. . .\n<\/p><p>\nLet thy work appear unto thy servants and thy glory unto their children.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41753\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41753)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41753)\">Ps. 90:13-14,16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHE VOICE WITHIN\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that this spirit of a voice within  the Lord trying to speak to us and guide us, may be\nwith us. It is a very personal affair. We do not need to wait for any great occasion depending\non someone else to assist us. His Spirit will be with us every day, at\nall times, if we serve God humbly and pray for his guidance.\n<\/p><p>\nThis delightful experience came in the form of a testimony out in the mission that I recently\nvisited. A young missionary bearing his testimony of what it meant to the family for a young\nman to go on a mission, and how the Lord truly provided, recited this incident:\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I left home I didn't know whether father would be able to make it or not\nin keeping up the expenses but he and mother said \"Go, we'll do the best we can\nfor you, Son.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI came into the missionary field. We had been getting along all right and last week\nI received a letter from father. He told the story that they were working hard and\nthey had harvested a good crop, and then he told the story of my little brother\neleven years old.\n<\/p><p>\nDad said, \"I have been giving your brother work on the binder. We were giving\nhim fifty cents an acre to run it. He had done very well; he had worked early and\nlate. Then the day came when we were to pay him. The neighbors had sent in\ntheir checks and I was going to pay him. I asked him: 'Now Son what are you\ngoing to do with the money?' Your brother said: 'Well, Father, I want a pair of\nLevis and I want to go to the County Fair and the rest I want to send to my\nbrother on his mission.'\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe enjoyed that voice within. The Lord was guiding him in his tender years. He had caught\nthe spirit that his brother had in missionary service.\n<\/p><p>\nWith the same feeling I bear my testimony: have patience wherever you are called to labor,\nthat those for whom you work may \"look up to the spires,\" and receive inspiration and\ncomfort. Oh, listen to the voice within, that it may guide you safely on the way. Do not be\ndisturbed by the scare lines of papers and commentators on the radio. Know that you have\nGod with you if you but do his will.\n<\/p><p>\nI thank him humbly for these things, and I bear testimony and pray for all of us, in the name\nof Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
