Isaacson, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1951, pp. 74-78<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nPresident Clark, President McKay, my other beloved brethren of the General Authorities, and\nmy dear brethren of the priesthood, truly this is nearly breathtaking, and I feel very humble in\nstanding here tonight. I am sure we didn't expect this tonight, and I will be grateful if I can\nhave an interest in your faith and prayers.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, this is very much a humbling experience. I wish all of you could have the experience I\nam now having of looking over this vast audience. I have prayed to the Lord that when I\nshould be called to occupy this position that he should not leave me. I have prayed to him\nfirst because I believe in prayer and, second, because I know I need the blessings of the Lord.\nI confess to you that without those blessings and his sustaining help and influence that I am\nnothing.\n<\/p><p>\nPROPHETS OF GOD\n<\/p><p>\nSurely one's testimony is strengthened as he comes here and listens to the brethren, listens to\nthe words of the Lord given to us by his servants, yes, by prophets, seers, and revelators of\nGod, our Eternal Father. We often hear them referred to as prophets, but I am wondering,\nmembers of the Church and particularly holders of the priesthood, if we give serious thought\nto the full meaning of that term. I recognize them as prophets of God, I know you do but\nthere are times, perhaps, when we pass that thought by lightly. Do you feel toward these\nbrethren, prophets of the Lord, as you would had you known the prophets of old? I want to\nbear my testimony to you that I know they are prophets of the living God, I know they are\ninspired of our Father in Heaven in their calling. I hope you will have the same feeling\nburning in your hearts and accept their teachings, because they are inspired of our Father in\nHeaven. If as members of the Church and particularly the Priesthood, we could only have the\nfaith and the assurance and the conviction that these brethren are prophets, seers, and\nrevelators, I believe we would pay more attention to what they tell us. Yes, spirituality is as\nessential to a man's soul as vitamins are to his body.\n<\/p><p>\nADULT MEMBERS OF AARONIC PRIESTHOOD\n<\/p><p>\nAs I look into this great congregation tonight, I have been thinking of the adult members of\nthe Aaronic Priesthood, many of them who have never been inside this building. If we could\nmove this body of men from this building on out to the north and then fill it again and again\nwith adult members of the Aaronic Priesthood in the Church, we could fill this building just\nas full as it is now, seven or eight times. You know, I'm one of those who believes the Lord\nloves these men. I believe their wives love them just as much as our wives love us, and their\nchildren love them as much as our children love us. If you had a wayward son, would you\nlove him? Well, I only have one son, and I love him very much, and if he were a wayward\nson, I believe I would love him just the same. What makes you think that the Lord doesn't\nlove his wayward sons?\n<\/p><p>\nNEED FOR GUIDANCE\n<\/p><p>\nMany of these men haven't the strength to get back into activity in the Church on their own\npower. Therefore, they do need your guidance, your encouragement and your patience; yes,\nI'd say they need you. They need someone to call on them, someone to come and see them,\nsomeone to encourage them and help them forsake those things that are keeping them out of\nthe Church. The Lord has asked us to repent, he has asked all of us to repent, and then he\nsaid; If you truly repent and come unto me, and forsake those things that you're doing, or that\nyou have done that you shouldn't have done, I will forgive you and remember them no more.\nBut he wants us to truly repent. I believe these men would love that privilege. Well, you may\nsay, they have the privilege. Why don't they take it? Well, they haven't the strength yet, until\nthey can absorb some of the teachings of the Church and of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which\nthey haven't had for a long time. They have perhaps become spiritually weak, because of\nhabits that have kept them from church activity or for other reasons. They're not strong\nenough yet to put those things aside. And then you must remember that many of these boys\nand men have not been taught in their homes. As Bishop Wirthlin told us, they were not\ntaught their many duties when they were young. I believe there are many fathers in the\nChurch today, although I think they're not justified, that are leaving the teachings of their\nsons to you brethren entirely. If you fail, where are they going to get those teachings? Many\nadult members of the Aaronic Priesthood, after they come back into activity, are so delighted\nand so anxious that they put a great deal of enthusiasm in their work.\n<\/p><p>\nI talked to a brother, who is now a bishop but who was an adult member of the Aaronic\nPriesthood five or six years ago. I couldn't help but recognize the joy and the happiness that\nhas come into that man's soul. I talked to his wife. She didn't have the ability nor the words\nto tell me how grateful they were. Yes, sometimes I think they're perhaps more grateful than\nsome of the rest of us, after the spirit has touched their souls and they've accepted it.\n<\/p><p>\nWORKERS NEEDED\n<\/p><p>\nSomeone has said, \"He who knows books knows much, he who knows nature knows more,\nbut he who knows God has reached the goal of human wisdom.\" Many of these men are\nbrilliant men, in their own right, successful men in their own business, and they do know\nbooks, but they have perhaps neglected their knowledge of God. As leaders, I hope that you\nmake yourselves acquainted with these thousands of adult members. It's too big a load for\njust two or three in each ward, or a dozen or so in each stake. There are many stakes in the\nChurch that have four or five or six hundred, and some stakes with even seven or eight\nhundred adult members of the Aaronic Priesthood. Do you know how many men could be\ncalled to work with a group like that, a group of five or six hundred men? You can't preach\nto these men in Sacrament meetings, because they're not there. You don't get them into your\npriesthood quorum meetings because they don't come out. Therefore we must put the shotgun\nmethod away. We must now have individual contact and use the rifle method where we can\ngo in and teach those men the principles of the gospel, the teachings that you and I were\nfortunate and blessed enough to have in our lives, but which many of them, not of their own\nfault, have been denied.\n<\/p><p>\nOh, I hope that you'll somehow or other organize yourselves that you'll be able to touch at\nleast one man. The Lord has said to us, \"And if it so be that you should labor all your days in\ncrying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be\nyour joy with him in the kingdom of my Father! And now, if your joy will be great with one\nsoul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your\njoy if you should bring many souls unto me!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12876\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12876)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12876)\">D&amp;C 18:15-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFATHERS AND SONS\n<\/p><p>\nNow fathers, how close are you staying to your own sons, so that the group of adult members\nwill not be increased? Do you fathers have close relationship with your own sons? Can your\nsons come to you and tell you all about their problems? Oh, I feel sorry for a boy that can't\ngo to his dad and tell him all about his mistakes, all about his sorrows, and all about his\nproblems. I think that that kind of relationship, in not being able to become close to a father,\ncan only tend to bring that boy, perhaps, more delinquent than ever. I know boys will make\nmistakes, but oh, I feel that if they can go to their dads and talk over those mistakes with\nthem, that those boys will be stronger and will not repeat their mistakes too many times, if\nthey can come to their dads. Do you dare to go to bed at nights and not know where your\nsons are? Do you know whom they're with, or where they are, or do you know when they're\ncoming home?\n<\/p><p>\nAwhile ago I was at a dinner party one night, and about eleven or eleven-thirty, the telephone\nrang and one of the men was called to the phone. We couldn't hear the conversation on both\nsides, but we could hear what he had to say. When he took his seat his wife said to him,\n\"who was that calling?\" He said, \"Well that was our son John. He just called to tell us that he\nwouldn't be home at twelve o'clock.\" He told his father he was going to a waffle dinner after\nthe show or the dance, I don't recall which it was, but he called to tell his father that he\nwouldn't be home until twelve-thirty or one o'clock. I turned to that man and said, \"How old\nis your boy?\" I thought he was a youngster calling up. He said, \"He's twenty-three years old.\"\nI thought, what a marvelous relationship, what a marvelous thing that this boy would take the\ntime and make the effort to call his father at a party to tell him that he would be a little later\nthan usual.\n<\/p><p>\nOnly that father said, \"We can go home now tonight, and we don't need to worry about our\nchildren. They're going to be home at a certain time, or they're going to call us.\" Well, there\nisn't anything wrong in that kind of discipline. It isn't because it's strict discipline, it's\nbecause there is an understanding between father and son.\n<\/p><p>\nCLOSE RELATIONSHIP\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then, fathers, do your boys, at night, when they do come home, come into your bedroom\nand kiss you goodnight? Sometimes we have encouraged our daughters to do that with our\nwives, their mothers, but we fathers perhaps have not practiced that with our own sons.\nWhat's wrong with a son coming into his dad's bedroom at night and sitting on the side of\nhis bed and telling him how he liked his girl, or how the party was, or how they got along\ntonight. Don't you think if a boy will do that, don't you think he'll go into his own bedroom\nand kneel down and say his prayer after he has said goodnight to his dad? Don't you think if\nhe is that close to his dad, that he can pour his heart out to you after he sometimes stubs his\ntoe or makes a mistake? I don't like to see any boy or for that matter any man, live with his\nmistakes, because I think it eats the best out of him that is in him. Oh, I hope he can go to\nhis father and tell his father about his problems, and about his mistakes and about his sorrows.\nThere is no reason, fathers, why we can't be that close to our sons. Does your boy kiss you\ngoodnight? Does your boy kiss you when you leave in the day, or when you leave for a trip?\nOr have we left that to our wives and our daughters? I'll confess that I was guilty of that for\nyears, but I'm happy, so happy somehow or other that I've changed that in my own life. I'm\nglad that I can kiss my boy when he comes around me. I'm glad I can kiss him when I leave:\nI'm glad I can kiss him when I return. I don't want to be denied that beautiful blessing. I\nrecommend to you fathers that you start living a little closer to your sons, that you love them,\nthat you are not so strict with them that they can't come to you with anything.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, brothers, I didn't intend to say those things to you.  May the Lord bless you that you\nmay try and stay close to your sons, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
