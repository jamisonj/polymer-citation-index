Burton<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Assistant to the Council of the Twelve<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Theodore M. Burton, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1969, pp. 139-142<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brothers and sisters, many people have asked me about the new GIANT system of\ngenealogy announced by the First Presidency in the last general conference. Where did this\nidea come from, and what is the reason for this change?\n<\/p><p>\nThe answer is that it developed naturally out of our present system. As problems arose in the\nsystem we were using, we began to study them out in our own minds. We consulted earlier\nrevelations and directions from former Church leaders and then prayed earnestly for wisdom\nand sought counsel to know the mind of the Lord for our day. We met frequently with our\npresent leaders and presented questions directly to the First Presidency for answers.\n<\/p><p>\nAs we received greater light and knowledge, we had to revise some of our new ideas and\nconcepts until, by listening to the whisperings of the Spirit, a system finally evolved that\ncould be approved for presentation to the people.  May I discuss for a few moments in\ngeneral terms how we obtain knowledge, for an understanding of how this principle applies\nparticularly to the GIANT system.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A complex world<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe live in a world so complex and involved that sometimes life becomes a frustrating\nexperience.  There are many kinds of voices in the world, and as Paul explained to the\nCorinthians: \n<\/p><p>\n\"So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be\nknown what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.\n<\/p><p>\n\"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without\nsignification.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a\nbarbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"497\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 497)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(497)\">1 Cor. 14:9-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAmong the many voices we hear, which voice should we believe? With so many duties and\nresponsibilities, which ones should have priority? With various paths stretching out before us,\nwhich path should we follow? With so much work to be done, what work should we do first?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Making decisions<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt is evident from this multiplicity of choices that we need to make decisions. But if we make\na decision based solely on our limited experience with out consulting experts, the likelihood\nof making a correct choice becomes a matter of pure chance.  In order to know what to do, it\nmight be well to reflect on how the Lord prepares us to make decisions.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the beginning God gave Adam a choice of whether to be obedient and trust in the Lord or\nto seek knowledge on his own.\n<\/p><p>\nAdam chose to make his own decisions. He disobeyed the Lord, ate of the fruit of the tree of\nknowledge, and was therefore left to his own resources. This meant eviction from the Garden\nof Eden and from the presence of the Lord: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And I, the Lord God, said unto mine Only Begotten: Behold, the man is become as one of us\nto know good and evil; and now lest he put forth his hand and partake also of the tree of life,\nand eat and live forever,\n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore I, the Lord God, will send him forth from the Garden of Eden, to till the ground\nfrom whence he was taken; \n<\/p><p>\n\"For as I, the Lord God, liveth, even so my words cannot return void, for as they go forth out\nof my mouth they must be fulfilled\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39333\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39333)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39333)\">Moses 4:28-30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Good and evil<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nUndoubtedly the Lord gave Adam counsel so that he could protect himself against evil and\nknow how to recognize and avoid it. Note that the Lord didn't say that Adam should be able\nto know good <i>from<\/i> evil, but that he should know good <i>and<\/i> evil. In a like manner we are to\nknow both good and evil and learn to prefer the good above the evil. Through our experiences\nin life we eventually learn to choose the good simply because it is the better way, the easier\nway, and the simpler way in the long run.\n<\/p><p>\nExperience, however, can be a very dear teacher. If we live life without direction and without\nsomeone to guide us, it is as dangerous as playing with dynamite. A slight mistake made\ninnocently through lack of knowledge and life blows up in our face. Mistakes can be so\nserious that sometimes we can never fully repair the dam age done. Some mistakes may even\nresult in loss of life itself. Simply stated, we need guidance and help.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Value of obedience<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAdam and Eve, after being driven from the Garden of Eden, needed guidance and did what\nall wise men and women should do. They asked the Lord for direction. In response, \". . . he\ngave them commandments, that they should worship the Lord their God, and should offer the\nfirstlings of their flocks, for an offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient unto the\ncommandments of the Lord\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39335\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39335)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39335)\">Moses 5:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAdam had already learned his lesson well. Because he hadn't done what the Lord asked him\nto do, he lost the privileges he formerly had. Now that Adam was on his own, he had to fight\nweeds, illness, cold, hunger, and all the other problems that beset mankind. Adam had already\nlearned the value of obedience, and he obeyed this new counsel religiously. How long this\nobedient sacrifice continued we don't know, but it must have been a long period as we reckon\ntime. At least it was long enough for the Lord to make sure that Adam had learned his lesson\nwell before he was given the reason for this commandment. But as a result of his obedience,\nhe now obtained further knowledge. The scripture continues: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer\nsacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded\nme.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only\nBegotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent\nand call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39336\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39336)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39336)\">Moses 5:6-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Pattern for gaining knowledge<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThis then becomes the pattern by which we gain knowledge in this life. If we seek the Lord\nand ask for counsel, it is given. The Lord is a very wise teacher. He knows that one can't\nteach a student until that student is ready to listen. I think failure to understand this principle\nis the cause of many of our present-day ills. We too often give when the recipient doesn't\nwant to receive. We preach when people refuse to listen. Young people complain they can't\ncommunicate with their elders when really that obligation rests upon youth. Youth doesn't ask\nfor counsel, but seeks to give advice of what should be done, based on limited experience.\nYouth doesn't seek for information, and we unwisely give youth advice that youth doesn't\nwant in the first place. If the youth want to communicate with the older generation, let them\nfirst take the initiative themselves and ask for and seek further light and knowledge.\n<\/p><p>\nLikewise parents claim they can't communicate with the younger generation when really that\nobligation rests upon the parents. Parents too often go their own way, doing things as they've\nalways done them. They don't ask for information to determine youth's needs in our modern\nworld, but seek to give counsel without that guidance. Parents don't understand the pressures\non modern youth and unwisely give youth advice that youth isn't ready to accept. If parents\nwant to communicate with the younger generation, let them first take the initiative and ask\nyouth what youth wants to know, thus learning to understand youth's problems.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Concept of asking<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThis concept of asking for information and help is a fundamental method of obtaining\nknowledge. Although the Lord warns us of impending dangers, he doesn't give information to\nus until we ask for it.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will\ncome in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42428\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42428)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42428)\">Rev. 3:20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is expressed even more clearly in Matthew: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto\nyou; \n<\/p><p>\n\"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it\nshall be opened\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35910\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35910)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35910)\">Matt. 7:7-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis whole dispensation of the fulness of times began when a youth asked a question of the\nLord as a result of reading this scripture: \n<\/p><p>\n\"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and\nupbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea\ndriven with the wind and tossed\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26220\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26220)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26220)\">James 1:5-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe book of Doctrine and Covenants may be regarded as a prime example of this principle.\nRevelations were given as a result of questions asked. When the Lord saw the willingness of\nthe Prophet Joseph and his associates to receive instruction, he gave them additional principles\nand revelations much beyond the original questions asked.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Gaining further knowledge<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJust as Adam was not given further knowledge until he had learned and practiced the law of\nsacrifice, so the Israelites were not qualified to have the Melchizedek Priesthood until they\nfirst learned how to use and practice the laws of the Aaronic Priesthood. The gospel of love\nwas not given until Israel learned and practiced the preliminary law of carnal commandments,\nwhich, Paul explained to the Galatians\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23289\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23289)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23289)\">Gal. 3:24<\/a><\/span>),\nwas a schoolmaster to bring them to Christ. In\nour day we must learn and practice the law of tithing before we can receive the law of\nconsecration. We must learn and practice the laws which pertain to baptism and confirmation\nbefore we are permitted to make higher moral and ethical covenants in the temple. As Alma\nexpressed this thought he said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his\nword, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they should have; therefore we see that the\nLord doth counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just and true\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9107\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9107)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9107)\">Alma 29:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Salvation for the dead<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn this dispensation God has given us great responsibilities in regard to one of his higher laws,\nthat of salvation for the dead. At first the law was only introduced to us. Temples had to be\nbuilt and a people had to be gathered. The people thus gathered had to be lifted up to be\nworthy to enter the temples. Vital information concerning the dead had to be gathered as best\nit could.\n<\/p><p>\nWe thus learned by doing, and from this experience sought better and more efficient ways to\ndo this work.\n<\/p><p>\nNow in our day we find ourselves closer to the end than ever before. God has provided for\nour use a greater knowledge of how to gather records of the dead. He has provided rapid\nmethods of copying information by using microfilm. We have jet planes to speed the\ngathering of these records, and modern tools, such as coding, card punch, and sorting\nmachines, optical scanners, electronic computers, and other types of modern business\nmachines, that can be used to compile and index these records into usable form. Temples are\nbeing erected in ever-increasing numbers, and Church membership is growing to provide\nworthy people who can serve in those temples.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>GIANT system<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt is no wonder that the present slow and cumbersome methods of preparing names for temple\nordinance work are giving way to the faster, more accurate GIANT system.\n<\/p><p>\nYet with all these changes, the basic principles of salvation for the dead haven't changed. We\nare still responsible for gathering and submitting names for our kindred dead. We still have to\ndo the temple ordinance work for those we identify as our progenitors. We still have to\nmaintain our own family book of remembrance with pedigree charts and family group sheets\nof our direct ancestors to make sure that the temple ordinance work has been done for all our\nloved ones.\n<\/p><p>\nI regard this new method as a higher system, simpler, more rapid, and more accurate than any\nwe have had heretofore. As I see it, this progress is a natural growth of that truth which God\ngives us as we seek for answers in further prayer: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall forsake all evil and cleave unto all good,\nthat ye shall live by every word which proceedeth forth out of the mouth of God.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For he will give unto the faithful line upon line, precept upon precept; and I will try you and\nprove you herewith\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15429\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15429)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15429)\">D&amp;C 98:11-12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Further light and knowledge<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThus we have sought for further light and knowledge, having been obedient to the preliminary\nconcepts. God has given us additional truth and new precepts to apply in our work of\nsalvation for the dead. This is a clear voice telling us what to do. It is a well-defined path for\nfuture work. An improved way has been prepared to aid us in completing the work leading to\nthe organization of the family of God.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God grant that we will respond to this new concept and devote a part of our time to this\nimportant work. This new procedure has been approved by the Prophet of the Lord and has\nthe blessing of the First Presidency. I have a personal testimony that it is approved of God,\nfor as I pray for knowledge of this truth I have a good, warm feeling in my heart. I give you\nthis testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
