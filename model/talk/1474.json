Madsen, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1966, pp. 91-97<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nPresident McKay&mdash;President Tanner&mdash;My Brothers in the Priesthood: I have always felt\nhumbled standing in the presence of Latter-day Saints, but never to the extent of this moment.\nI earnestly pray for the blessings of the Holy Ghost that from my feeble lips may come words\nworthy of this sacred hour.\n<\/p><p>\nOurs is the deep responsibility and privilege of the missionary in the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\nOur Prophet, Seer, and Revelator has highlighted and rehighlighted this fact.\n<\/p><p>\nThe everlasting gospel has been restored to the earth, for the last time, to be preached \"unto\nevery nation and kindred and tongue and people.\" The Prophet Joseph has told us \"That the\ntruth of God will go forth boldly, till it has penetrated every continent, and sounded in every\near, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"The sound must go forth\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn the 58th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord reminds us: \"For verily, the sound\nmust go forth from this place unto all the world, and unto the uttermost parts of the\nearth&mdash;the Gospel must be preached unto every creature.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhat an awesome challenge we have&mdash;with earths rapidly multiplying billions, as pointed\nout by Brother Brockbank. Experts estimate of course as you have heard, that 1 billion lived\nat the time of the restoration; 3 1\/2 billion now and some 7 billion by the year 2000.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay, in his inspiring message opening this Conference, referred to scientific\ndiscoveries which \"stagger the imagination\"&mdash;\"discoveries latent with such potent power, either\nfor the blessing or the destruction of human beings as to make men's responsibility in\ncontrolling them the most gigantic ever placed in human hands . . . this age,\" he went on to tell\nus, \"is fraught with limitless perils <i>as well as untold possibilities<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow, it is with some of these blessings made accessible through scientific knowledge that I\nhave been assigned to speak with you for a few moments tonight.\n<\/p><p>\nThe great Alma cried to the Lord that his voice might be multiplied to shake the earth with\nthe plan of salvation.\n<\/p><p>\nKing Benjamin, in his efforts to communicate the Gospel more effectively, caused a tower to\nbe built that he might speak to the great multitudes.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Broadcasting facilities available<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat mighty towers has our Heavenly Father permitted us to have in this dispensation\nthrough the use of Radio and Television. Surely, they are powerful instruments beyond\nimagination, to help the Gospel message \"sound in every ear\" on this planet.\n<\/p><p>\nUnder the direction of our Prophet, the use of Radio and Television is expanding. The Church\nnow owns totally, or has ownership in, 20 broadcasting facilities: \n<\/p><p>\nFive Television stations; 4 Radio stations, two of these stations are 50,000 watt&mdash;the most\npowerful authorized; we have 6 FM and 5 shortwave, in areas ranging from New York City\nto Seattle, Washington.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I briefly review our activities in five areas: Standard AM Radio; International Radio;\nTelephone line and cable related to broadcasting; Film related to broadcasting; and, finally,\nTelevision.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Standard AM Radio<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe potentials of standard AM radio have surpassed all boundaries of our imaginations, with\nthe development of the transistor&mdash;a miracle in itself, which some claim will be recorded by\nfuture historians as an event greater than the invention of the printing press. This has been\nbrought into sharp focus by the fact that illiteracy and ignorance reign so supremely upon this\nearth today that many overseas, and even on our own continents here in the Western\nHemisphere, are not able to read and to write.\n<\/p><p>\nI listened numbly as one of our great behavioral scientists recently in New York made the\nstatement that in the world as we have it today, over half of all the children between the ages\nof 5 and 19 will never see a school room; and that the degree of illiteracy of this world\nincreases every time the clock ticks because we are totally unable to build educational\nfacilities and train teachers to keep literacy, the ability to read and to write, ahead of the\npopulation explosion.\n<\/p><p>\nThe only way we can reach millions of people will be through the spoken voice. The\ntransistor radio, inexpensively manufactured today, has opened the doors of intelligence to\nliterally millions. The best place you can possibly see this is to go to South America and see\npeople with hardly enough to eat, and hardly any clothes on their backs, with an expensive\ntransistor radio in their possession.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the United States there are over 250 million operating radio&mdash;more sets, by far, than\npeople. We have, in addition, over 350,000,000 sets outside of the U. S. and the number\nincreases rapidly. For instance, some 31 million new sets were sold in the U. S. last year.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>FM Radio<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThere are over 4,000 AM broadcasting stations and over 1,400 FM stations in the U. S. with\nsome 7,000 of these stations in addition, overseas. The channels are wide open for our use.\n<\/p><p>\nNow the use of AM radio by the Church, of course, is highlighted by the Salt Lake\nTabernacle Choir and Brother Evan's Spoken Word program, now the oldest continuous\nnetwork radio broadcast in history&mdash;and a missionary tool of immeasurable value.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Tribute to Earl J. Glade, Broadcast Pioneer<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt is fitting, I believe, to pay tribute here tonight to the memory of Earl J. Glade, the Chief\nExecutive for many years, and the guiding light of KSL, who left us three weeks ago at the\nage of 80; and who, through his great vision in industry, in the early days of radio, sold the\nNetwork on the idea of a weekly Choir broadcast. Its effect cannot be measured.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Tabernacle Choir Weekly Broadcast<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nToday, this Choir program is heard weekly over 194 CBS stations; over 100 additional\nstations in the U. S. and Canada by tape; and a growing area that we are very proud of, 94\nLatin American stations, with the narration corrected and translated into Portuguese and\nSpanish. It is also heard over the Voice of America and on the Armed Forces Radio and\nTelevision service.\n<\/p><p>\nIn addition, hundreds of radio stations also provide large audiences for the Choir's music via\nrecordings. In fact, in one of the leading stations, I discovered recently in the East, the\nmanagement requires the playing of four Choir numbers per day as station policy.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Elder Sill's addresses<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Sterling Sill's outstanding weekly program is now released on over 400 stations via\ntape recordings.\n<\/p><p>\nThrough AM Radio alone, General Conference is heard on over 25 stations, with tapes also\nnow being sent for the first time to Latin-American stations.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Early Morning Broadcasts<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAt night we have had an interesting experiment for the past several years&mdash;we re-broadcast\nGeneral Conference for four hours, from 1:00 AM to 5:00 AM over KSL and KIRO, two\npowerful 50,000 watt stations. The results have been most gratifying with expected letters\nfrom people in hospitals, service stations, all-night auto drivers and people who have to work\nin the daytime, expressing their gratitude that we are broadcasting the Conference when they\ncan hear it. These letters come from all over Western America, Canada, Mexico, and far\nbeyond.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Responses from listeners<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn fact, mail from a single session encouraged by an offer of a few Choir albums to those\nwriting from the greatest distances, brought responses from Kingston, Jamaica to Suva in the\nFiji Islands; 27 countries; 42 states; 3 ships at sea. Letters from such as one from a wonderful\nRelief Society President in the Island of Samoa (and I must have a trip there to verify\nthis)&mdash;she said that hundreds listen clearly in Samoa to this program&mdash;hearing Conference for\nthe first time when we started to re-broadcast it.\n<\/p><p>\nA letter from a dear sister in Canada who awakened at a very early hour, being unable to\nsleep, turned on her radio, heard an organ, she told us in her letter, and was quite surprised;\nin fact said she was alarmed as she looked at her clock three or four times to find out she was\nlistening to the Mormon Conference from Salt Lake City. She was so excited that she\nawakened all of her family and made them stay up all night to listen to Conference. The\npost-script to her letter said, \"It may not be important to you to hear Conference, but it is\nvery important to us; it is a wonderful event in our lives because, you see, we just joined the\nChurch a few weeks ago.\"\n<\/p><p>\nStandard AM Radio is also used from 12 midnight to 6:00 AM each Sunday on KSL and\nKIRO, to broadcast a program we call \"Prelude to the Sabbath,\" a six-hour workshop program\nin which our own people here are seeking to learn the means and the ways to make so-called\nreligious programming more interesting and palatable, to people. We have invited to\nparticipate with us in this, many faiths, and we are receiving and broadcasting their\nprogramming as they attempt to explain the Gospel as they understand it. It is an\nunderstatement to tell you that we have learned much from those of other churches in the\nexcellent utilization they, too, are making of radio and television, and we have made many\nfriends of people of other faiths through this workshop program.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>International Radio<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe second area of international broadcasting is little known. Today, there are over 3,000\nstations around the world in over one hundred nations broadcasting to the world. Most of\nthese are government-owned and operated, and are used in an ideological war of freedom vs.\ncollectivism which most Americans should have the privilege of hearing. It is raging through\nthe air with venom enough to turn the color of the air. These great principles of freedom and\ncollectivism are being debated through these radio channels.\n<\/p><p>\nNow the Church owns five out of a total of seven international radio licenses given by the\nFederal Communications Commission in the United States. In this project, we have entered a\ngreat arena, and as one of the nonmembers of the Church said recently to me, \"Your Church\nnow speaks with the voice of nations.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>United States Stations feature American culture<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe proper operations of these stations challenges the best skills and abilities of the most\nprofessional of our nation's broadcasters, and certainly requires a great deal of dedication and\nfunds. It is an opportunity presented to us to help explain to the world (incidentally, as a\nmatter of the conditions upon which the license is granted that we must reflect the culture and\nthe principles of this Nation) the divine principles of the Constitution of the United States\nattacked overseas viciously misunderstood by too many of us at home.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is our opportunity to explain to the people as best we can, the blessings which can come to\nall men and women worldwide as they apply these principles to their lives. This is a project\nin embryo which can open doors to worldwide communications unlimited.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>General Conference Broadcast to four continents in four languages<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe sessions of this General Conference are broadcast over WNYW, as the five stations are\nknown, to over 100 countries in four continents, in four languages. In addition, every week\nregularly, we broadcast 30 special L. D. S. programs in English and Spanish over these\ninternational facilities.\n<\/p><p>\nIn one Conference session broadcast over WNYW, we offered a few Choir albums to those\nwriting from the greatest distances, to encourage mail response; and it came from 61 foreign\ncountries; 37 of the 50 states; 8 ships at seas. Letters came from young men buried in the\nsnow on the dew line far to the North; a letter came from a young man in a small village in\nMexico, some 200 miles south of Monterey, who said, in his broken English, \"I contacted the\nmissionaries, or they found me in Monterey; my Mother became ill and I had to come back to\nmy village. Last Sunday afternoon I was listening to the shortwave radio and I heard the\nmighty organ from the Salt Lake Temple, and I heard the sermons in Spanish. My Mother\ncame and sat beside me for a few moments and she stood up angrily and said to me, 'Get\naway from that thing&mdash;it will turn your mind.'\" He said, \"Oh, how I need the Gospel. Will\nyou please tell the missionaries to come and find me.\"\n<\/p><p>\nA letter from a student in Bogota, Colombia, who said, \"I have never heard of your church\nbefore. Are there any people in the country of Colombia that could help me understand more\nof your religion?\"\n<\/p><p>\nA family in Europe brought into the Church through listening to this instrument; and letters\nfrom Saints and others in Africa. I wish I had time to relate some of the stories behind these\nletters&mdash;they brought tears to our eyes; perhaps they would to yours.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Broadcasting by telephone and cable<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe third area relates to telephone lines and cables in broadcasting. Now this session of\nPriesthood Conference is being heard in over 400 chapels in Canada and in the United States,\nand is being seen in some areas by cable television.\n<\/p><p>\nFor some sessions of our General Conference, over 50 chapels in Europe are connected to the\nTabernacle by telephone line and by cable, of course, under the water, and report perfect\nclarity of reception in these chapels.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Broadcasting by film<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnother area relating to film is broadcasting. We have now a remarkable device called a\nkinescope which has been greatly perfected in the last year or two, which permits us to\ntransmit effectively television video tape programs to film&mdash;regular 16 mm\nmovies&mdash;sound-on-film. With this machine we are now adapting the weekly Choir program to 16 mm\nfilm with a Spanish and a Portuguese sound-track&mdash;the narration, of course, for use on a\ndozen or more Latin American stations. That list will grow appreciably as we learn how to do\nthis more effectively.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Use of sound-on-film<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn addition, this device has permitted us to do something else that has caught a great deal of\nour attention. A session of General Conference is transferred to sound-on-film with the words\nof the speakers translated and then lip-synced with the motion picture so that the General\nAuthorities appear to be speaking in French, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Mandarin\nChinese.\nWe have had a wonderful response; these films are in wide use&mdash;continuing use&mdash;in chapels\nthroughout the world where we are told there is seldom a night where there isn't General\nConference in some chapel, in some mission, in some distant spot. It, of course, opens a\ncomplete new area for us.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Television<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe fifth area, very quickly, in Television, of course represents the near ultimate in that\n\"mighty tower\" to help bring the Gospel to every nation and kindred and tongue and people,\nfor Television represents the nearly perfect device for mass communication. And certainly\nthere are no more precious truths that the world needs, or should have, than the principles of\nthe Gospel; and the great challenge is to be able to transmit those in a way that we will be\nable to have them penetrate this quarter-inch of skull that seems so impenetrable by so many\nother methods.\n<\/p><p>\nIn this country, the average television set operates six hours and 27 minutes per day. The\naudiences to this type of communication are simply fantastic. We think the people would even\nwatch the test signal if we had a couple of cowboys shooting in back of it.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Choir seen in six cities each week<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Choir is now seen in six cities every week via television&mdash;Los Angeles, Seattle, Salt Lake\nCity and three other communities&mdash;it is just beginning. In telecasting the General\nConference, we stand doubly humble because we have, indeed, been greatly blessed.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is not too difficult to occasionally obtain gratis, a quarter-hour, or even a half-hour, from a\nTV station, but to obtain two hours in one unit&mdash;is almost unheard of except for things like\nfootball games.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Conference by radio coverage<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe extent of our blessings in telecasting Conference is mirrored in these statistics: In the\nConference of October, 1962, 21 stations in the U. S. carried our Conference broadcast.\nEighteen months later, April, 1964, 194 United States and Canadian stations released\nConference&mdash;practically all of them for a full two hours\n<\/p><p>\nWhy this remarkable Conference TV coverage? One reason is this great blessing we have in\nour Choir. This unparalleled talent is respected in all the world of radio and television.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Respect gains cooperation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNumber two reason, and of great importance&mdash;almost equal importance in many areas&mdash;is\nthe respect of television station ownership and management for the L. D. S. members of their\ncommunities.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the southwest, a television station executive vice president and general manager told me, in\nessence: \"Do you know the local L. D. S. representative you sent to me to ask for air time for\nyour Church?\" When I confessed I did not know him, he said \"You certainly should. He is\none of the most loved men in our entire area; he could have anything he wants from this\nstation.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn another instance, the station owner recounted how his music librarian, a young lady, had\ncome and asked for two hours on Sunday for her church. \"Of course, we agreed,\" he told me,\n\"she is one of the finest persons I have ever met or employed.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn the midwest, another television executive called me on the phone to tell me the good news\nhe had cleared time for Conference. \"I just couldn't help clearing time,\" he said. \"I have a\nsister-in-law who is one of the most wonderful people and wonderful member of a family that\na person could ever have&mdash;and she's a 'fire-ball' Mormon. When she called me and said,\n'Lou, are you going to give me any conference&mdash;or not?' All I could say, and gladly,\nwas&mdash;Yes.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnother of many fine examples&mdash;five stations covering an entire state cleared because of\ntheir respect for an LDS leader living among them. And in one of our largest cities, the\nsame experience was repeated. We have had many more similar occurrences.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Service of Paul Evans and staff<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMay I express appreciation to Brother Paul Evans and his associates who work diligently for\nmany months to build this Conference TV network each session. But in doing so, may I\nunderline this fact that the help of many members of the Church has made this blessing\npossible. And Mission Presidents tell us it has now become an important tool to them in\nhelping investigators to learn more about the Church, and to help to keep up the interest and\nmorale of the members who are still isolated from us.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Success of \"Every Member a Missionary\" assignment<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nEveryone a missionary. How wonderful it is to see President McKay's counsel in action as\nrelates to our business. How important it is, too, for many reasons to be living testimonies of\nthe Gospel of Jesus Christ for we never know when our attitudes and actions will be, and can\nbe, used for good.\n<\/p><p>\nBriefly we have reviewed Church mass communications in five areas: Standard AM Radio;\ninternational radio; telephone line and cable related to broadcasting; film related to\nbroadcasting; and television. May we tell you quickly we have taken only first steps&mdash;they\nwill be multiplied many times. We have taken only a few steps&mdash;just far enough to see the\nunlimited horizons in the technical ability to communicate to every nation and kindred and\ntongue and people that are now within our grasp.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Satellite, a facility<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe great future hangs above the earth some 22,000 miles above the East Coast of Brazil in\nan 87 pound speck, motionless in position to the ground. Through this tiny object, the early\nbird satellite, hundreds of telephone calls, a television signal and other material, Can\neffectively reach \"unto\" one-third of the earth's surface.\n<\/p><p>\nAlready we have sent a special broadcast of the Salt Lake Tabernacle Choir to Europe\nthrough this instrument; and another broadcast through an earlier satellite.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Another Satellite<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnother early bird is scheduled to be hung high above the Pacific within the next thirty days,\nthus bringing two-thirds of the earth's surface under two early birds.\n<\/p><p>\nMarvelous as these satellites seem to all of us at this time, it has been called the \"crystal set\"\nof the future of worldwide broadcasting.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Scriptural Mandate fulfilled.<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJust three of these instruments make it possible for us to fulfill the Doctrine &amp; Covenants,\nSection 58, Verse 64: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For verily, the sound must go forth from this place unto all the world, and unto the uttermost\nparts of the earth&mdash;the Gospel must be preached unto every creature\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50022\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50022)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50022)\">D&amp;C 58:64<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI leave with you my testimony that I know this work is divine; that we are led by a mighty\nProphet, Seer, and Revelator; that great prophets surround him; that God in His wisdom has\ngiven us television and radio to assist Him in His great purposes.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we be blessed and ever diligent in the use of all communications media to hasten the day\nof His Kingdom, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
