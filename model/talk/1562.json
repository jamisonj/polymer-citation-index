Dyer, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1967, pp. 40-42<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brothers and sisters, it is most difficult at a time like this to express one's true\nemotions. As I sat there since the sustaining of the officers today, I thought that in every life\nthere are a number of semaphores of direction; and rather hastily there came back to me a few\nof those semaphores which, if I had taken the wrong turn, most surely would have prevented\nme from occupying this position today.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Times of decision<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThese brethren who hear me sing would not suspect that in my early life I sang in a quartet:\nwe became pretty good, to the extent that at the age of 18 we received a contract to go on a\nvaudeville circuit to sing for some 42 weeks, and we were all primed for this. But at this time\nBishop Parry of the 16th Ward called me to his office and said that they wanted to\nrecommend me to be called on a mission, and, of course, that was the end of the quartet as\nfar as I was concerned. I went into the mission field at the age of 18; and when I came back,\nhaving previously played some baseball in my high school years, I was approached by two or\nthree semi-pro teams who wanted me to play for them. It was then, because of my great\ndesire to play baseball, that the possibility of making it a career occurred to me. I signed to\nplay with one of these teams but soon found, as I was called to labor in a bishopric about the\nsame time, that it was interfering with my responsibilities as a member of the bishopric, so I\nhad to make the decision; and the decision was to continue my work in the bishopric and\nserve the Lord to the best of my ability.\n<\/p><p>\nI then settled down to the work of succeeding in business. As the years passed, it became\nmore favorable, and as most young men, I desired to make a lot of money. I had as my goal a\nmillion dollars, and I felt that if I would follow the course that I had taken, perhaps I could\ndo this by the time I would reach the age of 55. Things were progressing very well in this\ndirection when President Stephen L Richards called me to his office and said that I had been\ncalled to preside over the Central States Mission. A year or so after that I disposed of my\nbusiness interests, so I will never know whether I would or could have made a million dollars.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember receiving a telephone call, after I had become one of the Assistants to the Twelve,\nwhile attending a conference in the Teton Stake. It was just a matter of routine, yet the\ntremendous implications of it have startled me many times when I think about it. A member\nof the First Presidency on the other end of the telephone said, \"Brother Dyer, we would like\nyou to go to Europe. When can you leave?\" I said, \"I can leave any time,\" thinking that I was\nto go there on a trip for maybe two weeks to attend some conferences or some other\nassignment. But he said, \"You won't be coming back very soon, so you had better think a\nlittle longer about this.\" But it made no difference. I accepted the call and with my wife spent\n25 months presiding over the European Mission.\n<\/p><p>\nThere have been many other semaphores in my life, and I am confident that each of you in\nyour own life has had many of your own.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen President McKay asked me in the temple a few days ago if I would accept the calling\nof the apostleship, I replied that I would, although I was somewhat perplexed as to what this\ncalling would mean under the circumstances. As we moved to another room in the temple, my\nfeelings were somewhat quieted by the kind and meaningful words of a member of the\nQuorum of the Twelve, whom I greatly love and respect. After extending his well wishes, he\nsaid these words (and they have tremendous meaning): \"Don't worry, Alvin. You have been\ncalled by the highest authority upon the earth to this calling, and it will be\nmade known to you what you are to do.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI know only partially now, at the present time, what holding the apostleship in my case will\nentail for me. I know, of course, that the Lord has made known that an apostle is to contend\nagainst none but the church of evil (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14912\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14912)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14912)\">D&amp;C 18:20-21<\/a><\/span>), to take upon himself the name of Christ and speak the\ntruth in soberness, and to be a witness, a special witness for Jesus Christ in the world (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15030\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15030)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15030)\">D&amp;C 107:23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Calling by authority<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nBut it matters not as to its entirety, for I am committed to serve the president of the High\nPriesthood, whom we call the President of the Church (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15035\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15035)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15035)\">D&amp;C 107:65<\/a><\/span>). He is the one declared by the Lord to\nbe like unto Moses, to preside over the whole Church (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15037\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15037)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15037)\">D&amp;C 107:91<\/a><\/span>), and there is only one appointed to this\nhigh and holy position upon the earth at one time (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15072\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15072)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15072)\">D&amp;C 132:7<\/a><\/span>). I know with all my soul that President\nMcKay is that servant of God upon the earth today.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The presence of Prophet<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI have been privileged to feel the nearness of President McKay's spirit. I have felt the majesty\nof his soul as we stood in the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, observing in the short distance a\nplace there known as Spring Hill, referred to in Section 116 of the Doctrine and Covenants (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15047\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15047)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15047)\">D&amp;C 116:1<\/a><\/span>) as\nthe place where Adam, Michael, or the \"Ancient of Days,\" in accordance with the prophecy of\nDaniel, shall in the due time of the Lord visit the earth for an important reason (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10688\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10688)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10688)\">Dan. 7:13-14<\/a><\/span>), and while\nthere hearing President McKay utter quietly, \"This is a most holy place.\" I have shed tears of\njoy and of sorrow with this great man upon occasions.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember the experience of a very noted European who came to America, Dr. Hans Wacher\nof Munich, a very accomplished and well-known architect who had been converted to the\nChurch, a man known all over Eurasia, South America, and Africa for his great ability. He\nhas written a number of books on the use of light in buildings. I had the privilege of\nintroducing him to the President and sitting at the other end of the table while they talked.\nAnd then I heard this man say, as we reached the foyer outside the President's office, these\nwords which in a sense echo my own thoughts over and over again this day: \"Today I have\nstood in the presence of a prophet of God. Truly he is a prophet. I shall return to my beloved\nBavaria and testify unto my family and my friends that David O. McKay is a prophet of God.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Programs of the Church are impressive<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThese past days, my brethren and sisters, have been most glorious, as the Spirit of the Lord\nhas been made manifest in the progress of the Church and its programs of the future in the\nservice to mankind. Yesterday, in the regional representatives seminar, we all felt an\noverwhelming surge of the Spirit as Brother Lee was testifying of the work. It had a\nmotivating power over all who were present, and affected me very deeply. I am firmly\ncommitted to the laws of the priesthood and to the instruction and direction, given to us as a\npeople by the Lord, of this important work and of all the revelations, both for the present and\nfor the future. In this the priesthood is the governing force, while revelation is the guiding\nlight.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Service shared with family<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAt this time my feelings concern most deeply my tried and true and most wonderful\ncompanion for time and for all eternity, my dear wife and sweetheart. Together we have\nshared many years of service in the work of the Master, and always there has been that\nfeeling of oneness in that service; even now my heart is full, and I know that her heart is with\nme in this call and that she is a part of it. How wonderful is her support and understanding. I\nam most grateful for her and our two children, Gloria and Brent, who with their companions\nfor time and eternity bless our lives with our grandchildren. I have one brother living.\nMy brother Gus and I are the only two of a family of 15, and I am\ngrateful for him and his untiring work in the Church, which he has pursued throughout all his\nlife.\n<\/p><p>\nI do not feel to speak longer, but in closing may I read just one verse that has impressed me\nfor many years as reflecting the true teachings of the Master in our dealings one with another.\nThe spirit of every word can be found in his parables and teachings: \n<\/p><p>\n\"May I be no man's enemy, and may I be the friend of that which is eternal . . . May I never\ndevise evil against any man: if any devise evil against me, may I escape . . . without the need\nof hurting him. May I love, seek, and attain only that which is good. May I wish for all\nmen's happiness and envy none . . . May I win no victory which harms me or my\nopponent . . .  May I respect myself . . . May I always keep tame that which rages within me.\"\n(<i>This Age of Confusion<\/i>, p. 296.)\n<\/p><p>\nMay joy and happiness continue as a possession of those who love and are obedient to the\ngospel, and may the gospel be the hope and the opening of the door of light to the honest in\nheart who seek its golden truths the world over, that they may be thus numbered with the\nchildren of our Heavenly Father in this great latter-day work. I bear you my testimony that I\nknow without any question that this is the work of our Heavenly Father; I am grateful for the\nsemaphores of life that have pointed the way, and I await now only the opportunity to\ncontinue that service in the kingdom of God. I bear this witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
