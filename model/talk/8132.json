Rasband, Elder Gary\u00a0E. Stevenson, and Elder Dale\u00a0G. Renlund\u00a0as Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. Our hearts, our prayers, and our faith sustain them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">We know of their great capacity. Yet they will need reassurance in their calls, as we all do, that the Lord is with them in His work. The newest deacon needs that confidence, as does the most experienced high priest who receives a new call.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">That confidence grows as you come to see that He called you through His servants. My encouragement is to help you know that when you do your part, the Lord adds His power to your efforts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">Any calling we receive in the Lord\u2019s kingdom requires more than our human judgment and our personal powers. Those calls require help from the Lord, which will come. Even the new deacon will learn that is true, and he will go on learning over the years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">One of my grandsons is here tonight in his first priesthood session. He was ordained a deacon six days ago. He may expect that his first performance of a priesthood duty will be passing the sacrament next Sunday. My prayer is that he will see that moment as it really is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">He may think that his work for the Lord is to pass the sacrament tray to people seated in the sacrament meeting. But the Lord\u2019s purpose is not simply to have people partake of bread and water. It is to have them keep a covenant that will move them along the path to eternal life. And for that to happen, the Lord must give a spiritual experience to the person to whom the deacon offers the tray.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">I have seen that happen once in a care center when a deacon leaned forward to pass the tray to a white-haired lady. She looked at the bread as if it were precious. I have never forgotten her smile as she partook and then reached up to pat the deacon\u2019s head, saying quite loudly, \u201cOh, thank you!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">That deacon was simply performing his priesthood duty. Yet the Lord then multiplied the deacon\u2019s act. It was evident that the sister\u00a0remembered the Savior as she expressed sincere gratitude for a deacon\u2019s service. She was reassured as he served the sacrament to her that she would have the Spirit to be with her. She was not alone that day in the care center. Neither was the deacon alone in his modest service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">A young teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood may not sense, as he goes to teach a family, that he is a partner with the Lord in His work. I remember still the simple testimony of a young home-teaching companion who came into our home. The Spirit confirmed his words to me and to my family. He may not remember that day, but I do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">The Lord will magnify the efforts of a young man again when he is called to become a priest. The first baptism he performs, for instance, may be of a young person he does not know. He may be worried about whether he will say the right words and perform the ordinance correctly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">But the Lord, whose servant he is, will magnify his calling. The person he baptizes has chosen to move along the path to eternal life. The Lord will do His greater part. He did it for me once when the boy I baptized, tears streaming down his face, said in my ear, \u201cI\u2019m clean. I\u2019m clean.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">As you move from one priesthood service to another, you will see the Lord is in the work with you. I learned this from meeting an elders quorum president in a stake conference years ago. In the conference there were more than 40 names presented of men who were to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">The stake president leaned over to me and whispered, \u201cThose men were all less-active prospective elders.\u201d In amazement, I asked the president what his program was to rescue these men.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">He pointed to a young man in the back of\u00a0the chapel. He said, \u201cThere he is. Most of these men have been brought back because of that elders quorum president.\u201d He was on the back row, dressed casually, his legs stretched out with his battered boots crossed in front of him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">I asked the stake president to introduce me to him after the meeting. When we met, I told the young man I was surprised by what he had done and asked him how he did it. He shrugged his shoulders. He obviously didn\u2019t think he deserved any credit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">Then he said softly, \u201cI know every inactive guy in this town. Most of them have pickup trucks. I have a truck too. I wash my pickup where they wash theirs. In time, they become my friends.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">\u201cThen I wait until something goes wrong in their lives. It always does. They tell me about it. I listen and I don\u2019t find fault. Then, when they say, \u2018There is something wrong in my life. There just <span class=\"emphasis\">has<\/span> to be something better than this,\u2019 I tell them what is missing and where they can find it. Sometimes they believe me, and when they do, I take them with me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p22\" class=\"\" id=\"p22\">You can see why he was modest. It was because he knew he had done his small part and the Lord was doing the rest. It was the Lord who had touched the hearts of those men in their troubles. It was the Lord who had given them the feeling that there must be something better for them and a hope that they could find it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">The young man, who\u2014like you\u2014was a servant of the Lord, simply believed that if he did his small part, the Lord would help those men along the path to home and to the happiness only He could give them. This man also knew the Lord had called him as elders quorum president because he would do his part.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p24\" class=\"\" id=\"p24\">There will be times in your service when you won\u2019t have the remarkable and visible success of that young elders quorum president. That is the time when you will need to be confident that the Lord, knowing you would do your part in the work, called you through His authorized servants. Having faith in the call from the Lord\u2019s servants was crucial in the missionary service of my great-grandfather Henry Eyring.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p25\" class=\"\" id=\"p25\">He was baptized on March\u00a011, 1855, in St. Louis, Missouri. Erastus Snow ordained him to the office of a priest shortly thereafter.\u00a0The president of the St. Louis Stake, John\u00a0H. Hart, called him to serve a mission to the Cherokee Nation on October\u00a06.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-12461_000_030\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See \u201cMinutes of the Conference,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">St. Louis Luminary,<\/span> Oct. 13, 1855, 187.]<\/span><\/sup> He was ordained an elder on October\u00a011.

The only reason he could have had the courage to go was that he knew in his heart that God had called him through His authorized servants. It was the source of his courage. That must be the source of our courage to persevere, whatever our callings in the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p27\" class=\"\" id=\"p27\">After Elder Eyring had served for three difficult years and upon\u00a0the death of the mission president, Henry was nominated and sustained as president of the mission in\u00a0a meeting held on October\u00a06, 1858. He was surprised and as shocked as a new deacon would be. He wrote, \u201cIt was quite unexpected to me to be called to that responsible office but as it was the will of the brethren I cheerfully accepted, feeling at the same time my great weakness and lack of experience.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-12461_000_030\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Henry Eyring letter to Brigham Young, Oct.\u00a07, 1858, Brigham Young Office Files, Church History Library, Salt Lake City.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p28\" class=\"\" id=\"p28\">The now-President Eyring traveled to the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw Nations in 1859. Through his\u00a0efforts, the Lord \u201cadded,\u201d as Henry recorded, \u201ca number to the church.\u201d He organized two branches but noted that \u201cvery few are alive in the cause.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-12461_000_030\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Henry Eyring report to Church Historian\u2019s Office, Aug. 1860, Missionary Reports, Church History Library, Salt Lake City.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p29\" class=\"\" id=\"p29\">A year later, Henry was faced with the difficult reality that the political leaders among the people he was serving no longer permitted the Latter-day Saint missionaries to do their work. As he pondered what he should do, he recalled the instruction from his previous mission president indicating that he should prolong his mission until 1859.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-12461_000_030\">4<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See Henry Eyring letter to Brigham Young, Oct.\u00a09, 1859, Brigham Young Office Files, Church History Library, Salt Lake City.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p30\" class=\"\" id=\"p30\">In October of that year, Henry wrote to President Brigham Young for direction, but he did not receive a reply to his question. Henry recorded, \u201cNot being able to hear anything from the Presidency of the Church, I called upon the Lord in prayer, asking him to reveal to me his mind and will in regard to my remaining longer or going up to Zion.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p31\" class=\"\" id=\"p31\">He continued: \u201cThe following dream was given to me in answer to my prayer. I dreamt I had arrived in [Salt Lake] City and immediately went to [President Brigham] Young\u2019s office, where I found him. I said to him: \u2018[President] Young I have left my mission, have come of my own accord, but if there is anything wrong in this, I am willing to return and finish my mission.\u2019 [In the dream the prophet] replied: \u2018You have stayed long enough, it is all right.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p32\" class=\"\" id=\"p32\">Henry wrote in his journal, \u201cHaving had dreams before which were literally fulfilled I had faith to believe, that this also would be and consequently commenced at once to prepare for a start.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/general-priesthood-session\/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p33\" class=\"\" id=\"p33\">He arrived in Salt Lake City on August\u00a029, 1860, having walked most of the way.
