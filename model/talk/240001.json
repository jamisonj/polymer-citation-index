The Lord, and if He does not I am sure we cannot do it, and if He does not show us how we cannot do it. Well, some people come and try to convert us. Very well, let them convert away. If they have anything to convert you to, I say for God's sake take it, if they have something that is more intelligent than that which has been communicated to you. We are desirous to obtain all truth from whatever quarter it comes, and every good thing that can be made manifest, and if anybody has got any truths that we have not we are prepared to embrace them, but we have no truths to barter away for the fictions, ideas, theories and opinions of men.

And hence it is necessary that we should comprehend the position we occupy. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v24n3\"> We have been in the world and we have preached the Gospel to the world and are doing it, and that is part of our duty, and we are fulfilling it as fast as the Lord opens the way. We have done a great deal. I think that at an assembly some little time ago there were twenty-five nationalities represented. Is there any difference of sentiment among these diverse people? No. In speaking with a gentleman recently on some of the difficulties between the English and the Irish people, I told him that it was lamentable that such a feeling should exist. Well, said he, they are two different races and they cannot affiliate, one being Celtic and the other Anglo-Saxon, and their sympathies and feelings are dissimilar. Their ideas and feelings differ; their education and their instincts differ. That is very true so far as it goes. But what of us? We are gathered here under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, and that as I before said, produces a unity of feeling and spirit, a oneness and sympathy that does not exist in the world and Jesus has said, By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye love one another.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"69856\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 69856)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(69856)\">John 13:35<\/a><\/span> We have people among us from all parts of the United States, from Ireland, Scotland and Wales, from England, France and Germany, from Denmark, Norway and Sweden; also from Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, from the islands of the sea, and in fact, from nearly every civilized country. And how is it brethren? Are we Scandinavians; are we English; are we Scotch, Swiss or Dutch, as the case may be? No; the Spirit of God, which we obtained through obedience to the requirements of the Gospel; having <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"2b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD24\/JoD24_0002.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;2b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8758\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> been born again, of the water and of the Spirit,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"68842\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 68842)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(68842)\">John 3:5<\/a><\/span> has made us of one heart, one faith, one baptism;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"74991\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 74991)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(74991)\">Eph. 4:5<\/a><\/span> we have no national or class divisions of that kind among us. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v24n4\"> What, then, are we aiming at? We are aiming to introduce among us the principle of virtue, integrity, honesty, and a knowledge of God and of His laws. This is what we are seeking to do. And do we injure any man or set of men in so doing? I think not. I will say to the credit of our merchants, that they are spoken of as honorable men, as men who pay their debts better than the majority of mankind. Such is the report I hear from gentlemen with whom I communicate. This is pleasing to hear. It is pleasing to see the principle of honor introduced in our trading; and we ought to be honorable one with another and with all men, treating all with the respect they deserve and merit at our hands. But because we do this are we to submit to every kind of indignity; are we to submit to be outraged, to be traduced; are we to permit, in a social capacity, evils and crimes to be introduced in our midst, and never lift up our voice against them? Are we to permit our sons and daughters to affiliate and associate with corrupt men and women? No. But if our youth choose to pursue a course of that kind, all well? No, I will not say it is well; it would be better if they did better. We are here to introduce correct principles; and we profess to be moving on a more elevated plane; we profess to be under the influence of the inspiration of the Almighty; and God cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"82388\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 82388)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(82388)\">Alma 45:16<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"83717\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 83717)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(83717)\">D&amp;C 1:31<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v24n5\"> Let me read that prayer a little more: &#x201C;Our Father who art in heaven.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"63317\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 63317)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(63317)\">Matt. 6:9<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"67507\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 67507)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(67507)\">Luke 11:2<\/a><\/span> What, is He indeed my  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"3a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD24\/JoD24_0003.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;3a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8757\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>Father?

What do they tell us? They set themselves up as our exemplars, and among other things say, we must marry as they do. And how is that? Let me ask some of you venerable, whiteheaded men that were married in various places, what kind of a covenant did you make? You were asked if you would take the woman to be your lawful wedded wife, for how long? Until death did you part. What a miserable thing. And this is what they have to offer. A woman takes a man as long as he lives, and then when he dies all is gone into oblivion; no eternal unity, no claim pertaining to heaven or the future; no sons, no daughters, no wife, no husband. That is nihilism, I think. This is the condition they would put you in today, if you would listen to them. But we are told that we should remember the rock from whence we are hewn, and the pit from whence we were dug.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"59491\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 59491)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(59491)\">Isa. 51:1<\/a><\/span> God has shown us principles that are ten thousand times more exalting and ennobling than anything they have to offer.

It would be something like their marriage&#x2014;it ends in death, and sometimes even before that. What has been the proceeding here? Who are the authors and abettors of the iniquities that prevail in our midst? Wicked and unscrupulous men, the professed advocates of reform and a hypocritical civilization, such as ministers, politicians and others. Who are the introducers and originators of our gambling hells, or bagnios, and of the open and flagrant acts of debauchery and corruption that prevail in our cities where Gentiles reside? Who are the protectors of drunkenness and other vices? Our professed Christian reformers. These are their institutions; and their emissaries have been trying to introduce the murder of the innocents in the shape of feticide and infanticide. Can we believe in the sincerity and truthfulness of such hypocritical, corrupt and degraded men? They tell us it is contrary to law for a man to be married as we are, especially if he has more wives than one. They talk about polygamy; but that is not the thing which they are aiming at. I will mention these things some other time. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v24n14\"> There are one or two statements that I wish to make before I close.

You have heard a statement about Mayor Little and his son. Talk about purity! Was there any purity about that! The young man was obliged to object to his father, who was an honorable man, registering, because he had what? Broken any law? I do not think he had ever broken a polygamic law, but he had two wives some time ago when there was no law against it. Some of these things we mean to contest yet. We have not laid aside our franchise. If any think so they make a great mistake. There is not one man or woman in twenty who have refrained from exercising their franchise at the polls who, if the law of the United States was carried out and constitutional principles sustained, could be interfered with according to the most rigid interpretation of the so-called polygamic laws, and we shall contest these rights. We are not going to give up everything. In the interests of peace some of us hold our franchise in abeyance at the present time; but as I stated at Conference when I spoke of these things&#x2014;we mean to contend for our rights legally and constitutionally, inch by inch to the last end, and to maintain the principle of human rights in the interest of ourselves, in the interest of our children, in the interest of the honorable men of this nation, and in the interest of the freedom of man throughout the world. So do not think we are giving up everything: we have not given up one solitary iota. Yet we thought it better to withdraw until we had a fair opportunity to contest all these things peaceably, and quietly, and to contend for our rights legally and constitutionally as  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"7a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD24\/JoD24_0007.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;7a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8753\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>American citizens and as men. Can we think that men are very sincere who purse the course that has been adopted toward us? And what on the back of the refusal to let Brother Little register? It is purity they are after; is it? Here comes along the keeper of a bagnio and its inmates? Can they be registered? Yes! Because, according to a ruling, not a law, but a perversion of law, an oath is prescribed to American citizens, wherein, loathsome, damning vices are protected. And they can register while the honorable and virtuous are rejected. And our good, Christian folks try to crowd these things down our throats. Well, we can bide our time. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v24n15\"> I will refer to another affair that took place. Another man, when he came to be registered, after looking at the oath said: &#x201C;I don't think I can take it, because I have got a wife and keep a mistress.&#x201D; But he was requested to read the oath. After having done so, he said: &#x201C;I see the crime is here in it being in the marriage relation, and though I have a mistress as well as a wife, the mistress is not in the marriage relation, and I can take it.&#x201D; This man was said to be candid. Of course he was, and people say that he was honorable to tell his feelings. Yes, he was honorable, if it can be honorable for a man to pledge himself before the altar to be true to his wife and to the covenants he had made before God and witnesses&#x2014;and then break those covenants; if that is honor, he may be called an honorable man, but we do not call it very honorable amongst us. This shows that lascivious cohabitation can be tolerated and protected by men who would seek to be our teachers and our reformers.

It is a circumstance that is to be deplored. A married man considered here an honorable man, an upright man, a man that has taken an active part in some of the schools, who has given considerable to the building of churches and it has been thought that he was really seeking to do good amongst us&#x2014;has lately sought to abduct an honorable young lady, or tried to persuade her to leave her home clandestinely with him and go to a distant land. How can we trust these people? These are facts; I have the letters; I know what I am talking about, and yet these are who are supposed to be Christian reformers, identified with churches, schools, and other places of improvement, who do not shrink to associate themselves with those infamies. A very low state of morality exists among them, as we know. How is it with us? Do we have men that sometimes do wrong? Yes. Do we sanction the wrong? Can an adulterer have a place amongst us? I tell you, No, he cannot, and any Bishop who would permit anything of that sort ought himself to be removed.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"85330\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 85330)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(85330)\">D&amp;C 42:24-26<\/a><\/span> We are in favor of chastity, purity and virtue, not nominally but really, and we should make a distinction between one thing and the other and maintain virtue and correct principles in spite of the hypocrisy and corruptions that exists, for it is among us and around us.
