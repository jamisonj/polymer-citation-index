As the Church has grown, Relief Society is now able to fulfill its purposes in every ward and branch, in every stake and district, while adapting in an ever-changing world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/what-i-hope-my-granddaughters-and-grandsons-will-understand-about-relief-society.p22\" class=\"\">Every day, Relief Society sisters around the world experience the entire range of mortal challenges and experiences. Women and their families today live face to face with unrealized expectations; mental, physical, and spiritual illness; accidents; and death. Some sisters suffer loneliness and disappointment because they do not have families of their own, and others suffer from the consequences of poor choices made by family members. Some have experienced war or hunger or natural disasters, and others are learning about the strain of addictions, unemployment, or insufficient education and training. All of these difficulties have the potential to bleach the bones of faith and exhaust the strength of individuals and families.

This element of our discipleship should closely resemble the ministry of our Savior. In the early days of Relief Society, a visiting committee from each ward received an assignment to assess needs and collect donations to be distributed to those in need. Throughout the years, Relief Society sisters and leaders have learned one step at a time and have improved in their ability to watch over others. There have been times when sisters have focused more on completing visits, teaching lessons, and leaving notices when they have stopped by their sisters\u2019 homes. These practices have helped sisters learn patterns of watchcare. Just as people in the time of Moses concentrated on keeping long lists of rules, the sisters of Relief Society have at times imposed many written and unwritten rules upon themselves in their desire to understand how to strengthen one another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/what-i-hope-my-granddaughters-and-grandsons-will-understand-about-relief-society.p27\" class=\"\">With so much need for relief and rescue in the lives of sisters and their families today, our Heavenly Father needs us to follow a higher path and demonstrate our discipleship by sincerely caring for His children.

It will unify and align a worldwide sisterhood with the purposes of Relief Society and the patterns and privileges of disciples. It is a witness of women\u2019s essential role in our Father\u2019s plan of happiness, and it provides an immovable standard of what we believe, what we do, and what we will defend. The First Presidency has encouraged us to \u201cstudy this book and allow its timeless truths and inspiring examples to influence [our] lives.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote21-09611_000_044\">21<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[First Presidency, in <span class=\"emphasis\">Daughters in My Kingdom,<\/span> ix.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/what-i-hope-my-granddaughters-and-grandsons-will-understand-about-relief-society.p33\" class=\"\">Knowing that the organization of Relief Society was divinely created, President Joseph\u00a0F.

As Relief Society becomes a way of life for them, I hope they will serve in unity with others to fulfill its divine purposes. I have a testimony of the true restored Church of Jesus Christ, and I am grateful for the pattern of discipleship that was restored when the Lord inspired the Prophet Joseph Smith to organize Relief Society.
