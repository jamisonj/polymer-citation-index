Lee, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1949, pp. 44-51<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI would like to introduce the few remarks that I shall make by recalling a few scriptures, one\nof which has been repeated by two previous speakers today.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord declared:\n<\/p><p>\nAll truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all\nintelligence also; otherwise there is no existence\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12706\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12706)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12706)\">D&amp;C 93:30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFREEDOM OF CHOICE \n<\/p><p>\nAnd the other, quoted by Elder Romney as one of the great teachings from the Book of\nMormon, was Father Lehi's explanation of this same great principle to his son Jacob:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he had created our first\nparents, and the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are\ncreated, it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in opposition\nto the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter.\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man\ncould not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3500\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3500)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3500)\">2 Ne. 2:15-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere were those who seemingly, as evidenced by their conduct, think of this principle of free\nagency as a matter of license to do what they please to do. But again Father Lehi explains this\nmatter to his son:\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things shall be given them which are\nexpedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great\nmediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power\nof the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3502\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3502)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3502)\">2 Ne. 2:27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe must teach men everywhere that liberty and freedom are to be obtained only by yielding\nobedience to truth. We must teach Latter-day Saints the meaning of the words of the Savior:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27371\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27371)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27371)\">John 8:32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnyone who looks about him and thinks about this matter will see great evidence of the\npower of evil enticing men to do evil. It must be understood by us as a Church that if we are\nto build a force that will nullify the power of evil, we must develop the God-given agencies\nplaced in his Church to entice men to seek the paths that lead to eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nGENERAL SERVICEMEN'S COMMITTEE\n<\/p><p>\nI have recalled these scriptures I have quoted many times during the last few years because of\nthe feeling and weight of responsibility that has rested upon me in the assignment of the First\nPresidency as a member of the general servicemen's committee directing the work of the\nChurch among our Latter-day Saint boys in military service and as a member of the general\npriesthood committee. It was with a prayer of relief that we thanked the Lord that we had\ncome through the war with as few casualties, spiritually speaking, as we did, but it was with\nconsiderable anxiety that we again saw marshaled into the ranks of the military, our young,\nuntrained boys, many of them without experience and with not too much faith developed, in a\nso-called peacetime draft. We came soon to see and learn, to our dismay, that the moral\nhazards in such a situation were even greater than during the fighting part of the war. Then\nthere was something of a moral discipline that boys had when ahead of them there was the\nprospect of imminent death.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is true today that the draft situation has eased somewhat, but we view with fear and anxiety\nthe forces that are at work which would have a universal military draft of all able-bodied\nyoung men in this country, which will come except God in his mercy shall deliver us\ntherefrom. It is because of that anxiety and that possibility and the fact that we still have\nmany of our young men in service that have caused me to think of these matters which the\nLord has called to our attention.\n<\/p><p>\nVIEWS OF CHAPLAIN\n<\/p><p>\nWith respect to the matter of war and the processes of war, a chaplain who served in two\nwars and longer, writes this:\n<\/p><p>\nWar (and by inference the training for it) makes for few conversions. War only makes people\nmore strongly what they were when the struggle began. If they were intemperate when they\nwent into uniform, they will usually have become much harder drinkers by the time they\ncome back home. If they were careless in sex morality, they are almost sure to have become\nmore slimy in that respect. If they were noisy braggarts, you may expect them to return\nintolerable boasters. If they were selfish, their selfishness will have increased. If they were\nhonest, decent, modest men, the war will usually have improved those qualities. If they\ndespised God, they will have come out more sure in scorn; if they loved God a little, they\nwill have learned to love him a lot. But there will be no more conversions than in peacetime,\nrather less. All history shows it true that no religious revival ever began or was fostered by\nbattle.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat is said here by this chaplain about those away from their homes in military service\nmight in part be said about all who are away from their homes and away from the influence\nof the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nAs we scan the priesthood reports from quarter to quarter, there is evidence that there are\nmany of our priesthood members not in military service but likewise away from home and\naway from the ties and influences of the Church. There are also reports of many girls who are\naway from their homes at school and at work and, therefore, shorn of the influences that\notherwise would tie them close to the influence of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nPLACE OF REFUGE\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Lord revealed the name by which his Church was to be called, he gave some other\ninstructions as to what that Church was to do. He said:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd that the gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her stakes, may be for a\ndefense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without\nmixture upon the whole earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12725\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12725)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12725)\">D&amp;C 115:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs I have thought of that refuge which the Lord designed his organization to be, I have\nthought of those agencies within it, one of which Elder Benson spoke so eloquently about in\nhis Church of the Air address this morning, the home. He quoted the scripture which we have\nhad repeated time and time again as a quotation from the revelation of the Lord. After the\nLord had declared it a sin upon the heads of the parents if they failed to teach the law of\nrepentance and have their children baptized when eight years of age\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12655\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12655)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12655)\">D&amp;C 68:25<\/a><\/span>), he said:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the inhabitants of Zion also shall remember their labors, inasmuch as they are appointed\nto labor, in all faithfulness; for the idler shall be had in remembrance before the Lord\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12659\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12659)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12659)\">D&amp;C 68:28-30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPURPOSES OF CHURCH ORGANIZATION\n<\/p><p>\nThe Apostle Paul has defined another one of the purposes of the Church organization in his\nwritings to the Ephesians. He declared that the Lord gave this organization \". . . to edify the\nbody of the church,\" (or, in other words to educate the members of the Church until they\nwould) \"all come unto a unity of faith\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21634\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21634)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21634)\">Eph. 4:12-13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nClearly the Apostle Paul saw the importance of the teacher and those who would instruct our\nmembers in the doctrines of the Church as another of those divine agencies in the Church to\nentice against the power of evil. It would be well if all the teachers would understand what\nthe Apostle Paul meant when he said to the Corinthians:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I . . . came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you\nthe testimony of God.\n<\/p><p>\nFor I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"172\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 172)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(172)\">1 Cor. 2:1-2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOBJECTIVE OF TEACHERS\n<\/p><p>\nThat should be the only objective of instructors and teachers in this Church to teach \"Jesus\nChrist, and him crucified.\" We need not the \"excellency of speech nor of wisdom,\" but we\nneed the testimony of God, as Paul said. And then this warning came in his later writings:\n<\/p><p>\nFor if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"179\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 179)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(179)\">1 Cor. 14:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Joseph F. Smith, in commenting about this and decrying the fact that there were\nsome apparently trying to confuse our people and lead them away by destroying faith rather\nthan by building a testimony of God, said:\n<\/p><p>\nAmong the Latter-day Saints the preaching of false doctrine disguised as truths of the gospel\nmay be expected from people, of two classes and practically from these only; they are: First,\nthe hopelessly ignorant, whose lack of intelligence is due to their indolence and sloth, who\nmake but feeble effort, if indeed any at all, to better themselves, by reading and study; those\nwho are afflicted with a dread disease that may develop into an incurable malady&mdash;laziness.\n<\/p><p>\nSecond, the proud and self-vaunting ones, who read by the lamp of their own conceit; who\ninterpret by rules of their own contriving; who have become a law unto themselves, and so\npose as the sole judges of their own doings, more dangerously ignorant than the first.\n<\/p><p>\nBeware of the lazy and the proud; their infection in each case is contagious; better for them\nand for all when they are compelled to display the yellow flag of warning, that the clean and\nuninfected may be protected.\n<\/p><p>\nI wish that we could have in all our classes and meetings the spirit which characterized one of\nour missionary meetings down at Ventura, California, where I visited recently with President\nOscar W. McConkie, of the California Mission, when a woman who had sat in one of our\nLatter-day Saint meetings for the first time in her life made this comment at the close of the\nmeeting:\n<\/p><p>\nI have studied the scriptures all my life, but today the words of the scriptures have been made\nto live.\n<\/p><p>\nSo can be all the instructions of inspired teachers of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nDUTIES OF THE PRIESTHOOD\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now there is a third agency in the Church to entice men away from evil.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has set up the priesthood, and to them he gave the injunction to elders, priests,\nteachers, deacons, that they were to \"watch over the Church\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12611\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12611)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12611)\">D&amp;C 20:53<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;and in more detailed\nexplanation to the teachers&mdash;\"to see that there is no iniquity, no evil speaking, and that all\nChurch members do their duty\" (see\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12612\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12612)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12612)\">D&amp;C 20:54<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBut, even after instructions have gone out from the General Authorities, concerning the\nservicemen, to our bishops and stake presidents as how the boys away from home may be\ncontacted and directed; and after our instructions have gone out about the girls who likewise\nare away from home, and how we ought to shepherd them and keep in touch with them; and\nhow the quorums should look after their absent members, we regret to say our reports indicate\nthat sometimes quorum leaders take too lightly the exercise of those agencies which our\nHeavenly Father has caused to be set up here for the enticement to do good of those who\notherwise are being enticed by evil.\n<\/p><p>\nAt the beginning of the war there was an interesting newspaper account of a boy flying in\nfrom a training trip over the air field who suddenly shouted through his radio device to the\nman in the control tower below: \"I can't see. I've lost my eyesight.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the man in the control tower said: \"Now, Son, you get a grip on yourself, and I will tell\nyou what to do.\"\n<\/p><p>\nQuietly the man in the control tower guided him and had him circle the field many times,\nlosing altitude by manipulating the controls, and finally the pilot rolled to a stop safely in\nfront of the control tower on the ground.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is that kind of calm wisdom and counsel that we need so much today. I would like to\nillustrate what I mean by bringing you parts of two letters from two of our boys who came\nthrough a period of spiritual \"blindness\" because of the steadying influence of wise counselors\nin the Church. One of these boys wrote a letter just recently and began his letter by saying:\n<\/p><p>\nEXPERIENCE OF SERVICEMAN\n<\/p><p>\n\"My bishop is the best bishop in this Church.\" He then explained that when he became a\npriest, his bishop taught him, among the first things, that God answered prayer. So the bishop\ninstructed him before he went away into military service, and he went away strengthened by\nthese teachings, but when he got out there, he learned to his dismay that some of those who\nclaim membership in the Church did not act as the servants of the Lord should. They were\nrowdy. There was irreverence. And he got to thinking, \"Could it be the Church of Jesus Christ\nif they don't reverence his name and are irreverent in his house?\" He went to visit other\nchurches and found a spirit of worship that sometimes was not to be found in his own. In his\nown way he formed the conclusion that therefore the Church must be wrong. He wrote home\nto his bishop and said: \"Bishop, I have decided to join another church. I feel that this must be\nwrong or our people would be more reverent in their meetings.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHis bishop wrote back and said: \"Well, my boy, do not act too hastily. You study about this\nmatter, and think about it. You pray to your Heavenly Father, and everything will be all\nright.\" The boy then wrote this:\n<\/p><p>\n\"On Thanksgiving night, I was very tired as I had just come off a watch at night, and when I\nhad gone to bed, all I wanted to do was sleep. That night God answered my prayer. It was\nlate, and what to me was a vision and to the common people would be a dream came to me. I\nsaw a beautiful garden, and in the middle of this garden was a golden path. Coming down the\npath was my grandfather who had died in 1937. On the other side was my uncle who had\ndied on a mission in 1939.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Now I had gone to bed very tired, and I had never thought of my uncle or my grandfather as\nthey had died when I was still under ten years of age.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But that was not all. In the middle of them was Joseph Smith. They all talked to me, and the\nfinal thing that I can remember distinctly as being said was Joseph Smith telling me to stick\nto the truth, no matter what the other people said or did and to listen to the truth even though\nothers did not listen to it.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Then he said that there was still work to be done there as I had work to do here, and they\nfaded away, and it seemed that I was in the garden alone until the garden began to fade, and I\nseemed to fall.\n<\/p><p>\n\"When I awoke, it was still the middle of the night, and it was also cold, yet I had a feeling\nof warmth within me, and I knew that God had answered my prayers. I finished the night in\nrestful sleep.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Now you may think I was dreaming, too, but I still feel and know that I had an answer to\nmy prayer.\n<\/p><p>\nI recalled that boy's letter when we heard a group of missionaries down in the California\nMission say: \"When we get discouraged and downcast and blue, we have made a practice to\ngo away fasting into the mountains before daylight and stay there all day and return after dark\nat night, and we have never failed to come from that experience strengthened by the power of\nGod.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWOUNDED MAN REMEMBERED\n<\/p><p>\nAnother of our men coming back from combat service overseas was thrown into the middle\nof the ocean when his ship was torpedoed. He was seriously burned and was sent to a\nsanitarium, with his mind greatly disturbed and upset. He writes this testimony:\n<\/p><p>\n\"While in the hospital, word came to me that my son had been gravely wounded in the South\nPacific. I could not go to him. My world had collapsed. No, again, it is not the usual story. I\ndid not remain steadfast in the faith. I became rebellious. I blamed my Heavenly Father for all\nof the misery and distress which was mine. I concluded that he had let me down. I turned\naway from him. I even got to the point where I could no longer pray. It seemed as if my line\nof communication had been broken, and I had lost all contact with God. That was the depth\nof human misery. Utter futility and resentment were mine. There is no destitution like that of\nbeing out of contact with our Heavenly Father. It is like receiving a busy signal when you call\nyour doctor in an emergency.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But then a miracle happened! My friends in the Church had not forgotten me! They prayed\nwith faith for my recovery. My name was placed in the temples of our Lord where prayer was\nsaid in my behalf. My children continued to pray even as I had taught them to do. My parents\nprayed with an unwavering faith.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The elders of the Church sought me out and gave me a blessing. I had little faith in them,\nbut God had not forgotten me. He heard those prayers, and he turned not away. And health\nsoon returned to my body.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI ask you members and leaders of the Church: Suppose that the bishop had been too busy to\nwrite to his boy who was disturbed by the irreverence of many who attended meetings where\nhe had been. Suppose that he had not been taught as a priest the things which the bishop had\ntaught him about prayer and how he could get an answer to his problems. Suppose that this\nother man's elders' quorum had failed, and they had forgotten to pray back home. I ask you\nto consider the seriousness of our responsibility in these matters.\n<\/p><p>\nDAY OF DECEPTION\n<\/p><p>\nToday is a day of clever deception, a day when the Master declared one of the signs of his\ncoming should be that even the very elect, according to the covenant, would be deceived\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34311\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34311)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34311)\">Matt. 24:24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOne of our boys now studying in a large university on the coast declared that the \"thing that\nhad kept him from losing faith in the Bible which the higher critics have decimated almost to\na point of non-recognition,\" he said, \"the thing that has kept my faith is that I know the Book\nof Mormon is true, and because of that testimony I know that what they are saying about the\nBible is false and not the truth.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has given us a sure guide as to how we might discern truth from error. He said:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd that which doth not edify is not of God. . . .\n<\/p><p>\nThat which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light and continueth in God, receiveth\nmore light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12630\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12630)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12630)\">D&amp;C 50:22-24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nKEEP GOD'S COMMANDMENTS\n<\/p><p>\nI wish we could take a lesson from the testimony of a man in this city who conducts a\nbusiness here, who wrote and told me about a little experience he had when during the\nso-called depression of the past years, he thought he was going to lose everything that he had,\nand so he fasted and prayed that the Lord would show him how to save his business, and he\nsaid: \"One morning just as it was breaking daylight I felt the still small voice which said to\nme: 'If you will only but keep God's commandments, you will be given all the wisdom\nnecessary to save your business.\n<\/p><p>\nSimple, but a great powerful truth&mdash;if we will only keep God's commandments, the wisdom\nsufficient to our needs will be given us!\n<\/p><p>\nIn the words of one, may we not forget the great truth which he has put in these words:\n<\/p><p>\nIsn't it strange that princes and kings<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;        And clowns that caper in sawdust rings<br \/>\nAnd just plain folks like you and me<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;        Are builders for eternity?\n<\/p><p>\nTo each is given a bag of tools,<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;        A shapeless mass and a book of rules,<br \/>\nAnd each must build ere life has flown,<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;        A stumbling-block or a steppingstone. <br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                               (\"Stumbling-Block or Stepping Stone,\"<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                                by R. L. Sharpe.)\n<\/p><p>\nGod grant us strength. May we rise to our responsibilities, to do our job, to entice the\nmembership of this Church and the world to seek the things that bring eternal life and\nhappiness here and in the world to come, I pray humbly, in the name of the Lord Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
