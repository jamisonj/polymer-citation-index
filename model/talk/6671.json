Although none of us spoke the language, my six-year-old had the greatest difficulty learning a new language. We decided to put her in preschool with four-year-olds, even though she should be starting first grade. Our hope was that interaction with younger children would be less intimidating to her and might facilitate her ability to communicate in Portuguese.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-language-of-love.p5\" class=\"\">But the reality for my daughter was that she was as foreign to the children as they were to her.

A few even threw rocks and bullied her, laughing rudely at recess. She was scared and hurt and decided she couldn\u2019t go back into class. Sitting alone while the playground emptied, she remembered what we had taught her about loneliness. She remembered that Heavenly Father is always close to His children and she could speak to Him at any time, not just before bedtime. He would understand the language of her heart. In a corner of the playground, she bowed her head and said a prayer. She didn\u2019t know what to pray for, so she asked that her father and mother could be with her to protect her. While returning to the classroom, a Primary song came into her mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I often go walking in meadows of clover,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And I gather armfuls of blossoms of blue.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I gather the blossoms the whole meadow over;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Dear mother, all flowers remind me of you.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-language-of-love.p11\" class=\"\">(\u201cI Often Go Walking,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Children\u2019s Songbook,<\/span> 202)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-language-of-love.p12\" class=\"\">As she opened her eyes, she noticed one little flower growing between the cracks of the cement.
