I am blessed with a wonderful wife and family. I am buoyed up by the strength of the Brethren with whom it is now my blessing to serve.

Hinckley.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/obedience-lifes-great-challenge.p5\" class=\"\">As I have made my transition this past year from the corporate world of business to that of trying to be a faithful full-time servant of our Father in Heaven and an especial witness of Jesus Christ, it has been a very tender experience for me. It has made me more sensitive to the responsibility, the blessings, and the opportunities that the gospel affords each of us if we will be obedient to its principles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/obedience-lifes-great-challenge.p6\" class=\"\">President Boyd K. Packer has stated on a number of occasions that \u201cwe all have the right to inspiration and direction by the Spirit of the Holy Ghost.\u201d And then he adds, \u201cWe all live far below our privileges.\u201d As I have pondered the implications of his statement, it becomes clear that many of us are missing some spiritual opportunities and blessings by letting \u201cthe things that should matter most in life be at the mercy of the things that matter least.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/obedience-lifes-great-challenge.p7\" class=\"\">If any one of us were asked what is most important in life, most of us would quickly respond, \u201cOur families and the opportunities the gospel affords us to be celestial families\u2014together forever.\u201d Yet the pressures of everyday living frequently and subtly move us away from that pursuit which we so proudly proclaim. And in the process the priorities that should really matter most to us become captive to those things that, while seemingly important at the moment, have little or no relevance to our long-term goal. And in many cases, the temptations and pressures to pursue the less-important matters lead us down the wrong paths of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/obedience-lifes-great-challenge.p8\" class=\"\">President Spencer W. Kimball warned us, \u201cThe cares of the world are so many and so entangling, even very good people are diverted from following the truth because they care too much for the things of the world.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-98905_000_034\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cListen to the Prophets,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1978, 77.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/obedience-lifes-great-challenge.p9\" class=\"\">While I have had my share of lessons on obedience during my life, one of the most memorable was taught to me as a young boy by my dog and my mother. When I was about eight years of age, my father brought home a puppy which I promptly named Spot. We became the greatest of pals as I tried to teach him a few tricks and obedience to my commands. He learned well, except he could not conquer an overwhelming desire to chase and bark at cars as they came down the dusty street by our home in our small southern Utah town. As hard as I tried, I could not break Spot of his bad habit. One day a neighbor came speeding by in his large truck. He knew Spot and he knew Spot\u2019s bad habit. This time, just as Spot approached the truck in his usual aggressive manner, this man swerved toward Spot, running over him with the rear wheel of his truck.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/obedience-lifes-great-challenge.p10\" class=\"\">With tears streaming down my face, I cradled Spot in my arms and ran to the house, calling to my mother and brother for help. As we washed the blood from his head, it soon became apparent that Spot\u2019s disobedient act had dealt him a fatal blow. As the burial of Spot was completed and the tears dried, my mother then taught me one of the great lessons of life as she explained the principle of obedience and its application in my life. She made clear that seemingly small acts of disobedience can result in longer-term consequences of unhappiness, regrets, and even fatal results.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/obedience-lifes-great-challenge.p11\" class=\"\">As we grow in the gospel, we learn the value of obedience to principles which will consistently align us with the teachings of our Savior and prophets. As we are obedient to their teachings, we then begin to understand what the Savior meant when He said, \u201cFor whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-98905_000_034\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37795\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37795)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37795)\">Matt. 16:25<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/obedience-lifes-great-challenge.p12\" class=\"\">Since we each have periodic challenges of obedience, we can take heart in President Hinckley\u2019s encouragement \u201cthat the Lord will not give us commandments beyond our power to observe.

As we mature into young adults and beyond, setting priorities and managing pressures between work, Church, and family is a balancing act that requires continual reevaluation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/obedience-lifes-great-challenge.p14\" class=\"\">Periodically one might well ask, \u201cIf I continue to travel the road I am currently following, where will it lead me and what will happen to my family?\u201d Are we establishing the foundation for an eternal family, or are we focusing more on the pride of personal accomplishments and a collection of temporal trophies that are taking precedence over the things that should really matter most?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/obedience-lifes-great-challenge.p15\" class=\"\">Regardless of our age and stage in life, daily obedience to gospel principles is the only sure way to eternal happiness.
