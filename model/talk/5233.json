I would like to thank the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Seventy for everything they have taught me during the course of many years about the Savior and the way I can serve him better. I would also like to thank my mission president, who believed in me during my youth. He gave me confidence and nurtured my testimony of Christ and his restored gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/honour-thy-father-and-thy-mother.p6\" class=\"\">I come to this calling with a feeling of inadequacy but also with a great and solemn testimony that comes from God that I am willing to give my best to serve the Lord and his people. I received this calling through President Hinckley, who also called me as the stake mission president of the first stake in Santiago, Chile, in 1972 and later as president of the Mexico City South Mission in 1982.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/honour-thy-father-and-thy-mother.p7\" class=\"\">As I have pondered about my childhood, my youth, and my adult life, I believe that the foundation for my beliefs was laid by my parents during the years of my childhood and youth. I wish to render a tribute to them. My father and mother, with no formal education, knew how to teach the eternal principles of the gospel. I am the tenth child in a family of twelve children\u2014ten boys and two girls.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/honour-thy-father-and-thy-mother.p8\" class=\"\">The Lord gave to Israel, through Moses, the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai.

First, they taught us correct principles and helped us walk uprightly before the Lord and live his commandments. Second, they taught us the value of work, personal integrity, and family unity. Even though not all of us are members of the Church, we have tried to live according to the principles they taught us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/honour-thy-father-and-thy-mother.p10\" class=\"\">Every year we have the opportunity to gather as a family\u2014children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren\u2014with my father.

I worried about work, my girlfriend, school, and family. When I was old enough to go on a mission, my father was almost sixty-six years old, and I thought, my father is old, and if I leave for two years, he may die and I will not see him anymore. Who will take care of my mother? She will be all alone when he is no longer at her side.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/honour-thy-father-and-thy-mother.p12\" class=\"\">May I tell you that I served two years in the mission, I served in the Church schools in Chile for five years, I served as a mission president for three years, as a Regional Representative for six years, and my father is still here at the head of the family.

We asked him to give me a blessing, something which I have always striven to do when I have received a new priesthood assignment. He laid his hands upon my head and gave me a short but grand blessing. He said, \u201cSon, I bless you that the Holy Spirit may accompany you, your wife, and your children in everything you do.\u201d What more could I wish for?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/honour-thy-father-and-thy-mother.p17\" class=\"\">I would also like to thank my sweet companion and my dear children, two of whom are now serving full-time missions and the third is awaiting his call.
