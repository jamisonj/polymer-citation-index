Six months ago, at the close of our conference, I stated that my beloved companion of 67 years was seriously ill. She passed away two days later. It was April 6, a significant day to all of us of this Church. I wish to thank publicly the dedicated doctors and wonderful nurses who attended her during her final illness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/the-women-in-our-lives.p5\" class=\"\">My children and I were at her bedside as she slipped peacefully into eternity. As I held her hand and saw mortal life drain from her fingers, I confess I was overcome. Before I married her, she had been the girl of my dreams, to use the words of a song then popular. She was my dear companion for more than two-thirds of a century, my equal before the Lord, really my superior. And now in my old age, she has again become the girl of my dreams.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/the-women-in-our-lives.p6\" class=\"\">Immediately following her passing there was a tremendous outpouring of love from across the world. Great quantities of beautiful floral offerings were sent. Large contributions were made in her name to the Perpetual Education Fund and her academic chair at Brigham Young University. There were literally hundreds of letters. We have boxes filled with them from many we know and from very many we do not know. They all express admiration for her and sympathy and love for us whom she left behind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/the-women-in-our-lives.p7\" class=\"\">We regret that we have been unable to respond individually to these many expressions.

One is incomplete without the other.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/the-women-in-our-lives.p26\" class=\"\">I recognize that we have many wonderful women among us who do not have the opportunity of marriage. But they, too, make such a tremendous contribution. They serve the Church faithfully and ably. They teach in the organizations. They stand as officers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/the-women-in-our-lives.p27\" class=\"\">I witnessed a very interesting thing the other day. The General Authorities were in a meeting, and the presidency of the Relief Society were there with us. These able women stood in our council room and shared with us principles of welfare and of helping those who are in distress. Our stature as officers of this Church was not diminished by what they did. Our capacities to serve were increased.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/the-women-in-our-lives.p28\" class=\"\">There are some men who, in a spirit of arrogance, think they are superior to women. They do not seem to realize that they would not exist but for the mother who gave them birth. When they assert their superiority they demean her. It has been said, \u201cMan can not degrade woman without himself falling into degradation; he can not elevate her without at the same time elevating himself\u201d (Alexander Walker, in <span class=\"emphasis\">Elbert Hubbard\u2019s Scrap Book<\/span> [1923], 204).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/the-women-in-our-lives.p29\" class=\"\">How very true that is. We see the bitter fruit of that degradation all about us. Divorce is one of its results. This evil runs rampant through our society. It is the outcome of disrespect for one\u2019s marriage partner.
