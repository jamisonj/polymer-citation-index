We should always have been in danger if He had not taken care of us. &#x201C;But,&#x201D; say some, &#x201C;don't you think that when our Legislature meet they had better go to work and pass a law doing away with polygamy?&#x201D; No; no such thought ever enters my mind; and as I said in the few remarks I made this morning: <\/div> <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"355b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD24\/JoD24_0355.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;355b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/8405\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v24n1022\"> &#x201C;We want no cowards in our ranks, Who will our colors fly; We call for valiant-hearted men, Who are not afraid to die.&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v24n1023\"> No yielding up of principles that God has revealed.

[The audience responded with a loud &#x201C;Amen.&#x201D;] We want no trembling in the knees, nor anything of that kind around us. Let those who hold such ideas go among the other class and advocate their views with them, but not with us. These are my feelings and my views in relation to this matter. If we can be true to ourselves, true to our God; if we can maintain our virtue, our uprightness, our integrity; if we can be honest and upright and cultivate the spirit of kindness, harmony, and union among ourselves, God will take care of Israel, for He will fight our battles.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"89992\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 89992)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(89992)\">D&amp;C 105:14<\/a><\/span> And what else?
