Our young men and young women have many more distractions to sidetrack them in their preparations for both a mission and a future happy life. Technology has expanded, and almost everyone has access to handheld devices that can capture the attention of the human family of God for both great good and unconscionable ill.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">Tonight I speak to missionaries now serving, future missionaries, returned missionaries, and all young adult men in the Church. I pray you will understand and thoughtfully consider what I have to say to you as you journey through these exciting and exacting years of your life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">In the early days of the Church, missionaries were interviewed by a General Authority before they went on their missions. These days you are interviewed to serve as missionaries by your bishops and stake presidents, and most of you will go through your entire lives without being interviewed by a General Authority. That is simply a reflection of the reality in a worldwide church of more than 15 million members. I know I speak for my brethren when I tell you that we wish it were possible for us to know all of you personally and to be able to tell you that we love you and that we support you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">Fortunately the Lord has provided ways for us to reach out to you. For example, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve assigns every missionary to his or her mission. Although this is done without a traditional face-to-face interview, technology and revelation combine to provide an experience that is remarkably intimate and personal. Let me tell you how this happens.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">Your photograph comes up on a computer screen, together with key information provided by your bishop and stake president. When your picture appears, we look into your eyes and review your answers to the missionary recommendation questions. For that brief moment, it seems as if you are present and responding to us directly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">As we look at your photograph, we trust that you have cleared in every way the \u201craised bar\u201d required today to be a faithful, successful missionary. Then, by the power of the Spirit of the Lord and under the direction of President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson, we assign you to one of the Church\u2019s 406 worldwide missions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">No, it isn\u2019t the same as a personal, face-to-face interview. But it\u2019s close.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">Videoconferencing is another way that helps us reach out to Church leaders and members who live far away from Church headquarters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">With that in mind, I would like those of you preparing to serve missions, those who have returned, and all of you young adults to spend a few minutes with me as though we were having a personal video chat right now. Please look at me for a few minutes as though you and I were the only ones in the room, wherever you are tonight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">For my part, I will imagine that I am looking into your eyes and listening carefully to your responses to a few questions that I believe will tell me a lot about the depth of your testimony and your devotion to God. If I may paraphrase what I said to missionaries 13 years ago, what we need now is the greatest generation of young adults in the history of the Church. We need your whole heart and soul. We need vibrant, thinking, passionate young adults who know how to listen and respond to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit as you make your way through the daily trials and temptations of being a young, contemporary Latter-day Saint.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">In other words, it\u2019s time to raise the bar not only for missionaries but also for returned missionaries and for your entire generation.

I would hope that all of our young adults, whether or not you served full-time missions, understand the importance of visiting with people who are lonely, sick, or discouraged\u2014not only as an assignment but also because of the genuine love you have for Heavenly Father and His children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p34\" class=\"\" id=\"p34\">Those of you in high school preparing for missions, I encourage you to participate in and graduate from seminary. You young adults should enroll in an institute of religion.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-12455_000_027\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See First Presidency letter, Apr.\u00a021, 2011.]<\/span><\/sup> If you are attending a Church school, consistently include a class each semester in religious education. During this important season of preparation for a mission, eternal marriage, and life as an adult, you must continue to find ways to learn and grow and receive inspiration and guidance through the Holy Ghost. A careful, prayerful study of the gospel through seminary, institute, or religious education classes can assist you in that goal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p35\" class=\"\" id=\"p35\">Whether you attend a Church school or not, whether you attend college or not, do not think that you are too busy to study the gospel.

There are four outstanding new courses that I would encourage every young adult to look into and to attend.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-12455_000_027\">4<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See \u201cNew Religion Classes to Be Offered at Church Universities and Institutes of Religion,\u201d lds.org\/topics\/education\/new-religion-classes.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p36\" class=\"\" id=\"p36\">And don\u2019t forget that classes and activities offered at your local institute or through your young single adult ward or stake will also be a place where you can be with other young men and young women and lift and inspire one another as you learn and grow spiritually and socialize together.

Please stop delaying! I know some of you fear family formation. However, if you marry the right person at the right time and in the right place, you need not fear. In fact, many problems you encounter will be avoided if you are \u201canxiously engaged\u201d in righteous dating, courting, and marriage. Don\u2019t text her! Use your own voice to introduce yourself to the righteous daughters of God who are all around you. To actually hear a human voice will shock her\u2014perhaps into saying yes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p38\" class=\"\" id=\"p38\">Now, brethren, I testify to you that the Lord Jesus Christ can help us fix anything that needs fixing in our lives through His atoning sacrifice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p39\" class=\"\" id=\"p39\">This evening, as we prepare to celebrate Easter Sunday tomorrow, please pause with me to remember the gift of Christ\u2019s Atonement.
