There are times, however, under unusual circumstances, when, in order to help provide for even the basic needs of her family, a mother may be required to accept employment outside her home. As President Ezra Taft Benson has stated, \u201cMany of you often find yourselves in circumstances that are not always ideal \u2026 who, because of necessity, must work and leave your children with others.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign, <\/span>Nov. 1981, p. 105.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/her-children-arise-up-and-call-her-blessed.p11\" class=\"\">It is to those mothers we address these remarks today. We urge also that Relief Society leaders make certain that they include those mothers in Relief Society callings and that lessons and programs address their needs. We hope that husbands, home teachers, and visiting teachers will give them encouragement and positive reinforcement in the demanding role that is theirs, for we know that in spite of their added working role they still must provide the emotional support that children need. In addition to the obvious physical needs of children, there are other aspects of a child\u2019s life that should not be neglected even though a mother has employment outside the home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/her-children-arise-up-and-call-her-blessed.p12\" class=\"\">The challenges facing the working mother of small children are many. First, she must find someone to give good care to her child. Next, she has to decide what to do in an emergency situation when there is an accident or sickness. She must rely on the help of an understanding employer, a relative, a neighbor, a schoolteacher, or someone else to help in those times of crisis.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/her-children-arise-up-and-call-her-blessed.p13\" class=\"\">We find that most working mothers organize their time by advance planning, shopping, scheduling, and assigning chores to include each member of the household. They realize the importance of having meals that provide essential nutrients and the warmth of gracious family dining\u2014even though fast-food establishments appeal to and even cater to the working-outside-the-home mother as an easier alternative.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/her-children-arise-up-and-call-her-blessed.p14\" class=\"\">We are well aware, however, that the real challenges for many working mothers come in their responsibility for guiding children through periods of questioning and decision making and in their times of trouble. These challenges come in being able to sense the unexpressed needs of children and those of which young people, in their immaturity, may not themselves be aware. A mother may not always be on hand when her child\u2019s needs seem most acute. But we find that many working mothers take every opportunity to be with their children\u2014to work with them in accomplishing household duties; when it is appropriate, to shop, plan, and play together; and sometimes just to be in the same room so that they have the sense of being with someone who loves them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/her-children-arise-up-and-call-her-blessed.p15\" class=\"\">It might be a temptation for a working mother to plan special outings and play times as the so-called \u201cquality\u201d time she has with her children. But many are aware of the danger this poses in giving them a distorted picture of life by using all their time together in recreation. It is important for children to see the balance that is necessary between work and play. They need to know that special events are more meaningful when daily routines are established and when assigned duties are completed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/her-children-arise-up-and-call-her-blessed.p16\" class=\"\">One grandmother helped her grandchildren learn this truth. When they came to her house she was careful to have jobs they could do together; then afterward, they played a game. Then another task was followed by another game. The children learned, as she hoped they would, the relationship between work and play and the comfortable sense of playing after work is completed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/her-children-arise-up-and-call-her-blessed.p17\" class=\"\">Schoolwork, too, and practicing to develop musical or other talents can become part of the daily routine. A mother who strives to know success can help her children learn the <span class=\"emphasis\">price<\/span> of success by working with them, when necessary, to help them reach a degree of excellence. A mother can make the difference in a child\u2019s achievement. She can give support by monitoring the completion and accuracy of assignments. She can help a child reap the rewards of persistent effort.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/her-children-arise-up-and-call-her-blessed.p18\" class=\"\">Even though a working mother cannot be the full-time model she might be if she were home with her children, she can help them learn the personal discipline that comes with daily, routine responsibilities, and, afterward, the well-being resulting from praise for work well done.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/her-children-arise-up-and-call-her-blessed.p19\" class=\"\">A mother must consider the essential purposes of life.
