They commenced about ten years ago in the city of London, in England; they\n  have churches formed in various parts of England and Scotland, and some few in Upper Canada. Mr.\n  Irving, their founder, was a learned and talented minister of the Church of Scotland, he was a great\n  logician, and a powerful orator, but withal wild and enthusiastic in his views. Moving in the higher\n  circles, and possessing talent and zeal, placed him in a situation to become a conspicuous character,\n  and to raise up a society similar to that which is called after his name.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">The Irvingites have apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists,<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> and angels. They profess\n  to have the gift of tongues, and the interpretation of tongues, and, in some few instances, to have the\n  gift of healing.<span class=\"footRef\">7<\/span><\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">The first prophetic spirit that was manifested was in some Misses Campbell that Mr. Irving met\n  with, while on a journey in Scotland; they had [what is termed among their sect] &ldquo;utterances,&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">8<\/span>\n  which were evidently of a supernatural agency. Mr. Irving, falling into the common error of\n  considering all supernatural manifestations to be of God, took them to London with him, and\n  introduced them into his church.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">They were there honored as the prophetesses<span class=\"footRef\">9<\/span> of God, and when they spoke, Mr. Irving or any\n  of his ministers had to keep silence. They were peculiarly wrought upon before the congregation,\n  and had strange utterances, uttered with an unnatural, shrill voice, and with thrilling intonations they\n  frequently made use of a few broken, unconnected sentences,<\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"109588\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 109588)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(109588)\">1 Cor. 15:23-24<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">2. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"105965\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 105965)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(105965)\">Gen. 2:7<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">3. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110360\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110360)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110360)\">James 2:26<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">4. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108598\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108598)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108598)\">Luke 23:46<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">5. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"109872\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 109872)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(109872)\">Philip. 3:10<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112969\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112969)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112969)\">Moro. 7:41<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">6. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"109807\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 109807)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(109807)\">Eph. 4:11<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">7. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"109521\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 109521)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(109521)\">1 Cor. 12:9-10<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">8. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108919\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108919)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108919)\">Acts 2:4<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">9. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108439\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108439)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108439)\">Luke 2:36<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
