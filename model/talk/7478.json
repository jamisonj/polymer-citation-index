I hope I can help you, my young brothers and sisters, understand how powerful your individual actions can be in strengthening your home and family, no matter what your circumstances. I understand, for example, that many of you may be the only member of the Church in your family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/strengthen-home-and-family.p7\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">For the Strength of Youth<\/span> reminds us that \u201cbeing part of a family is a great blessing. \u2026 Not all families are the same, but each is important in Heavenly Father\u2019s plan\u201d ([pamphlet, 2001], 10).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/strengthen-home-and-family.p8\" class=\"\">All families need strengthening, from the ideal to the most troubled.

President Hinckley gave the young women \u201ca simple four-point program\u201d in the general Young Women meeting last spring that will not only \u201cassure your happiness\u201d but will bless your family as well. He counseled each of us to \u201c(1) pray, (2) study, (3) pay your tithing, and (4) attend your meetings\u201d (\u201cLet Virtue Garnish Thy Thoughts Unceasingly,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 2007, 115).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/strengthen-home-and-family.p11\" class=\"\">Seeking the help of the Lord daily through prayer will bring great blessings to your family.

He taught us the doctrine of eternal families from the scriptures. We read his experiences of how fasting and prayer helped his investigators prepare to receive the ordinance of baptism. He assured us that our family too could be blessed through fasting and prayer. Then came his challenge: \u201cThe bishop of the Stanford Ward spoke on a topic a couple of months ago which really hit home. \u2026 The bishop\u2019s talk made me stop and realize the goals I want to accomplish in life. Uppermost in my mind is the goal I want to achieve with my own family \u2026 that, of course, being sealed to you, Mom and Dad, for time and all eternity in the house of the Lord.

In the many months that followed, we established family patterns of righteousness. We prayed together, studied about the ordinances of the temple, paid tithing, and attended our meetings regularly\u2014as a family. Shortly after my brother returned from his mission, we were prepared to receive the ordinances of the temple. I knew the Lord had heard and answered our prayers as we surrounded the holy altar in the temple and were sealed as a family for time and all eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/strengthen-home-and-family.p29\" class=\"\">Can you make a difference in your family?
