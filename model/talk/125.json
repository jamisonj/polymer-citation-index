Merrill, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1944, pp. 149-153<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nBrethren, and radio listeners: And I am very glad to be able to say \"Radio listeners,\" for of all\nthe Conferences I have attended during my life&mdash;and they began when I was ten years of\nage&mdash;I have attended none that I have enjoyed to a greater degree than I have this one, up to\nthe present moment of time.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my wish, brethren and sisters, to speak for a few minutes on and call attention, to some\nof our fundamental principles and their application to our daily lives. In doing this I desire to\nspeak truthfully, wisely, and helpfully.\n<\/p><p>\nMAN INHERITS ATTRIBUTES OF GOD HIS FATHER\n<\/p><p>\n\"We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy\nGhost\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6606\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6606)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6606)\">A of F 1:1<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;three\nseparate, distinct persons, who are united as one in purpose and attunement.\nSince in the world of life, like besets like, it must follow that in bodily form we are like our\nFather in heaven. Hence, it cannot be true that we are brutes or descendants of beasts; we are\nof the race of the Gods. It therefore follows that man did not, as the atheist asserts, create\nGod in his own image. As a spirit child of our Father in heaven, man not only inherited His\ndivine form, but also the divine attributes, even though it may be in minute quantities only.\n<\/p><p>\nAmong these are intelligence, will-power, thinking-power, love, charity, mercy, patience,\nsense of justice, fairness, and right, etc. We believe in the wonderful doctrine of eternal\nprogression, in accordance with which these inherited attributes and powers may be enlarged\nthrough effort and righteous living, until ultimately they may reach, in the hereafter, God-like\nproportions.\n<\/p><p>\nIs such a doctrine true, or is it fanciful, based upon eternal truth? In accordance with this\nbelief, life in mortality has a purpose. We know the doctrine is true.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is fitting here to mention another divine gift to all born into mortality&mdash;that of free agency.\n<\/p><p>\nKnow this, that every soul is free<br \/>\nTo choose his life and what he'll be, <br \/>\nFor this eternal truth is given,<br \/>\nThat God will force no man to heaven.\n<\/p><p>\nHe'll call, persuade, direct aright,<br \/>\nAnd bless with wisdom, love and light, <br \/>\nIn nameless ways be good and kind, <br \/>\nBut never force the human mind.\n<\/p><p>\nFAITH A NECESSARY GUIDE\n<\/p><p>\nTo achieve fully the purpose of mortal life, man must pursue the way of life which the Lord\nHimself has given, but the Lord will force no man to do this. As a result but relatively few\nmortal men make earnest attempts to follow the Lord's way of life. Why? There are many\nreasons, one of which is the lack of sufficient faith in the existence of a living personal God,\nwho is really our Father in heaven, and functions as a loving, merciful, though just God.\n<\/p><p>\nWe, that is multitudes of Latter-day Saints, not only believe that God lives, but we testify that\nwe know He lives, and in doing so, we are in accord with Biblical teachings. We are\nreminded that on one occasion, Jesus, receiving various answers from His disciples to His\nquestions, turned to Peter and asked: \"Whom say ye that I am?\" The ready answer was: \"Thou\nart the Christ, the son of the living God.\" Then the Master replied: \"Blessed art thou, Simon\nBarjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in\nheaven\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33910\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33910)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33910)\">Matt. 16:15-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOn another occasion He said: \"My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any man will\ndo his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of\nmyself\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27132\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27132)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27132)\">John 7:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the apostle James, in harmony with the teachings of the Master, wrote: \"If any of you\nlack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it\nshall be given him.\" But there was a condition named\"&mdash;But let him ask in faith, nothing\nwavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For\nlet not that man think he shall receive any thing of the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26050\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26050)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26050)\">James 1:5-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSo this afternoon we have heard Brother Romney speak of the Book of Mormon, and of how\nwe may know, if we fulfill the conditions that the prophet Moroni names in the last chapter in\nthe book, of the genuineness of that book through the power of the Holy Ghost\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38228\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38228)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38228)\">Moro. 10:4-5<\/a><\/span>). It is through\nthe power of the Holy Ghost that we are able to testify that we do know. It is not a matter of\nbelief only, it is a matter of assurance that comes to us, enabling us to say as certainly as we\nlive that we do know.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, and radio listeners, I myself can testify likewise that I know. But how do I know?\n<\/p><p>\nA PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN ANSWER TO PRAYER\n<\/p><p>\nNow, may I say that I am too old, perhaps, to be too diffident to relate a little experience, and\nI believe that experiences are helpful. I shall here relate one.\n<\/p><p>\nFamily prayer has been spoken of during these sessions by more than one of the speakers. I\nwas reared in a family where prayer, night and morning was always the order. I have seen my\nfather sometimes too busy to stop to eat his breakfast, but never too busy to kneel with his\nfamily in prayer before he left, to thank the Lord for the prospects of the day, for the rest of\nthe night, and to ask his direction and help in the labors of the day. I was taught to pray at\nmy mother's knee, and when I could say my own little prayers, I was taught that it was my\nprayer; it should be said in secret, or at least to myself.\n<\/p><p>\nSo I knelt on one side of the bed, brother on the other side, every night. He never knew what\nI prayed for; certainly I did not know what he prayed for. But when I was about ten years of\nage, I began to pray for a special blessing. But I did not get an answer. Why? Father had\ntaught us that there are three factors that must characterize every prayer that the Lord will\nanswer: We must pray for real needs&mdash;and even grown-ups, he said, sometimes ask the Lord\nfor things they do not get, because they ask foolishly&mdash;we must pray worthily, and we must\npray with faith.\n<\/p><p>\nIn answer to my first prayer, no answer came. The faith was there, I felt, to the extent that I\ncould exert it. The need was there, I felt certainly no doubt about that, but was the\nworthiness? I could always think of something, as I prayed night after night without an\nanswer, that I had done that I should not have done, and so I continued to pray, feeling that\nwhen I could make myself worthy of an answer, I would get it.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was after I had been praying nightly for five years that the whole family went, one\nWednesday evening, in the month of February, into town and attended a Sunday School\nentertainment. My class rendered its number, followed by another that sang, and I remember\nsome of the words of that song: \"Keep on asking, God will answer by and by.\" To me that\nwas a revelation. I kept on praying.\n<\/p><p>\nSome four years later, in the latter part of the month of August, 1887, in my nineteenth year,\nafter I had been praying nightly for nine long years with all the earnestness of my soul for\nthis special blessing, I was alone in the bedroom, and I said, half aloud, \"O Father, wilt thou\nnot hear me?\" I was beginning to get discouraged.\n<\/p><p>\nThen, brethren, something happened. The most glorious experience that I have received, came.\nIn answer to my question I heard as distinctly as anything I ever heard in my life the short,\nsimple word: \"Yes.\" Simultaneously my whole being, from the crown of my head to the soles\nof my feet, was filled with the most joyous feeling of elation, of peace and certainty that I\ncould imagine a human being could experience. I sprang from my knees, and\njumped as high as I could, and shouted: \"O Father, I thank thee.\" At last an answer had come.\nI knew it.\n<\/p><p>\nWhy did it not come before? I have thanked the Lord many times since that He withheld the\nanswer. A few days after that, father said to me: \"Would you like to go to Salt Lake City\nand attend the University of Deseret?\"&mdash;a secret wish of which I had said nothing. I had\nfinished, the spring before, what is equivalent in this day to a junior high school course,\nnothing more in the town. I wanted to go on and now I could. And as it turned out, after\ngraduating at the University of Deseret, I went east and completed nine years of work in the\nfield of science in four of America's leading universities.\n<\/p><p>\nHad I gone without an answer to my prayers at that critical moment in my life I might have\nforgotten to pray. But I think that I am here today&mdash;I think that I have been preserved in the\nChurch, perhaps, because the answer to my prayer came at that critical moment, since which \ntime never has a day passed that I have forgotten to pray. And as long as memory lasts I\ncannot forget the thrilling experience of that night.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren and sisters, that answer to my prayer was a revelation. What did I want to\nknow? I had learned that Joseph Smith, a fourteen-year-old boy, went into the woods to pray.\nFulfilling the conditions necessary to get an answer, he had received the most glorious vision\nthat records give us any knowledge of. He knew that God lives; he saw Him; he heard him.\nHe knew that Christ, whose resurrection the Christian world celebrates today, also lives. He\nsaw the Christ, his Redeemer; he heard His voice\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30225\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30225)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30225)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17-20<\/a><\/span>).\nThere was certainty in his soul.\n<\/p><p>\nI wanted to know, too, of my own self whether God lives. I believed\n<\/p><p>\nHe would give me a testimony. I have had many testimonies since. Brethren, I do know.\n<\/p><p>\nRESPONSIBILITY FOLLOWS A TESTIMONY\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren, all of you who are here, doubtless could relate experiences similar to what I\nhave related. You know, all of you. You are the key men in the Church of God. You come\nfrom all over America, you are the leaders. Every one of you knows, and you can testify.\nThat is one characteristic of the membership of this Church&mdash;we know we know! And therein\nlies the strength of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nBut because we know, brethren, we are bound. There are obligations imposed by our certain\nknowledge that we cannot logically escape. Obligations to do what? Keep the Lord's\ncommandments is the answer. We have heard it said in this conference of the leadership in\nthe Church that the Lord's way of life, if followed by the people, will bring peace to the earth. Wars will\ncease, and contention will end; but when are we willing to follow the Lord's way of life?\nUntil we do, we shall not have peace; because the evil one is here, and he has under his\npower the great majority of our Father's children, and through the exercise of that power he is\nleading them away.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have heard about some of the delinquencies of youth; and we have also heard it stated\nhere, a correct statement, that youth is delinquent, boys and girls are delinquent, because\ngrown-ups are delinquent. Boys and girls see what their elders do, and naturally they follow\nin their footsteps. We have heard references, here, in this session, to the violation of the\nsanctity of the Sabbath day. What must we do in these modern times to keep holy the Sabbath\nday? The law of the Sabbath was given to ancient Israel, when conditions were vastly\ndifferent. What does it mean to keep holy the Sabbath day in our times? Well, we may not\nonly read the answer in the Doctrine and Covenants (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11988\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11988)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11988)\">D&amp;C 59:9-13<\/a><\/span>),\nbut a century later than this revelation we may also read a\nsigned statement by the presidency of this Church in the editorial columns of <i>The Deseret News<\/i>\nof a few years ago what it means to keep holy the Sabbath day in our times. We grant\nto the First Presidency the right and duty to interpret our doctrines and indicate what our\npractices should be in harmony with them. According to that declaration, we may not go to\nmovies, or any other kind of commercial entertainments on Sunday; we may not go hunting,\nwe may not go fishing, we may not do multitudes of things that even our people do. And why\ndo they do them? Let each individual ask himself that question.\n<\/p><p>\nHow can one who knows that God lives and can testify that he knows, think of getting his\ngun and hunting trappings and go out on the Sabbath day into the mountains to hunt deer, or\nout into the fields to shoot pheasants? How can he think of getting the fishing tackle ready\nand go out onto the streams and spend the day of the Lord in fishing and in pleasure?\n<\/p><p>\nWell, we do many things, brethren, violative of divine commandments. Why do we do them?\nIn the light of our testimony we cannot do them guiltlessly, can we? Are we not obligated by\nthose testimonies to live the Lord's way of life? What shall we do?\n<\/p><p>\nLove the Lord our God with all our might, mind, and strength. But can we do this really\nwithout striving to the extent of the will power that the Lord has given to us to keep His\ncommandments?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the second great commandment is like unto the first: we must love our neighbors as\nourselves (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33921\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33921)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33921)\">Matt. 22:37-39<\/a><\/span>);\nwhich, as we know, rightly interpreted means our fellow men. But if we are going\nto love our neighbors as ourselves, we must treat our neighbors as we would like to be\ntreated were the circumstances reversed. In other words, we must live the Golden Rule\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33891\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33891)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33891)\">Matt. 7:12<\/a><\/span>). And\nuntil men are willing to live the Golden Rule far more completely than they are living now,\nwe shall not have peace in our nation or in the world.\n<\/p><p>\nYet we talk of winning peace after we have won this global war. We won the first World\nWar, but we did not win the peace, it is said. We may win the second World War, but we\nwill win the peace only when we are willing at least measurably, to live the Lord's way of\nlife. The Lord help us that we may be able to do that, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
