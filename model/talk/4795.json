I\u2019ve concluded that words are inadequate and that in reality their real tribute will be found in the lives of people throughout the earth who have been touched by their influence, which influence will continue for generations to come. We love these men with a love that will not be diminished, even though our contact with some of them will not be as frequent as in the past. We acknowledge that they have pioneered many of the aspects of the Church in many parts of the world. And now they are pioneering a new course that some of the rest of us will soon follow. They go with our love, our prayers, our deep respect and admiration, and our eternal gratitude.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p4\" class=\"\">On the wall of the kitchen in our home hangs a clock. It\u2019s a windup clock. That is, it is necessary every seven or eight days to wind up the mechanism with a key. If this is not done at regular intervals, the clock eventually begins to lose time; its chimes become sluggish and off-tone. Finally it stops until it is rewound again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p5\" class=\"\">Sometimes when I am rewinding this clock, I think how good it would be if I could restore my physical powers to their youthful vigor in a manner as simple as this. I suppose increasing age sometimes brings these thoughts to all who move into the later years of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p6\" class=\"\">In some ways, and to some degree, I can effect a partial rejuvenation through exercise, rest, and proper nourishment. I realize, however, that my physical clock is gradually winding down. The mechanism becomes increasingly sluggish. The chimes are less vibrant and sometimes a little out-of-pitch. One day the clock will stop altogether, in spite of all my desire and effort to keep it going.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p7\" class=\"\">So it is with the physical clock in each one of us. It is part of the Lord\u2019s plan. Our time here is but one phase of an eternal existence. As our physical clock winds down, we have the assurance of new beginnings and even greater possibilities as other phases open to us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p8\" class=\"\">As I think of these sobering realities, there comes to mind another figurative clock that operates within me. It is my spiritual clock. It has some similarities to the physical one. It, too, needs regular winding to stay in time and keep its true tone. Unlike the physical clock, however, the spiritual one is not necessarily destined for dissolution. In fact, with proper attention and regular care it grows more vigorous\u2014more perfect in its operation, more clear and resonant in its tones. But this is not an automatic process. Just as with the clock that hangs on our kitchen wall, unless there is a regular winding up of the mechanism, a spiritual sluggishness develops, the spiritual tone becomes off-key, and, unless something is done to correct the winding-down process, the clock can stop.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p9\" class=\"\">In the world\u2019s environment today, spiritual clocks that do not receive regular attention can wind down very quickly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p10\" class=\"\">Just forty years ago, in the October conference of 1949, Elder Albert E. Bowen, a member of the Council of the Twelve, spoke these words:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cMen are mortal and beset by human frailties. They are enticed by the pressures of immediate \u2026 desire to depart from the high standards of the perfect law. When they are under the influence of an exalted occasion, they make high resolves. They firmly determine to avoid past mistakes and to do better. But gone out from under the spell of that influence and absorbed in the complicated pursuits of life, they find difficulty in holding fast to their noble purposes. \u2026 So it is essential that they come again, and frequently, under the influence which kindles anew the warmth of spirit in which good resolutions are begotten, that they may go out fortified to withstand the pressures of temptation which lure them into false ways. Happily, if they refresh themselves frequently enough under ennobling influences, the spirit of repentance will be at work with them, and they will make conquest of some temptations\u2014rise above them\u2014and advance thus far toward their final goal.\u201d (In Conference Report, Oct. 1949, p. 139.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p12\" class=\"\">All of us require the \u201cennobling influences\u201d about which Elder Bowen spoke to \u201cwind up\u201d our spiritual clocks. Just as exercise, proper nourishment, and rest are essential to our physical well-being, so are such things as regular prayer, scripture study, Sabbath worship, partaking of the sacrament, and service to others necessary for our spiritual vigor. Without these continuing influences in our lives, our spiritual clocks wind down.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Prayer<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p14\" class=\"\">Nephi said, \u201cIf ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cBut behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4362\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4362)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4362)\">2 Ne. 32:8\u20139<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p16\" class=\"\">Amulek understood the importance of prayer as a spiritually rejuvenating influence. \u201cHumble yourselves,\u201d he said to the Zoramites, \u201cand continue in prayer. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p17\" class=\"\">Ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9738\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9738)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9738)\">Alma 34:19, 26<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p18\" class=\"\">Amulek counseled the people to pray over their flocks, their households, and their fields.

His inspired counsel to the members of the Church, and to all people, has led many to draw close to the scriptures, particularly the Book of Mormon. The testimonies that can be borne to the value of scripture study are numerous. There is a special power in the scriptures. Scripture study, combined with daily, purposeful prayer, can provide much of the resolution that is necessary today to offset the influences so prevalent in the world that lead us into forbidden ways.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p22\" class=\"\">Alma likened the word of God to a seed. \u201cWe will compare the word unto a seed,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves\u2014It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9735\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9735)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9735)\">Alma 32:28<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/winding-up-our-spiritual-clocks.p23\" class=\"\">I can testify that Alma\u2019s analogy is a valid one.

When we concern ourselves more with others, there is less time to be concerned with ourselves.
