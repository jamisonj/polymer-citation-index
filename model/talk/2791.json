Preparations had been made and orders given for the camp to make ready to cross the Jordan and lay siege to Jericho. Joshua told the people that the Lord would do wonders by drying up the river when the feet of the priests leading the march and bearing the ark of the covenant would touch the water. Just as he had foretold, the waters of the Jordan were miraculously dammed up and they crossed over on dry land.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p4\" class=\"\">After the people of Israel had crossed the dry riverbed, the Lord commanded Joshua to select twelve men, one from each tribe, to carry on their shoulders twelve stones from the Jordan and lay them down in the place where they would encamp that night. Then he added, \u201cThat this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cThen ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30087\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30087)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30087)\">Josh. 4:6\u20137<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p6\" class=\"\">Fathers have been leaving memorials for their children, and children have been raising them to their fathers, since time began. Here on Temple Square we have consciously surrounded ourselves with such memorials\u2014the old Nauvoo bell, the Seagull Monument, statues of the Restoration, Thorvaldsen\u2019s <span class=\"emphasis\">Christus,<\/span> to name just a few. These serve to unite generation with generation, preserving in a long, unbroken chain the important events of our common heritage. The passage of time and the growth of our institutions often tend to separate us not only from each other but also from our common purposes. Down through history we have been commanded to construct memorials, or hold Passover feasts, or convene general conferences to preserve the power of our united faith and to remember the commandments of God in achieving our eternal, unchanging goals.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p7\" class=\"\">More than monuments and festivals are needed, however, for us to succeed in reinforcing our strength and preserving our unity. In much the same way as Joshua did years ago, the builders of the impressive Washington Monument gathered stones from each of the states of the union and encased them within the interior of that 555-foot obelisk, the tallest masonry building in the world, as a tribute not only to the first president and Father of Our Country, but also to our national unity. Yet, while that monument was in preparation, America entered into the bloodiest, most decisive internal conflict it has ever known. It was, as someone has suggested, a Civil War fought over a pronoun\u2014should the United States be referred to as \u201cthey\u201d or \u201cit\u201d? Memorials and flags and festivals notwithstanding, the \u201cunion\u201d was at stake, for as President Abraham Lincoln had earlier warned, using the Savior\u2019s own words, \u201cIf a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33271\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33271)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33271)\">Mark 3:24\u201325<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p9\" class=\"\">However great the need may be for unity within nations, there is even greater need for harmony and interdependence within the worldwide Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As this great conference draws near its close, may I read from what a modern-day prophet referred to as \u201cthe greatest prayer ever uttered in this world\u201d? It is recorded by John in impressive detail as he hears it fall from the lips of the Son of God at the close of the evening, after he and his apostles had dined together for the last time:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cFather, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cI have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cI pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cHoly Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAs thou has sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cThat they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.\u201d (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"28899\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28899)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28899)\">John 17:1, 6, 9, 11, 18, 20\u201322<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p18\" class=\"\">Within this Church there is a constant need for unity, for if we are not one, we are not his.

More must be done. It is unity that has thus far enabled the Church, its wards and stakes, branches and districts, and members, to construct temples and chapels, undertake welfare projects, seek after the dead, watch over the Church, and build faith. More must be done. These great purposes of the Lord could not have been achieved with dissension or jealousy or selfishness. Our ideas may not always be quite like those who preside in authority over us, but this is the Lord\u2019s church and he will bless each of us as we cast off pride, pray for strength, and contribute to the good of the whole.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/that-we-may-be-one.p23\" class=\"\">By the same token, I know of no stronger weapons in the hands of the adversary against any group of men or women in this church than the weapons of divisiveness, faultfinding, and antagonism.
