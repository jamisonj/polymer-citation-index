Many college-age youths came to work in that pristine, beautiful area.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/satans-bag-of-snipes.p5\" class=\"\">One such person was Jill, a young woman from San Francisco, California. Feeling that a young woman from a big city might be a little bit naive about her new environment, I and a few friends felt it our obligation to teach her about the ways of the real West. We decided to take her on a \u201csnipe hunt.\u201d For those of you who may not be familiar with a snipe hunt, it is a practical joke, as there is no such thing as a snipe, at least not in the western United States. The tools necessary for a snipe hunt are a stick and a cloth bag. The \u201chunter\u201d is told to go through the brush, beating the bushes with a stick while calling the snipe in a high-pitched, ridiculous voice. The nonexistent snipes are thus to be driven into the cloth bag.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/satans-bag-of-snipes.p6\" class=\"\">We gave Jill her cloth bag and a stick and an area to hunt across the hill. The plan was to return to our starting point in about 15 minutes, at which time we would supposedly count our snipes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/satans-bag-of-snipes.p7\" class=\"\">When she did not return at the appointed time, we gloated and took delight in the seriousness with which she took her hunt. After about 30 minutes, we felt it was time to rescue her, explain the joke, have a good laugh, and all go to dinner. However, it became apparent that she had taken her snipe hunt more seriously than we had expected\u2014she was not to be found in her assigned area. After searching rather extensively and still finding no evidence of her, we began moving into the woods, calling for her at the top of our voices, but to no avail.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/satans-bag-of-snipes.p8\" class=\"\">Hoping she might have gone back to her dormitory, we returned and asked some young women to search for her there, but this also was to no avail. It was now turning dark, and our concern heightened. We enlisted all the young men we could from the boys\u2019 dormitory, and with flashlights continued the search deep into the woods. Well into the darkness of night\u2014frightened, concerned, and hoarse from calling\u2014we decided it was now time to report our ridiculous deed to the park rangers. While we were standing in front of the dorms, trying to determine which brave soul would have the privilege of reporting her disappearance, Jill suddenly appeared\u2014not from her dormitory, but rather from that of a friend, with whom she had enjoyed dinner (which we incidentally missed) and a comfortable evening with her friends. Her first words to us as she approached said it all: \u201cHow do you fellows like hunting <span class=\"emphasis\">snipe hunters?<\/span>\u201d Well, so much for big city na\u00efvet\u00e9, and so much for the ways of the real West. The joke was on us, and I have never had a desire for any more snipe hunting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/satans-bag-of-snipes.p9\" class=\"\">But there is another \u201csnipe hunt\u201d going on all around us, and we may be the naive victims. It is not a practical joke, and it will not end with a good laugh and a little warm fellowship. Satan is the great deceiver, liar, and enemy to all that is good, including our happiness and our well-being. His great desire is to thwart our Heavenly Father\u2019s plan of happiness and make us \u201cmiserable like unto himself\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3249\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3249)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3249)\">2 Ne. 2:27<\/a><\/span>). Being the very author and perpetrator of deceit, he in effect would invite us to join him in his snipe hunt, to fill our bags with excitement, fun, popularity, and the so-called \u201cgood life.\u201d But his promises are as illusionary as the nonexistent snipe. What he really offers are lies, misery, spiritual degradation, and loss of self-worth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/satans-bag-of-snipes.p10\" class=\"\">Satan\u2019s sales pitch as he sends us off to fill our bags is \u201cEat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3283\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3283)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3283)\">2 Ne. 28:7<\/a><\/span>). His invitation may seem enticing and convincing. Nephi describes his sales techniques as pacifying, flattering, and lulling as he declares, \u201cAll is well\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3289\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3289)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3289)\">2 Ne. 28:21\u201322<\/a><\/span>). Among other things Satan would have us put in our bags is immorality in all its forms, including pornography, language, dress, and behavior. But such evil deeds bring emotional distress, loss of spirituality, loss of self-respect, and lost opportunity for a mission or temple marriage, and sometimes even unwanted pregnancy. Satan would enslave us by having us put drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and other addictive behaviors into our bags.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/satans-bag-of-snipes.p11\" class=\"\">Satan will tell us that these things are OK and that \u201ceverybody is doing it.\u201d He will tell us that they bring popularity and acceptance. Satan\u2019s lies can be very enticing, especially at that critical time in life when young people are craving acceptance and popularity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"preamble\">However, there are certain clues to guide us as to what to avoid putting in our bags.
