There are both seen and unseen forces that influence our choices. This point was brought home some five years ago in a way that almost cost me dearly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">We were traveling with family and friends in the south of Oman. We decided to relax on the beach along the coast of the Indian Ocean. Soon after our arrival, our 16-year-old daughter, Nellie, asked if she could swim out to what she thought was a sandbar. Noticing the choppy water, I told her that I would go first, thinking there might be dangerous currents.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">After swimming a short while, I called to my wife, asking if I was close to the sandbar. Her response was, \u201cYou have gone way past it.\u201d Unbeknownst to me I was trapped in a riptide<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10911_000_040\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Riptide: \u201ca tide that opposes another or other tides, causing a violent disturbance in the sea\u201d (Dictionary.com).]<\/span><\/sup> and was being pulled rapidly out to sea.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">I was unsure what to do. The only thing I could think of was to turn around and swim back toward shore. That was exactly the wrong thing to do. I felt helpless. Forces beyond my control were pulling me farther out to sea. What made matters worse was that my wife, trusting my decision, had followed me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">Brothers and sisters, I thought there was a high likelihood I would not survive and that I, because of my decision, would also cause my wife\u2019s death. After great effort and what I believe was divine intervention, our feet somehow touched the sandy bottom and we were able to walk safely back to our friends and daughter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">There are many currents in this earthly life\u2014some safe and others not. President Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball taught that there are powerful forces in our own lives much like the unseen currents of the ocean.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-10911_000_040\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball, \u201cOcean Currents and Family Influences,\u201d<span class=\"emphasis\"> Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1974, 110\u201313.]<\/span><\/sup> These forces are real. We should never ignore them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">Let me tell you about another current, a divine current, that has become a great blessing in my life. I am a convert to the Church. Prior to my conversion, my life\u2019s ambition was to ski and, accordingly, I moved to Europe after high school to fulfill that desire. After several months of what seemed an ideal life, I felt I should leave. At the time I did not understand the source of that feeling, but I chose to follow it. I ended up in Provo, Utah, with a few good friends who, like me, were members of a different faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">While in Provo I met people who were living a much different life than I was. I felt drawn to them, though I did not know why. Initially, I resisted these feelings, but I soon found a peace and comfort that I had never known. I began to embrace a different current\u2014one that brought me to an understanding of a loving Heavenly Father and to His Son, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">I was baptized with my friends in 1972. This new current I chose to follow, the gospel of Jesus Christ, provided direction and meaning to my life. However, it was not without its challenges. Everything was new to me. At times I felt lost and confused. Questions and challenges were posed by both friends and family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">I had a choice to make. Some of their questions created doubt and uncertainty. The choice was an important one. Where would I turn for answers? There were many who wanted to convince me of the error of my ways\u2014\u201criptides\u201d determined to pull me away from the peaceful current that had become a wonderful source of happiness. I learned very clearly the principle that there is \u201copposition in all things\u201d and the importance of acting for myself and not forsaking my agency to others.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-10911_000_040\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130416\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130416)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130416)\">2\u00a0Nephi 2:11, 16<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">I asked myself, \u201cWhy would I turn away from that which had brought me such great comfort?\u201d As the Lord reminded Oliver Cowdery, \u201cDid I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter?\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-10911_000_040\">4<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130417\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130417)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130417)\">Doctrine and Covenants 6:23<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> My experience had been similar.

How would I address the uncertainty they created? Rather than allow them to destroy the peace and happiness that had come into my life, I chose to set them aside for a season, trusting that in the Lord\u2019s time, He would reveal all things. I found solace in His statement to the Prophet Joseph: \u201cBehold, ye are little children and ye cannot bear all things now; ye must grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-10911_000_040\">5<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130418\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130418)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130418)\">Doctrine and Covenants 50:40<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> I chose not to forsake what I knew to be true by following an unknown and a questionable current\u2014a potential \u201criptide.\u201d As President N.\u00a0Eldon Tanner taught, I learned \u201chow much wiser and better it is for man to accept the simple truths of the gospel \u2026 and to accept by faith those things which he \u2026 cannot understand.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-10911_000_040\">6<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[N.\u00a0Eldon Tanner, in Conference Report, Oct. 1968, 49.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">Does this mean there is no room for honest inquiry?

Recently, a young man visited my home. He had a good spirit about him, but I sensed he was not fully participating in Church activity. He told me that he had been raised in a gospel-centered home until his father was unfaithful to his mother, resulting in their divorce and influencing all his siblings to question the Church and to fall away. My heart was heavy as I spoke with this young father who now, affected by his father\u2019s choices, was raising these precious spirits outside the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">Another man I know, a onetime faithful Church member, had questions regarding certain doctrine. Rather than ask Heavenly Father for answers, he chose to rely solely on secular sources for guidance. His heart turned in the wrong direction as he sought what seemed to be the honors of men. His pride may have been gratified, at least temporarily, but he was cut off from the powers of heaven.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote11-10911_000_040\">11<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130423\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130423)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130423)\">Doctrine and Covenants 121:35\u201337<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Rather than find truth, he lost his testimony and brought with him many family members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">These two men became trapped in unseen riptides and brought many with them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p22\" class=\"\" id=\"p22\">Conversely, I think of LaRue and Louise Miller, my wife\u2019s parents, who despite never having much by way of worldly possessions, chose to teach the pure doctrine of the restored gospel to their children and to live it every day of their lives. By so doing they have blessed their posterity with the fruits of the gospel and the hope of eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/trifle-not-with-sacred-things.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">In their home they established a pattern where the priesthood was respected, where love and harmony were abundant, and where the principles of the gospel directed their lives. Louise and LaRue, side by side, demonstrated what it meant to live lives patterned after Jesus Christ. Their children could clearly see which of life\u2019s currents would bring peace and happiness. And they chose accordingly.
