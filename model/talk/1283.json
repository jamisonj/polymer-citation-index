To him,\nhowever, is given a special endowment not bestowed upon any other living thing. When the\nCreator \"breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul,\" God gave\nhim the <i>power of choice<\/i>\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23688\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23688)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23688)\">Gen. 2:7<\/a><\/span>).\nOnly to the human being did the Creator say: \". . . thou\nmayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39176\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39176)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39176)\">Moses 3:17<\/a><\/span>). As God intended man\nto become as he, it was necessary that He should first make him free. Thus man was endowed\nwith the greatest blessing that can be given to mortal beings&mdash;<i>the gift of free agency.<\/i>\nWithout this divine power to choose, humanity cannot progress.\n<\/p><p>\nCommenting upon this special endowment, a leading scientist, Dr. Lecomte du Nouy in\n<i>Human Destiny<\/i> said: \"By giving man liberty and conscience, God abdicated a part of His\nomnipotence in favor of His creature and this represents the spark of God in man ('God is\nwithin you').

It is not our formidable battlements, or bristling\nseacoasts, or in our Navy. Our defense is in the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of\nall men in all lands everywhere. <i>Destroy this spirit, and we have planted the seeds of<\/i>\n<i>despotism at our own doors<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe opposite of freedom is bondage, servility, restraint, conditions that inhibit mentality, stifle\nthe spirit, and crush manhood. <i>To coerce, to compel to bring the individual into servitude is<\/i>\n<i>the communist plan for the human family.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nAside from resisting such oppression from without, each individual carries within himself the\nresponsibility of living nobly or ignobly. Daily every normal person is faced with the choice\nof submission to what Paul designated the \"works of the flesh\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23265\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23265)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23265)\">Gal. 5:19<\/a><\/span>), or of reaching\nupward for the fruits of the Spirit, which are \"love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,\ngoodness, faith, meekness, temperance\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23266\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23266)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23266)\">Gal. 5:22-23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nConditions in the world today seem to indicate that too many human beings are living not\nvery far above the animal plane. <i>Cunning, deception, thieving, lying, cruelty, brutality<\/i>\n<i>warring conflicts are still all too common even among Christian nations.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nCharles Wagner in <i>The Simple Life<\/i> gives this impressive warning against indulgence in\nanimal desires:\n<\/p><p>\n\"He who lives to eat, drink, sleep, dress, take his walk&mdash;in short, pamper himself all that he\ncan&mdash;be it the courtier basking in the sun, the drunken laborer, the commoner serving his\nbelly, the woman absorbed in her toilettes, the profligate of low estate or high, or simply the\nordinary pleasure-lover, a 'good fellow,' but too obedient to material needs&mdash;<i>that man or<\/i>\n<i>woman is on the downward way of desire, and the descent is fatal<\/i>. Those who follow it obey\nthe same laws as a body on an inclined plane. Dupes of an illusion forever repeated, they\nthink: 'Just a few steps more, the last, toward the thing down there that we covet; then we\nwill halt.' But the velocity they gain sweeps them on, and the further they go the less able\nthey are to resist it.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Here is the secret of the unrest, the madness, of many of our contemporaries. Having\ncondemned their will to the service of their appetites, they suffer the penalty. They are\ndelivered up to violent passions which devour their flesh, crush their bones, suck their blood,\nand cannot be sated. This is not a lofty moral denunciation. I have been listening to what life\nsays, and have recorded, as I heard them, some of the truths that resound in every square.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>\"Has drunkenness, inventive as it is of new drinks, found the means of quenching thirst? Not<\/i>\n<i>at all. It might rather be called the art of making thirst inextinguishable. Frank libertinage,<\/i>\n<i>does it deaden the sting of the senses? No; it envenoms it, converts natural desire into a<\/i>\n<i>morbid obsession and makes it the dominant passion. Let your needs rule you, pamper<\/i>\n<i>them<\/i>&mdash;<i>you will see them multiply like insects in the sun. The more you give them, the more they<\/i>\n<i>demand<\/i>. He is senseless who seeks for happiness in material prosperity alone . . . Our needs,\nin place of the servants that they should be, become a turbulent and seditious crowd, a legion\nof tyrants in miniature. A man enslaved to his needs may best be compared to a bear with a\nring in its nose that is led about and made to dance at will. The likeness is not flattering, but\nyou will grant that it is true.\n<\/p><p>\n\"<i>It is only by direct action on youth that a better society can be successfully moulded. All<\/i>\n<i>pseudo-mysticisms<\/i>&mdash;<i>social, philosophical or political<\/i>&mdash;<i>must be replaced by the Christian<\/i>\n<i>ideal, the only one based on liberty and the respect of human dignity. When people have<\/i>\n<i>received the same education, when they obey the same moral rules and think universally, they<\/i>\n<i>do not easily accept the idea of fighting each other and are very near an understanding.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\n\"Today the nations constituted by individuals but possessing their own independent life want\nto exist and concentrate all their efforts toward this goal, sometimes sincerely in the interest\nof their members, sometimes solely in the interest of their leaders or of what the latter believe\nis an ideal superior to that of the individual. Governments, evidently, have\nthe duty to protect their countries against enemies, for in so doing they protect the individual\nwhich they are supposed to represent. But they also have the duty to prepare the future by\nspreading the light and by attacking the <i>roots of the evil<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe sing:\n<\/p><p>\n\"In sylvan depth and shade,<br \/>\n    In forest and in glade,<br \/>\n    Where'er we pass,<br \/>\n    The hand of God we see<br \/>\n    In leaf and bud and tree<br \/>\n    Or bird or humming bee<br \/>\n    Or blade of grass.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;              &mdash;Emmeline B.

To be alive only to appetite, pleasure, pride,<\/i>\n<i>money-making, and not to goodness and kindness, purity and love, poetry, music, flowers,<\/i>\n<i>stars, God and eternal hopes, is to deprive one's self of the real joy of living.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nIn man's life, this physical stage, man finds activity in two phases: <i>first<\/i> in the struggle for\nlivelihood and comforts; and, <i>second<\/i> in the tendency to grovel. The first is natural and most\ncommendable. The second is debasing, and when unrestrained leads one to the level of\nanimals. When a man harbors the thought that he will obtain a livelihood by injuring his\nneighbor, that moment he begins to circumscribe his life; bitterness replaces happiness;\nsordidness supplants generosity; hatred takes the place of love, and beastliness takes the place\nof humanity.\n<\/p><p>\nGenerally there is in man a divinity which strives to push him onward and upward. We\nbelieve that this power within him is the spirit that comes from God. Man lived before he\ncame to this earth, and he is here now to strive to perfect the spirit within. At sometime in his\nlife, every man is conscious of a desire to come in touch with the Infinite. His spirit reaches\nout for God. This sense of feeling is universal, and all men ought to be, in deepest truth,\nengaged in the same great work&mdash;the search for and the development of spiritual peace and\nfreedom.\n<\/p><p>\nEach one of us is the architect of his own fate, and he is unfortunate indeed who will try to\nbuild himself without the inspiration of God; without realizing that he grows from <i>within<\/i>, not\nfrom without.\n<\/p><p>\nTrees that can stand in the midst of the hurricane often yield to the destroying pests that we\ncan scarcely see with a microscope. Likewise the greatest foes of humanity today are the\nsubtle and sometimes unseen influences at work in society that are undermining the manhood\nand womanhood of today. The test, after all, of the faithfulness and effectiveness of God's\npeople is an individual one. What is the individual doing?\n<\/p><p>\nEvery temptation that comes to you and me comes in one of three forms:\n<\/p><p>\n(1) A temptation of the appetite or passion;<br \/>\n(2) A yielding to pride, fashion, or vanity;<br \/>\n(3) A desire for worldly riches or power and dominion over lands or earthly possessions of\nmen.\n<\/p><p>\nSuch temptations come to us in our social gatherings; they come to us in our political\nstrivings; they come to us in our business relations, on the farm, in the mercantile\nestablishment; in our dealings in all the affairs of life we find these insidious influences\nworking. It is when they manifest themselves to the consciousness of each individual that the\ndefense of truth should exert itself.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church teaches that life here is probationary. It is man's duty to become the <i>master<\/i>, not\nthe <i>slave<\/i> of nature. His appetites are to be controlled and used for the benefit of his health\nand the prolongation of his life&mdash;his passions mastered and controlled for the happiness and\nblessing of others.\n<\/p><p>\nMan's greatest happiness comes from losing himself for the good of others. The advancement\nof science and the new discoveries from the dawn of history to the present are the results of\nthe efforts of men who have been willing to sacrifice themselves if necessary for the cause of\ntruth.\n<\/p><p>\n\"What pains and tears the slightest step forward of man's progress have cost! Every\nhair-breadth forward has been in the agony of some soul, and humanity has attained blessing\nafter blessing of all its vast achievement of good with bleeding feet.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe must not lose sight of the fact, however, that these great leaders of the world were more\nthan compensated by the supreme joy that comes from achievement.\n<\/p><p>\nToday there are those who have met disaster which almost seems defeat, who have become\nsomewhat soured in their natures; but if they stop to think, even the adversity which has come\nto them may prove a means of spiritual uplift. Adversity itself may <i>lead toward<\/i> and <i>not away<\/i>\nfrom God and spiritual enlightenment; and privation may prove a source of strength if we can\nbut keep the sweetness of mind and spirit. \"Sweet are the uses of adversity,\" said\nShakespeare, \"which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, wears yet a precious jewel in his\nhead.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIf you have lived true to the promptings of the Holy Spirit, and continue to do so, happiness\nwill fill your soul. If you vary from it and become conscious that you have fallen short of\nwhat you know is right, you are going to be unhappy even though you have the wealth of the\nworld.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now a word to the young:\n<\/p><p>\nIn their yearning for a good time, young people are often tempted to indulge in the things\nwhich appeal only to the baser side of humanity, five of the most common of which are: <i>first<\/i>,\nvulgarity and obscenity; <i>second<\/i>, drinking and petting; <i>third<\/i>, unchastity; <i>fourth<\/i>, disloyalty; and,\n<i>fifth<\/i>, irreverence.\n<\/p><p>\nVulgarity is often the first step down the road to indulgence. To be vulgar is to give offense\nto good taste or refined feelings.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is only a step from vulgarity to obscenity. It is right, indeed essential, to the happiness of\nour young people that they meet in social parties, but it is an indication of low morals when\nfor entertainment they must resort to physical stimulation and debasement. Drinking and\npetting parties form an environment in which the moral sense becomes dulled, and\nunbridled-passion holds sway. It then becomes easy to take the final step downward in moral\ndisgrace.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen, instead of high moral principles, a life of immoral indulgence is chosen, and man or\nwoman gets far down in the scale of degeneracy, disloyalty is an inevitable part of his or her\nnature. Loyalty to parents becomes quenched; obedience to their teachings and ideals\nabandoned; loyalty to wife and children smothered in base gratification; loyalty to Church\nimpossible, and often supplanted by sneers at its teachings.\n<\/p><p>\nSpirituality is the consciousness of victory over self and of communion with the Infinite.\nSpirituality impels one to conquer difficulties and acquire more and more strength. To feel\none's faculties unfolding and truth expanding the soul is one of life's sublimest experiences.\nBeing true to self and being loyal to high ideals develops spirituality. The real test of any\nreligion is the kind of man it makes. Being \"honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in\ndoing good to all men\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6792\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6792)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6792)\">A of F 1:13<\/a><\/span>)\nare virtues which contribute to the highest acquisition\nof the soul. It is the \"divine in man, the supreme, crowning gift that makes him king of all\ncreated things, the one final quality that makes him tower above all other animals.\"\n<\/p><p>\nLet us ever keep in mind that life is largely what we make it, and that the Savior of men has\nmarked clearly and plainly just how joy and peace may be obtained. It is in the gospel of\nJesus Christ and adherence thereto. Do your duty no matter how humble and resolve even in\nthe face of difficulties and discouragements to be:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Like the man who faces what he must<br \/>\n    With step triumphant and a heart of cheer;<br \/>\n    Who fights the daily battle without fear;<br \/>\n    Sees his hopes fail, yet keeps unfaltering trust<br \/>\n    That God is God.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYears ago I learned that&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\n\"The world wants men&mdash;true men<br \/>\n    Who cannot be bought or sold;<br \/>\n    Men who will scorn to violate truth&mdash;genuine gold.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThat is the kind of men who stand at the head of our stakes, wards, quorums, and\norganizations.
