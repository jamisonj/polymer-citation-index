Suddenly I realized that fifty-two years had come\u2014then gone\u2014since the signing of the Armistice of 1918 and the termination of the Great War. I tried to imagine what the River Somme looked like fifty-two years before. How many thousands of soldiers had crossed this same bridge? Some came back. For others, the Somme was truly a river of no return. For the battlefields of Vimy Ridge, Armentieres, and Nueve Chappelle took a hideous toll of human life.

During the Meuse-Argonne offensive, a major led this battalion through a gap in the enemy lines, but the troops on the flanks were unable to advance. An entire battalion was surrounded. Food and water were short; casualties could not be evacuated. Hurled back were repeated attacks. Ignored were notes from the enemy requesting the battalion to surrender. Newspapers heralded the battalion\u2019s tenacity. Men of vision pondered its fate. After a brief but desperate period of total isolation, other units of the 77th Division advanced and relieved the \u201clost battalion.\u201d Correspondents noted in their dispatches that the relieving forces seemed bent on a crusade of love to rescue their comrades in arms. Men volunteered more readily, fought more gallantly, and died more bravely. A fitting tribute echoed from that ageless sermon preached on the Mount of Olives: \u201cGreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28646\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28646)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28646)\">John 15:13<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/lost-battalions.p16\" class=\"\">Forgotten is the plight of the \u201clost battalion.\u201d Unremembered is the terrible price paid for its rescue.

He and his companions lived in a neighborhood in which resided many elderly widows of limited means. All the year long, the boys had saved and planned for a glorious Christmas party. They were thinking of themselves, until the Christmas spirit prompted them to think of others. Frank, as their leader, suggested to his companions that the funds they had accumulated so carefully be used not for the planned party, but rather for the benefit of three elderly widows who resided together. The boys made their plans. As their bishop, I needed but to follow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/lost-battalions.p23\" class=\"\">With the enthusiasm of a new adventure, the boys purchased a giant roasting chicken, the potatoes, the vegetables, the cranberries, and all that comprises the traditional Christmas feast. To the widows\u2019 home they went carrying their gifts of treasure. Through the snow and up the path to the tumbledown porch they came. A knock at the door, the sound of slow footsteps, and then they met.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/lost-battalions.p24\" class=\"\">In the unmelodic voices characteristic of thirteen-year-olds, the boys sang \u201cSilent night, holy night; all is calm, all is bright.\u201d They then presented their gifts.
