Today, more so than in the past, I am asked about the signs of the times and if I think the end of the world is near.

As members of the Church, we must not forget the Savior\u2019s admonition, \u201cBe not troubled: for all these things must come to pass.\u201d These are difficult times, when the forces of nature seem to be unleashing a flood of \u201cfamines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p9\" class=\"\">Recently I read a newspaper article that cited statistics from the U.S. Geological Survey indicating that earthquakes around the world are increasing in frequency and intensity. According to the article, only two major earthquakes (earthquakes measuring at least six on the Richter scale) occurred during the 1920s. In the 1930s the number increased to five, and then it decreased to four during the 1940s. But in the 1950s, nine major earthquakes occurred, followed by fifteen during the 1960s, forty-six during the 1970s, and fifty-two during the 1980s. Already almost as many major earthquakes have occurred during the 1990s as during the entire decade of the 1980s.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p10\" class=\"\">The world is experiencing violent disorders, both physical, as well as social. Here in the United States, we are still reeling from two incredibly destructive hurricanes. People in the Philippines see no end to the devastation of the volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Famine grips portions of Africa, where tragic human suffering is prevalent. To a lesser degree, hunger afflicts millions, even in countries that have a high standard of living.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p11\" class=\"\">Political unrest, warfare, and economic chaos prevail in many parts of the world, and the plagues of pornography, drug misuse, immorality, AIDS, and child abuse become more oppressive with each passing day. The media busily satisfies an apparently insatiable appetite of audiences to witness murder, violence, nudity, sex, and profanity. Is not this the day of which Moroni spoke when he recorded: \u201cBehold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38101\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38101)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38101)\">Morm. 8:35<\/a><\/span>.) And then he prophesied of conditions of the world as they are today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p12\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, whether or not these are indeed the last days or even \u201cthe beginning of sorrows\u201d as the Savior foretold, some of us may find our lives laden with frustration, disappointment, and sorrow. Many feel helpless to deal with the chaos that seems to prevail in the world. Others anguish over family members who are being carried downstream in a swift, raging current of weakening values and declining moral standards. Children particularly are suffering as society drifts further and further away from the commandments of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p13\" class=\"\">Many have even resigned themselves to accept the wickedness and cruelty of the world as being irreparable. They have given up hope. They have decided to quit trying to make the world a better place in which they and their families can live. They have surrendered to despair.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p14\" class=\"\">Admittedly we have ample reason to be deeply concerned because we see no immediate answers to the seemingly unsolvable problems confronting the human family. But regardless of this dark picture, which will ultimately get worse, we must never allow ourselves to give up hope! Moroni, having seen our day, counseled, \u201cWherefore, there must be faith; and if there must be faith there must also be hope.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38646\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38646)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38646)\">Moro. 10:20<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p15\" class=\"\">To all who have harbored feelings of despair and an absence of hope, I offer the words of the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cFear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cLook unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19571\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19571)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19571)\">D&amp;C 6:34, 36<\/a><\/span>), \u201ceven so am I in the midst of you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19570\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19570)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19570)\">D&amp;C 6:32<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p18\" class=\"\">My message to you today, my brothers and sisters, is simply this: the Lord is in control. He knows the end from the beginning. He has given us adequate instruction that, if followed, will see us safely through any crisis. His purposes will be fulfilled, and someday we will understand the eternal reasons for all of these events. Therefore, today we must be careful to not overreact, nor should we be caught up in extreme preparations; but what we must do is keep the commandments of God and never lose hope!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p19\" class=\"\">But where do we find hope in the midst of such turmoil and catastrophe? Quite simply, our one hope for spiritual safety during these turbulent times is to turn our minds and our hearts to Jesus Christ. The prophet Mormon taught: \u201cYe shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, if a man have faith he must needs have hope; for without faith there cannot be any hope.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38630\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38630)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38630)\">Moro. 7:41\u201342<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p21\" class=\"\">Faith in God and in His Son, Jesus Christ, is absolutely essential for us to maintain a balanced perspective through times of trial and difficulty.

Righteousness has never precluded adversity. But faith in the Lord Jesus Christ\u2014<span class=\"emphasis\">real<\/span> faith, whole-souled and unshakable\u2014is a power to be reckoned with in the universe. It can be a causative force through which miracles are wrought. Or it can be a source of inner strength through which we find peace, comfort, and the courage to cope.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p24\" class=\"\">As we put our faith and trust to work, hope is born.

Regardless of how desperate things may seem or how desperate they may yet become, please believe me, you can always have hope. Always.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p27\" class=\"\">Recently I had the privilege of performing the temple sealing ordinances for a wonderful family. It was a beautiful occasion, as such ceremonies almost always are. But if you had known the father of this family several years earlier, you would have understood what a miracle was taking place in the House of the Lord that day. With his permission I quote from a letter he wrote to me:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cI was born into the Church and was taught the gospel at my mother\u2019s knee. Through her diligence and perseverance, she kindled a small ember of testimony that never left me even through some of the roughest times of my life. In my teen years Satan hit me hard. It was during the late 1960s and early 1970s, a time of great turmoil, and Satan was hard at work on me. I was taken with the practice of free drugs, free love, free fun, and the rest of the world be damned. Beginning with my first drink of alcohol, I began to slowly deteriorate. After alcohol, other drugs were that much easier to use. In order to take drugs, you must become a good liar. You learn to do whatever it takes to conceal your behavior from others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cAfter many years of living this way, all my moral fiber seemed to be completely eroded away. I had a minimal amount of conscience and had sunk to the depths of despair and depression. I watched friends die from drugs and suicide. As time passed, my friends and I were exposed to the criminal justice system. In fact, many of my former friends are still in prison. Had it not been for the small flicker of testimony instilled in me by my mother when I was a child, to know that Heavenly Father could still love me, I have reservations as to whether I would even be writing this letter today.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p30\" class=\"\">Some parents might have given up hope on this prodigal son, but not this man\u2019s mother. She continued to believe that he would find his way back to the teachings of his childhood and once again place his trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. With the loving support of his family and friends, that is exactly what he did. Let me read again from his letter:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cIf there is one thing I have learned, it is that no matter how lost you feel, no matter how low you may have sunk, there can be forgiveness and peace. I learned that the further one drifts from the Lord, the harder it is to return to Him and His teachings. But once I opened my heart and called out in prayer to Heavenly Father to help me in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, I came to know the power of repentance and the blessings of obedience to God\u2019s commandments.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p32\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, I wish all of you could have been with us in the temple that day to feel the joy of hope fulfilled.

They are faith, hope, and charity. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"865\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 865)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(865)\">1 Cor. 13:13<\/a><\/span>.) Together they give us a base of support like the legs of a three-legged stool. Each principle is significant within itself, but each also plays an important supporting role. Each is incomplete without the others. Hope helps faith develop. Likewise true faith gives birth to hope. When we begin to lose hope, we are faltering also in our measure of faith. The principles of faith and hope working together must be accompanied by charity, which is the greatest of all. According to Mormon, \u201ccharity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38638\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38638)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38638)\">Moro. 7:47<\/a><\/span>.)

Real faith fosters hope for the future; it allows us to look beyond ourselves and our present cares. Fortified by hope, we are moved to demonstrate the pure love of Christ through daily acts of obedience and Christian service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p35\" class=\"\">I assure you, my brothers and sisters, that our Heavenly Father is aware of us, individually and collectively.
