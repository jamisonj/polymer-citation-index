It is a freshwater inland lake a little over twelve miles long and seven miles wide. The River Jordan flows through it, from north to south, on its journey toward the Dead Sea.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p4\" class=\"\">This was the lake Jesus knew as a child and as a young man, its western shores lying just twelve or fifteen miles from his boyhood home of Nazareth. It was to this lake and the neighboring Galilean hills that Jesus returned so often during those demanding years of his public ministry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p5\" class=\"\">On one journey to Galilee, the Savior taught the multitudes crowded near the water\u2019s edge. With the people pressing ever closer, Jesus sought a better teaching circumstance by stepping into a boat and pushing out a few yards into the sea. There, a short distance from the eager crowd, he could be seen and heard by those straining for sight and words of the Master.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p6\" class=\"\">Following his discourse, the Savior invited his disciples to join him, and they set out together for the other side of the lake. The Sea of Galilee is quite low, about 680 feet below sea level, and the heat becomes quite great. The hills surrounding the water rise up very sharply and to considerable height. The cold air rushing down from the hills meets the warm air rising from the lake in such a way that sudden and temporarily violent storms can occur on the surface of that inland sea. It was just such a storm as this that Jesus and his disciples found as they crossed the lake at evening time. This is the way Mark described it:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33338\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33338)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33338)\">Mark 4:36\u201341<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p13\" class=\"\">All of us have seen some sudden storms in our lives. A few of them, though temporary like these on the Sea of Galilee, can be violent and frightening and potentially destructive. As individuals, as families, as communities, as nations, even as a church, we have had sudden squalls arise which have made us ask one way or another, \u201cMaster, carest thou not that we perish?\u201d And one way or another we always hear in the stillness after the storm, \u201cWhy are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p14\" class=\"\">None of us would like to think we have <span class=\"emphasis\">no<\/span> faith, but I suppose the Lord\u2019s gentle rebuke here is largely deserved. This great Jehovah, in whom we say we trust and whose name we have taken upon us, is he who said, \u201cLet there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23970\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23970)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23970)\">Gen. 1:6<\/a><\/span>.)

Furthermore, it was he who parted the Red Sea, allowing the Israelites to pass through on dry ground.

Certainly it should be no surprise that he could command a few elements acting up on the Sea of Galilee. And our faith should remind us that he can calm the troubled waters of our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p15\" class=\"\">Let me recall for you the story of Mary Ann Baker. Her beloved and only brother suffered from the same respiratory disease that had taken their parents\u2019 lives, and he left their home in Chicago to find a warmer climate in the southern part of the United States.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p16\" class=\"\">For a time he seemed to be improving, but then a sudden turn in his health came and he died almost immediately. Mary Ann and her sister were heartbroken. It only added to their deep grief that neither their own health nor their personal finances allowed them to claim their brother\u2019s body or to finance its return to Chicago for burial.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p17\" class=\"\">The Baker family had been raised as faithful Christians, but Mary\u2019s trust in a loving God broke under the strain of her brother\u2019s death and her own diminished circumstances. \u201cGod does not care for me or mine,\u201d said Mary Ann. \u201cThis particular manifestation of what they call \u2018divine providence\u2019 is unworthy of a God of love.\u201d Does that sound at all familiar?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cI have always tried to believe on Christ and give the Master a consecrated life,\u201d she said, \u201cbut this is more than I can bear.
