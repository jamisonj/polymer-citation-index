Thabiso and his bishop, who presides and holds the keys for the quorum, had been praying for quorum members who were less active, seeking inspiration about whom to visit and how to help them. They felt prompted to visit the home of Tebello, and they invited me to go with them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p6\" class=\"\">Once we made it past the ferocious guard dog, we found ourselves in the living room with Tebello, a calm-spirited young man who had stopped attending church because he had become busy doing other things on Sundays. He was nervous but happy to receive us and even invited his family to join him. The bishop expressed his love for the family and his desire to help them become an eternal family by being sealed in the temple. Their hearts were moved, and we could all feel the strong presence of the Holy Ghost guiding every word and every sentiment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p7\" class=\"\">But it was the words of Thabiso that made the difference in the visit. It seemed to me that this young priest was speaking in the language of angels\u2014loving words that we all could fully understand but that especially touched his friend. \u201cI enjoyed so much talking to you all the time at church,\u201d he said. \u201cYou always have kind words for me.

But sometimes I also witness, with a sad heart, how many young men do not understand how much good they can do with the power they hold.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p12\" class=\"\">The priesthood is the power and authority of God Himself to act in the service of His children. Oh, if only every young man, every Aaronic Priesthood holder, could fully comprehend that his priesthood possesses the keys of the ministering of angels. If only they could understand that they have the sacred duty to help their friends find the pathway that leads to the Savior. If only they knew that Heavenly Father will give them the power to explain the truths of the restored gospel with such clarity and sincerity that others will feel the undeniable truthfulness of the words of Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p13\" class=\"\">Dear young men of the Church, let me ask you a question that I hope you will carry in your heart for the rest of your life. What greater power can you acquire on earth than the priesthood of God? What power could possibly be greater than the capacity to assist our Heavenly Father in changing the lives of your fellowmen, to help them along the pathway of eternal happiness by being cleansed of sin and wrongdoing?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p14\" class=\"\">Like any other power, the priesthood needs to be exercised to accomplish any good.

Only those who are brave will be counted among the chosen. As you exercise the power of your sacred priesthood, your courage and confidence will increase. Young men, you know that you are at your best when you are in the service of God. You know that you are happiest when you are anxiously engaged in a good work. Magnify the power of your priesthood by being clean and being worthy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p15\" class=\"\">I add my voice to the call Elder Jeffrey\u00a0R. Holland made to you six months ago from this pulpit. \u201cI am looking,\u201d he said, \u201cfor men young and old who care enough about this battle between good and evil to sign on and speak up. We are at war.\u201d He continued, \u201c\u2026\u00a0I ask for a stronger and more devoted voice, a voice not only against evil\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, but a voice for good, a voice for the gospel, a voice for God\u201d (\u201cWe Are All Enlisted,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 2011, 44, 47).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p16\" class=\"\">Yes, Aaronic Priesthood holders, we are at war. And in this war, the best way to defend against evil is to actively promote righteousness. You cannot listen to foul words and pretend you don\u2019t hear. You cannot watch, alone or with others, images you know are filthy and pretend you don\u2019t see. You cannot touch any unclean thing and pretend it\u2019s no big deal. You cannot be passive when Satan seeks to destroy that which is wholesome and pure. Instead, stand up boldly for what you know is true! When you hear or see anything that violates the Lord\u2019s standards, remember who you are\u2014a soldier in the army of God Himself, empowered with His holy priesthood. There is no better weapon against the enemy, the father of lies, than the truth that will come out of your mouth as you exercise the power of the priesthood. Most of your peers will respect you for your courage and your integrity. Some will not. But that doesn\u2019t matter. You will gain the respect and trust of Heavenly Father because you used His power to accomplish His purposes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p17\" class=\"\">I call on every Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidency to once again raise the title of liberty and organize and lead your battalions. Utilize your priesthood power by inviting those around you to come unto Christ through repentance and baptism. You have the mandate and power of Heavenly Father to do it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p18\" class=\"\">Two years ago, while visiting Santiago, Chile, I was very much impressed by Daniel Olate, a young man who often accompanied the missionaries. I asked him to write to me, and with his permission I will read to you part of his recent e-mail: \u201cI just turned 16, and Sunday I was ordained to the office of a priest. That same day I baptized a friend; her name is Carolina. I taught her the gospel, and she regularly attended church and even received her Personal Progress award, but her parents would not allow her to be baptized until they got to know and trust me. She wanted me to baptize her, so we had to wait for a month until Sunday, when I turned 16. I feel so good to have helped such a good person to be baptized, and I feel happy that I was the one who baptized her.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p19\" class=\"\">Daniel is just one of many young men around the world who are living up to the power God has entrusted to them. Another is Luis Fernando, from Honduras, who noticed that his friend was walking a dangerous path and shared his testimony with him, literally saving his life (see \u201cA Change of Heart,\u201d lds.org\/youth\/video). Olavo, from Brazil, is another example. A true standing minister in his home (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122930\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122930)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122930)\">D&amp;C 84:111<\/a><\/span>), Olavo inspired his mother to return to full activity in the Church (see \u201cReunited by Faith,\u201d lds.org\/youth\/video). You can find some of these stories and many others like them on the Church\u2019s youth website, youth.lds.org. By the way, the Internet, social media, and other technologies are tools the Lord has placed in your hands to help you exercise your priesthood duties and extend the influence of truth and virtue.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p20\" class=\"\">Dear young men, when you exercise the Aaronic Priesthood in the way I have described, you are preparing yourselves for responsibilities in your future. But you are doing much more than that. Like John the Baptist, that exemplary Aaronic Priesthood holder, you are also preparing the way of the Lord and making His paths straight. When you boldly declare the gospel of repentance and baptism, as John did, you are preparing the people for the coming of the Lord (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122931\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122931)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122931)\">Matthew 3:3<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122932\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122932)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122932)\">D&amp;C 65:1\u20133<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122933\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122933)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122933)\">84:26\u201328<\/a><\/span>). You are often told about your great potential.
