As I would find a dog and capture it, I placed it in the crate, took it home, locked it in the coal shed, and turned the latch on the door.

One day just over a year ago, after taking care of matters at the office, I felt a strong impression to visit an aged widow who was a patient at St. Joseph Villa here in Salt Lake City. I drove there directly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/peace-be-still.p71\" class=\"\">When I went to her room, I found it empty. I asked an attendant concerning her whereabouts and was directed to a lounge area. There I found this sweet widow visiting with her sister and another friend. We had a pleasant conversation together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/peace-be-still.p72\" class=\"\">As we were talking, a man came to the door of the room to obtain a can of soda water from the vending machine.

Stephen told me that his father was there in the same facility and was near death. He had been calling my name, and the family had wanted to contact me but had been unable to find a telephone number for me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/peace-be-still.p74\" class=\"\">I excused myself immediately and went with Stephen up to the room of my former counselor, where others of his children were also gathered, his wife having passed away some years previous. The family members regarded my meeting Stephen in the lounge area as a response by our Heavenly Father to their great desire that I would see their father before he died and answer his call. I, too, felt that this was the case, for if Stephen had not entered the room in which I was visiting at precisely the time he did, I would not have known that Gene was even in that facility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/peace-be-still.p75\" class=\"\">We gave a blessing to him.
