But I have\nbeen impressed with the thought of saying something in addition to what has been said in\nrelation to the sacred and holy covenant of marriage.\n<\/p><p>\nMISUNDERSTANDING OF SCRIPTURES\n<\/p><p>\nThere is plenty that can be said, I think, without my crossing the lines and necessarily\nrepeating. The Lord never intended, never designated nor designed that marriage should come\nto an end with death. There isn't anything in the scriptures when properly understood that\nindicates anything of that kind. It is due to a misunderstanding through a lack of the guidance\nof the Spirit of the Lord that has led the world almost universally to believe that marriage is\nfor time only, that when death comes, there comes a separation of husbands and wives, and\nchildren are left without any claim in the eternities upon their parents.\n<\/p><p>\nThe one passage of scripture above all others that is relied on in the world to attempt to prove\nthat marriage comes to an end and that there is no marriage hereafter is taken from the\nremarks of our Savior to the Sadducees who came tempting him. You recall that these\nSadducees did not believe in the resurrection. They came with a story, which no doubt is\nfictitious, to the effect that a woman had been married consecutively seven times, and trying\nto catch him in a trap, they asked him which of these seven husbands would be the husband\nof the woman in eternity. Our Lord gave them the proper answer because he was speaking to\npeople who did not believe in the hereafter. So he said in answer to their questions: \"The\nchildren of <i>this<\/i> world marry and are given in marriage.\" I call your attention to the fact that\nthe Lord said that he and his disciples did not belong to this world; the Sadducees did. To\ncontinue: \"But they which shall be counted worthy to attain <i>that<\/i> world and the resurrection\nfrom the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34455\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34455)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34455)\">Matt. 22:23-30<\/a><\/span>). This is\nabsolutely true.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the Lord has revealed this same doctrine to the Church in the day in which we live. He\nsays unto those who are married for time only, and those who do not believe in marriage for\neternity: \n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in\nmarriage; but are appointed angels in heaven; which angels are ministering servants, to\nminister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal\nweight of glory.\n<\/p><p>\nFor these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain\nseparately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity, and\nfrom henceforth are not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12950\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12950)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12950)\">D&amp;C 132:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSo the Lord says those of that class, who may be worthy to enter the kingdom of heaven,\nshall be like the angels, and they remain separately and singly in eternity.\n<\/p><p>\nMARRIAGE AN ETERNAL PRINCIPLE\n<\/p><p>\nBut the Lord very definitely has declared that marriage is an eternal principle. That is\nrecorded in our scriptures, in the Bible. I call your attention to the fact that the very first\nmarriage on the face of this earth was performed by the Lord, and it was not for time only\nbecause there was no time. That was declared, and that ceremony given, to a couple who were\nnot subject to death. Therefore, marriage was not intended to come to an end. And after the\nFall, when Adam and Eve were driven from the Garden of Eden, the Lord did not say that\nthey should return to the dust, and their bodies should remain, but he gave them the promise\nof the resurrection; nor did he say to them that this marriage that was performed for eternity,\nif you please, would come to an end.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Lord was confronted by the Pharisees, who believed in the resurrection, his answer\nto them was a very different one. Likewise they came tempting him. They wanted to know if\nit is lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause. And the answer was given them: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and\nfemale,\n<\/p><p>\nAnd said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his\nwife: and they twain shall be one flesh?\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34450\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34450)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34450)\">Matt. 19:4-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhere is any idea of separation in that remark? \"Wherefore they are no more twain\"&mdash;that\nsounds like eternity. \"No more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together,\nlet no man put asunder\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34452\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34452)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34452)\">Matt. 19:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMARRIAGE BY DIVINE COMMANDMENT\n<\/p><p>\nIn the temples of the Lord men and women are sealed, married for time and for all eternity.\nThe Lord has commanded it. Children born to them will be their children not only in this life,\nbut also in eternity; and the family relationship, according to the plan of the Lord, is not\ndesigned to come to an end. But, of course, if people will not accept marriage by divine\ncommandment, it cannot be recognized. What God has joined together must be something that\nwill endure, for he does not perform ceremonies for time only. The Lord did not say to these\nPharisees, \"There is no marriage in eternity,\" but he said, where God joins, it endures forever.\nThat, I read into this passage of scripture, and I think I read it correctly.\n<\/p><p>\nCOVENANTS AND OBLIGATIONS\n<\/p><p>\nNow I want to plead to my good brethren and sisters, good members of the Church, to go to\nthe temple to be married for time and all eternity. I want to plead with those who have been\nto the temple and have been so married to be faithful and true to their covenants and their\nobligations, for in the House of the Lord they have made solemn covenants and have taken\nupon themselves before God, angels, and witnesses, obligations that sometimes are broken.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat does marriage mean to members of the Church? It means that they are receiving in that\nordinance the greatest, the crowning blessing, the blessing of eternal lives. Now that's the way\nthe Lord puts it, \"eternal lives\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12953\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12953)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12953)\">D&amp;C 132:24<\/a><\/span>),\nwhich means not only will the husband and the wife enter\ninto eternal life, but their children who were born under the covenant likewise will be entitled\nthrough their faithfulness to eternal lives. And further, that the husband and the wife after the\nresurrection of the dead will not come to an end. By that the Lord means that they will have a\ncontinuation of the seeds forever\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12952\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12952)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12952)\">D&amp;C 132:19<\/a><\/span>),\nand the family organization does not come to an end.\n<\/p><p>\nREASON FOR DIVORCE\n<\/p><p>\nWe have too many marriages in the temple of the Lord where the parties entering into the\ncovenants violate them. If we as members of the Church were living in full accord with the\nprinciples of the gospel, living by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34409\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34409)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34409)\">Matt. 4:4<\/a><\/span>),\ndivorce would practically disappear so far as the Church is concerned; that is, among those\nwho are married in the temple.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen divorce comes to those who are married in the temple, it has come because they have\nviolated the covenants and the obligations they have taken upon themselves to be true to each\nother, true to God, true to the Church. If they will continue to live in that faithfulness, if they\nwill have love in their hearts for each other, respect each other's rights and not one attempt to\ntake an advantage unduly of the other but have the proper consideration, there will be no\nfailures. When the separation comes, as I say, too frequently, it is because of violation of the\ncovenants and obligations of this sacred and holy ceremony.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd when a man and a woman are married in the temple for time and all eternity and then\nseek through the courts a separation, and perhaps come to the President of the Church to get a\ncancellation, what have they done? Children likely have been born, and as we have already\nheard, these children belong to God; they are his children sent to that home with all the rights\nof protection from father and mother, guidance from father and mother, to be built up and\nstrengthened in the faith, and to go into the heavens, into the celestial kingdom with the father\nand mother to sit with them in exaltation and glory. But frequently a man and a woman\ncannot live together, many times because of some trivial thing that arises, and they separate.\nWhat have they done to those children? They have destroyed their God-given rights, taken\nthem away from them, destroyed a family. And how are they going to go into the eternities\nand face their Maker under those conditions?\n<\/p><p>\nNow I realize, the Savior realized it, I did not read far enough to take that into consideration\nbecause that was not what I was talking about at the time, that there are some cases where a\nwife needs to have a separation, perhaps a husband should have a separation, but always\nbecause of a violation, a serious violation of the covenants that have been made. But here you\nhave the broken home; children left without one and maybe without both parents, to be taken\nperhaps through the mercy of the Almighty into some other faithful family to he adopted in\nsuch a family to be theirs through all eternity.\n<\/p><p>\nNow time will not permit me to say more. There is so much that could be said, much perhaps\nthat ought to be said. But those who violate this sacred and solemn covenant are going to\nhave a sorry time of it if they are guilty when they come to the judgment seat of God, for\nthey have broken the bands of an eternal union and lost their promise of exaltation in the\nkingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord bless you I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
