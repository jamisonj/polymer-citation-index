I hope that what I have to say will apply to all young priesthood holders everywhere. As I think of this large congregation and also the many thousands more who have joined us by satellite, I am reminded that the great blessing of holding the priesthood of God is one that is reserved for the relatively few, considering the billions of people in the world. To hold the priesthood is a signal honor; yet any worthy man or boy over the age of 12 in the Church may receive it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/message-to-my-grandsons.p6\" class=\"\">Priesthood is the authority delegated to man to minister in the name of God.

A young convert in his ward in Ontario, Canada, was sustained as a teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood, and Peter was asked to be the \u201cvoice\u201d in the ordination. Peter wrote, \u201cI had never laid my hands on anybody\u2019s head before, and I felt so inadequate. But then the Spirit reassured me that it would be fine for me to do it. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/message-to-my-grandsons.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cThe young man to be ordained sat down in the chair, and I stood directly behind him.

After we had finished the ordination and said, \u2018\u2026 and we wish to pronounce a blessing on your head at this time \u2026\u2019 [the Young Men president] looked at me and indicated that I was on my own.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/message-to-my-grandsons.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cAt that point, the priesthood entirely changed its meaning for me. It was no longer just a title, but the actual authority to act in God\u2019s name, and I was giving that authority to someone else. I paused and waited for the Spirit to whisper to me what I was to say. It is difficult for me to describe the feelings I had that day during the blessing, but I can say that I now have a stronger testimony that the power of the priesthood is real.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-00605_000_023\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Peter Pomart, \u201cThe Power Is Real,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">New Era,<\/span> Oct. 1996, 10; see <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> June 1997, 44.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/message-to-my-grandsons.p10\" class=\"\">You young men are no doubt looking forward to receiving the higher or Melchizedek Priesthood.

As you date the lovely young women of the Church, you have a duty to protect their physical safety and virtue. The priesthood you hold gives you the greater responsibility to see that the high moral standards of the Church are always maintained. You know better than to approach the edge of sexual enticement. You will lose part of that which is sacred about yourself if you go beyond the edge and abuse the great powers of procreation. How can any of us hope to play a great role in time or eternity if we have no power of self-control? To be married to a righteous woman who loves the Lord, loves you, and respects the priesthood is one of the greatest of blessings of life and eternity. I have learned this from over 60 years of marriage to my wife, Ruth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/message-to-my-grandsons.p18\" class=\"\">Friends and acquaintances add much to the richness of life, but these relationships can be temporary.

When I was a boy, many people had Model T Fords. Compared to modern cars, they were relatively simple mechanically. Many people were able to fix their own cars by grinding the valves, changing the rings on the pistons, putting in new brake bands, and using a generous supply of baling wire. Nowadays automobiles are so sophisticated that the average person knows very little about how to repair them. The mechanics of today use a computer to diagnose engine problems. I mention this example to encourage you young men to get training and education in order to keep up. Technical education is very important, and the same thing is true in fields of higher education.
