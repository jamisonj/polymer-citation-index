Centuries later, when Jesus was asked, \u201cWhich is the great commandment in the law?\u201d He answered, \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125824\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125824)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125824)\">Matthew 22:36\u201337<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/no-other-gods.p6\" class=\"\">The second of the Ten Commandments elaborates the direction to have no other gods and identifies what should be the ultimate priority in our lives as His children. \u201cThou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing\u201d in the heavens or the earth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125825\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125825)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125825)\">Exodus 20:4<\/a><\/span>).
