Over a period of years this man became a slave to alcohol. Drink by drink he accumulated all the miserable habits and characteristics of a drunkard. He walked the streets in a stupor of mind and with an unsteady step. When greeted by friends passing by, his response was a feeble wave of the hand or an almost inaudible grunt. Physically, he was a wreck.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p4\" class=\"\">To avoid people and conversation, this alcoholic would stagger off the path or into the gutter, for that was the direction of his look. He seemed oblivious to the people, the things, and the events around him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p5\" class=\"\">Many pitied this man who had lost health, pride, purpose, family love, and other blessings.

Others, without compassion ridiculed him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p6\" class=\"\">After many years of suffering, some unselfish people helped this man work a miracle. These friends invested countless hours of loving care, much kindly persuasion, many fervent prayers, and all else required to reform the man. In the process of repentance, (1) he allowed the written word of God to nourish his impoverished soul; (2) he fixed his eyes upon a living prophet and tuned his ears to the prophet\u2019s teachings; and (3) he also rekindled faith in himself by exercising faith in Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p7\" class=\"\">In time he gained the confidence and strength to walk with steady stride on the sidewalk.

Finally, after some inner strugglings, I asked: \u201cWhat will it take to convince you that you must successfully complete your calling?\u201d He did not answer. So I added: \u201cAre you waiting to see a burning bush? to receive an angelic visitation? or to hear a voice directly from heaven?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/look-to-god-and-live.p19\" class=\"\">His response was immediate: \u201cThat\u2019s what I need.
