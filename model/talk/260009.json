They are exceedingly appropriate to Latter-day Saints, as doubtless they were when written to former-day Saints. The circumstances which surrounded our brethren and sisters in former days, no doubt were similar in many respects to those which surround us in this one day, probably, with this difference that we are not scattered to the same extent they were; we have been gathered together from the nations where the Gospel was preached to us, and are now living in one community in these mountains. But the same doctrines, the <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"78b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0078.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;78b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9450\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> same principles, the same powers of evil, the same powers of good, the same Spirit of God, and the same spirit of evil, were extant then, and were experienced then by the Saints who took upon themselves the name of Christ, as they are by us who now live. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n250\"> Since I have come into this stand my mind has reverted to a conversation which I had a few days ago with a minister of the Dutch Reform Church, who was passing through this city, and who was introduced to me, and had a good many inquiries to make respecting our doctrines. When I told him how God had revealed Himself in these last days, how He had restored the Everlasting Priesthood, the ordinances of life and salvation, the Gospel in its original purity and power, accompanied with the Holy Ghost and its gifts, and had organized the Church as in ancient days, and related to him what God had said concerning all the churches in Christendom, he had the question to ask, which is so frequently asked of all our Elders when they travel and declare the same message, &#x201C;Why has God left the Christian world for so long a time without these blessings and these powers and these gifts that you now claim as belonging to your Church and having been restored from heaven? And what has become of those Christians whom you say died in ignorance of the fullness of the Gospel of salvation?&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n251\"> These are very pertinent questions. They are questions frequently asked of all our Elders. They are questions which suggest themselves to the minds of every thinking man when he is told that God has restored the truth in its original purity, with the power and authority of the Priesthood which have been so long withdrawn. Our ancestors we may  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"79a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0079.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;79a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9449\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>have known, at least some of them; we may have known the morality of their lives, the purity of their intentions, the goodness of their motives, their exemplary conduct; and if we do not understand the principles of the Gospel when we are told the message that the Elders have to bear, the inquiry naturally arises, &#x201C;Is it possible that my grandfather, my grandmother, my uncle, or perchance my father and my mother, have not gone to heaven, that they are not in the presence of God? Why, better people I never knew, and I have always thought,&#x201D; says the inquirer, &#x201C;that they really had gone to heaven, and now you tell me that unless I am baptized I shall be damned, and yet they are dead and have not been baptized.&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n253\"> I expect many feel as the heathen king once felt. He was a king of the Franks, one of the old races that invaded what is now called France. He had surrendered his old convictions sufficiently to consent to receive the rite of baptism. A Catholic Bishop from Rome was to sprinkle him. But before submitting to be sprinkled the thought suggested itself to the king to ask the question what had become of his ancestors. The Bishop, more ready than politic, said, &#x201C;They have gone to hell.&#x201D; &#x201C;Then,&#x201D; said the king, &#x201C;I will go to hell with them; I shall not be separated from my ancestors,&#x201D; and he refused to receive the rite of baptism. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n254\"> Now, I expect that there are many people in the world who, in the absence, or for the want of knowledge concerning the plan of salvation would almost feel the same when told that if they did not obey the Gospel, they would be damned. But when people are enlightened concerning the plan of Jehovah, the Gospel of the Son of God, they <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"79b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0079.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;79b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9449\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> can easily reconcile justice and mercy as being attributes of the Great Being whom we worship. As I remarked to this gentleman, &#x201C;I might easily answer your question by propounding another question to you. You are a Christian minister; you preach what you believe to be the Gospel; what has become of the millions of heathen who died in ignorance of that Gospel which you profess to obey and accept as the plan of salvation&#x2014;the millions of heathen who never heard the name of Jesus Christ, the only name given under heaven whereby man can be saved&#x2014;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"71447\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 71447)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(71447)\">Acts 4:12<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"81616\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 81616)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(81616)\">2 Ne. 31:21<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"92734\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 92734)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(92734)\">Moses 6:52<\/a><\/span>what has become of them?&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n255\"> &#x201C;Oh,&#x201D; said he, &#x201C;but they were not Christians.&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n256\"> Said I, &#x201C;Do you think that God makes a distinction between the souls or the spirits of men? Is there one class of spirits for whom He has a greater respect than He has for others! Is a Christian soul more valuable, or more precious, in the sight of our Great Creator, than the soul of a heathen? I do not believe it myself. I have no such idea.&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n257\"> But he could see a wide distinction between those who were Christians and those who were not. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n258\"> Nevertheless the difficulty still remains, and it will ever remain to those who do not comprehend the plan of salvation as revealed by the Lord Jesus Christ. We must remember that God's work is not confined to this life; that God's plan of salvation extends throughout eternity; that according to our belief it began to operate in eternity, if it ever began at all&#x2014;for it never really in truth began, it always operated, operated from eternity and will operate to eternity, for all the children of men, for every human soul.

And Enoch said unto the Lord: How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity? And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations; and thy curtains are stretched out still; and yet thou art there, and thy bosom is there; and also thou art just; thou art merciful and kind forever; And thou hast taken Zion to thine own bosom, from all thy creations, from all eternity to all eternity; and naught but peace, justice, and truth is the habitation of thy throne; and mercy shall go before thy face and have no end; how is it that thou canst weep? <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n262\"> &#x201C;The Lord said unto Enoch; Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day that I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency; And unto thy <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"80b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0080.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;80b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9448\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father; but behold, they are without affection, and they hate their own blood; And the fire of mine indignation is kindled against them; and in my hot displeasure will I send in the floods upon them, for my fierce anger is kindled against them. Behold, I am God; Man of Holiness is my name; Man of Counsel is my name; and Endless and Eternal is my name, also. Wherefore, I can stretch forth mine hands and hold all the creations which I have made; and mine eye can pierce them also, and among all the workmanship of mine hands there has not been so great wickedness as among thy brethren; But behold, their sins shall be upon the heads of their fathers; Satan shall be their father, and misery shall be their doom; and the whole heavens shall weep over them, even all the workmanship of mine hands; wherefore should not the heavens weep, seeing these shall suffer? But behold, these which thine eyes are upon shall perish in the floods; and behold, I will shut them up; a prison have I prepared for them. And That which I have chosen hath plead before my face.

And you will remember&#x2014;although it seems almost unnecessary to repeat it to this congregation who are so well instructed; but there are young people who are not so familiar with these doctrines, and, therefore, for their benefit I quote the Scriptures. You will remember when Mary, after she missed the body from the sepulchre, rushed forward to a man, supposing him to be the gardener, and asked him where he had laid the body.

He had not yet ascended to the Father. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n273\"> Thus you see the Scriptures corroborate that which I have said in this respect. His body had lain, as I before remarked, from Friday until Sunday, in the tomb, and then it was resurrected. But during that period His spirit had been engaged preaching to the spirits in prison; they heard the glad tidings of salvation from the Savior. His voice penetrated the depths of hell, the gloom of darkness, and it awakened hope within their hearts. He proclaimed liberty to the captive. He opened the prison doors to those that were bound. He preached unto them the acceptable year of the Lord:<span class=\"citation\" id=\"60082\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 60082)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(60082)\">Isa. 61:1-2<\/a><\/span> for the time had come for them to be redeemed from their prison house in which they had been so long incarcerated for the sins committed in the flesh. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n274\"> This is the Gospel of salvation that God has revealed.

They cannot hear the Gospel. They cannot be judged until they do hear it. Every principle of salvation will be proclaimed to those who have died without the privilege of hearing it in the flesh&#x2014;they must hear it in the spirit world as well as those who hear it in the flesh. Therefore, we need not be in any anxiety concerning our ancestors; we need not puzzle ourselves with questions as to the fate of the heathen; we need not be disturbed in our feelings to reconcile the justice of God with His mercy, or His mercy with His justice, to the children of men. None of these questions need trouble us, for the reason that by the revelation of these glorious principles God's mercy is reconcilable in the most perfect manner with His justice. We see by this that God will not consign any soul to endless torment without first giving him an opportunity of receiving or rejecting the Gospel. If he be consigned to torment it will be as a punishment for violating law. Where there is no law there is no transgression of the law.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"72318\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 72318)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(72318)\">Rom. 4:15<\/a><\/span> There can be therefore no punishment if a man does not comprehend the law.

Therefore in the spirit world there are grades of punishment just as there are grades of spirits. Some are ignorant.

Every man has within him a spirit which comes from our Great Creator, and if we grieve it not it leads us, guides us, though we may not know the Gospel, as has been the case with many thousands and millions of human beings.
