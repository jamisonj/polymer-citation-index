Consequently, they enter into long-term debt on the basis of two salaries. Perhaps too late they find that changes do come, women have children, sickness stalks some families, jobs are lost, natural disasters and other situations occur, and no longer can the mortgage payment, based on the income from two salaries, be made.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/constant-truths-for-changing-times.p19\" class=\"\">It is essential for us to live within our means.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/constant-truths-for-changing-times.p20\" class=\"\">Next, I have felt impressed to speak to mothers, to fathers, to sons, and to daughters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/constant-truths-for-changing-times.p21\" class=\"\">I would say to each mother, each father\u2014be a good listener.

In the spring of 1848, my great-great-grandparents, Charles Stewart Miller and Mary McGowan Miller, joined the Church in their native Scotland, left their home in Rutherglen, Scotland, and journeyed across the Atlantic Ocean. They reached the port of New Orleans and traveled up the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri, with a group of Saints, arriving there in 1849.

One day a delegation came to our home and asked my wife, Frances, to sign the petition. She declined, saying, \u201cWhy, he\u2019s just a little boy, and the papers are so heavy for him.
