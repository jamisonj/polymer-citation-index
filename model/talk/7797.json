If you are concerned about providing financially for a wife and family, may I assure you that there is no shame in a couple having to scrimp and save. It is generally during these challenging times that you will grow closer together as you learn to sacrifice and to make difficult decisions. Perhaps you are afraid of making the wrong choice. To this I say that you need to exercise faith. Find someone with whom you can be compatible. Realize that you will not be able to anticipate every challenge which may arise, but be assured that almost anything can be worked out if you are resourceful and if you are committed to making your marriage work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/priesthood-power.p23\" class=\"\">Perhaps you are having a little too much fun being single, taking extravagant vacations, buying expensive cars and toys, and just generally enjoying the carefree life with your friends.

If you choose wisely and if you are committed to the success of your marriage, there is nothing in this life which will bring you greater happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/priesthood-power.p25\" class=\"\">When you marry, brethren, you will wish to marry in the house of the Lord. For you who hold the priesthood, there should be no other option. Be careful lest you destroy your eligibility to be so married. You can keep your courtship within proper bounds while still having a wonderful time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/priesthood-power.p26\" class=\"\">Now, brethren, I turn to another subject about which I feel impressed to address you. In the three years since I was sustained as President of the Church, I believe the saddest and most discouraging responsibility I have each week is the handling of cancellations of sealings. Each one was preceded by a joyous marriage in the house of the Lord, where a loving couple was beginning a new life together and looking forward to spending the rest of eternity with each other. And then months and years go by, and for one reason or another, love dies. It may be the result of financial problems, lack of communication, uncontrolled tempers, interference from in-laws, entanglement in sin. There are any number of reasons. In most cases divorce does not have to be the outcome.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/priesthood-power.p27\" class=\"\">The vast majority of requests for cancellations of sealings come from women who tried desperately to make a go of the marriage but who, in the final analysis, could not overcome the problems.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/priesthood-power.p28\" class=\"\">Choose a companion carefully and prayerfully; and when you are married, be fiercely loyal one to another. Priceless advice comes from a small framed plaque I once saw in the home of an uncle and aunt. It read, \u201cChoose your love; love your choice.\u201d There is great wisdom in those few words. Commitment in marriage is absolutely essential.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/priesthood-power.p29\" class=\"\">Your wife is your equal. In marriage neither partner is superior nor inferior to the other. You walk side by side as a son and a daughter of God. She is not to be demeaned or insulted but should be respected and loved. Said President Gordon\u00a0B. Hinckley: \u201cAny man in this Church who \u2026 exercises unrighteous dominion over [his wife] is unworthy to hold the priesthood.

The three of us went into one of the beautiful sealing rooms, not knowing a soul in the room except Elder ElRay\u00a0L. Christiansen, then an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve, a General Authority position which existed at that time. Elder Christiansen was scheduled to perform a sealing ceremony for a bride and groom in that very room that morning. I am confident the bride and her family thought, \u201cThese must be friends of the groom\u201d and that the groom\u2019s family thought, \u201cThese must be friends of the bride.\u201d My couple were seated on a little bench with about a full two feet (0.6 m) of space between them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/priesthood-power.p38\" class=\"\">Elder Christiansen began by providing counsel to the couple who were being married, and he did so in a beautiful fashion. He mentioned how a husband should love his wife, how he should treat her with respect and courtesy, honoring her as the heart of the home. Then he talked to the bride about how she should honor her husband as the head of the home and be of support to him in every way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/priesthood-power.p39\" class=\"\">I noticed that as Elder Christiansen spoke to the bride and the groom, my couple moved a little closer together. Soon they were seated right next to one another. What pleased me is that they had both moved at about the same rate.

Each was smiling.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/priesthood-power.p40\" class=\"\">We left the temple that day, and no one ever knew who we were or why we had come, but my friends were holding hands as they walked out the front door. Their differences had been set aside. I had not had to say one word. You see, they remembered their own wedding day and the covenants they had made in the house of God. They were committed to beginning again and trying harder this time around.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/priesthood-power.p41\" class=\"\">If any of you are having difficulty in your marriage, I urge you to do all that you can to make whatever repairs are necessary, that you might be as happy as you were when your marriage started out. We who are married in the house of the Lord do so for time and for all eternity, and then we must put forth the necessary effort to make it so. I realize that there are situations where marriages cannot be saved, but I feel strongly that for the most part they can be and should be. Do not let your marriage get to the point where it is in jeopardy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/priesthood-power.p42\" class=\"\">President Hinckley taught that it is up to each of us who hold the priesthood of God to discipline ourselves so that we stand above the ways of the world.

This is my prayer in His sacred name, His holy name, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-09605_000_027\"><a name=\"-09605_000_027\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-09605_000_027\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"122086\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122086)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122086)\">Doctrine and Covenants 121:36\u201337<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-09605_000_027\"><a name=\"-09605_000_027\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-09605_000_027\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"122087\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122087)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122087)\">Exodus 20:7<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-09605_000_027\"><a name=\"-09605_000_027\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-09605_000_027\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"122088\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122088)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122088)\">Isaiah 1:18<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-09605_000_027\"><a name=\"-09605_000_027\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-09605_000_027\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"122089\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122089)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122089)\">Doctrine and Covenants 58:42<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-09605_000_027\"><a name=\"-09605_000_027\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote5-09605_000_027\">5.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122090\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122090)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122090)\">John 17:14<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122091\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122091)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122091)\">Doctrine and Covenants 49:5<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-09605_000_027\"><a name=\"-09605_000_027\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote6-09605_000_027\">6.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cPresident Harold\u00a0B.
