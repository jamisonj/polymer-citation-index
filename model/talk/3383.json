Now, a year later, we may consider how the area council is actually functioning, and, more specifically, its role in (1) welfare services master planning, (2) teaching gospel principles germane to welfare services, and (3) coordinating the welfare services efforts of temporal and ecclesiastical officers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>How the councils work<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/priesthood-councils-key-to-meeting-temporal-and-spiritual-needs.p12\" class=\"\">Personal experience suggests that the principal, immediate benefit from a renewed emphasis on Church councils is the opportunity to coordinate the efforts of temporal and ecclesiastical officers. Through councils, Church leaders can better work together to teach the doctrines, principles, and practices of welfare services and to plan for a great upsurge in accomplishments. The enduring personal friendships which develop during this effort evoke our noblest sentiments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/priesthood-councils-key-to-meeting-temporal-and-spiritual-needs.p13\" class=\"\">The Regional Representatives and General Authority Executive Administrator for an area, addressing their welfare services responsibilities, may rely heavily on the Welfare Services area director.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/priesthood-councils-key-to-meeting-temporal-and-spiritual-needs.p14\" class=\"\">In our first area council meeting, an executive planning committee was appointed, including selected Welfare Services region agents and certain specialists chosen from the area.

Finally, this phase 1 (or strategic) plan will be submitted to the General Welfare Services Committee.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/priesthood-councils-key-to-meeting-temporal-and-spiritual-needs.p18\" class=\"\">Once the approval of that committee has been obtained, we will begin phase 2, or the operational master plan.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Planning and goals<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/priesthood-councils-key-to-meeting-temporal-and-spiritual-needs.p20\" class=\"\">As planning develops, a need is recognized to perform more effectively that which the Lord has already taught us; for example, to provide meaningful work for more of those receiving assistance and to improve the productivity of our present resources.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/priesthood-councils-key-to-meeting-temporal-and-spiritual-needs.p21\" class=\"\">Both improving the present system and planning for additional accomplishment require that principles which pertain to welfare services be taught more effectively.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/priesthood-councils-key-to-meeting-temporal-and-spiritual-needs.p22\" class=\"\">Therefore, our area council adopted a formal teaching plan which includes specific doctrines, principles, and practices to be taught; identifies by whom, to whom, and when the teaching shall occur; and involves everyone in the priesthood line and Relief Society presidents.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/priesthood-councils-key-to-meeting-temporal-and-spiritual-needs.p23\" class=\"\">Concurrently, a family guide for emergency preparedness is being compiled. Suggestions on how to implement it and a schedule for delivering it through the priesthood line into every home are also being prepared. This project, not yet finally approved by our area council, is intended to be a first step toward more complete family preparedness, the foundation of welfare services.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/priesthood-councils-key-to-meeting-temporal-and-spiritual-needs.p24\" class=\"\">Also, the first annual service evaluation of welfare services by ecclesiastical leaders was recently conducted to determine what is succeeding and what can be improved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/priesthood-councils-key-to-meeting-temporal-and-spiritual-needs.p25\" class=\"\">A master plan is our principal tool in purposeful preparation.

Thus, the plan becomes the vision of the heart, and we have increased awareness of inspiring concepts which, though not new, come to us with invigorating freshness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/priesthood-councils-key-to-meeting-temporal-and-spiritual-needs.p28\" class=\"\">As we carefully and prayerfully develop a plan to prepare for the times of stress that are ahead, the magnitude of the challenge may seem overwhelming. Providing even temporary assistance to 15 percent or perhaps even 30 percent of the Church members may seem beyond our capability. However, in addition, we must plan to provide meaningful work for those who become unemployed and to assist with the physical, emotional, and social problems that inevitably accompany periods of economic stress.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/priesthood-councils-key-to-meeting-temporal-and-spiritual-needs.p29\" class=\"\">However, \u201cthe Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1763\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1763)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1763)\">1 Ne. 3:7<\/a><\/span>).

At each step, consensus of the council members must be obtained, through prayer and discussion, to achieve that unity which is prerequisite to the Lord\u2019s help. To be effective, decisions must be reached by divine consensus, not by compromise. Participants are not competing advocates, representing special interests, but rather contributing members of a unified body.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/priesthood-councils-key-to-meeting-temporal-and-spiritual-needs.p35\" class=\"\">The priesthood council is a form of management unique to the divine Church.
