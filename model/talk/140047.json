It always affords me gratification to contemplate the things pertaining to the Church and kingdom of God, and to the interests of humanity on the earth. I love to speak of these things, I am always pleased to hear of them, and I am as willing to listen to the truth when emanating from some person else as I am to communicate it to others, as it may be made manifest to me. I feel as our Elders generally do&#x2014;that we are seeking to communicate&#x2014;not our own special ideas, or any peculiar theory that we may have entertained; but, under the guidance of the Almighty, that we may instruct and teach as we may be led and guided by the Spirit of the living God.

I feel always willing to hear, to teach, to receive instruction, or to communicate unto others those principles that are calculated to promote their happiness and well-being in time and in eternity.

A feeling of this kind tends more or less to unbelief instead of faith in God, and hence we find very few men in our day who act as men of God did in former days, that is, seek unto him for guidance and direction in the affairs of life. If we examine what is termed the sacred history of the Bible, we shall find that in the various ages of the world, until soon after Christianity was introduced, there was a feeling among men to call upon God and to have their prayers answered&#x2014;a feeling that if they would approach the Most High and call upon his name in faith, he would answer their supplications and give unto them wisdom, intelligence and revelation for the guidance of their feet in the pathway of life; and it was not based as it is now, generally, upon some old theories, or upon communications made unto others; but if we trace the records of Scripture through, we shall find that men generally sought for themselves guidance and direction and revelation adapted to the peculiar circumstances in which they were placed. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v14n1309\"> If we go back to the time when Adam first made his appearance on the earth, the Lord God we are told communicated with him, gave him certain commandments, told him what he should do and what he should not do; and when he transgressed the law, we are told that he heard the footsteps of the Lord in the garden, and he heard his voice speaking unto him,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52586\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52586)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52586)\">Gen. 3:8<\/a><\/span> and when, at the dictum of the Almighty, he was expelled from the paradise in which he lived, an angel was placed there as a guardian to prevent his return.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52671\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52671)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52671)\">Gen. 3:24<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v14n1310\"> From the accounts that we have in our possession of events that took place soon after that time, we learn  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"358a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD14\/JoD14_0358.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;358a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/5169\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>that the Lord communicated his will unto others, and there was a man called Enoch, a very remarkable personage, whose history is very brief indeed, considering the important events that transpired during his day.

The priests of those days offered sacrifices to their gods, and, like the priests of these days, they were generally opposed to new revelation from God. Abraham's father had instructed him in the doctrines of these idols, and had sought to induce him to have faith in them and in their power, authority, and dominion, telling him what great personages they were. But Abraham, inspired by the Lord, went on a certain occasion into the temple of these gods and smote them right and left, upsetting and breaking them in pieces. His father came in and asked what he had been doing, what great sin this was that he had committed, why he was so sacrilegious in his feelings and so wicked as to seek to destroy these gods? Said he, &#x201C;Father, I did not do anything to them, they quarreled among themselves and went to work fighting and knocked one another down, broke one another's heads and knocked off one another's arms and legs.&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh,&#x201D; said his father, &#x201C;my son do not tell me anything of that kind, for they are made of wood and they could not move or stir from their place nor knock one another down; it has been some other agency that has done it.&#x201D; &#x201C;Why, father,&#x201D; said he, &#x201C;would you worship a being that could not stir or move, that had hands and could not handle, that had legs and could not walk, a mouth that could not speak, and a head and it was of no use? Would you worship a being like that?&#x201D; But nevertheless our history informs us that the priests were angry and stirred up his father against him. But the Lord inspired Abraham to leave there. The Bible tells us the Lord said to him: &#x201C;Get thee up from thy father's house, from the land wherein thou wast born, and go up to a land <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"359b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD14\/JoD14_0359.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;359b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/5168\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> I will show unto thee, and which I will afterwards give unto thee for an inheritance.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"53012\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 53012)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(53012)\">Gen. 12:1<\/a><\/span> And we are told that, &#x201C;he went up, not knowing whither he went.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"76990\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 76990)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(76990)\">Heb. 11:8<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v14n1315\"> There is something very peculiar about this little history, so far as we have it in the Bible.

In offering up his only son there was something very peculiar, not especially as a sacrifice, but it came in contact with every parental feeling which he must necessarily have felt for his only child. This, in and of itself, rendered it one of the most severe and painful trials that could be placed upon man; but there was something else connected with this which was explained by the Prophet Joseph Smith, who, when speaking of these things, said God was determined in these days to have a tried people as He had in former times,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"126533\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 126533)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(126533)\">D&amp;C 101:4<\/a><\/span> and that he would feel after their heartstrings and try them in every way possible for them to be tried; and if he could have invented anything that would have been more keen, acute, and trying than that which he required of Abraham he would have done it. But that, no doubt, was one of the greatest trials that could have been inflicted on any human being. Notice the old gentleman tottering along with his son, brooding over the promises of God and the peculiar demand now made upon him. Says he: &#x201C;Isaac, let us go up into the mountain here, and offer a sacrifice to the Lord.&#x201D; And he took him along; they ascend the mountain, they gather together some rocks and together build an altar; they gather the fuel and place it on that altar; and when everything is prepared Isaac says: &#x201C;Father, here is the altar and here is the wood: but where is the sacrifice?&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"53294\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 53294)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(53294)\">Gen. 22:7<\/a><\/span> What would the feelings of a father be under such circumstances?

To these men we are indebted for the Bible, that is, for the Old and New Testaments; to them and their revelations, to the communications that they had, the ministering of angels and the opening visions, and the unfolding of the purposes of God, and the various histories and dealings of God with the people; to them are we indebted for the Bible that we Christians of the present day talk so much about.

But you read the Bible through, and you will find that the Scriptures that are given to us are simply an account of revelations, communications, prophecies and the ministering of angels, and the power of God made manifest to the ancient people of God who had the Gospel.
