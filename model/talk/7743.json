For example, scientists can look at the rings of trees and make educated guesses about climate and growing conditions hundreds and even thousands of years ago. One of the things we learn from studying the growth of trees is that during seasons when conditions are ideal, trees grow at a normal rate. However, during seasons when growing conditions are not ideal, trees slow down their growth and devote their energy to the basic elements necessary for survival.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/of-things-that-matter-most.p6\" class=\"\">At this point some of you may be thinking, \u201cThat\u2019s all very fine and good, but what does it have to do with flying an airplane?\u201d Well, let me tell you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/of-things-that-matter-most.p7\" class=\"\">Have you ever been in an airplane and experienced turbulence? The most common cause of turbulence is a sudden change in air movement causing the aircraft to pitch, yaw, and roll. While planes are built to withstand far greater turbulence than anything you would encounter on a regular flight, it still may be disconcerting to passengers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/of-things-that-matter-most.p8\" class=\"\">What do you suppose pilots do when they encounter turbulence? A student pilot may think that increasing speed is a good strategy because it will get them through the turbulence faster. But that may be the wrong thing to do. Professional pilots understand that there is an optimum turbulence penetration speed that will minimize the negative effects of turbulence. And most of the time that would mean to reduce your speed. The same principle applies also to speed bumps on a road.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/of-things-that-matter-most.p9\" class=\"\">Therefore, it is good advice to slow down a little, steady the course, and focus on the essentials when experiencing adverse conditions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>The Pace of Modern Life<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/of-things-that-matter-most.p11\" class=\"\">This is a simple but critical lesson to learn. It may seem logical when put in terms of trees or turbulence, but it\u2019s surprising how easy it is to ignore this lesson when it comes to applying these principles in our own daily lives. When stress levels rise, when distress appears, when tragedy strikes, too often we attempt to keep up the same frantic pace or even accelerate, thinking somehow that the more rushed our pace, the better off we will be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/of-things-that-matter-most.p12\" class=\"\">One of the characteristics of modern life seems to be that we are moving at an ever-increasing rate, regardless of turbulence or obstacles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/of-things-that-matter-most.p13\" class=\"\">Let\u2019s be honest; it\u2019s rather easy to be busy. We all can think up a list of tasks that will overwhelm our schedules. Some might even think that their self-worth depends on the length of their to-do list. They flood the open spaces in their time with lists of meetings and minutia\u2014even during times of stress and fatigue. Because they unnecessarily complicate their lives, they often feel increased frustration, diminished joy, and too little sense of meaning in their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/of-things-that-matter-most.p14\" class=\"\">It is said that any virtue when taken to an extreme can become a vice.
