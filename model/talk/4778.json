A call to lead is not an exemption from the challenges of life. We seek for inspiration in the same way that you do, and we must obey the same laws which apply to every member of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/revelation-in-a-changing-world.p53\" class=\"\">We are sorry for our inadequacies, sorry we are not better than we are. We can feel, as you can see, the effect of the aging process as it imposes limitations upon His leaders before your very eyes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/revelation-in-a-changing-world.p54\" class=\"\">But this we know. There are councils and counselors and quorums to counterbalance the foibles and frailties of man. The Lord organized His church to provide for mortal men to work as mortal men, and yet He assured that the spirit of revelation would guide in all that we do in His name.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/revelation-in-a-changing-world.p55\" class=\"\">And in the end, what is given comes because the Lord has spoken it, \u201cwhether by [His] own voice or by the voice of [His] servants, it is the same.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18923\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18923)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18923)\">D&amp;C 1:38<\/a><\/span>.) We know His voice when He speaks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/revelation-in-a-changing-world.p56\" class=\"\">Revelation continues with us today. The promptings of the Spirit, the dreams, and the visions and the visitations, and the ministering of angels all are with us now.
