[{"Verse":"0","Text":"<i>Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, in the summer of 1828. HC 1:20\u201323. Herein the Lord informs Joseph of alterations made by wicked men in the 116 manuscript pages from the translation of the \u201cBook of Lehi,\u201d in the Book of Mormon. These manuscript pages had been lost from the possession of Martin Harris, to whom the sheets had been temporarily entrusted. See heading to <a onclick=\"getScripture('?book=sec&chap=3&verses=&jst=')\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\">Section 3<\/a>.  The evil design was to await the expected retranslation of the matter covered by the stolen pages, and then to discredit the translator by showing discrepancies created by the alterations. That this wicked purpose had been conceived by the evil one, and was known to the Lord even while Mormon, the ancient Nephite historian, was making his abridgment of the accumulated plates, is shown in the Book of Mormon (<a onclick=\"getScripture('?book=w_of_m&chap=1&verses=3-7&jst=')\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\">The Words of Mormon 1:3-7<\/a>).<\/i>"},{"Verse":"1","Text":"Now, behold, I say unto you, that because you delivered up those writings which you had power given unto you to translate by the means of the Urim and Thummim, into the hands of a wicked man, you have lost them."},{"Verse":"2","Text":"And you also lost your gift at the same time, and your mind became darkened."},{"Verse":"3","Text":"Nevertheless, it is now restored unto you again; therefore see that you are faithful and continue on unto the finishing of the remainder of the work of translation as you have begun."},{"Verse":"4","Text":"Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength and means provided to enable you to translate; but be diligent unto the end."},{"Verse":"5","Text":"Pray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea, that you may conquer Satan, and that you may escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold his work."},{"Verse":"6","Text":"Behold, they have sought to destroy you; yea, even the man in whom you have trusted has sought to destroy you."},{"Verse":"7","Text":"And for this cause I said that he is a wicked man, for he has sought to take away the things wherewith you have been entrusted; and he has also sought to destroy your gift."},{"Verse":"8","Text":"And because you have delivered the writings into his hands, behold, wicked men have taken them from you."},{"Verse":"9","Text":"Therefore, you have delivered them up, yea, that which was sacred, unto wickedness."},{"Verse":"10","Text":"And, behold, Satan hath put it into their hearts to alter the words which you have caused to be written, or which you have translated, which have gone out of your hands."},{"Verse":"11","Text":"And behold, I say unto you, that because they have altered the words, they read contrary from that which you translated and caused to be written;"},{"Verse":"12","Text":"And, on this wise, the devil has sought to lay a cunning plan, that he may destroy this work;"},{"Verse":"13","Text":"For he hath put into their hearts to do this, that by lying they may say they have caught you in the words which you have pretended to translate."},{"Verse":"14","Text":"Verily, I say unto you, that I will not suffer that Satan shall accomplish his evil design in this thing."},{"Verse":"15","Text":"For behold, he has put it into their hearts to get thee to tempt the Lord thy God, in asking to translate it over again."},{"Verse":"16","Text":"And then, behold, they say and think in their hearts\u2014We will see if God has given him power to translate; if so, he will also give him power again;"},{"Verse":"17","Text":"And if God giveth him power again, or if he translates again, or, in other words, if he bringeth forth the same words, behold, we have the same with us, and we have altered them;"},{"Verse":"18","Text":"Therefore they will not agree, and we will say that he has lied in his words, and that he has no gift, and that he has no power;"},{"Verse":"19","Text":"Therefore we will destroy him, and also the work; and we will do this that we may not be ashamed in the end, and that we may get glory of the world."},{"Verse":"20","Text":"Verily, verily, I say unto you, that Satan has great hold upon their hearts; he stirreth them up to iniquity against that which is good;"},{"Verse":"21","Text":"And their hearts are corrupt, and full of wickedness and abominations; and they love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil; therefore they will not ask of me."},{"Verse":"22","Text":"Satan stirreth them up, that he may lead their souls to destruction."},{"Verse":"23","Text":"And thus he has laid a cunning plan, thinking to destroy the work of God; but I will require this at their hands, and it shall turn to their shame and condemnation in the day of judgment."},{"Verse":"24","Text":"Yea, he stirreth up their hearts to anger against this work."},{"Verse":"25","Text":"Yea, he saith unto them: Deceive and lie in wait to catch, that ye may destroy; behold, this is no harm.
