It weren\u2019t no use to try and hide it from Him \u2026 I knowed very well why they wouldn\u2019t come. It was because my heart warn\u2019t right; it was because I weren\u2019t square: it was because I was playing double. I was letting on to give up sin, but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to make my mouth say I would do the right thing and the clean thing. But deep down in me, I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. YOU CAN\u2019T PRAY A LIE \u2026 I found that out.\u201d (New York: Platt &amp; Munk, 1960, pp. 445\u201346.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/forgive-them-i-pray-thee.p12\" class=\"\">Huck Finn was right. You can\u2019t pray a lie; and regardless of what may be decided by a common judge, actual forgiveness cannot take place until true repentance has preceded it. The common judge serves as the Lord\u2019s agent. A bishop may be deceived, but the Holy Ghost cannot. When confession takes place, it ought to be from the inner-most depths of the heart and soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/forgive-them-i-pray-thee.p13\" class=\"\">What a tragedy when someone finally gets enough courage to go to the bishop and then leaves his office having only partially confessed. Oh, beloved brothers and sisters, \u201cthe shepherd should not recoil from the diseased sheep\u201d (Victor Hugo, <span class=\"emphasis\">Les Miserables,<\/span> New York: Random House, n.d., p. 32). The bishops in this kingdom have been endowed with wisdom, judgment, and mercy from on high. They can relieve the burden of the repentant sufferer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/forgive-them-i-pray-thee.p14\" class=\"\">Some years ago, a man knocked on my office door late at night and said, \u201cPresident, may I speak to you?

We sat across the corner of the desk, and he said, \u201cFour times I have driven over to the stake office and have seen your light on, and four times I have driven back home without coming in. But,\u201d he continued, \u201clast night I was reading in <span class=\"emphasis\">The Miracle of Forgiveness<\/span> again, and I realized that every major transgression must be confessed. I have come to confess a transgression. I have been on two high councils and have served as a bishop twice, and I believe the Lord called me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/forgive-them-i-pray-thee.p15\" class=\"\">I agreed, \u201cI\u2019m sure he called you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/forgive-them-i-pray-thee.p16\" class=\"\">He said, \u201cForty-two years ago, before my wife and I were married, we committed fornication once, the week prior to our going to the temple. We did not lie to the bishop, who was my wife\u2019s father; he simply talked with us and signed our recommends. We then went to the stake president, and he did not interview us. He signed our recommends, and we went to the temple unworthily. While we were on our honeymoon,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe decided to make it up to the Lord. We decided we would pay more than our share of tithing and more than our share of building fund; we would accept every assignment to the welfare farm and do all else we were asked to do. We decided we were not worthy to go to the temple, and we did not go for a year. It has been forty-two years since the transgression, and we have lived as near Christlike lives as we know how. I believe we have been forgiven, but I know that confession is necessary.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/forgive-them-i-pray-thee.p17\" class=\"\">Then he quoted from 2 Nephi 9:41 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4028\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4028)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4028)\">2 Ne. 9:41<\/a><\/span>], which states, \u201cBehold, the way for man is narrow, but it lieth in a straight course before him, and the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/forgive-them-i-pray-thee.p18\" class=\"\">Then he said, \u201cI would rather confess to you now.

Her eyes were wet from crying. She had probably told her husband she couldn\u2019t come in. He had insisted, telling her I would stay there all night. Finally, forty-five minutes later, she was at the door. I took her by both hands and led her across the room. I sat across the corner of the desk, and then I said, \u201cYour husband confessed to a transgression that happened over forty-two years ago of which you were a part. I want to make it easy for you.
