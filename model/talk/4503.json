His atonement brought about a greater destiny and a nobler concept for us. We are still commanded to sacrifice, but not by shedding blood of animals. Our highest sense of sacrifice is achieved as we make ourselves more sacred or holy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This we do by our obedience to the commandments of God. Thus, the laws of obedience and sacrifice are indelibly intertwined. Consider the commandments to obey the Word of Wisdom, to keep the Sabbath day holy, to pay an honest tithe. As we comply with these and other commandments, something wonderful happens to us. We become disciplined! We become disciples! We become more sacred and holy\u2014like our Lord!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I pay tribute to beloved ladies in my life who have taught sanctifying lessons to me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For a short time during the first year of our marriage, Sister Nelson maintained two jobs while I was in medical school. Before her paychecks had arrived, we found ourselves owing more than our funds could defray. So we took advantage of an option then available to sell blood at $25 a pint. In an interval between her daytime job as a schoolteacher and her evening work as a clerk in a music store, we went to the hospital and each sold a pint of blood. As the needle was withdrawn from her arm, she said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to pay tithing on my blood money.\u201d (When her mother learned I was bleeding her daughter between two jobs, I sensed at that time she may not have been too pleased with her new son-in-law.) Such obedience was a tremendous lesson to me. Sister Nelson\u2019s commitment to tithe became my commitment, too.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>You righteous daughters, never underestimate the influence for good you can exert upon your fathers. I haven\u2019t met a father yet who claimed to be perfect. So in his imperfection, stand steadfast in loving patience with your dad. Let me illustrate this point with a personal story.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Many years ago when our daughters were very young, Sister Nelson and I took them fishing. We were having a wonderful time. Everyone was catching fish. Then shades of Saturday night\u2019s darkness brought a curfew to our fun. So great was my enthusiasm for our success, I allowed myself to rationalize aloud with the girls. (Rationalization is one of the real obstacles to obedience.) Knowing that the next day was Sunday, I jokingly said, \u201cIf we get up tomorrow two hours earlier than normal, we could catch some more fish and then quit promptly at our usual wake-up hour.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Silence followed. My companion and our daughters all glared at me. Icy stillness was broken when our seven-year-old said, \u201cDaddy, would you eat those fish you caught on Sunday?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Then she added, \u201cWould you ask Heavenly Father to bless fish you caught on the Sabbath?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Needless to say, we did no fishing the next morning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Their commitment to the Sabbath became my commitment, too.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>So it is, dear daughters. As you obey each of God\u2019s commandments, your holiness will fortify the foundation of your fathers\u2019 faith. When the two of you are together spiritually, one plus one is clearly greater than two.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t    <span class=\"strong\">5.<\/span>\n\t  <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"strong\">Adam and Eve taught the gospel to their children.<\/span> Today, men and women still have that worthy work to do. But before you can teach, you must first learn of your premortal existence, the Creation, the Fall, the atonement of Christ, and the reason for mortality. Study the scriptures and internalize them. Teach faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Then let your commitment to the mission of the Church be evident in all you do. Preaching the gospel, perfecting the Saints, and redeeming members of your family will cause you to concentrate on covenants and ordinances of eternal significance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>As you exercise your agency, teach things that are elevating and useful. Teach the principles of honesty, self-reliance, avoidance of unnecessary debt. You will build a more stable society by so doing. And remember your example.
