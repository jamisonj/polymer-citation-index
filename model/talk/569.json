I pray that we will heed it and remember that we\nare living in a wicked world where men's hearts have turned from truth to untruth, from\nrighteousness to wickedness; when men are unrighteously ambitious, seeking for power; when\nthe liberties of the people are in danger. It behooves us as members of the Church to heed the\ncounsels that are given by those who stand as our leaders under Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful for the gospel, for all the privileges which are mine to give service, for the\nprivilege that is mine to honor my Maker and be a true servant to our Master, the Savior and\nRedeemer of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are all aware that we are in imminent danger&mdash;danger because Satan rages in the hearts\nof the people (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3543\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3543)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3543)\">2 Ne. 28:20<\/a><\/span>).\nThis has all been predicted, and the predictions are coming true. Antichrist is\ngaining power, and Satan has put into the hearts of the people&mdash;the majority of\nthem&mdash;greed, and the desire to dominate and take advantage of those who are weak.\n<\/p><p>\nOur duty is to keep the commandments of the Lord, to walk uprightly, to defend every\nprinciple of truth, to sustain and uphold the Constitution of this great country, to remember\nthe Declaration of Independence, for, as we heard this morning from our President, upon\nthese principles our country was based. They stand at the foundation, the cornerstones of the\nliberty that our fathers fought for, and which brought to pass according to the word of the\nLord, the redemption of this land by the shedding of blood.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is no other course for us to take but the course of righteousness and truth. An ancient\nprophet on this continent said, \". . . the natural man is an enemy to God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40242\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40242)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40242)\">Mosiah 3:19<\/a><\/span>).\nThe world today has become carnal, as much so now as in the beginning when Adam\nattempted to teach his children the principles of eternal truth, and Satan came among them\nand commanded them to believe it not.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd we read, \"From that time forth man became carnal, sensual, and devilish\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39009\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39009)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39009)\">Moses 5:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSurely we see these indications prevalent in our own land and in foreign lands. Men have\nbecome carnal. They have become enemies to God. They are seeking for their own\nadvancement and not for the advancement of the kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nLet me call your attention to this fact which you, of course, all know that we are living in the\nlast days, the days of trouble, days of wickedness, spoken of as days of wickedness several\nhundred years before the coming of Christ by Nephi, as it is recorded in the twenty-seventh\nchapter of Second Nephi.\n<\/p><p>\nBut, behold, in the last days, or in the days of the Gentiles&mdash;yea, behold all the nations of\nthe Gentiles and also the Jews both those who shall come upon this land and those who shall\nbe upon other lands yea, even upon all the lands of the earth, behold, they will be drunken\nwith iniquity and all manner of abominations.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd when that day shall come they shall be visited of the Lord of Hosts, with thunder and\nwith earthquake, and with a great noise, and with storm, and with tempest and with the flame\nof devouring fire (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3541\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3541)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3541)\">2 Ne. 27:1-2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat was said many hundreds of years before the birth of Christ. We are living in the days of\nthe Gentiles when this prediction was to be fulfilled. We see it being fulfilled, and we must\nremember, my good brethren and sisters, that members of the Church are not members of,\nand do not belong to the world.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the wonderful prayer of our Redeemer, as recorded in the seventeenth chapter of John&mdash;I\ncan hardly read this chapter without tears coming to my eyes&mdash;wherein our Lord, in praying\nto his Father in the tenderness of all his soul because he knew the hour had come for him to\noffer himself as a sacrifice, prayed for his disciples. In that prayer he said,\n<\/p><p>\nI pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them\nfrom the evil.\n<\/p><p>\nThey are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nSanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27532\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27532)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27532)\">John 17:15-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf we are living the religion which the Lord has revealed and which we have received, we do\nnot belong to the world. We should have no part in all its foolishness. We should not partake\nof its sins and its errors&mdash;errors of philosophy and errors of doctrine, errors in regard to\ngovernment, or whatever those errors may be&mdash;we have no part in it.\n<\/p><p>\nThe only part we have is the keeping of the commandments of God. That is all, being true to\nevery covenant and every obligation that we have entered into and taken upon ourselves.\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Kimball in his remarks this morning spoke of a man who could not quite understand\nwhen he paid his tithing and kept the Word of Wisdom, was prayerful, and tried to be\nobedient to all the commandments the Lord had given him, and yet he had to struggle to\nmake a living; while his neighbor violated the Sabbath day, I suppose he smoked and drank;\nhe had what the world would call a good time, he paid no attention to the teachings of our\nLord and Savior Jesus Christ, and yet he prospered.\n<\/p><p>\nYou know, we have a great many members of the Church that ponder that over in their hearts\nand wonder why. Why this man seems to be blessed with all the good things of the\nearth&mdash;incidentally, many of the bad things that he thinks are good&mdash;and yet so many members of\nthe Church are struggling, laboring diligently to try to make their way through the world.\n<\/p><p>\nThe answer is a simple thing. If I sometimes, and once in a while I do, go to a football game\nor a baseball game or some other place of amusement, invariably I will be surrounded by men\nand women who are puffing on cigarettes or cigars or dirty pipes. It gets very annoying, and I\nget a little disturbed. I will turn to Sister Smith, and I will say something to her, and she will\nsay, \"Well, now, you know what you have taught me. You are in <i>their<\/i> world. This is their\nworld.\" And that sort of brings me back to my senses. Yes, we are in their world, but we do\nnot have to be of it.\n<\/p><p>\nSo, as this is their world we are living in, they prosper, but, my good brethren and sisters,\ntheir world is coming to its end. It will not be many years. I can say that. I do not know how\nmany years, but Elijah said when he bestowed his keys: \". . . by this ye may know that the\ngreat and dreadful day of the Lord is near even at the doors\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13044\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13044)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13044)\">D&amp;C 110:16<\/a><\/span>). I am sure that\nover a hundred years later I can say that the end of this world is drawing to its end.\n<\/p><p>\nThe day will come when we will not have <i>this<\/i> world. It will be changed. We will get a better\nworld. We will get one that is righteous, because when Christ comes, he will cleanse the\nearth.\n<\/p><p>\nRead what is written in our scriptures. Read what he himself has said. When he comes, he\nwill cleanse this earth from all its wickedness\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12995\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12995)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12995)\">Moses 7:48<\/a><\/span>),\nand, speaking of the Church, he has said that\nhe would send his angels and they would gather out of his kingdom, which is the Church, all\nthings that offend (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34509\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34509)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34509)\">Matt. 13:41<\/a><\/span>).\nThen we are going to have a new earth, a new heaven\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12974\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12974)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12974)\">D&amp;C 29:23-24<\/a><\/span>).

I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
