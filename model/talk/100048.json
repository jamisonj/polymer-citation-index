When I first went forth to preach to the world I suffered a great deal in my feelings, probably as much as any man that ever attempted to preach. When I reflected upon my own inexperience I felt like a child, and I do today. For this reason I think much about those young men who have gone forth to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. They will feel the need of being assisted by the Almighty when they are traveling through the European countries. Part of them are under twenty years of age, and they will realize their dependence upon God more than ever they have done before. I was over thirty years old when I commenced preaching the Gospel, but they are all young and well adapted for learning, hence they have many advantages. In those early times we did not know one hundredth part of the principles of the Gospel that we now know; in fact, there was but very little revealed, and we had not learned to understand the Scriptures except to a very limited extent. We had a little understanding of what was already revealed and written in the revelations given through Joseph the Prophet. I look over these <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"239b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD10\/JoD10_0239.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;239b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/4137\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> things when I am thinking of those boys, and that is not all, I pray for them continually. I never bow before God without asking him in the name of his Son to remember those young men, and I know he will bless them with the power of his Spirit to guide them in the way of life. They do not know scarcely at present whether they understand much about the principles of the Gospel or not, and they will not really know until they have had some experience more than they had here at home. They are brought into a position where they will feel the necessity of calling upon God, and when they get home again they will find that they have had quite an experience, such an experience, too, as will be of lasting benefit to them. I used to think that anybody knew as much as I did, for I had very little confidence in myself, but I had confidence in God or I could not have preached at all. They will have just such feelings, and if they have any confidence at all it will be in God. Well, this is the case with most of us, and it is right; our confidence should be in him and not in ourselves, for without his assistance we are nothing and can do nothing towards the salvation of the human family. To be sure, the world are as ignorant as we were in relation to the Gospel of Christ, but we are the chosen of the Lord and he will support us in all our under<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"240a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD10\/JoD10_0240.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;240a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/4136\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>takings in righteousness.

There is not now one man brought to the knowledge of the truth by receiving the Gospel to where there was a hundred thirty years ago. It seems as though the people are blinder now than they were thirty years ago, and ignorance prevails to a greater extent than it did at that time. Jesus says, &#x201C;Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

It is the duty of every one to labor day by day to promote each other's happiness, and also to study the well-being of mankind. When we take a course opposite to this, we become uneasy, unhappy and discontented; we are not satisfied with anything that is around us; our food, our raiment, our habitations, and all that we possess becomes an annoyance to us; now what is the cause of this? It certainly does not originate with the Spirit of God, for that will never render anyone unhappy. You all understand, when you are in the right, that it is the spirit of the world, or that spirit which controls the world, which causes people to feel in this way; and unless they drive it far from them it will lead them down to sorrow, misery, and death. It is a spirit that inclines to kill and destroy, and that inclines the wicked to waste away everything there is upon the earth. The Saints should be particularly careful to avoid the influence of this spirit of destruction, for it is not of God, and we can all see now it leads mankind to destroy each other. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v10n1044\"> Jesus says, &#x201C;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"68703\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 68703)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(68703)\">John 3:3<\/a><\/span> It is very easy to understand that a man can see very little of a kingdom unless he goes into it, and a man to see and understand the kingdom of God must first become a member of the Church of Christ, and then he progresses until he has an opportunity of looking into the kingdom, of becoming acquainted with its officers and laws, and hence it is that Jesus says, &#x201C;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"68779\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 68779)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(68779)\">John 3:5<\/a><\/span> When the kingdom of God is organized upon the earth, it is done to protect the Church of Christ in its rights and privileges, so that you see the  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"241a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD10\/JoD10_0241.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;241a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/4135\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>Church makes a government to protect itself, but who knows what that government is?

Just let us look at these commandments, and then compare them with some of those given in our own day.

Among the revelations which we find in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants there is one which was given in Feb., 1831, in which is contained the general outlines of the law which is to govern the Latter-day Saints.

What can prevent us from obtaining a knowledge of things past and things to come? There is nothing to prevent even our little boys and little girls having these gifts and blessings, except it be a slackness on our part in our duties towards God. I know there is a slackness with many of this people; there is a spirit of division, of contention and strife creeping in among the Latter-day Saints, but still I am happy to know that with the majority there is a great improvement. I know also that those brethren that are engaged in assisting to gather the poor, their blessings will be great indeed; they will have a reward in the present and in the future. On the other hand it is a matter of regret that there are others who do not feel interested enough to make up their butter and carry a tenth of it into the Tithing Office. Some of them think it is too small a matter, others are indifferent and don't care anything about it, and thus a great many of the people neglect their tithes, and do not put them into the Lord's storehouse; hence the poor, the laborer upon the public works, and the families of our missionaries lack many of the comforts of life, which the people who are laboring exclusively for themselves constantly enjoy. I presume you all remember what Christ said in regard to the poor widow who gave her small donation at the treasury of the synagogue, but lest some of you should have forgotten it, I will remind you of it: &#x201C;And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"246b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD10\/JoD10_0246.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;246b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/4130\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.&#x201D;&#x2014;Mark 12. 41, 44.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"66653\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 66653)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(66653)\">Mark 12:41-44<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v10n1084\"> Let me now say to the Latter-day Saints, if you will cast in your tithes and your offerings you will be blessed with greater abundance; the Lord will open the windows of heaven and bestow upon you a greater blessing.

Many of the brethren in those trying times were clothed in skins of wild animals. I felt impressed to prophesy to them, and I said, &#x201C;Never mind, boys, in less than one year there will be plenty of clothes and everything that we shall want sold at less than St. Louis prices;&#x201D; and I thought when I came to reflect upon it that it was a very improbable thing, and brother Rich told me that he thought I had done up the job at prophesying that time, but the sequel showed the prediction to be of the Lord.
