I have elected to do so again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/repentance.p4\" class=\"\">In a school yard game, young boys sometimes form a circle, and one hits another on the shoulder and says, \u201cPass it on.\u201d The one who receives the blow obediently transmits it to the next in line and says, \u201cPass it on.\u201d The third recipient promptly punches a fourth, and each in succession thereafter, by \u201cpassing it on,\u201d tries to rid himself of his pain, and the responsibility for it, by inflicting it on another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/repentance.p5\" class=\"\">Many of us are like these schoolboys. Perhaps without realizing it, as adults we continue to play the same childish game and risk far more than a bruised shoulder in the process. Let me explain what I mean.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/repentance.p6\" class=\"\">Unwillingness to accept the responsibility for and consequences of one\u2019s actions is an all too common condition in today\u2019s world. Who has not heard of the drunken driver who sues his host for allowing him to get drunk, or of the accident victim who claims damages from the physician who tries to help him? Perpetrators of the most heinous crimes often plead guilty by reason of insanity or claim that they are victims of society\u2019s ills. The homeless blame alcohol. Alcoholics blame genetic deficiencies. Abusers and adulterers blame the broken homes of their childhood. And there are enough who agree with them to ensure that no one need feel terribly guilty for long if they don\u2019t want to.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/repentance.p7\" class=\"\">The habit of shifting the burden of guilt onto someone else, while perhaps understandable in a secular setting, has more serious consequences in a spiritual one.

Rather than getting out of a vicious and senseless circle, we fault our neighbor for our pain and try to pass it on. But to repent we must leave the circle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/repentance.p13\" class=\"\">The first step in the repentance process has always been simply to recognize that we have done wrong. If we are so hedged about by pride, rationalization, machismo, or a misdirected sense of self-esteem as to prevent us from ever admitting that we are part of the problem, we are in trouble. We then may not even know of our need to repent. We will have no idea whether the Lord is pleased with us or not and may become \u201cpast feeling.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2003\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2003)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2003)\">1 Ne. 17:45<\/a><\/span>.)

This not only means that we will not be punished for what Adam did in the Garden, but also that we cannot excuse our own behavior by pointing a finger to Adam or anyone else. The real danger in failing to accept responsibility for our own actions is that unless we do, we may never even enter on the strait and narrow path. Misconduct that does not require repentance may be pleasant at first, but it will not be for long. And it will never lead us to eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/repentance.p15\" class=\"\">Just as foolish as believing that we can \u201cpass it on\u201d is the idea that the satisfaction of being in the circle, whatever that may be, can somehow excuse any wrongs committed there. This notion is widely shared and is most often expressed by the phrase, \u201cThe end justifies the means.\u201d Such a belief, if left undisturbed and unchecked, can also impede the repentance process and cheat us out of exaltation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/repentance.p16\" class=\"\">Those who teach it are almost always attempting to excuse the use of improper or questionable means. Such people seem to be saying, \u201cMy purpose was to do good or to be happy; therefore, any little lie, or misrepresentation, or lapse of integrity, or violation of law along the way is justified.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/repentance.p17\" class=\"\">In certain circumstances, some say it is \u201cokay\u201d to conceal the truth, to dig just a small pit for an adversary, to pursue an advantage of some kind\u2014such as superior knowledge or position\u2014against another. \u201cThis is just common practice,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m just looking after Number One,\u201d they say. \u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and war,\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s the way the ball bounces,\u201d they say.

They often cite Nephi\u2019s killing of Laban as an example of the need to violate a law to accomplish a greater good and to prevent a nation from dwindling in unbelief. But they forget that Nephi twice refused to follow the promptings of the Spirit.
