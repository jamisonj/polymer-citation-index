(2) Fear: Mature missionaries need not fear tracting or learning a new language. Much can be contributed using talents already acquired. Missionaries can venture into another language situation knowing that they will learn what they need to know without demanding fluency of themselves. They will learn some of their mission language and find joy in using each new expression.  (3) Fitness: While a risk-free environment cannot be guaranteed either at home or in the mission field, appropriate provisions can be made for proper diet and exercise. Routine needs for physical care can generally be met in the mission field. In the event of an emergency, evacuation, if advisable, is possible.  (4) Families: Children and grandchildren of senior missionaries will be blessed because of their service. To a missionary the Lord provided this promise: \u201cBehold, you have had many afflictions because of your family; nevertheless, I will bless you and your family, yea, your little ones; and the day cometh that they will believe and know the truth and be one with you in my church\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43927\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43927)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43927)\">D&amp;C 31:2<\/a><\/span>).

Parents of 9 grown children and grandparents of 20 grandchildren, they now serve in a remote part of Chile, working in a small branch. They make frequent visits among less-active members and with families recently converted to the Church. These visits provide opportunity for the Poelmans to read with those families and bear testimony of temple blessings. In their mission branches, they have also taught people how to conduct music and play simplified versions of the hymns on small electronic keyboards. Elder and Sister Poelman recently wrote: \u201cBaptism is only the first step in conversion. When the initial excitement subsides and the new converts continue facing the need to work long hours just to put bread on the table, they need others to help them who share the joy of the gospel. That is our specialty. Part of our work is preventive\u2014staying close to new converts. Yet others who rarely attend meetings have not lost conviction and receive our messages gratefully. As we watch the changes brought about in the lives of those we visit, we feel blessed to be receiving constant tutoring and help from the Lord in this work and, at the same time, to know that our family members back home are vicariously sharing our calling and those special blessings.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-24911_000_027\">6<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[Personal letter, dated 29 June 2004.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/senior-missionaries-and-the-gospel.p10\" class=\"\">Such marvelous couples are engaged in the work of reclaiming souls who have previously made covenants to take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/senior-missionaries-and-the-gospel.p11\" class=\"\">Other missionary couples render service in sacred temples of the Church. Elder Kenneth and Sister Barbara Willits, for instance, serve in the Accra Ghana Temple. They developed a special love for the people of Ghana while serving there as missionaries more than two decades earlier. They are energetic and enthusiastic converts of 50 years, with 3 children, 16 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren. They perform the exalting ordinances of the temple. Brother Willits serves as a sealer. On several occasions they have been pleasantly surprised to meet members whom they had previously encountered during their first mission. Recently Elder Willits performed the sealing of a husband and wife that they had taught in 1982, and to that couple, Elder Willits sealed four of their deceased children. Elder and Sister Willits write: \u201cOur willingness to leave our family and home is motivated by the temple covenants we have made, and our deepest desire is to become an eternal family. Our family is fully supportive as we serve, and they share in many blessings we have received. We are humbly grateful for the privilege of assisting others to receive their temple blessings.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-24911_000_027\">7<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[Personal letter, received 28 June 2004.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/senior-missionaries-and-the-gospel.p12\" class=\"\">Courageous and caring couples like Elder and Sister Willits enable and enrich the work done in many of our temples across the earth.

There we also met with the missionaries, among whom were several stalwart senior couples.

Speaking with a slight and sweet German accent, they recounted the difficult days of World War II and the subsequent Soviet occupation. They spoke of their many deprivations. Finding the Lord\u2019s true Church and later immigrating to America were counted as treasured blessings. The ensuing years brought them five healthy children, along with spiritual and financial increase. They felt that serving a mission would be a good way for them to show gratitude to the Lord. They expressed a deep desire to serve in Eastern Europe. Their call came to serve in the Ukraine Kiev Mission. Elder and Sister Hegewald write: \u201cNow, close to the end of our mission in the land of our former enemy, we are thankful for the opportunity to teach and love the Ukrainian people. As we have served the Lord, our souls have been healed and our family has become more united.

(2) Fear: Mature missionaries need not fear tracting or learning a new language. Much can be contributed using talents already acquired. Missionaries can venture into another language situation knowing that they will learn what they need to know without demanding fluency of themselves. They will learn some of their mission language and find joy in using each new expression.  (3) Fitness: While a risk-free environment cannot be guaranteed either at home or in the mission field, appropriate provisions can be made for proper diet and exercise. Routine needs for physical care can generally be met in the mission field. In the event of an emergency, evacuation, if advisable, is possible.  (4) Families: Children and grandchildren of senior missionaries will be blessed because of their service. To a missionary the Lord provided this promise: \u201cBehold, you have had many afflictions because of your family; nevertheless, I will bless you and your family, yea, your little ones; and the day cometh that they will believe and know the truth and be one with you in my church\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43927\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43927)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43927)\">D&amp;C 31:2<\/a><\/span>).
