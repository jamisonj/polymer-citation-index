His subject was \u201cGood Books of the Nineteenth Century.\u201d In the course of his remarks he said, \u201cThe greatest book published in the nineteenth century in the field of religion was the Book of Mormon.

It has done what the Prophet Joseph said it would do. It has divided men into two camps\u2014those who are for it and those who are against it. There have [possibly] been more books written against it than against any book ever published in America. \u2026 On the shelves of the Church Library in the Church Office Building there are more than 1,500 [anti-Mormon] books, each of which, in a portion of its pages, makes an attack on the Book of Mormon. Fifteen hundred volumes by fifteen hundred separate authors. Of those fifteen hundred probably only two ever reached a second edition. \u2026\u201d (William E.

They have given up their occupations, their countries.

Mr. Hastings was a Baptist minister in New Mexico during the depression days in the early 1930s. After one of his revival meetings, someone gave him a Book of Mormon which he took home and placed on the shelf. About five years later he picked it up and started to read it. After he had read it through, he testified to his family it was true. The next weekend he went to Springerville, Arizona, to find a member of the Church who could teach him more. It was only a few weeks until he and his family were baptized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-book-of-mormon.p30\" class=\"\">Brother and Sister Hastings and their family appeared in our little branch in Oklahoma City in mid-1939.

He gave a Book of Mormon to one of his associates in business. He soon retired from the company and heard nothing from this former associate for several years. When he saw him again, the friend said, \u201cPossibly you\u2019d like to know what happened to your Book of Mormon? I haven\u2019t read it, but many of my family have, and there are now nineteen of my family members in your church as a result of reading it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-book-of-mormon.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cI took the book home and put it on the shelf. One night as my mother was babysitting for us, she saw the book and began to read it. When we came home, she asked us about it.
