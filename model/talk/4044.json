Many thousands participated in that conference, which was carried across the continent from coast to coast. It was an inspirational experience to look into the faces of those assembled in the Tabernacle on that occasion\u2014women of beauty, women of strength, women of capacity, women of virtue, women of faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p5\" class=\"\">Last night, similarly, there emanated from the Tabernacle a great gathering of the priesthood, a meeting which was carried from here to 714 other locations across the world and to 900 stake centers in which were assembled men and boys of the Church who love the Lord and walk with faith and conviction. What a marvelous thing this work is, my beloved brethren and sisters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p6\" class=\"\">It is a great honor to stand before you and speak to Latter-day Saints across the world. I pray for direction of the Holy Spirit. I am not here as a substitute for the President of the Church. I am speaking as his Second Counselor, a responsibility I did not seek but one which I have accepted as a sacred call, in the fulfillment of which I have tried to lift some of the heavy burdens of office from the shoulders of our beloved President and move forward the work of the Lord with diligence. President Kimball is the prophet of the Lord. None other can or will take his place for so long as he lives. When he passes, there will be another ready, a man who, through long years of experience and service, has been trained, has been tested, has been schooled and refined and prepared to fill that sacred and awesome responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p7\" class=\"\">I wish to report to the membership of the Church wherever you may be that the work is going well. I feel that our Father in Heaven smiles upon it with approval. I realize, of course, that each of us, regardless of our position, could do better in our responsibilities. We ought constantly to be improving. Nonetheless, there is cause for satisfaction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p8\" class=\"\">The missionary work moves forward, with new fields opened since we last met in conference. The activity of Church members throughout the world improves. The vast work of genealogical research is being expanded, and an ever-increasing number of faithful Latter-day Saints carry forward the sacred work in the temples.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p9\" class=\"\">We are building new houses of worship on an unprecedented scale. Economies of construction have been developed to hold down the cost of these structures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p10\" class=\"\">Three new temples have been dedicated since last we met\u2014one in Boise, Idaho; one in Sydney, Australia; and, most recently, one in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. Tens of thousands of Latter-day Saints have participated in these inspiring dedicatory services. In the Boise Temple, twenty- four individual services were held, with a great outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord in each. Numerous were the expressions of appreciation. In Australia it was the same. People came to the temple from as far away as Tasmania in the south, and from Thursday Island in the far north; they came across the entire continent, from Perth on the west coast, many of them at great sacrifice, to enjoy the wonderful atmosphere of that significant occasion when fourteen dedicatory services were held.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p11\" class=\"\">We returned only a few days ago from Manila in the Philippines. There on an eminence where the ground falls away to the rear, affording a view of an entire valley, stands a beautiful and sacred temple. Here, as elsewhere, there is incised in the stone of one of the towers the words \u201cHoliness to the Lord. The House of the Lord.\u201d By the thousands they came, the wonderful, faithful members of the Church in the Republic of the Philippines. With songs of thanksgiving, with words of counsel and testimony, with a prayer of dedication, they all joined in presenting to the Lord, as the gift of a thankful people, this beautiful house as his abode.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p12\" class=\"\">In all of these new temples, the buildings have been opened to the general public prior to dedication. Tens and tens of thousands have gone through them. They have been free to ask any questions concerning them. These visitors have been respectful and reverent as they have partaken of the spirit of these sacred structures. As they have felt of that spirit and learned something of the purposes for which the temples have been built, these who have been our guests have recognized why, following dedication, we regard these buildings as sanctified and holy, reserved for sacred purposes and closed to the public.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p13\" class=\"\">Participating in these dedicatory services, one senses the true strength of the Church. That strength is in the hearts of the people, who are united by a bond of recognition of God as our Eternal Father and Jesus Christ as our Savior. Their individual testimonies are firmly established on a foundation of faith concerning things divine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p14\" class=\"\">In each new temple we have had a cornerstone ceremony in harmony with a tradition that goes back to ancient times. Before the general use of concrete, the foundation walls of the building were laid with large stones. A trench would be dug, and stones would be placed as footings. Starting at a point of beginning, the foundation wall would be run in one direction to a cornerstone; then the corner would be turned and the wall run to the next corner, where another stone was placed, from which the wall would be run to the next corner, and from there to the point of beginning. In many instances, including the construction of early temples in the Church, cornerstones were used at each junction point of the walls and put in place with ceremony. The final stone was spoken of as the chief cornerstone, and its placement became the reason for much celebration. With this cornerstone in position, the foundation was ready for the superstructure. Hence the analogy that Paul used in describing the true church:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cNow therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cIn whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21962\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21962)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21962)\">Eph. 2:19\u201321<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p18\" class=\"\">We have basic cornerstones on which this great latter-day church has been established by the Lord and built, \u201cfitly framed together.\u201d They are absolutely fundamental to this work, the very foundation, anchors on which it stands. I should like to speak briefly of these four essential cornerstones which anchor The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I mention first the chief cornerstone, whom we recognize and honor as the Lord Jesus Christ. The second is the vision given the Prophet Joseph Smith when the Father and the Son appeared to him. The third is the Book of Mormon, which speaks as a voice from the dust with the words of ancient prophets declaring the divinity and reality of the Savior of mankind. The fourth is the priesthood with all of its powers and authority, whereby men act in the name of God in administering the affairs of his kingdom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-cornerstones-of-our-faith.p19\" class=\"\">May I comment on each of these. Absolutely basic to our faith is our testimony of Jesus Christ as the Son of God, who under a divine plan was born in Bethlehem of Judea. He grew in Nazareth as the carpenter\u2019s son, within him the elements of both mortality and immortality received, respectively, from his earthly mother and his Heavenly Father. In the course of his brief earthly ministry, he walked the dusty roads of Palestine healing the sick, causing the blind to see, raising the dead, teaching doctrines both transcendent and beautiful. He was, as Isaiah had prophesied, \u201ca man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25601\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25601)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25601)\">Isa. 53:3<\/a><\/span>.)
