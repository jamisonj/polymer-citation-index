Brown, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1970, pp. 77-80<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brethren and sisters, it is a joy to be home again. After a globe-encircling journey, which\nresults often in a better understanding of the peoples of other lands and cultures, I return with an\nincreased appreciation of our own beloved America, its freedoms, and its opportunities.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Hunger for truth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my impression also that people of all lands and cultures have an increasing hunger for truth\nand an open-minded attitude toward new truths. Thinking men everywhere are seeking for light.\nThere is, in fact, a worldwide quest for truth.\n<\/p><p>\nLeaders in both religious and scientific fields are asking for a revival of learning and a\nbroad-minded attitude toward truth&mdash;wherever it may be found. Let me remind you, however,\nthat broad-mindedness too often is nothing but a flattening out of high-mindedness!\n<\/p><p>\nThe good life is a life that is pursued intelligently, toward the cultivation of genuine spirituality\nthat is grounded in faith and knowledge, that is dedicated to truth.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The glory of God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFaith is the ground of all religion, but there is no special virtue in blind faith. Only faith that is\ngrounded in a courageous search for truth is worthy of the student. We should reject every\ntemptation to irrationality, overcome every inclination to disregard or distort the facts, avoid the\nextremes of fanaticism, and above all else, demand the truth. Here is the firm foundation for our\nreligion&mdash;a religion that describes the glory of God as intelligence (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15617\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15617)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15617)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span>) and proclaims that man is\nsaved no faster than he gains knowledge.\n<\/p><p>\nJust as the truths of science must be tested and verified by reason and factual investigation, so\nthe moral and spiritual truths which the world is seeking from its prophets must be proved and\nvalidated in the experience of men. In his search for truth, every man must be true to himself. He\nmust answer to his own reason and to his own moral conscience. Anything less than this would\nbetray his dignity as a human being and a child of God. True dignity is never won by place, and\nit is never lost when honors are withdrawn.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Endurance of truth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nEspecially in the realms of spiritual and religious\nendeavor where faith ventures into untried fields, truth must meet the test of unbelief and endure\nthe fires of persecution, opposition, rejection, and hatred. Truth crushed to earth shall rise again.\n<\/p><p>\nPerhaps it was this thought of the permanence and eternal endurance of truth which prompted\nOliver Wendell Holmes to write his illuminating poetic essay on \"The Battle for Survival of\nNewborn Truths.\" He said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"The time is wracked with birth pangs,<br \/>\n     Every hour brings forth some gasping truth,<br \/>\n     And truth, newborn, looks a misshapen, and untimely growth,<br \/>\n     The terror of the household, and its shame,<br \/>\n     A monster coiling in its nurse's lap<br \/>\n     That some would strangle, some would only starve,<br \/>\n     But still it breathes, and passed from hand to hand,<br \/>\n     And suckled at a hundred half-clad breasts,<br \/>\n     Comes slowly to its stature and its form,<br \/>\n     Calms the rough ridges of its dragon scales,<br \/>\n     Changes to shining locks its snaky hair, <br \/>\n     And moves transfigured into angel guise, <br \/>\n     Welcomed by all who cursed its hour of birth <br \/>\n     And folded in the same encircling arms<br \/>\n     That cast it like a serpent from their hold.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Newly revealed truth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nLet us discuss some newly revealed truth&mdash;truth that has had just such a reception and\nexperience as the poet mentions, for it was thought to be \"a misshapen and an untimely growth.\"\nYet it is coming to its stature and its form, and its truth will move transfigured yet into angel\nguise.\n<\/p><p>\nThe somewhat melancholy history of the past seems to have been a necessary forerunner to those\ngreat events which we now proclaim. The passing of the sun of time beyond the meridian, after\nthe crucifixion of Christ, was followed by the twilight and the sunset, and then centuries of\ndarkness, after which the signs of dawn appear. The morning breaks, the shadows flee.\n<\/p><p>\nHow gloriously the Lord has kept his promise that in the latter days he would pour out his Spirit\nupon all flesh!\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A marvelous age<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a marvelous age is this in which we live! What tremendous advancement has been made\nwithin the last 150 years!\n<\/p><p>\nIn the fields of communication and transportation alone, we have made such strides as would\ncause our ancestors, if they could come and see us, to say that we were gods. They would be\nstunned by radio and television and the marvelous achievements of science, the harnessing of\nelectricity and other powers by which we bring to servitude the great forces of nature which in\ntheir day men feared and were wont to worship.\n<\/p><p>\nBut lest we be given to boasting of these great events and achievements, we should be reminded\nof how they are being used, and of what is happening in this world of ours by the very things\nwhich our civilization has produced. Hunger and want, misery and woe seem to be spreading\nthrough the world, threatening the very civilization that has made these things possible. It seems\nthat God's great plan included work for a wrecking crew, to tear down the old structure and\nmake room for that which is to come. But let not those who are responsible for these things be\ncomforted in this thought, for God has said: \"It is impossible but that offenses will come: but woe\nunto him, through whom they come!\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31809\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31809)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31809)\">Luke 17:1<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Spiritual enlightenment<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nBut are we to look for great advancement in these fields of human thought and activity alone,\nwhere material things seemingly are glorified and the spiritual things forgotten? Or may we\nexpect in fields of moral growth and spiritual enlightenment to find new truth and revelation\nfrom God?
