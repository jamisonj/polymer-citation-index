The early members of the Church brought with them many customs, traditions, and practices from their earlier beliefs. Not all of these practices conformed to the will of the Lord. In a revelation given in May 1831, He explained to the elders of the Church how to discern and decide which of these practices were appropriate. He referred to both sides of the issue of teaching and receiving. Not only must we teach by the Spirit, we must receive by the Spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/what-is-truth.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd again, he that receiveth the word of truth, doth he receive it by the Spirit of truth or some other way?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/what-is-truth.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cIf it be some other way it is not of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19217\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19217)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19217)\">D&amp;C 50:19\u201320<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/what-is-truth.p8\" class=\"\">If we do not receive the truth by His spirit, it is not His word.

He said he had discovered the Book of Mormon was not the word of God and that Joseph Smith was not a prophet of God. He then proceeded to quote articles and books which were written by enemies of the Church. As he listed his sources, I replied that I also had read them and others, and they had only served to confirm my faith in the Book of Mormon and the Prophet Joseph Smith. He was surprised that I could have read the same things he had read and not believe as he believed. I suggested that he devote at least equal time to the right side of the issue, but he had come with a decision, not a question. His mind was made up. He did not want to know. His heart was closed. I thought of the children of Israel and their reaction to the Lord after he had guided them out of bondage: \u201cAnd notwithstanding they being led, the Lord their God, their Redeemer, going before them, leading them by day and giving light unto them by night, and doing all things for them which were expedient for man to receive, they hardened their hearts and blinded their minds, and reviled against Moses and against the true and living God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1984\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1984)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1984)\">1 Ne. 17:30<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/what-is-truth.p12\" class=\"\">The promise of the Lord with regard to his word and his works is very explicit: \u201cIf any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29472\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29472)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29472)\">John 7:17<\/a><\/span>.)
