I can visualize grandfathers, fathers, bishops, deacons, teachers, and priests seated together, some as families or quorums; also full-time missionaries, students, and new converts\u2014all bearers of the Holy Priesthood of God. And beyond this historical Salt Lake Tabernacle are hundreds more such assemblies of priesthood bearers anxiously awaiting encouragement and instruction from our prophet and his noble counselors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/spiritual-crevasses.p5\" class=\"\">This past summer, Clarence Neslen, Jr., took his family to Jasper National Park in Alberta, Canada. They enjoyed exploring the Columbia Icefields, jumping over crevasses in the famous Athabasca Glacier. It was an exciting experience until eleven-year-old Cannon, attempting to jump across a crevasse, missed and fell into the deep chasm. He became wedged between the walls of ice. As his father looked down some thirty feet to where his son was trapped, he was further alarmed as he saw a river of icy water flowing beneath the crevasse.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/spiritual-crevasses.p6\" class=\"\">Several young men were also exploring the glacier. They heard the cries for help and came running. They had a small rope but soon realized that it was not strong enough to pull Cannon to safety. If it broke, Cannon would most assuredly fall into the rushing river of freezing water.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/spiritual-crevasses.p7\" class=\"\">Sister Neslen and others ran to a nearby lodge for help. The nearest park ranger camp was seventy-five miles away. They learned by telephone that two park rangers were near the icefields. Located by radio, they rushed to the rescue. Time was short, decisions urgent, and silent prayers were sent heavenward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/spiritual-crevasses.p8\" class=\"\">Brother Neslen tried to calm his son and soothe his fears. Hypothermia was setting in. Young Cannon\u2019s shirt had been pushed up as he fell. His bare skin was now pressed against the cold walls of the glacier. To keep his son from unconsciousness, the father called down to him to keep praying, to wiggle his fingers and toes, and to sing his favorite songs. Over and over Cannon sang, \u201cI am a child of God, and he has sent me here, has given me an earthly home with parents kind and dear\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 301). All were strengthened by Cannon\u2019s faith and determination. But he was beginning to weaken. His father kept assuring him that help would soon arrive and that his Heavenly Father would hear his prayers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/spiritual-crevasses.p9\" class=\"\">The two rangers arrived. Spikes were driven into the ice, and ropes were attached to a ranger, who was lowered to rescue Cannon. But the walls were too narrow for him. Their only chance was to lower a looped rope and pray he was alert enough to grasp it and then have the strength to hold on as they tried to pull him out.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/spiritual-crevasses.p10\" class=\"\">Brother Neslen offered the most fervent prayer of his life, he said. He pleaded with the Lord to save his son\u2019s life. \u201cA feeling of assurance and calm came over me,\u201d he said, \u201cand I knew that he would be saved.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/spiritual-crevasses.p11\" class=\"\">Cannon had lapsed into unconsciousness. His father called down encouragement, rousing his son sufficiently that Cannon\u2019s icy fingers now were able to catch hold of the rope. \u201cHold on with all of your might!\u201d his father called down to him. Cannon was carefully pulled up\u2014inch by inch, foot by foot\u2014all thirty feet. When he was finally pulled to safety, he was unconscious. His fingers had miraculously frozen around the rope and had to be pried loose.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/spiritual-crevasses.p12\" class=\"\">He was immediately wrapped in blankets and rushed to a waiting ambulance, but there was not enough warmth to raise his body temperature sufficiently. A paramedic undressed Cannon, then took off his own coat and shirt and held Cannon against his bare chest so that his body heat would radiate to the boy. Cannon slowly responded to the loving care of his rescuers. The prayers of all had been answered.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/spiritual-crevasses.p13\" class=\"\">Young Cannon Neslen, a newly ordained deacon, is here in this audience tonight. We thank our Father in Heaven that his life was spared. He was spared for a purpose. He told his father that, while wedged in the ice, he felt a comforting assurance that he would be saved. He knows God loves him and that He has a special mission for him to perform in this life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/spiritual-crevasses.p14\" class=\"\">Not unlike Cannon Neslen, who accidentally fell into a crevasse, some of your friends\u2014and perhaps even some of you\u2014have slipped into spiritual crevasses.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/spiritual-crevasses.p15\" class=\"\">Spiritual crevasses symbolize the temptations and pitfalls that too many of our youth are tragically encountering: alcohol, with its wine coolers and keg parties, drug tampering and dependency, R- and X-rated films and videos, which often culminate in sexual immorality. On the edge of those ominous crevasses are parents and others who, with fervent prayers, cry for help and assistance. Like Cannon\u2019s father, they, too, pray that their sons or daughters will hold on to the extended lifeline. Their love, and the teachings of the scriptures and the assurance of the eternal blessings of the Savior\u2019s atonement, are sure lifelines to safety.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/spiritual-crevasses.p16\" class=\"\">Youth are not the only ones who slip into crevasses.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/spiritual-crevasses.p17\" class=\"\">A stake president recently told me that a respected member who had held Church leadership positions was enticed by some business friends to try the cocaine drug \u201ccrack.\u201d The men were depressed.
