According to the word of the Lord, they belong to \". . . the only true and\nliving church upon the face of the whole earth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13072\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13072)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13072)\">D&amp;C 1:30<\/a><\/span>). This Church has within it\nthe power of the priesthood with all the ordinances of the gospel and doctrines necessary to\nbring its members back into the presence of God and give them exaltation. Members of the\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are heirs not only to the celestial glory but also to\nexaltation or eternal life in that glory; and that heirship shall be obtained if they keep all the\ncommandments given by Jesus Christ to members of his kingdom. Thus, the words of Paul\napply very aptly to the Latter-day Saints: \n<\/p><p>\nEye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the\nthings which God hath prepared for them that love him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"225\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 225)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(225)\">1 Cor. 2:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nCertainly all the things that this world could offer would not be comparable if attained to the\nreceiving of eternal life which God promises to members of his kingdom; for he has declared\nthat \". . . eternal life . . . is the greatest of all the gifts of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13085\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13085)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13085)\">D&amp;C 14:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOn a certain occasion, the Savior said: \n<\/p><p>\nFor what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what\nshall a man give in exchange for his soul?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34579\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34579)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34579)\">Matt. 16:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn answering those questions for the members of the Church, I would say there is nothing that\nthis world offers which would be equal to the eternal exaltation which God promises those\nwho love him; nor is there anything in this world which we would give for our souls.\n<\/p><p>\nYet I do recognize the fact, also, that there are many temptations in mortality which we have,\nand some of the Latter-day Saints, as a result of these temptations, fall into sin and thereby\nexchange their souls for the things of this world; for example, the desire to attain wealth,\nposition, or power, accompanied by greed, selfishness, covetousness, and other earthly\ncontaminations, cause some Latter-day Saints to lose their souls. The Savior has warned\nagainst covetousness; he said: \n<\/p><p>\nTake heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of\nthe things which he possesseth.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth\nplentifully: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to\nbestow my fruits?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I\nbestow all my fruits and my goods.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine\nease, eat, drink, and be merry.\n<\/p><p>\nBut God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose\nshall those things be, which thou hast provided?\n<\/p><p>\nSo is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31335\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31335)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31335)\">Luke 12:15-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd, we could say, so shall it be with the Saints in our day who love gold more than they\nlove God.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are all very familiar with the incident recorded in the New Testament wherein the rich\nyoung ruler came to the Master and asked what he must do to gain eternal life. After the\nSavior had listed many of the commandments to him, the young ruler said, \"All these things\nhave I kept from my youth up.\" And then the Savior, knowing of his weakness, said, \"If thou\nwilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure\nin heaven: and come and follow me\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34586\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34586)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34586)\">Matt. 19:20-21<\/a><\/span>). And the rich young man went\naway sorrowing, because he had much goods. He was not willing to exchange his earthly\ngoods for his eternal soul; neither was he willing to follow the Savior's admonition wherein\nhe said: \n<\/p><p>\nLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt and where\nthieves break through and steal: \n<\/p><p>\nBut lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and\nwhere thieves do not break through nor steal: \n<\/p><p>\nFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34550\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34550)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34550)\">Matt. 6:19-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI do not believe that the Savior objects to Latter-day Saints becoming wealthy, if they use that\nwealth as they should. God wants his children to have the good things of the world, if we use\nthat wealth to pay our tithing, and fast offerings, to send out missionaries, to build church\nhouses, and to help build up the kingdom of God here upon this earth in every way; but he\nwarned against the evil effects that wealth might have on members of his\nChurch. Those who use their wealth for the building of the kingdom of God are following the\nSavior's admonition to\n<\/p><p>\n. . . seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be\nadded unto you (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34557\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34557)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34557)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThroughout various dispensations of the gospel, the Lord has placed it upon those who have\nwealth to \"remember the poor.\" In the latter days he gave definite commandments to members\nof the Church of Jesus Christ in this respect; and he gave these commandments in strong\nterminology. Let me quote from the Doctrine and Covenants: \n<\/p><p>\nWo unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, for your riches will\ncanker your souls; and this shall be your lamentation in the day of visitation and of judgment,\nand of indignation: The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved!\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13119\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13119)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13119)\">D&amp;C 56:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOn another occasion, the Savior revealed in modern days: \n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his\nportion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy, he shall, with the\nwicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13166\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13166)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13166)\">D&amp;C 104:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, what is meant by the law of his gospel? The law of his gospel, in this respect, no\ndoubt, is fast offerings the Church, welfare contributions, probably tithing, and the other\ncontributions that God has provided in his Church to take care of the needy and the poor, and\nto build up his kingdom here upon this earth. No Latter-day Saint who refuses to contribute\nhis share in carrying forward the work of the Lord will be found guiltless at the judgment\nday.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, what shall the Latter-day Saint give in exchange for his soul? The Lord has given to us\nthe Sabbath day law. In latter days he commanded: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the\nhouse of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13124\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13124)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13124)\">D&amp;C 59:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd yet on the Sabbath day there are many Latter-day Saints who go to picture shows, who\ngo to ball games, who go car riding, who work on their lots, and in these and numerous other\nways contaminate themselves with the sins of the world, and thereby exchange their souls for\nimproper Sabbath day observance and its accompanying vices.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has given a great law for the physical and spiritual health of his children, known as\nthe Word of Wisdom. Paul, the ancient Apostle, declared: \n<\/p><p>\nKnow ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?\n<\/p><p>\nIf any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy,\nwhich temple ye are (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"227\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 227)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(227)\">1 Cor. 3:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThus, as Paul proclaimed, our bodies are temples of God, given to us that we might keep\nthem clean, pure, and uncontaminated in all respects, that some day we might come back with\nour bodies into the presence of our eternal Maker and have them purified and exalted. So the\nthings that we do that will contaminate our bodies certainly work against the saving of our\nsouls. Would any women who belong to the true Church be foolish enough to drink tea and\nthereby contaminate their bodies? Would others among us drink coffee, use liquor or tobacco,\nand thereby exchange the gratifying of these physical appetites for our eternal souls? Foolish,\nindeed, would be such people, to say the least.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord also gave the great law of chastity in ancient times, saying, \"Thou shalt not commit\nadultery\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22638\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22638)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22638)\">Ex. 20:14<\/a><\/span>).\nSpeaking of sex immorality, Alma said to his son: \n<\/p><p>\nKnow ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most\nabominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy\nGhost? (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8937\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8937)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8937)\">Alma 39:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn modern revelation, the Lord has reaffirmed the commandment: \"Thou shalt not commit\nadultery\" (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"13112\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13112)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13112)\">D&amp;C 42:24<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13122\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13122)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13122)\">D&amp;C 59:6<\/a><\/span>).\nWe read in the Doctrine and Covenants, also: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd verily I say unto you, as I have said before, he that looketh on a woman to lust after her,\nor if any shall commit adultery in their hearts, they shall not have the Spirit, but shall deny\nthe faith and shall fear.\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, I, the Lord, have said that the fearful, and the unbelieving, and all liars, and\nwhosoever loveth and maketh a lie, and the whoremonger, and the sorcerer, shall have their\npart in that lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death.\n<\/p><p>\nVerily I say, that they shall not have part in the first resurrection\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13127\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13127)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13127)\">D&amp;C 63:16-18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWith such doctrine revealed by the Lord directly to us, we know, as Latter-day Saints, that if\nwe commit adultery and if we continue to satisfy the lusts of the flesh, so to speak, by living\nthat kind of life, we shall be thrust down to hell. Thus, we thereby sell our souls for the\ngratification of the lust of the flesh. Let me ask you, is sex immorality worth such an\nexorbitant price?\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has also given the great law of celestial marriage, which is the crowning gospel\nprinciple, giving the promise that those who abide by that law and keep the other\ncommandments shall rise in the resurrection and receive exaltation or eternal life which he\ndeclares is the greatest gift that he has in store for man.\n<\/p><p>\nEven after receiving such a glorious promise, there are many Latter-day Saints who refuse to\nabide by the law of celestial marriage, refusing to go to the temple and enter into God's holy\ncovenant. And why do they refuse? For various reasons.\n<\/p><p>\nWould there be some members of the Church foolish enough to refuse to go to the temple\nbecause they did not want to wear garments for the short space of life in mortality? If there\nare members of the kingdom of God so unwise, certainly we would say, such a choice would\nbe a very foolish one, indeed. Or would there be some among us who would refuse to pay\ntithing and fast offerings to the Lord, who would disregard God's law of health by breaking\nthe Word of Wisdom, who would defile their bodies by not observing the law of chastity, or\nbreak God's other commandments and thereby cut themselves off from the blessings of the\npriesthood, from the blessings of the temple, and ultimately from exaltation? The truth\nremains that there are such unwise people who hold membership in the Church. At the\ncoming of the Lord, if they fail to repent, they shall be counted among the \"foolish virgins\"\n(see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"13115\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13115)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13115)\">D&amp;C 45:56<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13128\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13128)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13128)\">D&amp;C 63:54<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"<i>For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what<\/i>\n<i>shall a man give in exchange for his soul?<\/i>\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34580\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34580)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34580)\">Matt. 16:26<\/a><\/span>, italics added.)\n<\/p><p>\nCertainly, as Latter-day Saints, we would have no profit if we should gain the whole world\nand lose our souls. There is nothing that this world can offer that we would exchange for\neternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless us as children of the covenant&mdash;members of his Church and kingdom&mdash;that\nwe will keep the commandments, that we will walk in the pathway that our Savior has\npointed out for us to follow back to the presence of our eternal Father, that we may someday\nattain an eternal and blessed exaltation, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
