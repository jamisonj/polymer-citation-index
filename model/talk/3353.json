It is very difficult to keep up with the growth of the Church in many lands\u201d (in Conference Report, Samoa Area Conference 1976, p. 9).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/communion-with-the-holy-spirit.p4\" class=\"\">It has been 150 years since The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized. Why does this Church continue to flourish and grow so dramatically? In 1979 there were almost two hundred thousand convert baptisms in addition to the natural growth of the Church.

We believe that we can answer this question more correctly than anyone else.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/communion-with-the-holy-spirit.p5\" class=\"\">Several characteristics are peculiar to our faith. Among them is its organization with prophets and Apostles, who Paul said are the foundation of the Church (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"21926\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21926)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21926)\">Eph. 2:20<\/a><\/span>); the First Quorum of the Seventy, also the great order of lay priesthood leadership, the missionary system, the welfare program, the temples, the genealogical effort, and many other distinguishing features.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/communion-with-the-holy-spirit.p6\" class=\"\">There is, however, another reason for our growth, which transcends all others. Of an interview in 1839 between the Prophet Joseph Smith and Martin Van Buren, then president of the United States, the following was reported:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/communion-with-the-holy-spirit.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cIn our interview with the President, he interrogated us wherein we differed in our religion from the other religions of the day.
