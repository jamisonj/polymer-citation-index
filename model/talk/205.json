Wirthlin, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1945, pp. 99-107<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI sincerely trust, my brethren, that I might enjoy the spirit of the Lord the few minutes that I\nstand before this magnificent body of the priesthood of the Lord Jesus Christ. As I listened to\nthe opening prayer of this session of our conference tonight, there was one thought expressed\nthat made a deep impression upon me, and that was the thought that we should put our arms\naround those who have become inactive and indifferent in the Church. Our responsibility to\nthose who become indifferent brings to mind the scripture presented by Elder Mark E.\nPetersen in his most inspirational address. It is found in Ephesians 4:11-13.\n<\/p><p>\nASSIGNMENTS FOR THE PRIESTHOOD\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors\nand teachers; For the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of\nthe body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son\nof God, unto a perfect man (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21608\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21608)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21608)\">Eph. 4:11-13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs I analyze these words of Paul, they seem to fall into two distinct parts. The first part has\nto do with those who are the designated servants of the Lord. The second part outlines the\nassignments to these servants; first, the assignment of perfecting the Saints; second, the work\nof the ministry; third, the edifying of the body of Christ until we all come to a unity of the\nfaith; and fourth, a knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE TEACHER'S DUTIES\n<\/p><p>\nWe are all familiar with the responsibility of each group of these servants of the Lord, but I\nshould like to make particular reference to the group that Paul calls the teachers. Considering\nthe office of teacher in the Church first, and secondly the assignment of perfecting the Saints,\nestablishing faith in their hearts, and giving them a complete knowledge of the mission, the\nsacrifice and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, it would seem that in the scriptures there\nshould be a plan or formula whereby these teachers might accomplish the objectives outlined\nin the declaration of Paul. The formula or plan is found in a revelation given to the Prophet\nJoseph Smith in section 20, verse 53 of the D&amp;C wherein the Lord said:\n<\/p><p>\nThe teacher's duty is to watch over the church always, and be with and strengthen them; And\nsee that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying,\nbackbiting, nor evil speaking; And see that the church meet together often, and also see that\nall members do their duty (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12088\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12088)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12088)\">D&amp;C 20:53<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the Lord's plan, and in it there are found five distinct steps: first, the teacher's duty is\nto watch over the Church always, which indicates that the assignment of teaching the people\nisn't an assignment for any specified period of time but one that might be a life's mission, for\nthe Lord used the word \"always.\" The second step involves the teacher being with and\nstrengthening them. The third step is to see that there is no iniquity in the Church, neither\nhardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking fourth, to see that the\nChurch meet together often; fifth, and also see that all the members do their duty.\n<\/p><p>\nIn analyzing this great priesthood assignment of perfecting the Saints, it will require constant\nmotivation, teaching, and particularly in guarding the Saints against those who come as\nwolves in sheep's clothing, teaching the doctrines of men which are always false doctrines.\nThe untiring effort, prayers, and presence of the teacher, the guardian of the flock, are\nnecessary in order to strengthen the Saints in knowledge, in their faith, and in their\ntestimonies, to the end that they will know of a surety that the restored gospel of Christ is\nbeing taught by the teacher of the Lord, and to enjoy a testimony that whispers constantly to\nthem that the gospel as restored to the Prophet Joseph Smith is the Lord's plan wherein they\ncan enjoy salvation and exaltation in the kingdom of our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nIt logically follows that if the Saints are to be perfected, of necessity iniquity, hardness with\neach other, lying, backbiting, and evil speaking must be eliminated from their daily lives. If\nyou will think of iniquity, think of hardness, think of lying, backbiting, and evil speaking,\ninevitably you think of Satan, who is the source of these sins which have caused and do cause\nsorrow and death. The emotions of hate, criticism, and backbiting that he inculcates into the\nhearts of men are the causes for apostasy, for whenever a man in this Church finds fault,\npractices backbiting and evil speaking, he becomes hardened in his heart, and the spirit of\nGod departs from him. Unless there is a change, this course leads to apostasy and degradation.\nThe teachers of the Church being the watchmen on the towers of Zion should have as one of\ntheir objectives so to teach the Saints that they will have the strength to overcome these vices\nand evils to the end that the perfection spoken of by Paul will ultimately be their achievement\nand blessing.\n<\/p><p>\nThe duty of the teacher to see that the Church meet together often is of utmost importance,\nfor in meeting together often, the Lord has promised that his spirit will be present in rich\nabundance; and where his spirit is found, truth, love, and light will be the blessings of those\nwho are in attendance. The teacher should encourage the Saints to meet together on the\nLord's day, to rest from their labors, and, most important of all, to partake of the emblems of\nthe Last Supper to the end that the body of the crucified Redeemer will become so edified\nthat the people will know that the broken body that hung on the cross and the spilled blood\nbrought about the atonement and made the resurrection possible. Furthermore, through the\nedification of the body of the Savior as represented in the sacrament, the Saints will have a\ntestimony of his divine calling and always be willing to remember him and keep his\ncommandments.\n<\/p><p>\nThe teacher should so inspire the Saints that all of them will do their duty as the Lord\ncommanded, for out of duty is personal development and spiritual progress possible, for \"faith\nwithout works is dead\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26059\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26059)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26059)\">James 2:26<\/a><\/span>).\nPersonal development and spiritual progress go for perfection in\ncharacter, in noble deeds, and in doing the will of our Heavenly Father, and the reward,\ntherefore, is one which is divinely given in the form of a testimony, a testimony of the divine\nmission of the Savior, a testimony of the mission of Joseph Smith, a testimony of the fact that\nthose who now guide and direct the destiny of this work do it under the inspiration of our\nHeavenly Father's holy spirit and with the mantle of authority upon their shoulders which was\nrestored through the instrumentality of John the Baptist, Peter, James, and John. Activity is\nthe strongest bulwark against the temptations and snares of the evil one. Activity is the\nlifeblood of this great organization. It is the foundation for an enduring testimony which can\nbe lost when an individual does not do his duty and becomes inactive and indifferent.\n<\/p><p>\nThe servants of the Lord, these teachers, were assigned to watch over the Church always and\nto be with and strengthen its membership and are selected by the Lord's representative, the\nbishop. But who are to be chosen to this great priesthood assignment? This question is not\ndifficult to answer, for the bishop and his counselors have the right to call on every high\npriest, every seventy, every elder, every priest, and every teacher, who is worthy of this great\nand holy calling.\n<\/p><p>\nOfttimes the remark is heard, \"I have been teaching for ten or fifteen years and feel that\nbecause of this long tenure in office, I have graduated from this field of activity.\" I want to\nsay emphatically, brethren, that any man who makes such a declaration might as well add, \"I\nhave graduated from the priesthood that I hold.\" The man who holds the priesthood of God is\nexpected to render service as long as he lives, for his priesthood is endless. Furthermore, he is\nexpected to respond to any and all calls that are made of him by the proper authority.\nAnything short of this is comparable to renouncing one's priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is no honor with more distinction attached to it than the honor of teaching the people.\nThe Savior set the proper example. His whole ministry was devoted to the welfare of the\npeople and particularly to teaching them the doctrines of the kingdom. Surely, no one holding\nthe priesthood will forego the privilege of following the example of the great Teacher. The\nLord commanded Joseph Smith that we should teach one another the doctrines of the\nkingdom (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12159\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12159)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12159)\">D&amp;C 88:77<\/a><\/span>),\nand there is no better way than visiting among the people and teaching them the\ndoctrines of the restored gospel. There are those who feel that they should be excused from\nteaching the people because of other duties, but it is felt that although members of the\npriesthood are engaged in other activities such as the auxiliaries, the assignment of teaching\nthe people should take precedence for it is a priesthood activity, and the priesthood comes\nfirst. There is only one exception to this rule, and this exception is made by the First\nPresidency and the Council of the Twelve: in the case of stake presidencies and high councils,\nthey are exempt from teaching because they constitute a court of the Church, and it is felt to\nbe necessary that their minds be free of bias or prejudice. If they were to visit among the\npeople as teachers or arbitrators, these men who constitute the high council court might find\nthemselves in situations where their minds might become prejudiced because of contacts with\nthose who are engaged in controversy. But the stake presidency and high council are\nresponsible for the ward teaching in their stake, to see that it is done in all the wards and that\nthe commandment of the Lord as revealed to the Prophet Joseph is carried out fully.\n<\/p><p>\nQUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS\n<\/p><p>\nWhat are the qualifications of a teacher? A teacher should be a man who teaches by example\nand lives every doctrine and principle that he advocates. I am not hesitant in saying to you\nthat when a man goes forth to teach the principles of the gospel, having a clear conscience\nand knowing in his own heart that he is obeying and abiding by the principles of the gospel to\nthe best of his ability, he can with certainty know that he will teach the Saints with the\ninspiration of God's spirit resting mightily upon him. He can teach in the spirit of sincerity,\nand the impression that he will make upon those who listen to him will be lasting and will\nsow the seeds of faith and obedience. A teacher should always be prepared. My observations\nindicate that many times teaching is done without proper preparation and that the monthly\nward teachers' message prepared by the Presiding Bishop's Office is the crutch upon which\nmany of our brethren lean. The message may be read before visiting the people, but there are\nmany instances where it is read for the first time in the home of some Latter-day Saint, which\nis a confession that the teachers have come unprepared, and the impression made under such\ncircumstances is very unfavorable. Proper preparation is of utmost importance, for upon it\nsuccess depends.\n<\/p><p>\nTeachers should know the families which constitute their flock. More important, they should\nknow each individual to the end that they can provide the bread of life that is needed, not\nonly collectively but individually, rendering such counsel as will encourage and stimulate\ngreater activity. Teaching on this basis will preclude the use of a printed message, the teachers\nbeing prepared and inspired to give such message as is needed in each particular home. I am\nsure the time is coming, and it isn't too far distant, when the printed message, which has been\nplaced in your hands and is known as the monthly ward teaching message, may be eliminated\nentirely, and we shall go back to teaching the people, relying upon the Lord's spirit and\nmaking careful, prayerful preparation in order to be fully qualified to carry out the mandate of\nperfecting the Saints, of bringing them to a unity of the faith through the elimination of\niniquity, backbiting, evil speaking, and hardness with each other. Servants of the Lord should\nbe in constant communication with him in the performance of duty to be done. Nothing is of\nmore importance than getting down upon one's knees with a junior companion, a teacher or a\npriest, and supplicating the Lord for his blessings and assistance in this great assignment. I do\nnot hesitate to promise any pair of teachers who kneel down and ask God for his help, after\nhaving made proper preparation, that they will be impressed to do those things which will be\nmost efficacious in the lives of their flock.\n<\/p><p>\nTeaching the people requires regularity. In other words, we should establish in the Church the\npractice of teaching the people on the first and second Thursday of each month. Thereby it\nwould be only a short time until the people would become accustomed to having the teachers\nvisit on a definite night, that over the Church generally, these two nights will be known as\nward teaching nights, and most people will set them aside in anticipation of the teachers' visit.\n<\/p><p>\nIt must always be remembered that the teachers visit the people with definite objectives in\nmind, to strengthen them to see that they do their duty. Therefore, all material foreign to this\nimportant assignment should be deleted from the conversation. Much of our time and the time\nof the people is spent in discussing such topics as the weather, politics, and the war, and in so\ndoing we are wasting our time, the people's time, and most important of all, the Lord's time,\nbecause teachers are in his service and he expects us to devote the time involved to the\nwelfare and good of the people.\n<\/p><p>\nTRAINING OF AARONIC PRIESTHOOD MEMBERS\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to draw to the attention of you older men the responsibility that you have and\nthe privilege you enjoy in the companionship of a member of the Aaronic Priesthood. This\nyoung man looks to you for leadership and rightfully, too, and if you disappoint him in\nkeeping the appointments made, if you fail to assume responsibility of leadership in teaching,\nif you fail to give him the opportunity of expression, it logically follows that the young man\nwill look upon teaching as something of small consequence. On the other hand, with the right\nkind of leadership, this young man receives a training and an experience that will qualify him\nfor the mission field and, most important of all, burn into his heart a testimony that he is a\nservant of the Lord. I recall my experience as a teacher. My first companion was an old\nScandinavian brother who could hardly speak the English language distinctly and correctly.\nWhen the bishop assigned me to go with him, I had many reservations and rather reluctantly\nconsented. This grand man came to me and said, \"I am happy to have you as my companion.\nYou come to my home on such and such a night that we might make proper preparation.\" I\nwent to his home on the designated night with some misgivings. I was invited to kneel down\nwith him in his humble home and ask for the blessings of the Lord, and, brethren, I testify\nthat although this Scandinavian brother spoke broken English, he enjoyed the spirit of God in\nrich abundance, and I soon discovered in the thirteen families we visited, among whom were\nthe rich and the humble, that this good man was received with the highest degree of respect.\n<\/p><p>\nI ask you older brethren to manifest a keen interest in the priests and the teachers of the\nChurch to the end that they will come not only to know but to feel in their hearts that they\nare in the service of the Master, the service of perfecting his Saints and bringing them to a\nunity of the faith.\n<\/p><p>\nWATCHING OVER THE CHURCH\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord's declaration to watch over the Church always\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12089\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12089)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12089)\">D&amp;C 20:53<\/a><\/span>)\nentails the responsibility of being\nwilling to visit and be with the Saints whenever necessary, which should eliminate from our\nthinking that teaching the people requires but one night a month. It might require two nights;\nit may require three nights; it may require as many nights as are necessary to complete the\nassignment and to be ever on guard against any influences that are detrimental to the spiritual\nand temporal welfare of the people. It is essential that the ward teacher should attend all of\nhis meetings for two reasons: first, for his personal benefit; and secondly, to perform his duty\nof watching over the Church always, which implies that he will take a mental roll of all his\nlittle flock that are present. Those who are absent should be contacted with the thought in\nmind of stimulating them to activity and to carry out the mandate of the Lord to see that the\nChurch meet together often.\n<\/p><p>\nThere may be those who are in temporal difficulties. If you are watching over the Church\nalways, you will be able and be sufficiently qualified to report the temporal circumstances of\nsuch families to the bishop. If you are watching over the Church always, you will be available\nto render assistance to those who are ill and to the home of death. Surely, the heartfelt interest\nof the true shepherd of the flock will return to him the rich blessings of appreciation,\ngratitude, and love for his thoughtful and kindly administrations to those in difficulty.\n<\/p><p>\nRECEIVING THE TEACHERS IN THE HOME\n<\/p><p>\nI have drawn to your attention a few of the responsibilities of the teacher, but there are other\nresponsibilities. There is another phase of this great and important assignment that has to do\ndirectly with you and me who are being and who are to be taught by these servants of the\nLord. I ask the question, \"Do I receive these men, do you receive these men, with the highest\ndegree of respect and hospitality, or do we merely tolerate them out of superficial courtesy?\"\nIt is my feeling, brethren, that we assume an attitude of indifference. Many times we fail to\nlay aside the evening paper, turn off the radio, call in the family to receive the message of the\nLord's servants. If we expect to be built up in our faith, to achieve perfection in our lives as\nPaul said, these men should be received with all the courtesy and respect at our command.\nCertainly, if the President of the Church were to come to our door or the president of the\nstake or the bishop of the ward, we would feel highly honored to do all within our power to\nshow him proper deference. The teacher comes to our door, holding the same priesthood as\nthe President of the Church or the president of the stake, or the bishop of the ward and, being\nthe representative of the Lord, should receive a wholehearted welcome. If we will open our\nhearts and minds, these men as the instruments of the Lord will feed us the bread of life, and\nif there ever was a time when we need divine direction and the bread of life, it is in this day\nof distraction and difficulty. Furthermore, the visit of the teachers extends an excellent\nopportunity for our sons and daughters to come into the family circle in the presence of the\nLord's servants, feeling free to ask any questions they might have. I feel convinced that the\nyouth of Israel have many questions that go unanswered because there was no opportunity nor\nthe right place to answer them, but in the presence of father and mother and the teachers, the\nshepherds of the flock, these questions can be discussed freely and openly to the end that\nthese young people will be built up in their faith and testimonies.\n<\/p><p>\nSAVING THOSE WEAK IN FAITH\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my duty in the Presiding Bishopric's Office to consider the names of those who request\ntheir names to be deleted from the records of the Church. Only yesterday six such names\ncame to my attention, the names of individuals who requested that they be relieved of Church\nmembership because some of them had joined other faiths and felt that they had found the\ntruth. There can be no greater fallacy than believing that one has found the church of the\nLord when he has already been in it and leaves it for the organization of some man, but it is\nmy conviction that some of these people leave the fold, some of them are excommunicated,\nbecause you and I, the watchmen on the towers, the shepherds of the flock, are not doing our\nfull duty. I want to tell you that no man will give up his faith, will give up the restored\ngospel of the Lord Jesus Christ or will give up his membership in this Church for any other\nfaith or any other organization if he has a full understanding and comprehension of the gospel\nas it has been restored in this day. The reasons they leave are that they do not fully\nunderstand it and that many of them become critical and disobedient, which necessitates, on\nour part, greater activity and more alertness, a greater willingness to watch over the Church\nalways and be with them and strengthen them. Many of these people could be saved to the\nChurch if the teacher were doing his full duty.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is as the Savior said to Peter:\n<\/p><p>\nSo when they had dined. Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me\nmore than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto\nhim, Feed my lambs. He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou\nme? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my\nsheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was\ngrieved because he had said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him,\nLord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my\nsheep (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27207\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27207)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27207)\">John 21:15-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, you have the great honor, yes, the great responsibility of feeding the sheep of the\nLord Jesus Christ. If I were to ask you. \"Do you love Jesus Christ?\" with one accord I am\nsure you would respond in the affirmative, and in response to such, I feel sure the words of\nthe Christ would come down through the centuries, declaring again, \"Feed my sheep; feed my\nlambs.\"\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless each and every one of us that we will feel highly honored in teaching the\npeople to the end that we might have a part in the Lord's greatest plan and work, best\ndeclared in his words:\n<\/p><p>\nFor behold, this is my work and my glory&mdash;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of\nman (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38917\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38917)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38917)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>),\n<\/p><p>\nwhich I humbly pray each and every one of us will endeavor to do, in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
