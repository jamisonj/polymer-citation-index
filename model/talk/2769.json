In <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24457\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24457)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24457)\">Heb. 13:16<\/a><\/span> we read, \u201cBut to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.\u201d Communications in the family will often be a sacrifice because we are expected to use our time, our means, our talent, and our patience to impart, share, and understand. Too often we use communication periods as occasions to tell, dictate, plead, or threaten. Nowhere in the broadest sense should communication in the family be used to impose, command, or embarrass.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/family-communications.p7\" class=\"\">To be effective, family communication must be an exchange of feelings and information. Doors of communication will swing open in the home if members will realize time and participation on the part of all are necessary ingredients. In family discussions, differences should not be ignored, but should be weighed and evaluated calmly. One\u2019s point or opinion usually is not as important as a healthy, continuing relationship. Courtesy and respect in listening and responding during discussions are basic in proper dialogue. As we learn to participate together in meaningful associations, we are able to convey our thoughts of love, dependence, and interest. When we are inclined to give up in despair in our efforts to communicate because other family members have failed to respond, perhaps we would do well not to give up, but rather to give and take in our conversations. How important it is to know how to disagree with another\u2019s point of view without being disagreeable. How important it is to have discussion periods ahead of decisions.

Develop the ability and self-discipline to think of other family members and their communication needs ahead of your own\u2014a willingness to prepare for the moment\u2014the sharing moment, the teaching moment. Shed the very appearance of preoccupation in self, and learn the skill of penetrating a family member\u2019s shield of preoccupation. Sad is the day when a daughter is heard to say, \u201cMy mother gives me everything except herself.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Too early and too often we sow the seeds of \u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m busy? Don\u2019t bother me now.\u201d When we convey the attitude of \u201cGo away, don\u2019t bother me now,\u201d family members are apt to go elsewhere or isolate themselves in silence. All family members on some occasion or other must be taken on their own terms so they will be willing to come, share, and ask.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>It takes personal sacrifice to communicate when conditions are right for the other person\u2014during the meal preparation, after a date, a hurt, a victory, a disappointment, or when someone wants to share a confidence. One must be willing to forego personal convenience to invest time in establishing a firm foundation for family communication. When communication in the family seems to be bogging down, each individual should look to himself for the remedy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If we would know true love and understanding one for another, we must realize that communication is more than a sharing of words. It is the <span class=\"emphasis\">wise<\/span> sharing of emotions, feelings, and concerns. It is the sharing of oneself totally. \u201cWho is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26284\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26284)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26284)\">James 3:13<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">A willingness to set the stage.<\/span> The location, setting, or circumstances should be comfortable, private, and conversation-conducive. Effective communications have been shared in a grove of trees, on the mount, by the sea, in family home evening, during a walk, in a car, during a vacation, a hospital visit, on the way to school, during the game. When the stage is set, we must be willing to let the other family member be front and center as we appropriately respond.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Months and years after the score of a baseball game is long forgotten, the memory of having been there all alone with Dad will never dim. I\u2019ll not soon forget a ten-year-old girl excitedly telling me she had just ridden in the car with her daddy all the way from Salt Lake to Provo and back. \u201cWas the radio on?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh, no,\u201d she responded, \u201call Daddy did was listen and talk to me.\u201d She had her daddy all to herself in a setting she\u2019ll not soon forget. Let the stage be set whenever the need is there. Let the stage be set whenever the other person is ready.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">A willingness to listen.<\/span> Listening is more than being quiet. Listening is much more than silence. Listening requires undivided attention. The time to listen is when someone needs to be heard. The time to deal with a person with a problem is when he has the problem. The time to listen is the time when our interest and love are vital to the one who seeks our ear, our heart, our help, and our empathy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>We should all increase our ability to ask comfortable questions, and then listen\u2014intently, naturally. Listening is a tied-in part of loving. How powerful are the words, \u201cWherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cFor the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26281\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26281)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26281)\">James 1:19\u201320<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">4.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">A willingness to vocalize feelings.<\/span> How important it is to be willing to voice one\u2019s thoughts and feelings. Yes, how important it is to be able to converse on the level of each family member. Too often we are inclined to let family members assume how we feel toward them. Often wrong conclusions are reached. Very often we could have performed better had we known how family members felt about us and what they expected.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>John Powell shares this touching experience: \u201cIt was the day my father died. \u2026 In the small hospital room, I was supporting him in my arms, when \u2026 my father slumped back, and I lowered his head gently onto the pillow. I \u2026 told my mother \u2026 :<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201c\u2018It\u2019s all over, Mom. Dad is dead.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cShe startled me. I will never know why these were her first words to me after his death. My mother said: \u2018Oh, he was so proud of you. He loved you so much.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cSomehow I knew \u2026 that these words were saying something very important to me. They were like a sudden shaft of light, like a startling thought I had never before absorbed. Yet there was a definite edge of pain, as though I were going to know my father better in death than I had ever known him in life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cLater, while a doctor was verifying death, I was leaning against the wall in the far corner of the room, crying softly. A nurse came over to me and put a comforting arm around me. I couldn\u2019t talk through my tears. I wanted to tell her:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201c\u2018I\u2019m not crying because my father is dead. I\u2019m crying because my father never told me that he was proud of me. He never told me that he loved me. Of course, I was expected to know these things. I was expected to know the great part I played in his life and the great part I occupied of his heart, but he never told me.\u2019\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Secret of Staying in Love,<\/span> Niles, Ill.: Argus, 1974, p. 68.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>How significant are God\u2019s words when he took the time to vocalize his feelings with, \u201cThis is my beloved Son,\u201d yes, even the powerful communication, \u201cThis is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36412\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36412)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36412)\">Matt. 3:17<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Often parents communicate most effectively with their children by the way they listen to and address each other. Their conversations showing gentleness and love are heard by our ever-alert, impressionable children. We must learn to communicate effectively not only by voice, but by tone, feeling, glances, mannerisms, and total personality. Too often when we are not able to converse with a daughter or wife we wonder, \u201cWhat is wrong with her?\u201d when we should be wondering, \u201cWhat is wrong with our methods?\u201d A meaningful smile, an appropriate pat on the shoulder, and a warm handshake are all-important. Silence isolates. Strained silent periods cause wonderment, hurt, and, most often, wrong conclusions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>God knows the full impact of continuing communication as he admonishes us to pray constantly. He, too, has promised to respond as we relate to him effectively.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">5.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">A willingness to avoid judgment.<\/span> Try to be understanding and not critical. Don\u2019t display shock, alarm, or disgust with others\u2019 comments or observations. Don\u2019t react violently. Work within the framework of a person\u2019s free agency. Convey the bright and optimistic approach. There is hope. There is a way back. There is a possibility for better understanding.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Let a common ground for personal decision be developed. \u201cNeither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28881\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28881)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28881)\">John 8:11<\/a><\/span>) are words that are just as gentle and effective today as when they were first uttered.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Avoid imposing your values on others. When we can learn to deal with issues without involving personalities and at the same time avoid bias and emotions, we are on our way to effective family communications. When a family member makes a decision which may be inadequate or improper, do we have the ability and patience to convey the attitude that we don\u2019t agree with his decision but he has the right of choice and is still a loved member of the family?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>It is easy to point out mistakes and pass judgment. Sincere compliments and praise come much harder from most of us. It takes real maturity for a parent to apologize to a child for an error. An honest apology often makes the son or daughter feel surprisingly warm toward the mother or father or brother or sister. \u201cFor in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26283\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26283)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26283)\">James 3:2<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">6.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">A willingness to maintain confidences.<\/span> Be worthy of trust even in trivial questions and observations. Weighty questions and observations will only follow if we have been trustworthy with the trivial. Treat innermost trusts and concerns with respect. Build on deserved trust. Individuals who are blessed to have a relationship with someone to whom they can confidently talk and trust are fortunate indeed. Who is to say a family trust is not greater than a community trust?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">7.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">A willingness to practice patience.<\/span> Patience in communication is that certain ingredient of conduct we hope others will exhibit toward us when we fail to measure up. Our own patience is developed when we are patient with others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cBe patient; be sober; be temperate; have patience, faith, hope and charity.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16603\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16603)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16603)\">D&amp;C 6:19<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cI get sick and tired of listening to your complaints\u201d and \u201cI have told you a thousand times\u201d are but two of many often-repeated family quotations that indicate patience is gone and channels of communication are plugged.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>It takes courage to communicate patiently. We constantly need to express pride, hope, and love on a most sincere basis. Each of us needs to avoid coming through as one who has given up and has become totally weary in trying.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The correction of family members in front of others is to be avoided.
