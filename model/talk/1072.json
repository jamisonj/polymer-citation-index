In the Old Testament we read: \"My people are destroyed for lack\nof knowledge\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24903\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24903)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24903)\">Hosea 4:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThus spoke Hosea, the prophet. In keeping with the spirit of President McKay's masterful\nopening address, I take these words of warning as my text, \"My people are destroyed for lack\nof knowledge.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAs in Old Testament days we need knowledge today. We need to know our enemies. We\nmust assess clearly and accurately the perils that face the free world as we enter the Missile\nAge. At the same time we must assure ourselves of the knowledge which brings confidence\nand trust in our ability and that of our friends around the world to face the future&mdash;not in\nfear but with vigilance. From knowledge comes strength, and from strength comes the power\nto preserve freedom both at home and abroad.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Eisenhower and other dedicated men have worked tirelessly to help the free world\nunderstand better the deadly world conflict between good and evil which is constantly going\non.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are now entering a period of conferences, first at the Summit in May and again in June\nwhen the President travels to Moscow for a ten-day visit in Russia.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the President said in his State of the Union Message last January, \"We will continue in our\nsearch for peace and in our efforts to reach <i>mutually enforceable agreements<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe have an enormous responsibility here in the United States to help maintain peace and\nfreedom and to push back the somber clouds of war-threats caused by international tensions.\n<\/p><p>\nThe power of communism depends to a large extent on public ignorance. Knowledge is a\ndangerous thing&mdash;to totalitarian states; but knowledge is strength to a free people.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are some fundamental facts which must never be overlooked, lest it be said of this our\nland, \"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24901\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24901)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24901)\">Hosea 4:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe must never forget exactly what communism really is. Communism is far more than an\neconomic system. It is a total philosophy of life&mdash;atheistic and completely opposed to all that\nwe hold dear.\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe in an all-wise Creator. Communism teaches that everything in existence came\nabout as a result of ceaseless motion of the forces of nature.\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe in the dignity of man. Communism holds that human beings are but graduate\nbeasts. Hence communism does not hesitate to destroy those who stand in its way. The\nRussian communists in their rise to power liquidated millions of their fellow countrymen. The\nChinese communists wiped out tens of millions&mdash;perhaps as many as 30 million.\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe in a moral code. Communism denies innate right or wrong. As W. Cleon Skousen\nhas said in his timely book, <i>The Naked Communist<\/i>: The communist \"has convinced himself\nthat nothing is evil which answers the call of expediency.\" This is a most damnable doctrine.\nPeople who truly accept such a philosophy have neither conscience nor honor. Force, trickery,\nlies, broken promises are wholly justified.\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe in religion as a mode of life resulting from our faith in God. Communism\ncontends that all religion must be overthrown because it inhibits the spirit of world revolution.\n<\/p><p>\nEarl Browder, a longtime leader of the Communist Party in the U. S. A. said, \". . . we\nCommunists do not distinguish between good and bad religions, because we think they are all\nbad.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis atheistic, degrading, but militant philosophy is backed up with the strength and resources\nof a big country of 210 million people and a fast-growing economy. In addition, communism\nhas built an empire of 700 million people more. Besides this, it has agents in all free world\ncountries whose ultimate aim is to overthrow the existing social order and bring these\ncountries under the red flag.\n<\/p><p>\nThe major communist objective, make no mistake about it, is to destroy any society that\nadheres to the fundamentals of spiritual, economic, and political freedom&mdash;the integrity of\nman.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the leading exponent of the free society, the United States is thus the primary target of\nMarxian-Lenin philosophy.\n<\/p><p>\nInternationally, communism seeks to isolate us from the rest of the free world. Here at home,\ncommunism ceaselessly pursues the disintegration of the American way of life. It strives to\nuse education, science, literature, art, even the churches, to undermine our free society.\n<\/p><p>\nSuppose for a moment that this country fell under communist control. What would be the\nfruits of this calamity? First, the true seat of government would immediately be removed from\nWashington to Moscow. William Z. Foster, the former head of the Communist Party in the\nUnited States, said this: \"When a Communist heads the government of the United\nStates&mdash;and that day will come just as surely as the sun rises&mdash;the government will not be a\nCapitalistic government but a Soviet government, and behind this government will stand the\nRed Army to enforce the dictatorship of the proletariat.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhat would this mean to you and me in our daily lives?\n<\/p><p>\nCould we own our own homes? Our living quarters would be assigned to us, and we would\npay rent to the state as ordered.\n<\/p><p>\nCould we own our own farms? Our farms would be collectivized and become the property of\nthe state and we would work them under orders from the state.\n<\/p><p>\nCould we start a business and hire people to work for us? To do so would make us criminals.\n<\/p><p>\nCould we work where we pleased? We would work when, where, and how we were\ntold&mdash;and the government would do the telling. No labor unions as we now know them would be\npermitted to exist. Neither would Chambers of Commerce, Farm\nOrganizations, Rotary Clubs, the American Legion, and other organizations.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat would happen to our bank accounts? All above a small sum would be confiscated. The\nrest would be state-controlled for us. The state would take over our insurance.\n<\/p><p>\nExcept for a few closely personal items we would have no property to leave to our families\nwhen we die.\n<\/p><p>\nWe could travel around the country only with police permission.\n<\/p><p>\nWe could not travel abroad or marry a foreigner without the specific approval of the state.\n<\/p><p>\nWe could not even write freely to friends in other countries.\n<\/p><p>\nOur children would go to the schools selected for them, and only so long as the state\npermitted. Lenin said, \"Give us a child for eight years, and it will be a Bolshevik forever.\"\n<\/p><p>\nTeachers would be free to teach only what the state authorized. William Z. Foster said, \"Our\nteachers must write new school textbooks and rewrite history from the Marxian viewpoint.\"\n<\/p><p>\nTo belong to a church would be sure to bring discrimination and penalties of many kinds\nagainst us and our families. The great majority of church buildings would become state\nmuseums or warehouses.\n<\/p><p>\nNo real compromise is possible with evil such as this.\n<\/p><p>\nIs there any real danger that such a calamity could befall us here? My response to that is\nmerely to recite the following shocking fact: \n<\/p><p>\n<i>In forty years, communism, by trickery and force, has brought more people under its<\/i>\n<i>domination than the total number of Christians now living in the entire world&mdash;and<\/i>\n<i>Christianity has been in existence for nearly 2,000 years.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nWe dare not underestimate the communists' zeal, nor their aims, nor their power. To do so\ncould mean our destruction.\n<\/p><p>\nWe dare not accept communist pledges at face value.\n<\/p><p>\nThe German situation is a dramatic example.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Soviet Union in the 1940's sealed off its German occupation zone&mdash;breaking its\npromise.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Soviet Union built up a powerful East German semi-military police force&mdash;breaking\nanother promise. The Soviet Union pledged Germany political freedom, as well as freedom of\nspeech and press. Here again she broke her promise.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Soviet Union agreed to four-power rule in Berlin, then set up a separate East\nBerlin&mdash;breaking its promise.\n<\/p><p>\nI visited the Soviet Union last fall, spending much of my time with the good, honest,\nhard-working people of the soil. I am sure the Russian people want peace. I am confident that\nwe can look forward to an era of peace if the governments of the world respond to the will of\nthe people. But I saw no evidence that the communist leaders have altered their goal of world\nconquest&mdash;by economic if not by military means.\n<\/p><p>\nEven this short visit to the Soviet Union clearly revealed how uneven and unbalanced their\neconomic progress actually is. Their success in the field of rocketry is in sharp contrast to\ntheir backwardness in general standards of living. A Soviet wisecrack of recent vintage goes\nlike this: \"Last year we got a sputnik and this year a lunik, and one of these days we may\neven get shoes.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn agricultural efficiency and productivity the Soviet Union is still a long way behind the\nUnited States. But they do have a substantial growth potential.\n<\/p><p>\nBy means of a great effort, including better economic incentives, Soviet agriculture has\nincreased production by one half or more in the past six years.\n<\/p><p>\nAbout fifty million persons work in Russian agriculture and forestry&mdash;more than forty\npercent of their total labor force&mdash;compared with a little over seven million persons in the\nUnited States, or less than 10 percent of our labor force.\n<\/p><p>\nThey have relatively few farm machines compared to the United States, and they use a great\ndeal of hand labor, most of it done by women. Some sixty to seventy-five percent of their\nagricultural labor force consists of women.\n<\/p><p>\nBut one farm worker in the United States produces enough food and fiber to support about\ntwenty-five persons&mdash;one farm worker in Russia produces enough for only five or six\npersons.\n<\/p><p>\nThe typical Russian laborer has one pair of shoes and one suit of clothes.\nThat's because it takes a month's wages to buy a pair of shoes and two months or more to\nbuy a suit of clothes.\n<\/p><p>\nThey are putting up a bold front as regards their ability to catch up. I saw hundreds of posters\nin the USSR urging farmers to surpass the United States in per capita production. I also saw\nnumerous posters forecasting the ultimate victory of the communist system.\n<\/p><p>\nBut we in this country are driving ahead also.\n<\/p><p>\nI feel sure that the Soviets will not equal nor surpass our productivity in our lifetime, if ever,\nunder their system of agriculture. Why? Because they can never duplicate the levels of\nefficiency and productive ingenuity which are called forth in a free society.\n<\/p><p>\nBut let us not underestimate them. On the contrary, let us strive harder to make our own free\nsystem of agriculture and industry even more efficient. And let us constantly keep our guard\nup.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat can you and I do to help meet this grave challenge from a godless, atheistic, cruelly\nmaterialistic system&mdash;to preserve our God-given free way of life?\n<\/p><p>\n<i>First, let us all prize the treasures we have in this country<\/i>. This is a choice land&mdash;all of\nAmerica&mdash;choice above all others\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1556\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1556)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1556)\">1 Ne. 2:20<\/a><\/span>).\nBlessed by the Almighty, our forebears have made and\nkept it so. It will continue to be a land of freedom and liberty as long as we are able and\nwilling to advance in the light of sound and enduring principles of right.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Second, let us all do our part to stay free!<\/i> Let us stand eternal watch against the accumulation\nof too much power in government. Here in our free land let us preserve a true climate in\nwhich man can grow.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Third, let us all reaffirm our patriotism, our love of country<\/i>. Patriotism is more than\nflag-waving and brave words. It is how we respond to public issues. Let us rededicate\nourselves as patriots in the truest sense.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Fourth, let us all help to build peace:<\/i> True peace springs from within. Its price is\nrighteousness, and to achieve righteousness we must so conduct ourselves individually and\ncollectively as to earn the loyalty and devotion of other men.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Finally, let us all rededicate our lives and our nation to do the will of God<\/i>. With each of you,\nI love this nation. It is my firm belief that the God of heaven guided the Founding Fathers in\nestablishing it for his particular purposes. But God's purpose is to build free people of\ncharacter, not physical monuments to their material accumulations.\n<\/p><p>\nNations that truly love freedom love God. History is replete with examples of once powerful\nnations that have forgotten God. No nation ripened in iniquity can long endure.\n\"Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41432\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41432)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41432)\">Prov. 14:34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe in this land have a rich heritage of freedom. It has rewarded us beyond our brightest\ndreams. The key to further progress&mdash;the key to national security&mdash;is the preservation of the\ninitiative, vitality, energy, and resourcefulness of our people. Our material progress is merely\na by-product of our freedom. Our God-given freedom, a basic principle of religious truth, is\nstill the most powerful force on the face of the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nThe people of the world long for peace&mdash;and I specifically include the people of Russia.\n<\/p><p>\nThat is why we can approach these talks with the Russians with inner strength but without\nillusions. We know that knowledge of the enemy teaches us wariness and caution; we know\ntoo that we speak for millions of suppressed people on the Soviet side of the Iron Curtain, all\nthose everywhere who want peace with human dignity.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I conclude by saying that any system which deprives men of their free agency, which\nweakens the home and family, which depends on butchery for power, which denies all moral\nresponsibility, which holds that man lives by bread alone, and which denies the existence of\nGod, is of the devil.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the communist philosophy. There is no real evidence that it has been changed in the\nlast forty years.\n<\/p><p>\nKnowledge of the enemy and knowledge of ourselves give us the strength to\nfight the good fight for freedom and world peace.\n<\/p><p>\nMay it never come to pass that \"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24902\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24902)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24902)\">Hosea 4:6<\/a><\/span>),\nI humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
