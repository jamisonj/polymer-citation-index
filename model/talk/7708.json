For nearly a year and a half, the man had suffered isolation in a dark, damp cell. Now outside the castle wall, the prisoner was fastened to a post. He had time to utter aloud his final prayer, \u201cLord! open the king of England\u2019s eyes,\u201d and then he was strangled. Immediately, his body was burned at the stake. Who was this man, and what was the offense for which both political and ecclesiastical authorities had condemned him? His name was William Tyndale, and his crime was to have translated and published the Bible in English.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-blessing-of-scripture.p6\" class=\"\">Tyndale, born in England about the time Columbus sailed to the new world, was educated at Oxford and Cambridge and then became a member of the Catholic clergy. He was fluent in eight languages, including Greek, Hebrew, and Latin. Tyndale was a devoted student of the Bible, and the pervasive ignorance of the scriptures that he observed in both priests and lay people troubled him deeply. In a heated exchange with a cleric who argued against putting scripture in the hands of the common man, Tyndale vowed, \u201cIf God spare my life, ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plough, shall know more of the Scripture than thou dost!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-blessing-of-scripture.p7\" class=\"\">He sought the approval of church authorities to prepare a translation of the Bible in English so that all could read and apply the word of God. It was denied\u2014the prevailing view being that direct access to the scriptures by any but the clergy threatened the authority of the church and was tantamount to casting \u201cpearls before swine\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120192\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120192)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120192)\">Matthew 7:6<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-blessing-of-scripture.p8\" class=\"\">Tyndale nevertheless undertook the challenging work of translation. In 1524 he traveled to Germany, under an assumed name, where he lived much of the time in hiding, under constant threat of arrest. With the help of committed friends, Tyndale was able to publish English translations of the New Testament and later the Old Testament. The Bibles were smuggled into England, where they were in great demand and much prized by those who could get them. They were shared widely but in secret. The authorities burned all the copies they could find. Nevertheless, within three years of Tyndale\u2019s death, God did indeed open King Henry VIII\u2019s eyes, and with publication of what was called the \u201cGreat Bible,\u201d the scriptures in English began to be publicly available. Tyndale\u2019s work became the foundation for almost all future English translations of the Bible, most notably the King James Version.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-09205_000_016\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[The following sources were consulted for information about William Tyndale: David Daniell, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Bible in English<\/span> (2003), 140\u201357; Lenet Hadley Read, <span class=\"emphasis\">How We Got the Bible<\/span> (1985), 67\u201374; S.\u00a0Michael Wilcox, <span class=\"emphasis\">Fire in the Bones: William Tyndale\u2014Martyr, Father of the English Bible<\/span> (2004); John Foxe, <span class=\"emphasis\">The New Foxe\u2019s Book of Martyrs<\/span> (1997), 121\u201333; \u201cWilliam Tyndale,\u201d http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/William_Tyndale, accessed February 28, 2010; Bible Dictionary, <span class=\"scriptureRef\">\u201cBible, English.\u201d<\/span>]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-blessing-of-scripture.p9\" class=\"\">William Tyndale was not the first, nor the last, of those who in many countries and languages have sacrificed, even to the point of death, to bring the word of God out of obscurity. We owe them all a great debt of gratitude. We owe perhaps an even greater debt to those who faithfully recorded and preserved the word through the ages, often with painstaking labor and sacrifice\u2014Moses, Isaiah, Abraham, John, Paul, Nephi, Mormon, Joseph Smith, and many others. What did they know about the importance of scriptures that we also need to know? What did people in 16th-century England, who paid enormous sums and ran grave personal risks for access to a Bible, understand that we should also understand?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-blessing-of-scripture.p10\" class=\"\">Not long before his death, the prophet Alma entrusted the sacred records of the people to his son Helaman.

By His word, as Alma said, He enlarges our memory, sheds light on falsehood and error, and brings us to repentance and to rejoice in Jesus Christ, our Redeemer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>The Scriptures Enlarge Our Memory<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-blessing-of-scripture.p13\" class=\"\">The scriptures enlarge our memory by helping us always to remember the Lord and our relationship to Him and the Father. They remind us of what we knew in our premortal life. And they expand our memory in another sense by teaching us about epochs, people, and events that we did not experience personally. None of us was present to see the Red Sea part and cross with Moses between walls of water to the other side. We were not there to hear the Sermon on the Mount, to see Lazarus raised from the dead, to see the suffering Savior in Gethsemane and on the cross, and we did not, with Mary, hear the two angels testify at the empty tomb that Jesus was risen from the dead. You and I did not go forward one by one with the multitude in the land Bountiful at the resurrected Savior\u2019s invitation to feel the prints of the nails and bathe His feet with our tears. We did not kneel beside Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove and gaze there upon the Father and the Son. Yet we know all these things and much, much more because we have the scriptural record to enlarge our memory, to teach us what we did not know. And as these things penetrate our minds and hearts, our faith in God and His Beloved Son takes root.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-blessing-of-scripture.p14\" class=\"\">The scriptures also enlarge our memory by helping us not forget what we and earlier generations have learned. Those who either don\u2019t have or ignore the recorded word of God eventually cease to believe in Him and forget the purpose of their existence. You will remember how important it was for Lehi\u2019s people to take the brass plates with them when they left Jerusalem. These scriptures were key to their knowledge of God and the coming Redemption of Christ. The other group that \u201ccame out from Jerusalem\u201d shortly after Lehi had no scriptures, and when Lehi\u2019s descendants encountered them some 300 or 400 years later, it is recorded that \u201ctheir language had become corrupted; \u2026 and they denied the being of their Creator\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120350\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120350)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120350)\">Omni 1:15, 17<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-blessing-of-scripture.p15\" class=\"\">In Tyndale\u2019s day, scriptural ignorance abounded because people lacked access to the Bible, especially in a language they could understand. Today the Bible and other scripture are readily at hand, yet there is a growing scriptural illiteracy because people will not open the books. Consequently they have forgotten things their grandparents knew.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>The Scriptures Are the Standard for Distinguishing Truth and Error<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-blessing-of-scripture.p17\" class=\"\">God uses scripture to unmask erroneous thinking, false traditions, and sin with its devastating effects. He is a tender parent who would spare us needless suffering and grief and at the same time help us realize our divine potential. The scriptures, for example, discredit an ancient philosophy that has come back into vogue in our day\u2014the philosophy of Korihor that there are no absolute moral standards, that \u201cevery man prosper[s] according to his genius, and that every man conquer[s] according to his strength; and whatsoever a man [does is] no crime\u201d and \u201cthat when a man [is] dead, that [is] the end thereof\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120384\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120384)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120384)\">Alma 30:17\u201318<\/a><\/span>). Alma, who had dealt with Korihor, did not leave his own son Corianton in doubt about the reality and substance of a divine moral code. Corianton had been guilty of sexual sin, and his father spoke to him in love but plainly: \u201cKnow ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120394\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120394)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120394)\">Alma 39:5<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-blessing-of-scripture.p18\" class=\"\">In a complete reversal from a century ago, many today would dispute with Alma about the seriousness of immorality. Others would argue that it\u2019s all relative or that God\u2019s love is permissive. If there is a God, they say, He excuses all sins and misdeeds because of His love for us\u2014there is no need for repentance. Or at most, a simple confession will do. They have imagined a Jesus who wants people to work for social justice but who makes no demands upon their personal life and behavior.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-09205_000_016\">2<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[See interview of Richard Neitzel Holzapfel, in Michael De Groote, \u201cQuestioning the Alternative Jesus,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News,<\/span> Nov. 26, 2009, M5.]<\/span><\/sup> But a God of love does not leave us to learn by sad experience that \u201cwickedness never was happiness\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120396\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120396)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120396)\">Alma 41:10<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120405\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120405)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120405)\">Helaman 13:38<\/a><\/span>).

In scripture, we find vivid portrayals of the blessings that come from honoring true principles, as well as the tragedies that befall when individuals and civilizations discard them. Where scriptural truths are ignored or abandoned, the essential moral core of society disintegrates and decay is close behind. In time, nothing is left to sustain the institutions that sustain society.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>The Scriptures Bring Us to Christ, Our Redeemer<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-blessing-of-scripture.p21\" class=\"\">In the end, the central purpose of all scripture is to fill our souls with faith in God the Father and in His Son, Jesus Christ\u2014faith that They exist; faith in the Father\u2019s plan for our immortality and eternal life; faith in the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, which animates this plan of happiness; faith to make the gospel of Jesus Christ our way of life; and faith to come to know \u201cthe only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom [He has] sent\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120267\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120267)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120267)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-blessing-of-scripture.p22\" class=\"\">The word of God, as Alma said, is like a seed planted in our hearts that produces faith as it begins to grow within us (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120386\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120386)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120386)\">Alma 32:27\u201343<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120279\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120279)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120279)\">Romans 10:13\u201317<\/a><\/span>). Faith will not come from the study of ancient texts as a purely academic pursuit. It will not come from archaeological digs and discoveries. It will not come from scientific experiments. It will not even come from witnessing miracles. These things may serve to confirm faith, or at times to challenge it, but they do not create faith.
