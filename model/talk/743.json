Dilworth Young, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1954, pp. 104-106<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nThe fact that President McKay, in the beginning of the conference, laid stress upon the\nauxiliaries of the Church, his statement being followed up by two of the auxiliary groups of\nour young people singing, gives me license, my brothers and sisters, to speak to a special\ngroup.  I realize that there are many listening who do not belong to this group, but those to\nwhom I refer have a great deal to do with the destiny of about twenty-five thousand or thirty\nthousand of our young boys, so I feel justified in addressing them this morning.  I refer to the\nscoutmasters and the Explorer post advisers of the Church. There are about twenty-five\nhundred of them, in total.  In their hands are the weekday activities of our young boys.\n<\/p><p>\nFirst, my brethren, I can address you as brethren I am sure and as a co-laborer of many years\nstanding, I should like to call to your attention the fact that the best teaching is subtle.  The\ndeclared statements of the Scout oath and the Scout law do not necessarily teach morals,\nalthough they help.  It is the unspoken thing, the act from a man's heart which really does the\nteaching.  I should like to make three simple illustrations in my own life concerning that, and\nI shall mention names with no apology.\n<\/p><p>\nLooking back to my beginnings as a deacon there was a man who stood out in my life.  At\nthe time I was not particularly conscious of it, although even then it seems to me the Lord's\nSpirit whispered to my spirit that here was one whom I should follow.  He was my Uncle\nFred.  You know him better as Bishop Thomas A. Clawson, who was for so many years\nbishop of the Eighteenth Ward.  He ordained me a deacon.  I used to go to priesthood\nmeetings on Monday night with my cousin Cannon Young and my brother Hiram.  We would\nsit in preliminary exercises.  Uncle Fred did not say much of anything to us, but each\nevening, before we were dismissed to go to class, his eye caressed each one of us\nindividually, and those eyes, as they met ours, seemed to say, Good work, boys. We are glad\nyou are here.\" His serene countenance, as he sat there, seemed to be the assurance to me that\nall was well in Zion so far as I was concerned.  It was not words that did it, it was the fact\nthat he was that kind of man.  Sometimes, I wish we could have it today as it was in those\ndays when, after the priesthood class was over, we would gather again and let the bishop give\nhis final benediction before we departed for home. I think that was the highlight of my\ndeacon's experience, happy as it was. As we filed back into the old Eighteenth Ward chapel,\nUncle Fred's eye again went down the line of his deacons, engaged our eyes, each, as the\nfinal song was sung and the final prayer was said.  And we often walked home feeling lifted\nup spiritually.  This could not have been given by anyone but a man who lived what he\npreached without doing any preaching.\n<\/p><p>\nAs an adolescent youth, there were two men who taught me lessons in the same way without\nsaying anything.  I enjoyed a happy athletic career in high school.  I tried\neverything.  Willard Ashton, the coach, never did tell me I had to obey any rules of the game,\nbut I just knew that I had to; there was no other way to play it.  Why? Because that was the\nway he played it.  He did not talk about it, he did it.  During that same period, there was\nAdam Bennion; I had four happy years under Adam S. Bennion.  I cannot recall that he ever\nmentioned to me in all those years how I ought to conduct myself, but I knew how I should. \nI knew what he expected without his saying a word.  There came a time in our young lives\nwhen there was a crisis in our school as against another school, when there had to be honor\nvindicated.  We knew that when the time came Adam Bennion would vindicate our honor; we\nknew he could do nothing else, because he was that kind of man.\n<\/p><p>\nThose are three men, scoutmasters, out of many who without saying words influenced lives.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, you work with boys.  Let me tell you several subtle things which you can do, if you\nbelieve them, or can do them as though you believe them, which will immeasurably increase\nthe work and the happiness and the joy of the boyhood of this Church.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Sunday morning comes along, Mr. Scoutmaster, will you be found sitting in the class\nwith the deacons, or will you be so anxious about your own salvation that you will be up in\nthe elders' or the seventies' or the high priests' quorum?  I advise you to feel the importance\nof these young men under your care so greatly that when they walk into their class, even\nthough you may not be their adviser in that deacons' quorum, there you will be sitting next to\nthem, letting them see with their eyes that what is in your eyes in the reflection of what is in\nthe teacher's eyes.\n<\/p><p>\nI have often thought what effect it must have on a boy to reach out the sacrament plate to his\nscoutmaster sitting in sacrament meeting.  Boys love their scoutmasters, usually, and here sits\nthe scoutmaster where he belongs, and  the boy hands him the plate or the cup and smiles at\nhim, and the scoutmaster smiles back.  Not a word has been said, but the boy knows what it\nmeans to do his duty to God. He does not have to put his hand up and say it, he just knows\nit.\n<\/p><p>\nDo you scoutmasters realize that every time you pass a grove of trees in your hiking programs\nand in your camping out, that it is possible for your boys to duplicate in a measure the\nexperience of the Prophet Joseph?  What a lovely thing it would be if a scoutmaster could\nsubtly teach a boy that whenever he came into a grove or passed a grove, if he cared to go in\nthere and kneel down and offer a prayer to his Father, perhaps the Father would hear the\nprayer.  He might not show Himself to him, but he would reveal Himself to him by a method\nwhich we have been told is sure, by the Holy Ghost.\n<\/p><p>\nThe forests of our land, where God might influence boys are not confined to New York state,\nmy brothers and sisters and fellow scoutmasters.  They are here and around us.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been a Scout executive a long time, but I cannot recall many occasions that I have\nheard a scoutmaster bear his witness at a campfire that Jesus is the Christ. I have been guilty\nof that myself.  Could I do it over again, I would use many more occasions before the last\nembers died, to stand there and tell my boys of the living Christ and of the goodness of him\nin these days to reveal himself to the boy Prophet.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat can teach observance of the Sabbath day more effectively than the quiet ways of the\nleader as he guides his boys in the breaking of camp on Saturday evening.  As he lets them\nout of the car at each home his cheery, \"See you  tomorrow in priesthood meeting\" is a\npowerful sermon.  Conversely the noise of wheels turning against the pavement on Sunday is\nlouder than any words of advice.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd finally, I would be remiss indeed if I did not teach them to talk to their Father in heaven. \nCampfire programs and camping out programs and hikes and trips, when boys are away from\nhome, put them on their own as to whether they shall talk to their Father or\nnot.  They can do it individually, as I have suggested, in groves, but they must do it\ncollectively at times. I should like to ask you one favor. There has been given to the Boy\nScout organizations, I think righteously enough, a pattern of prayer which is used throughout\nscouting, and which, while all right for the boys of other faiths, does not belong in our\ngroups.  I can repeat it in about ten words; it is short.  I say it with all reverence both toward\nthe Lord and respect toward the men who think it is a good prayer: \"May the great\nScoutmaster of all good Scouts be with us until we meet again,\" they say, and then they\ndismiss the boys to go to bed.\n<\/p><p>\nMy fellow Scout leaders, at your came fires and in your dismissals, teach your boys that the\nLord is not a great Scoutmaster.  He is our God.  When you pray to him and when they pray\nto him, address him as he suggested himself.  Let them say, \"Our Father, which art in\nheaven\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34617\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34617)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34617)\">Matt. 6:9<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31370\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31370)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31370)\">Luke 11:2<\/a><\/span>), asking for the favors of the night, for the protecting care, for love and peace at\nhome, and for all things concerning which they should inquire.  Then let them always close it\nby saying, \"In the name of Jesus Christ,\" thus bearing their witness that they believe in his\nholy name.  That is the kind of prayer we ought to have our Latter-day Saint Scouts say.  For\nits kind, I have no objection to the other, but we have our kind which is better. It makes boys\nvocally and can be given inspirationally fit many occasions.\n<\/p><p>\nMy testimony is that God lives, and that he who sits on this stand, presiding, is his prophet\nand his servant.  I would that all the boys in our care will develop the same testimony with\nthe help of their leaders, in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
