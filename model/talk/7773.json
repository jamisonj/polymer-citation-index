However, these sisters felt closely connected because they were fervently praying for one another and were seeking the guidance of the Holy Spirit to know what their sisters needed, even though they weren\u2019t there in person very often. They managed to stay in contact by phone, by Internet, and by mail. They served with love because they had made covenants with the Lord and desired to bless and strengthen their sisters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/and-of-some-have-compassion-making-a-difference.p18\" class=\"\">Another dedicated pair of visiting teachers in the Democratic Republic of Congo walked great distances to visit a woman and her baby.

For her their visit was a message from heaven given just to her. As the visiting teachers met in her humble home, the sister, her family, and the visiting teachers were all lifted and blessed. The long walk didn\u2019t seem a sacrifice. These visiting teachers had compassion, making a difference for good and blessing the life of this woman.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/and-of-some-have-compassion-making-a-difference.p19\" class=\"\">Long distances, expense, and safety issues make in-person, monthly contacts impossible in some areas of the Church, but through the power of personal revelation, sisters who truly seek to love one another and are watching over and strengthening one another find meaningful ways to accomplish this call from the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/and-of-some-have-compassion-making-a-difference.p20\" class=\"\">An inspired Relief Society president counsels with her bishop and prayerfully makes visiting teaching assignments to assist him in watching over and caring for each woman in the ward.

Those were the times I was looking at it as a burden rather than a blessing.) I can honestly say that when I went visiting teaching, I always felt better. I was lifted, loved, and blessed, usually much more than the sister I was visiting. My love increased. My desire to serve increased. And I could see what a beautiful way Heavenly Father has planned for us to watch over and care for one another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/and-of-some-have-compassion-making-a-difference.p29\" class=\"\">Other blessings of being a visiting teacher are that we get to know and become friends with those we may not have known well otherwise.

It was later in the evening. I had no appointment. I didn\u2019t call. I had no partner. But I decided it was important to visit my friend Julie. Julie\u2019s daughter Ashley was born with a brittle-bone disease. Although Ashley was almost six years old, she was very small and unable to do much of anything besides move her arms and speak. She lay on a sheepskin rug all day, every day. Ashley was a happy, cheerful child, and I loved being around her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/and-of-some-have-compassion-making-a-difference.p32\" class=\"\">On this particular night when I got to the home, Julie invited me in and Ashley called out that she wanted to show me something. I went in and knelt down on the floor on one side of Ashley, and her mother was on the other side. Ashley said, \u201cLook what I can do!\u201d Then with a little assistance from her mother, Ashley was able to turn on her side and back again. It had taken her almost six years to accomplish this wonderful goal. As we clapped and cheered and laughed and cried together on this special occasion, I thanked Heavenly Father that I had gone visiting teaching and had not missed this great event. Even though that visit was many years ago and sweet Ashley has since passed away, I will be forever grateful that I had that special experience with her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/and-of-some-have-compassion-making-a-difference.p33\" class=\"\">My own dear mother was a wonderful and dedicated visiting teacher for many years. She was continually thinking of ways she could bless the families she visited. She paid particular attention to the children of the women she visited, hoping to strengthen families. I can remember one five-year-old running up to my mother at church and declaring, \u201cYou are my visiting teacher. I love you!\u201d Being part of the lives of wonderful women and their families was a blessing to my mother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/and-of-some-have-compassion-making-a-difference.p34\" class=\"\">Not all experiences related to visiting teaching are warm and wonderful. Sometimes it is hard, such as visiting a home where you really aren\u2019t welcome or when it is difficult to meet with a sister with a very busy schedule.
