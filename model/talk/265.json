I\nhope and pray that during the few moments I stand here I may be prompted and directed by\nthe good Spirit, for I desire to bear my testimony and to make acknowledgment of the rich\nspiritual heritage which is mine, and which I know is yours, because of our membership in\nthe Church.\n<\/p><p>\nCONVICTION NECESSARY TO ACTION\n<\/p><p>\nThe other day there came to my office a man to dissuade me, and to discourage me from\naccepting the call to the mission field. It was the same line of argument which I had heard\nthirty-five years ago. \"Why must you go?\" he asked. \"Isn't the soul at home as precious to\nsave as the soul in Europe?\" he asked. I answered him very briefly. \"I suppose,\" I said, \"it's a\nmatter of conviction.\" And then he replied, \"It is very important what we believe.\"\nAlma Sonne, Conference Report, October 1946, p. 118\nI knew this man; I knew his background; I knew his family. I remember that from his youth\nhe had walked in a road that led away from the Church. I recall his old grandfather, a\npioneer. As a boy I had heard his testimony. He had seen the Prophet. He had heard him\nspeak. This veteran came to Nauvoo when mobocracy and persecution were rampant. He later\nleft his home and his little farm and cast his lot with the persecuted and driven people, driven\nacross the prairie to the Rocky Mountains. Why did he do it? Because he had conviction!\n<\/p><p>\nA TESTIMONY OF THE TRUTHFULNESS OF THE BOOK OF MORMON\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I was a young man, feeling my way cautiously and thoughtfully, and I hope,\nprayerfully, I asked my father, \"Why did you join the Church?\" The question came to him as\na challenge. He hesitated for a moment and then replied, \"Because I read the Book of\nMormon.\" He had come to America, not for the gospel's sake, but because he believed\nAmerica was a land of opportunity, in which a person could make headway if he worked and\nsaved and struggled toward an end. And then someone handed him a Book of Mormon. \"Read\nit,\" he was urged. He read a chapter or two every night, before retiring, until\nthe book was read from cover to cover. He put it aside, not particularly impressed. Then one\nday as he was working in the field a thought came to him: \"That book is God-given. Joseph\nSmith never wrote that book.\" And then he came to a logical conclusion: \"If that book is a\nrevelation, then 'Mormonism' is true, and the gospel and the priesthood are upon the earth.\"\nThen he sought out the bishop of the ward in which he was residing, and asked to be baptized\na member of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nA MOTHER'S FAITHFULNESS\n<\/p><p>\nI recall now that my mother, when she was not yet in her 'teens, walked across the prairie\nfrom Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Cache valley, Utah, behind a yoke of oxen and a covered\nwagon; she, and her parents, trudged along over the dusty and sun-baked plains, until they\nreached the \"valleys of the mountains.\" The first year was spent in a dugout; they endured\nhardships and privations. Why? Because a humble missionary had brought the gospel to their\nhome and explained it to them in such a way that they could understand it. So it seems to me\nthat we all have such a heritage. I am thankful for it.\n<\/p><p>\nPREPARATION FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE GOSPEL\n<\/p><p>\nWe have been talking about America, the land of the free. There is an old American motto\nwhich is inscribed on our coins. It reads, \"In God we trust.\" I am convinced if freedom in\nAmerica; and elsewhere, is to be preserved, we must return to God. Indeed, I believe that\nyears before the gospel was restored, preparations were made for its restoration. It was no\naccident that Christopher Columbus reached the shores of San Salvador in three flimsy\nvessels. It was no accident that the invincible armada of King Phillip of Spain was scattered\nby a storm which arose at an opportune moment on the high seas. It was no accident that a\nfew drops of water, more or less, as Victor Hugo said, fell on the battlefield of Waterloo and\nbrought about the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte. It was no accident that thirteen loose,\nunorganized colonies on the Atlantic seaboard, without money, without credit, without a navy,\nwithout an army, were victorious in the Revolutionary War. It was no accident that the\nprofound and great political truth set forth in the Declaration of Independence found\nexpression through the pen of Thomas Jefferson. Why? Because he was inspired, and freedom\nof worship was an essential part of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God help us to appreciate the blessings which are ours. May he preserve our land and\nour nation in these crucial days, that America may live and freedom may go out to all the\nworld, so the gospel of the kingdom\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34105\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34105)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34105)\">Matt. 24:14<\/a><\/span>)\ncan be preached without fear or favor to the nations\neverywhere, I pray humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
