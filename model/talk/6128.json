I looked out the window, and in the street were newsboys carrying stacks of newspapers in their arms announcing the news that President George Albert Smith, the eighth President of the Church, had died. President Smith had been the only prophet I had known in my short time on earth. It was during his administration that I first felt the stirrings of a testimony, and even then I knew how important God\u2019s prophets are. I had been taught in Primary and in my home by loving parents that President Smith was our earthly link to our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, that They could talk to me through him. What an empowering concept for a young girl! The Spirit had confirmed in my 11-year-old mind that this was true. When I learned of his death, I felt a tremendous loss.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p5\" class=\"\">However, just five days after President Smith\u2019s death, President David O. McKay stood in this tabernacle and spoke to those assembled. He had just been unanimously sustained as the prophet, seer, and revelator by the Saints. As he brushed back the tears, he said, \u201cNo one can preside over the church without first being in tune with the head of the Church, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. He is our head. This is his church. \u2026 With his guidance, with his inspiration, we cannot fail.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-98911_000_006\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[In Leon R.

He went to the airport, stayed there two hours, and returned later from [the] dark room with a tremendous sheaf of pictures. He was supposed to take only two.

The ways in which our lives have been enriched by listening to our prophet\u2019s voice are numerous. We have a clearer picture of who we are and what we mean to our Father in Heaven. We have received commandments and counsel to guide us, reminders to keep us on the straight and narrow, and encouraging words to spur us on when we become disheartened or discouraged. If we listen to the voices of the world, we will be misled.

We as members of the Church see so much more. Through the whisperings of the Holy Spirit we know that the true head of this Church, the Lord Jesus Christ, does communicate with us through President Hinckley. It was my blessing and privilege to feel that Spirit when I was called into President Hinckley\u2019s office to receive my call to the general Relief Society presidency one and a half years ago. Before I knew the purpose of my being there, I shook his hand and received a powerful personal witness that I was in the presence of a prophet of God. That witness made me feel exceedingly humble and reverent. If I was kind of quiet that day, President Hinckley, that is the reason.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p18\" class=\"\">We are so blessed to have a living prophet who makes connections that have never been made before.

How blessed we are as Latter-day Saints to know that God can speak to us through our living prophet today and give us guidance and instruction and encouragement so that we may continue, just as the Lord\u2019s true Church continues, steadfast and confident on the path that leads us back to Him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p20\" class=\"\">There aren\u2019t many guarantees in this life.

Even the <span class=\"emphasis\">Good Housekeeping<\/span> seal of approval has a disclaimer written right on it! Nothing man-made or man-controlled can ever be truly guaranteed! But here\u2019s the miracle. The Lord has given some marvelous guarantees without any disclaimers. And this is one of them: He will choose the prophet, and He will never let that man lead us astray.

We are created in His image. Our gender was determined before we came to earth and is part of our eternal identity. We lived with Him before we came to earth. God commanded us to bear children but warned that the powers of procreation were to be employed only within the sacred bonds of marriage. God tells us through His prophet that we have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other as husband and wife and to rear our children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs. The family is ordained of God. Parents have specific duties and responsibilities\u2014fathers preside, provide, and protect, and mothers nurture. In addition, the proclamation contains this very important warning\u2014that those who abuse spouse or offspring, who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will stand accountable before God. Further, this warning\u2014that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets. Brothers and sisters, we are in the midst of that reality at this very moment.
