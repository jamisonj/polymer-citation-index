Six months later he explained: \u201cOur primary purpose was to set up \u2026 a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole abolished, and in-dependence, industry, thrift and self respect be once more established amongst our people. The aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves.
