I would like to give a few general thoughts in\nthe few moments that I occupy. I would like to quote a few statements from our Lord and\nSavior Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Statements of Jesus<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJesus said, \"For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of\nhim that sent me\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28506\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28506)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28506)\">John 6:38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through\nhim might be saved\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28495\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28495)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28495)\">John 3:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBrothers and sisters, our assignment is not to condemn the world, but to help save the world.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28519\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28519)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28519)\">John 10:10-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\". . .

Men love the creatures and the\ncreations of God more than they love the Creator. Alcohol, tobacco, stimulants, and drugs are\nconsumed abundantly. In many, the appetites are controlling their brains and minds, rather\nthan the God-given human mind controlling the appetites. Love is often turned into lust. Love\nis from God and lust is from Satan.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Blessings available<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nYoung people and many others are concerned and are asking about today and the\nfuture.
