We have been called to repentance in sermon and in prayer. For thirteen years I\nhave spent much of my time among people who know how to repent. I have never seen such\nbeautiful repentance in all my experiences as I have seen among the people of the South\nPacific.\n<\/p><p>\nSPEEDY REPENTANCE\n<\/p><p>\nAnd while I have been thinking about this principle of repentance, there has come to my\nmind one experience I had during the war years when our young men were going from New\nZealand to the war. There came into my office one day two young Maori brothers. They were\nin uniform. They had volunteered. Natives of New Zealand are not drafted or conscripted in\nthe military service; they have to volunteer. These two young men were about to embark for\nthe Near East and when they came into my office, I detected the odor of liquor. But I was not\nsurprised when they asked for a blessing, for I knew them well; I had lived at the home of\ntheir mother on my first mission. I said to them, \"Do you deserve a blessing?\" They knew\nwhat I meant, and they said, \"We think we do now; we repented a few minutes ago.\" That's\nthe speed with which a Polynesian repents.\n<\/p><p>\nUnder ordinary conditions I think I wouldn't have given them a blessing at that time, but as I\nlooked at them in the uniform of soldiers who had volunteered to give their lives that I might\nenjoy liberty, religious freedom, and all the other freedoms, the Spirit prompted me to bless\nthem. In my blessing I called them to repentance and told them that the blessings were\nconditioned entirely upon repentance. I promised them that through their repentance and their\nrighteous examples as soldiers in the theater of war to which they were going, they would\nreturn home. And how proud one of those young men was just a year ago when he came to\nme and said that he was counselor to the president of one of the branches in New Zealand,\nand that his brother was very active in the Church. From the minute they repented, coming to\nmy office, up Queen Street in Auckland, New Zealand, they had not broken the Word of\nWisdom.\n<\/p><p>\nDISCERNMENT NEEDED\n<\/p><p>\nI think one of the great responsibilities we have, we who hold the priesthood, is the\nresponsibility of acquiring a discernment, a spirit of discernment, so that we may really know\nwhen a man has repented.\n<\/p><p>\nI was walking along the street in one of our towns in New Zealand one day with my mission\npresident during my first mission.  I had been staying at the home of one of\nour Church members, and that's all he was, just a member. He had been a heavy drinker for\nyears, and I had seldom seen him without his pipe in his mouth. The president and I met him\non the street. We walked up to him, and the president said, calling him by name, \"I want you\nto get ready to take your wife and go to the temple of God and be sealed to each other.\"\nWhen I went back to New Zealand on my second mission, that man was the president of the\nbest district we had in the New Zealand mission, and how I thrilled when I heard his\ntestimony that from the minute he was asked to repent by the priesthood of God he had never\nbroken the Word of Wisdom. And he not only came to the Hawaiian Temple, but he also\ncame to this temple and received the blessings which God gives to all who properly repent.\n<\/p><p>\nUNDERSTANDING POLYNESIANS\n<\/p><p>\nI love the spirit of repentance in those people. And I am reminded now that this is the\ncentennial year of the Hawaiian Mission, a mission made great by such missionaries as\nPresident George Q. Cannon, President Joseph F. Smith, Lorenzo Snow, and many others.\nAnd as I have been laboring among those people, and as it has come to me to judge them\neven when their membership in the Church was involved, I have always said to myself, \"What\nwould Joseph F. Smith have done in this case? What would President George Q. Cannon have\ndone in this particular instance?\" I have spent much of my time in finding out or trying to\nfind out what the attitude of those grand and noble men was toward the Polynesian Islanders,\nand I have yet to hear that President George Q. Cannon or President Joseph F. Smith ever\nuttered anything but words of love to those people, whether they were active or inactive in the\nChurch. So also my heart has always gone out to them in great love.\n<\/p><p>\nThey are different from us. They have to be treated differently. We have to understand them,\nbut don't we have to understand ourselves, as well? And in this business of repenting and\nforgiving men and women of their sins, we must understand one another. We must try to see\nthem as much from their own eyes and get their own viewpoint as we do from our own.\n<\/p><p>\nHow we need to pray to God for the spirit of discernment! How we need to know that God\nis love (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1030\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1030)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1030)\">1 Jn. 4:8<\/a><\/span>),\nand that he forgives those who repent!\n<\/p><p>\nSPIRIT OF FORGIVENESS\n<\/p><p>\nJust yesterday I had copied from one of the sermons of President Joseph F. Smith a few\nwords which he delivered from this pulpit at one of the general conferences. It was on the last\nday of the conference, and they were his last words to that great assembly. I would like to\nread them here. I think you will read into these words the spirit of love, of\nforgiveness, which I know President Smith acquired from his association with those wonderful\npeople in the Polynesian Islands. \"Brethren and sisters, we want you to be united.\" We have\nheard that theme also in this conference, and many of us need to repent because we are not\none; we are not as loyal as we should be.\n<\/p><p>\nWe hope and pray that you will go from this conference to your homes feeling in your\nhearts and from the depths of your souls to forgive one another and never from this\ntime forth to bear malice toward another fellow creature. I do not care whether he is a\nmember of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or not, whether he is a\nfriend or a foe, whether he is good or bad. It is extremely hurtful for any man holding\nthe priesthood and enjoying the gift of the Holy Ghost to harbor a spirit of envy, or\nmalice, or retaliation, or intolerance toward or against his fellow man. We ought to say\nin our hearts, \"Let God judge between me and thee\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12800\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12800)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12800)\">D&amp;C 64:11<\/a><\/span>),\nbut as for me, I will forgive.\" I\nWalt to say to you that Latter-day Saints who harbor a feeling of unforgiveness in\ntheir souls are more censurable than the one who has sinned against them. Go home\nand dismiss envy and hatred from your hearts; dismiss the feeling of unforgiveness;\nand cultivate in your souls that spirit of Christ which cried out upon the cross, \"Father,\nforgive them; for they know not what they do\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31269\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31269)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31269)\">Luke 23:34<\/a><\/span>).\nThis is the spirit that Latter-day Saints\nought to possess all the day long. The man who has that spirit in his heart and keeps it\nthere will never have any trouble with his neighbor . . . but he will always be at peace\nwith God. It is a good thing to be at peace with God (<i>Conference Report<\/i>, October\n1902, pp. 86-87).\n<\/p><p>\n\"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to\nsee the right,\" let us strive, brothers and sisters, to finish this great work we are in, I pray in\nthe name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
