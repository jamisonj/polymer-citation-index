Both then and even more so now, I have felt and feel the weight of the call to serve and of the responsibility to teach with clarity and to testify with authority. I pray for and invite the assistance of the Holy Ghost as I now speak with you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p5\" class=\"\">This afternoon I want to describe and discuss a spiritual impression I received a few moments before I stepped to this pulpit during the Sunday morning session of general conference last October. Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf had just finished speaking and had declared his powerful witness of the Savior. Then we all stood together to sing the intermediate hymn that previously had been announced by President Gordon B. Hinckley. The intermediate hymn that morning was \u201cRedeemer of Israel\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 6).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p6\" class=\"\">Now, the music for the various conference sessions had been determined many weeks before\u2014and obviously long before my new call to serve. If, however, I had been invited to suggest an intermediate hymn for that particular session of the conference\u2014a hymn that would have been both edifying and spiritually soothing for me and for the congregation before my first address in this Conference Center\u2014I would have selected my favorite hymn, \u201cRedeemer of Israel.\u201d Tears filled my eyes as I stood with you to sing that stirring hymn of the Restoration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p7\" class=\"\">Near the conclusion of the singing, to my mind came this verse from the Book of Mormon: \u201cBut behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44377\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44377)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44377)\">1 Ne. 1:20<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p8\" class=\"\">My mind was drawn immediately to Nephi\u2019s phrase \u201cthe tender mercies of the Lord,\u201d and I knew in that very moment I was experiencing just such a tender mercy. A loving Savior was sending me a most personal and timely message of comfort and reassurance through a hymn selected weeks previously. Some may count this experience as simply a nice coincidence, but I testify that the tender mercies of the Lord are real and that they do not occur randomly or merely by coincidence. Often, the Lord\u2019s timing of His tender mercies helps us to both discern and acknowledge them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>What Are the Tender Mercies of the Lord?<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p10\" class=\"\">Since last October I have reflected repeatedly upon the phrase \u201cthe tender mercies of the Lord.\u201d Through personal study, observation, pondering, and prayer, I believe I have come to better understand that the Lord\u2019s tender mercies are the very personal and individualized blessings, strength, protection, assurances, guidance, loving-kindnesses, consolation, support, and spiritual gifts which we receive from and because of and through the Lord Jesus Christ. Truly, the Lord suits \u201chis mercies according to the conditions of the children of men\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44378\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44378)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44378)\">D&amp;C 46:15<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p11\" class=\"\">Recall how the Savior instructed His Apostles that He would not leave them comfortless. Not only would He send \u201canother Comforter\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44379\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44379)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44379)\">John 14:16<\/a><\/span>), even the Holy Ghost, but the Savior said that He would come to them (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44380\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44380)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44380)\">John 14:18<\/a><\/span>). Let me suggest that one of the ways whereby the Savior comes to each of us is through His abundant and tender mercies. For instance, as you and I face challenges and tests in our lives, the gift of faith and an appropriate sense of personal confidence that reaches beyond our own capacity are two examples of the tender mercies of the Lord. Repentance and forgiveness of sins and peace of conscience are examples of the tender mercies of the Lord. And the persistence and the fortitude that enable us to press forward with cheerfulness through physical limitations and spiritual difficulties are examples of the tender mercies of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p12\" class=\"\">In a recent stake conference, the tender mercies of the Lord were evident in the touching testimony of a young wife and mother of four whose husband was slain in Iraq in December of 2003. This stalwart sister recounted how, after being notified of her husband\u2019s death, she received his Christmas card and message. In the midst of the abrupt reality of a dramatically altered life came to this good sister a timely and tender reminder that indeed families can be together forever. With permission I quote from that Christmas card:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cTo the best family in the world! Have a great time together and remember the true meaning of Christmas! The Lord has made it possible for us to be together forever. So even when we are apart, we will still be together as a family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cGod bless and keep y\u2019all safe and grant this Christmas to be our gift of love from us to Him above!!!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cAll my love, Daddy and your loving husband!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p16\" class=\"\">Clearly, the husband\u2019s reference to being apart in his Christmas greeting referred to the separation caused by his military assignment. But to this sister, as a voice from the dust from a departed eternal companion and father, came a most needed spiritual reassurance and witness. As I indicated earlier, the Lord\u2019s tender mercies do not occur randomly or merely by coincidence. Faithfulness, obedience, and humility invite tender mercies into our lives, and it is often the Lord\u2019s timing that enables us to recognize and treasure these important blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p17\" class=\"\">Some time ago I spoke with a priesthood leader who was prompted to memorize the names of all of the youth ages 13 to 21 in his stake. Using snapshots of the young men and women, he created flash cards that he reviewed while traveling on business and at other times. This priesthood leader quickly learned all of the names of the youth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p18\" class=\"\">One night the priesthood leader had a dream about one of the young men whom he knew only from a picture. In the dream he saw the young man dressed in a white shirt and wearing a missionary name tag. With a companion seated at his side, the young man was teaching a family. The young man held the Book of Mormon in his hand, and he looked as if he were testifying of the truthfulness of the book. The priesthood leader then awoke from his dream.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p19\" class=\"\">At an ensuing priesthood gathering, the leader approached the young man he had seen in his dream and asked to talk with him for a few minutes. After a brief introduction, the leader called the young man by name and said: \u201cI am not a dreamer. I have never had a dream about a single member of this stake, except for you. I am going to tell you about my dream, and then I would like you to help me understand what it means.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p20\" class=\"\">The priesthood leader recounted the dream and asked the young man about its meaning. Choking with emotion, the young man simply replied, \u201cIt means God knows who I am.\u201d The remainder of the conversation between this young man and his priesthood leader was most meaningful, and they agreed to meet and counsel together from time to time during the following months.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p21\" class=\"\">That young man received the Lord\u2019s tender mercies through an inspired priesthood leader. I repeat again, the Lord\u2019s tender mercies do not occur randomly or merely by coincidence. Faithfulness and obedience enable us to receive these important gifts and, frequently, the Lord\u2019s timing helps us to recognize them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p22\" class=\"\">We should not underestimate or overlook the power of the Lord\u2019s tender mercies. The simpleness, the sweetness, and the constancy of the tender mercies of the Lord will do much to fortify and protect us in the troubled times in which we do now and will yet live. When words cannot provide the solace we need or express the joy we feel, when it is simply futile to attempt to explain that which is unexplainable, when logic and reason cannot yield adequate understanding about the injustices and inequities of life, when mortal experience and evaluation are insufficient to produce a desired outcome, and when it seems that perhaps we are so totally alone, truly we are blessed by the tender mercies of the Lord and made mighty even unto the power of deliverance (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44381\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44381)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44381)\">1 Ne. 1:20<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Who Are They Whom the Lord Has Chosen to Receive His Tender Mercies?<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p24\" class=\"\">The word <span class=\"emphasis\">chosen<\/span> in 1 Nephi 1:20 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44382\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44382)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44382)\">1 Ne. 1:20<\/a><\/span>] is central to understanding the concept of the Lord\u2019s tender mercies.

I testify that the tender mercies of the Lord are available to all of us and that the Redeemer of Israel is eager to bestow such gifts upon us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p26\" class=\"\">To be or to become chosen is not an exclusive status conferred upon us.
