It was night and it was very cold.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/children.p5\" class=\"\">While Elder Tuttle spoke, a little boy, perhaps six years old, appeared in the doorway.

This ragged street orphan saw the bread and inched slowly along the wall toward it. He was almost to the table when a woman on the aisle saw him. With a stern toss of her head, she banished him out into the night. I groaned within myself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/children.p7\" class=\"\">Later the boy returned. He crept along the wall, glancing from the bread to me. He was near the point where the woman would see him again. I held out my arms, and he came running to me. I held him on my lap.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/children.p8\" class=\"\">Then, as something symbolic, I set him in Elder Tuttle\u2019s chair.

There stood a boy wearing the same ragged shirt, a rag tied about a swollen jaw, his head covered with scabies. He held a rusty tin can and a spoon, the symbol of an orphan beggar. As I struggled to open the door to give him money, the train pulled out. I will never forget that hungry little boy standing in the cold, holding up his empty tin can.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/children.p12\" class=\"\">There was a sick little first grader in a hospital at a government Indian school with a fever and running nose.
