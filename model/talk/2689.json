If you were asked the question, \u201cWhy is it important to keep the commandments and live the teachings of Christ?\u201d what would your answer be?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p5\" class=\"\">Perhaps many of us would say, \u201cTo gain eternal life.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p6\" class=\"\">That\u2019s right, to gain eternal life. But for whom? For ourselves? Yes, that\u2019s part of it. But Christ taught, \u201cFor whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel\u2019s, the same shall save it.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33264\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33264)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33264)\">Mark 8:35<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p7\" class=\"\">We should focus, not on serving ourselves, but on serving our fellowmen, thereby losing ourselves in the service of our Heavenly Father, his work and his glory. In order to be most effective in our service, we need to put our own lives in order. Then, as we live the gospel, our lives will reflect righteousness and virtue, and we will be a powerful influence for good in the lives of others. This is why it is not enough to be righteous for the sake of our <span class=\"emphasis\">own<\/span> salvation. We must let our goodness radiate to <span class=\"emphasis\">others,<\/span> that through our example and reputation they will lift their lives and have the desire to follow the Savior\u2019s pattern of living.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p8\" class=\"\">As we go about our daily activities, we\u2019re often being judged by our fellowmen. Some of these judgments may be just, and some may be unjust. We can\u2019t always control what others think of us, or how others judge us, but we can control the kinds of messages we send out through our behavior. We should do all we can to establish for ourselves a worthy reputation, for such is of priceless worth. It is often the key to influencing others for good, and can be the means of bringing the gospel into their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p9\" class=\"\">The importance of what a good reputation means was emphasized to me when I entered into business many years ago with a great business leader. Our plans were to start a new wholesale business. He was to furnish the capital, and I was to furnish the management. After we reached an understanding he wrote me a check for a very large amount of money, and then he said, \u201cIf the business is a success, you will get all the credit; and if the business fails, you will likewise get all the credit.\u201d He then went on to say, \u201cShould the business fail, you will lose more than I will. I\u2019ll only lose money, and I have more of that; but you will lose your reputation, which is much more valuable than money.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p10\" class=\"\">I will never forget the value this highly successful businessman placed on reputation. Fortunately for both of us, the business was successful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p11\" class=\"\">I prefer not to think of reputation as a superficial facade, attempting to indicate depth where there is only shallowness, honesty where there is deceit, or virtue where there is unrighteousness. Rather, I like to think of reputation as a window, clearly exhibiting the integrity of one\u2019s soul. It is through this integrity of thought and integrity of conduct that we become pure and holy before the Lord. It is in this state that we can be most effective in serving our fellowmen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p12\" class=\"\">Christ taught us to be <span class=\"emphasis\">other-centered.<\/span> It is not enough for us to live the gospel inwardly; we need to be shining examples to all with whom we come in contact. In this sense, it\u2019s not only what we <span class=\"emphasis\">are<\/span> that\u2019s important: what others think of us is <span class=\"emphasis\">also<\/span> important. In order to be truly effective as missionaries, we need to be known for our good qualities, to have an unspotted reputation in all things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p13\" class=\"\">I would like, for example, to be known for my dependability\u2014for being honest and upright in all my dealings. I would like to be known as a man who meets his financial obligations on due date or prior thereto, a man whose word is as good as his bond. I would like to be known as one who is trustworthy and as one whose loyalty is unquestionable. I would like to be known as one who keeps the commandments and one who is fully committed in helping to build the kingdom of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p14\" class=\"\">Sometimes we hear a comment like, \u201cWhat does it matter what I do? It\u2019s my life, and I can do what I want with it.\u201d It may be true that we are the ones most affected by our own actions. But in this life, no man is an island; every mortal\u2019s life is intertwined with others\u2019 lives. It is not possible for a person to represent <span class=\"emphasis\">only<\/span> himself. <span class=\"emphasis\">Every<\/span> individual represents certain other people or groups of people as well. For example, we are all representatives of our own families, and the reputation of a family is established through the actions of individual family members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p15\" class=\"\">President George Albert Smith told the story of a time when he was seriously ill and had traveled to St. George, Utah, to see if it would improve his health. He became so weak that he could scarcely move. In his account he recalled: \u201cOne day, under these conditions, I lost consciousness of my surroundings and thought I had passed to the Other Side. I found myself standing with my back to a large and beautiful lake, facing a great forest of trees. \u2026 I realized, or seemed to realize, that I had finished my work in mortality and had gone home. I began to look around, to see if I could not find someone. There was no evidence of anyone living there, just those great, beautiful trees in front of me and the wonderful lake behind me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cI began to explore, and soon I found a trail through the woods which seemed to have been used very little, and which was almost obscured by grass. I followed this trail, and after I had walked for some time and had traveled a considerable distance through the forest, I saw a man coming towards me. I became aware that he was a very large man, and I hurried my steps to reach him, because I recognized him as my grandfather. \u2026 I remember how happy I was to see him coming. I had been given his name and had always been proud of it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen Grandfather came within a few feet of me, he stopped. His stopping was an invitation for me to stop. Then\u2014and this I would like the boys and girls and young people never to forget\u2014he looked at me very earnestly and said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p18\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018I would like to know what you have done with my name.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cEverything I had ever done passed before me as though it were a flying picture on a screen\u2014everything I had done. Quickly this vivid retrospect came down to the very time I was standing there. My whole life had passed before me. I smiled and looked at my grandfather and said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p20\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018I have never done anything with your name of which you need be ashamed.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cHe stepped forward and took me in his arms, and as he did so, I became conscious again of my earthly surroundings. My pillow was as wet as though water had been poured on it\u2014wet with tears of gratitude that I could answer unashamed.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p22\" class=\"\">President Smith continued to say, \u201cI have thought of this many times, and I want to tell you that I have been trying, more than ever since that time, to take care of that name. So I want to say to the boys and girls, to the young men and women, to the youth of the Church and of all the world: Honor your fathers and your mothers. Honor the names that you bear, because some day you will have the privilege and the obligation of reporting to them (and to your Father in heaven) what you have done with their name.\u201d (George Albert Smith, <span class=\"emphasis\">Sharing the Gospel with Others,<\/span> Deseret Book Company, 1948, pp. 111\u201312.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-importance-of-reputation.p23\" class=\"\">Not only do we represent our families, but each of us belongs to a community, state, province, or nation whose collective reputation is based on the actions of individuals. Many of us represent the business or organization from which we earn our living. Students represent the schools which they attend. As members of the Church we all represent the Church through our actions.
