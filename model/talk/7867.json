We plead with fathers to take their rightful place as the head of the house.

Pray for that every day. The answer will come with an increase in determination to lead your family, in your feelings of hope, and with greater happiness in your service. You will be more cheerful and optimistic, a great blessing for your wife and family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/families-under-covenant.p31\" class=\"\">The second imperative is to love your wife.

That can at times consume all the energy and strength you have. Age and illness may increase your wife\u2019s needs.

The Spirit at times softened the hearts of thousands and replaced hatred with love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/families-under-covenant.p37\" class=\"\">One way for you to reproduce the successes of Father Lehi is by the way you lead family prayers and family time, such as family home evenings. Give children opportunities to pray, when they can pray, for each other in the circle who need blessings.

When they pray for each other and serve each other, hearts will be softened and turned to each other and to their parents.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/families-under-covenant.p38\" class=\"\">The fourth opportunity to lead your family in the Lord\u2019s way comes when discipline is needed.
