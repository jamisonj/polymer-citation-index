These past six months have been a wonderful season for us as a Church. Last spring we ushered in the 150th anniversary of the organization. On April 6th, when we were similarly convened in general conference, we spanned most of the continent and reached across a century and a half of history when we spoke from the humble birthplace of the Church to the vast congregation assembled in this Tabernacle. Since then, with music, with dancing, with drama we have portrayed the epic story of the building of Zion in the latter days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p4\" class=\"\">We have refreshed the remembrance of our past and paid reverent tribute to those who gave so much to make possible that which we enjoy today. There has been stirred within us a spirit of thanksgiving to Almighty God for the wondrous manner in which he has woven the tapestry of his divine purpose. We have been reminded that we are an important part of the fulfillment of a great prophecy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p5\" class=\"\">All of this has been done in the spirit of jubilee. But there is much yet to be done. In ancient Israel each fiftieth year was observed as a jubilee year with remembrance and celebration. But there was also a mandate urging generous forgiveness and a lifting of the hand of oppression.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p6\" class=\"\">Now in 1980, as we draw the curtain on 150 years of our history, it becomes us as a grateful people to reach out with a spirit of forgiveness and an attitude of love and compassion toward those whom we have felt may have wronged us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p7\" class=\"\">We have need of this. The whole world has need of it. It is of the very essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He taught it. He exemplified it as none other has exemplified it. In the time of his agony on the cross of Calvary, with vile and hateful accusers before him, they who had brought him to this terrible crucifixion, he cried out, \u201cFather, forgive them; for they know not what they do\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32064\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32064)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32064)\">Luke 23:34<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p8\" class=\"\">None of us is called on to forgive so generously, but each of us is under a divinely spoken obligation to reach out with pardon and mercy. The Lord has declared in words of revelation: \u201cMy disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cI, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd ye ought to say in your hearts\u2014let God judge between me and thee, and reward thee according to thy deeds.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17436\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17436)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17436)\">D&amp;C 64:8\u201311<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p12\" class=\"\">How much we have need of the application of this God-given principle and its companion principle, repentance, of which President Romney has so persuasively spoken. We see the need for it in the homes of the people, where tiny molehills of misunderstanding are fanned into mountains of argument. We see it among neighbors, where insignificant differences lead to undying bitterness. We see it in business associates who quarrel and refuse to compromise and forgive when, in most instances, if there were a willingness to sit down together and speak quietly one to another, the matter could be resolved to the blessing of all. Rather, they spend their days nurturing grudges and planning retribution.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p13\" class=\"\">In that first year of the organization of the Church, when the Prophet Joseph Smith was repeatedly arrested and tried on false charges by those who sought to injure him, the Lord said to him through revelation, \u201cWhosoever shall go to law with thee shall be cursed by the law\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17378\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17378)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17378)\">D&amp;C 24:17<\/a><\/span>). I have seen that in our time among some of those who have vindictively pursued their nurtured grudges. Even among some of those who win their contests there appears to be little peace of mind, and while they may have gained dollars, they have lost something more precious.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p14\" class=\"\">Guy de Maupassant, the French writer, tells the story of a peasant named Hauchecome who came on market day to the village. While walking through the public square, his eye caught sight of a piece of string lying on the cobblestones. He picked it up and put it in his pocket. His actions were observed by the village harness maker with whom he had previously had a dispute.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p15\" class=\"\">Later in the day the loss of a purse as reported. Hauchecome was arrested on the accusation of the harness maker. He was taken before the mayor, to whom he protested his innocence, showing the piece of string that he had picked up. But he was not believed and was laughed at.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p16\" class=\"\">The next day the purse was found, and Hauchecome was absolved of any wrongdoing. But, resentful of the indignity he had suffered because of a false accusation, he became embittered and would not let the matter die. Unwilling to forgive and forget, he thought and talked of little else. He neglected his farm. Everywhere he went, everyone he met had to be told of the injustice. By day and by night he brooded over it. Obsessed with his grievance, he became desperately ill and died. In the delirium of his death struggles, he repeatedly murmured, \u201cA piece of string, a piece of string.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Works of Guy de Maupassant,<\/span> Black\u2019s Reader Service: Roslyn, New York, pp. 34\u201338.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p17\" class=\"\">With variations of characters and circumstances that story could be repeated many times over in our own day. How difficult it is for any of us to forgive those who have injured us. We are all prone to brood on the evil done us. That brooding becomes as a gnawing and destructive canker. Is there a virtue more in need of application in our time than the virtue of forgiving and forgetting? There are those who would look upon this as a sign of weakness. Is it? I submit that it takes neither strength nor intelligence to brood in anger over wrongs suffered, to go through life with a spirit of vindictiveness, to dissipate one\u2019s abilities in planning retribution. There is no peace in the nursing of a grudge. There is no happiness in living for the day when you can \u201cget even.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p18\" class=\"\">Paul speaks of \u201cthe weak and beggarly elements\u201d of our lives (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"23326\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23326)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23326)\">Gal. 4:9<\/a><\/span>). Is there anything more weak or beggarly than the disposition to wear out one\u2019s life in an unending round of bitter thoughts and scheming gestures toward those who may have affronted us?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p19\" class=\"\">Joseph F. Smith presided over the Church at a time of great bitterness toward our people. He was the target of vile accusations, of a veritable drumbeat of criticism by editorial writers even in this community. He was lampooned, cartooned, and ridiculed. Listen to his response to those who made sport of demeaning him: \u201cLet them alone. Let them go. Give them the liberty of speech they want. Let them tell their own story and write their own doom.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Doctrine,<\/span> 5th ed., Salt Like City: Deseret Book Co., 1939, p. 339.) And then with an outreaching spirit of forgiving and forgetting, he went ahead with the great and positive work of leading the Church forward to new growth and remarkable accomplishments. At the time of his death, many of those who had ridiculed him wrote tributes of praise concerning him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p20\" class=\"\">Not long ago I listened at length to a couple who sat across the desk from me. There was bitterness between them. I know that at one time their love was deep and true. But each had developed a habit of speaking of the faults of the other. Unwilling to forgive the kind of mistakes we all make, and unwilling to forget them and live above them with forbearance, they had carped at one another until the love they once knew had been smothered. It had turned to ashes with the decree of a so-called no fault divorce. Now there is only loneliness and recrimination. I am satisfied that had there been even a small measure of repentance and forgiveness, they would still be together, enjoying the companionship that had so richly blessed their earlier years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive.p21\" class=\"\">If there be any within the sound of my voice who nurture in their hearts the poisonous brew of enmity toward another, I plead with you to ask the Lord for strength to forgive.

But if you will seek it with sincerity and cultivate it, it <span class=\"emphasis\">will<\/span> come.
