Taylor, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1943, pp. 43-46<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI am very happy, my brethren, to have the opportunity of being in this conference to hear the\nwords of inspiration, counsel, and instruction that have come to us. I trust that I may be able\nto say something that will be helpful and that I may be humble in the things that I say.\n<\/p><p>\nI heard of a speaker who, in telling of his experiences in delivering a sermon, said that as he\nstood before a congregation he felt he was a great waterfall pouring out the word of the Lord\ninto the hearts of the thirsty people. A man who was standing by him said, \"Brother, from\nwhere I was sitting in the audience you didn't look like much of a waterfall. In fact what I\nsaw looked more like just a trickle.\"\n<\/p><p>\nINCREASE IN VISITORS TO TEMPLE SQUARE\n<\/p><p>\nAs you know, I am connected with the Temple Square Mission. We have many thousands of\npeople coming there. We thought that the war would interfere with this mission, that we\nwould not have very much to do. We were mistaken. During the months of January, February,\nand March of last year, when the grounds and tabernacle were open, we had something like\nforty-three thousand people. This year during the same three months when the tabernacle has\nbeen closed, we have had something like fifty thousand people. Three times as many people\nare going out with the guides this year as did last year. In the same three months of last year\nwe sold two hundred seventy-six copies of the Book of Mormon. The three months of this\nyear we have sold five hundred thirty-six copies of the Book of Mormon.\n<\/p><p>\nI am giving you this information because a number of people, principally members of the\nChurch, thought that because the tabernacle is closed no one would come to visit with us and\nthat we would not be able to do the type of work that we were able to do previously. In fact,\namong our own membership we often hear it said that the closing of this very historical\nbuilding is a great calamity and that we are failing to reach the people whom we should\nreach.\n<\/p><p>\nI grant you that the opportunity of coming into this building is a choice one. Inside this\nbuilding there are a sacredness, a spirit of worship, and a quietness that reach into the hearts\nof men and women and in some way go down deep into their souls. It makes them remember\nthe great faith and courage of our pioneers who made it possible to have this building, this\nblock, and this city of ours. However, I am quite sure that many of us forget that the Block is\nalso a sacred spot and that in it there is the spirit of worship, that God is here with us, and\nthat all men and women who come within our gates are blessed and may feel the inspiration\nof the Lord as they come among us.\n<\/p><p>\nCLOSING OF THE TABERNACLE\n<\/p><p>\nI surely wish our people could realize this fact and not feel that all has been lost simply\nbecause the tabernacle has been closed. Seemingly, we have no objections from our friends.\nWe have any number of army men and civilians who, when we say the building has been\nclosed because of the war emergency, say that that is the right thing to do. The only\nopposition that we have, seemingly, comes from our own membership. The work that we are\ndoing in the Block is of immense value to the people who come here. The guides are having\nthe same opportunity of preaching the gospel. We ask our guides to make an hour the\nmaximum and about forty or fifty minutes the minimum of time to hold the people as they\ntake them through the Block. So our guides are using the fifty and sixty minutes, just as they\nhave always used in preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. When men and women go away, I\nam quite certain they go away with a more kindly feeling concerning the Church of the Lord\nthat has been established in these latter days. Without any doubt we are doing a work that is\nvaluable in spreading a knowledge of the gospel among the people.\n<\/p><p>\nSTORY OF A CONVERSION\n<\/p><p>\nBecause of the nature of our work we have the opportunity of seeing people change their\nviewpoint, changing their way of life, rearranging their thinking in regard to the religious\nproblems of the day. We have people coming into the Church because of their contact here.\nRecently, we had a very intelligent and outstanding woman visit with us. Much of her life had\nbeen spent in France. She came on the Block and went around with one of our guides and\nwas so impressed that she came again. She was going down to California and thought she\nhad better stay here long enough to hear more about the Gospel. So we taught her the\nGospel; and one of our guides was so considerate that she took her to some of our meetings\nand young people's gatherings. The woman kept coming back. Then we talked things over\nwith her, and one day we said to her, \"You know we have the Word of Wisdom in the\nChurch; it has to do with smoking and drinking and the use of tea and coffee\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11895\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11895)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11895)\">D&amp;C 89:5-9<\/a><\/span>). It was quite a\nsurprise to her, and in a way shocked her because the use of some of these things had been a\npart of her life. She asked, \"Is that one of the teachings of Joseph Smith?\" We answered,\n\"Yes, that is one of the revelations which were given to him.\" \"Well, if Joseph Smith said\nthat, that is what the Lord wanted His children to do; I am going to do it.\" So since then she\nhas left all these things alone. She continued her investigation and is now a humble, faithful,\nand sincere member of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nYou know you have to change, turn around, think differently and do things differently when\nyou come into the Church of Jesus Christ. I wish all of us as we think about things could say\nin our hearts, \"Well, if the Prophet Joseph Smith said that, and it was given to him by the\nLord, we will do it just as he wants us to do.\"\n<\/p><p>\nA FATHER AND MOTHER CHANGE THEIR VIEWPOINT\n<\/p><p>\nOne day a father and mother came onto the Block. They followed several of our groups. As\nthey went around the third or fourth time, they thought that perhaps the people behind the\ncounter would wonder why they were going so often. So they made this explanation: \"We\nhave a son who is over in England in the military work. One day he wrote to us and said that\nhe had met the Mormon missionaries who are now in the army and said, 'They surely are a\nsplendid lot of fellows.'\"\n<\/p><p>\nNothing more was said by the son about his companions until some time later when they\nreceived a letter saying that he had joined the Mormon Church. \"We were so ashamed and\nembarrassed,\" said the mother, \"that we just could not go out and meet our friends or talk\nabout things, because of our son's joining a church that had such a bad name and reputation\nas the Mormon Church.\" I could not blame her so much because of the many lies which have\nbeen told about us.\n<\/p><p>\nSeveral days later they decided to come to Salt Lake and find out for themselves just what\nkind of church their son had joined. \"We have been in the city a few days and have gone\naround with the guides several times and have bought some Church works. Things look very\ndifferent to us now. We have enjoyed our visit and admire many of your teachings.\"\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless us. May we catch the spirit of missionary work. May we be helpful to the\nmen and women who are around us that no one shall go into the presence of God and have\nany complaint to make because we Latter-day Saints were untrue to the testimony and the\nobligations resting upon us to help our friends to see and understand the beauties of the\nGospel of Jesus Christ, I humbly ask in Jesus' name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
