This is true. But the Lord is not promising us just material wealth if we seek first the kingdom. From my own experience I know this is not the case. In the words of Henrik Ibsen: \u201cMoney may be the husk of many things, but not the kernel. It brings you food, but not appetite; medicine, but not health; acquaintances, but not friends; servants, but not faithfulness; days of joy, but not peace or happiness\u201d (In <span class=\"emphasis\">The Forbes Scrapbook of Thoughts on the Business of Life,<\/span> New York: Forbes, Inc., 1968, p. 88).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p15\" class=\"\">Material blessings are a part of the gospel if they are achieved in the proper way and for the right purpose. I am reminded of an experience of President Hugh B. Brown. As a young soldier in World War I, he was visiting an elderly friend in the hospital. This friend was a millionaire several times over who, at the age of eighty, was lying at death\u2019s door. Neither his divorced wife nor any of his five children cared enough to come to the hospital to see him. As President Brown thought of the things his friend \u201chad lost which money could not buy and noted his tragic situation and the depth of his misery,\u201d he asked his friend how he would change the course of his life if he had it to live over again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p16\" class=\"\">The old gentleman, who died a few days later, said: \u201c\u2018As I think back over life the most important and valuable asset which I might have had but which I lost in the process of accumulating my millions, <span class=\"emphasis\">was the simple faith my mother had in God <\/span>and in the immortality of the soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p17\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018\u2026 You asked me what is the most valuable thing in life.

Paying tithing is discharging a debt to the Lord. The Lord is the source of all our blessings, including life itself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p37\" class=\"\">The payment of tithing is a commandment, a commandment with a promise. If we obey this commandment, we are promised that we will \u201cprosper in the land.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1756\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1756)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1756)\">1 Ne. 4:14<\/a><\/span>.] This prosperity consists of more than material goods\u2014it may include enjoying good health and vigor of mind. It includes family solidarity and spiritual increase. I hope those of you not presently paying your full tithe will seek the faith and strength to do so. As you discharge this obligation to your Maker, you will find great, great happiness, The like of which is known only by those who are faithful to this commandment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p38\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Constancy #2: Live on less than you earn.<\/span> I have discovered that there is no way that you can ever earn <span class=\"emphasis\">more<\/span> than you can spend. I am convinced that it is not the amount of money an individual earns that brings peace of mind as much as it is having <span class=\"emphasis\">control<\/span> of his money. Money can be an obedient servant but a harsh taskmaster. Those who structure their standard of living to allow a little surplus, control their circumstances. Those who spend a little more than they earn are controlled by their circumstances. They are in bondage. President Grant once said: \u201cIf there is any one thing that will bring peace and contentment into the human heart, and into the family, it is to live within our means. And if there is any one thing that is grinding and discouraging and disheartening, it is to have debts and obligations that one cannot meet\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Standards,<\/span> Salt Lake City: <span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era,<\/span> 1941, p. 111).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p39\" class=\"\">The key to spending less than we earn is simple\u2014it is called discipline. Whether early in life or late, we must all eventually learn to discipline ourselves, our appetites, and our economic desires. How blessed is he who learns to spend less than he earns and puts something away for a rainy day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p40\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Constancy #3: Learn to distinguish between needs and wants.<\/span> Consumer appetites are man-made. Our competitive free enterprise system produces unlimited goods and services to stimulate our desire to want more convenience and luxuries. I do not criticize the system or the availability of these goods or services. I am only concerned about our people using sound judgment in their purchases. We must learn that sacrifice is a vital part of our eternal discipline.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p41\" class=\"\">In this and many other countries, many parents and children born since World War II have known only prosperous conditions. Many have been conditioned to instant gratification. There have been ample job opportunities for all who are capable of working. Yesterday\u2019s luxuries for most are considered today\u2019s necessities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p42\" class=\"\">This is typified by young couples who expect to furnish their homes and provide themselves with luxuries as they <span class=\"emphasis\">begin<\/span> their marriages, which their parents have managed to acquire only after many years of struggle and sacrifice. By wanting too much too soon, young couples may succumb to easy credit plans, thereby plunging themselves into debt. This would keep them from having the financial means necessary to do as the Church suggests in the matter of food storage and other security programs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p43\" class=\"\">Overindulgence and poor money management place a heavy strain on marriage relationships. Most marital problems, it seems, originate from economic roots\u2014either insufficient income to sustain the family or mismanagement of the income as earned.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p44\" class=\"\">One young father came to his bishop for financial counseling and told an all-too-frequent story: \u201cBishop, I have been well trained as an engineer, and I earn a good salary. It seems that all through school I was taught how to make money, but no one taught me how to manage money.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p45\" class=\"\">While we believe it is desirable for every student to take classes in consumer education, the primary training rests with the parents. Parents cannot leave this vital training to chance or transfer the responsibility entirely to our public schools and universities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p46\" class=\"\">An important part of this training should be to explain debt. For most of us there are two kinds of financial debt\u2014consumer debt and investment or business debt. Consumer debt refers to buying on credit those things we use or consume in daily living. Examples would include installment buying of clothes, appliances, furniture, etc. Consumer debt is secured by mortgaging our future earnings. This can be very dangerous. If we are laid off work, disabled, or encounter serious emergencies, we have difficulties meeting our obligations. Installment buying is the most expensive way to purchase. To the cost of the goods we buy must be added heavy interest and handling charges.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p47\" class=\"\">I realize that young families find it necessary at times to purchase on credit. But we caution you not to buy more than is truly necessary and to pay off your debts as quickly as possible. When money is tight, avoid the extra burden of additional interest charges.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p48\" class=\"\">Investment debt should be fully secured so as not to encumber a family\u2019s security. Don\u2019t invest in speculative ventures. The spirit of speculation can become intoxicating. Many fortunes have been wiped out by the uncontrolled appetite to accumulate more and more. Let us learn from the sorrows of the past and avoid enslaving our time, energy, and general health to a gluttonous appetite to acquire increased material goods.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p49\" class=\"\">President Kimball has given this thought-provoking counsel:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p50\" class=\"\">\u201cThe Lord has blessed us as a people with a prosperity unequaled in times past. The resources that have been placed in our power are good, and necessary to our work here on the earth. But I am afraid that many of us have been surfeited with flocks and herds and acres and barns and wealth and have begun to worship them as false gods, and they have power over us. Do we have more of these good things than our faith can stand? Many people spend most of their time working in the service of a self-image that includes sufficient money, stocks, bonds, investment portfolios, property, credit cards, furnishings, automobiles, and the like to <span class=\"emphasis\">guarantee<\/span> carnal security throughout, it is hoped, a long and happy life. Forgotten is the fact that our assignment is to use these many resources in our families and quorums to build up the kingdom of God\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> June 1976, p. 4).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p51\" class=\"\">By way of testimony, may I add this to President Kimball\u2019s statement.

Nothing seems so certain as the unexpected in our lives. With rising medical costs, health insurance is the only way most families can meet serious accident, illness, or maternity costs, particularly those for premature births. Life insurance provides income continuation when the provider prematurely dies. Every family should make provision for proper health and life insurance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/constancy-amid-change.p61\" class=\"\">After these basics are met, we should by frugal management regularly save to create funds for investment. It has been my observation that few people have been successful with investments who have not first developed the habit of saving regularly. This requires discipline and discriminating judgment.
