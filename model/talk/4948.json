I watched the white lines on that road more intently than ever before. Staying within the lines kept us from going onto the shoulder and into the deep canyon on one side and helped us avoid a head-on collision on the other. To wander over either line could have been very dangerous. Then I thought, \u201cWould a right-thinking person deviate to the left or the right of a traffic lane if he knew the result would be fatal?

Satan knows our weaknesses. He puts attractive snares on our paths at just those moments when we are most vulnerable. His intent is to lead us from the way that returns us to our Heavenly Father. Sin may result from activities that begin innocently or that are perfectly legitimate in moderation, but in excess they can cause us to veer from the straight and narrow path to our destruction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-straight-and-narrow-way.p13\" class=\"\">One example is sports.

While fine productions on these media are uplifting and entertaining, we need to be very selective in choosing what we see and how much of our time such an activity deserves.

For example, we may build a beautiful, spacious home that is far larger than we need. We may spend far too much to decorate, furnish, and landscape it. And even if we are blessed enough to afford such luxury, we may be misdirecting resources that could be better used to build the kingdom of God or to feed and clothe our needy brothers and sisters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/the-straight-and-narrow-way.p17\" class=\"\">Jacob, the Book of Mormon prophet, warned us, \u201cDo not spend money for that which is of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4383\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4383)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4383)\">2 Ne. 9:51<\/a><\/span>.)
