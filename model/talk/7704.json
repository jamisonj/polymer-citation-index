There the early Saints had come seeking refuge. Many had lost their homes and their farms, and some had lost their loved ones to the growing persecution. In Nauvoo they gathered and built a new and beautiful city. But the persecution was relentless, and by 1846 they were once again forced to leave their homes\u2014this time in the middle of winter. They lined up their wagons on Parley Street, awaiting their turn to cross the frozen waters of the Mississippi River into an unknown future.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p6\" class=\"\">As we stood on Parley Street reflecting upon their desperate conditions, my eyes were drawn to a series of wooden signs nailed to fence posts upon which were etched quotes from the diaries of these suffering Saints. As we read each quote, to our amazement what we found in their words was not desperation and discouragement but confidence and commitment and even joy. They were filled with hope, the hope that is reflected by this quote from the diary of Sarah DeArmon Rich, February 1846: \u201cTo start out on such a journey in the winter \u2026 would seem like walking into the jaws of death but we had faith \u2026 [and] we felt to rejoice that the day of our deliverance had come.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-09205_000_008\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Sarah DeArmon Rich, in Carol Cornwall Madsen, <span class=\"emphasis\">Journey to Zion: Voices from the Mormon Trail<\/span> (1997), 173\u201374; spelling modernized.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p7\" class=\"\">These early Saints were indeed homeless, but they were not hopeless. Their hearts were broken, but their spirits were strong. They had learned a profound and important lesson. They had learned that hope, with its attendant blessings of peace and joy, does not depend upon circumstance. They had discovered that the true source of hope is faith\u2014faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in His infinite Atonement, the one sure foundation upon which to build our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p8\" class=\"\">Today another group of pioneers exemplifies this important principle. On Tuesday, the 12th of January, a massive earthquake struck the country of Haiti. The earthquake left the capital city of Port-au-Prince in shambles. Its impact was devastating\u2014an estimated 1,000,000 people were left homeless, and over 200,000 were reported dead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p9\" class=\"\">While the world followed the unprecedented international response, another remarkable and inspiring rescue effort was under way in Port-au-Prince\u2014this one directed by a committee made up of local Haitian Church leaders organized according to the priesthood pattern and operating under inspiration. Members of the committee included, among others, the two stake presidents and the two stake Relief Society presidents in Port-au-Prince and the mission president, who at age 30 presides over 74 full-time missionaries in the Haiti Port-au-Prince Mission. All of his missionaries are Haitian, and miraculously not one of them was injured in this devastating earthquake.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p10\" class=\"\">Into the hands of these local inspired leaders were placed the resources of the Church, resources which included the generous contributions of many of you. For these contributions, the people of Haiti are profoundly thankful. Under the direction of the committee, truckloads of provisions arrived from the Dominican Republic almost immediately. Within days of the earthquake, planeloads of food, water purification systems, tents, blankets, and medical supplies arrived, along with a team of doctors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p11\" class=\"\">The nine chapels in and around Port-au-Prince were mostly undamaged\u2014another remarkable miracle. During the weeks that followed the earthquake, they became shelters for over 5,000 Haitians and bases from which food, water, and medical attention were distributed. Basic needs were met, and order began to emerge out of chaos.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p12\" class=\"\">Though the faithful Haitian Saints have suffered greatly, they are filled with hope for the future. Like the early pioneers in 1846, their hearts are broken but their spirits are strong. They too are teaching us that hope and happiness and joy are not products of circumstance but of faith in the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p13\" class=\"\">The prophet Mormon, himself no stranger to difficult circumstances, understood and clearly taught this doctrine:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd again, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you concerning hope.\u00a0\u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p15\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u00a0Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, if a man have faith he must needs have hope; for without faith there cannot be any hope.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-09205_000_008\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120446\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120446)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120446)\">Moroni 7:40\u201342<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p17\" class=\"\">Hope comes from faith in Jesus Christ.
