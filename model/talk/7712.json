They identified themselves as members of the Church, which wasn\u2019t too surprising because those not of our faith usually don\u2019t rush up to us in airports. In a conversation we hadn\u2019t expected, we soon learned through their tears that all three of these women were recently divorced, that in each case their husbands had been unfaithful to them, and in each case the seeds of alienation and transgression had begun with an attraction to pornography.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/place-no-more-for-the-enemy-of-my-soul.p6\" class=\"\">With that stark introduction to my message today\u2014one it is challenging for me to give\u2014I feel much like Jacob of old, who said, \u201cIt grieveth me that I must use so much boldness of speech \u2026 before \u2026 many \u2026 whose feelings are exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-09205_000_020\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120347\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120347)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120347)\">Jacob 2:7<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> But bold we need to be. Perhaps it was the father in me or maybe the grandfather, but the tears in those young women\u2019s eyes brought tears to mine and Sister Holland\u2019s, and the questions they asked left me asking, \u201cWhy is there so much moral decay around us, and why are so many individuals and families, including some in the Church, falling victim to it, being tragically scarred by it?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/place-no-more-for-the-enemy-of-my-soul.p7\" class=\"\">But, of course, I knew at least part of the answer to my own question. Most days we all find ourselves assaulted by immoral messages of some kind flooding in on us from every angle. The darker sides of the movie, television, and music industry step further and further into offensive language and sexual misconduct. Tragically, the same computer and Internet service that allows me to do my family history and prepare those names for temple work could, without filters and controls, allow my children or grandchildren access to a global cesspool of perceptions that could blast a crater in their brains forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/place-no-more-for-the-enemy-of-my-soul.p8\" class=\"\">Remember that those young wives said their husbands\u2019 infidelity began with an attraction to pornography, but immoral activity is not just a man\u2019s problem, and husbands aren\u2019t the only ones offending. The compromise available at the click of a mouse\u2014including what can happen in a chat room\u2019s virtual encounter\u2014is no respecter of persons, male or female, young or old, married or single. And just to make sure that temptation is ever more accessible, the adversary is busy extending his coverage, as they say in the industry, to cell phones, video games, and MP3 players.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/place-no-more-for-the-enemy-of-my-soul.p9\" class=\"\">If we stop chopping at the branches of this problem and strike more directly at the root of the tree, not surprisingly we find lust lurking furtively there. <span class=\"emphasis\">Lust<\/span> is an unsavory word, and it is certainly an unsavory topic for me to address, but there is good reason why in some traditions it is known as the most deadly of the seven deadly sins.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-09205_000_020\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See, for example, Henry Fairlie\u2019s excellent <span class=\"emphasis\">The Seven Deadly Sins Today<\/span> (1978).]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/place-no-more-for-the-enemy-of-my-soul.p10\" class=\"\">Why is lust such a deadly sin? Well, in addition to the completely Spirit-destroying impact it has upon our souls, I think it is a sin because it defiles the highest and holiest relationship God gives us in mortality\u2014the love that a man and a woman have for each other and the desire that couple has to bring children into a family intended to be forever. Someone said once that true love must include the idea of permanence. True love endures. But lust changes as quickly as it can turn a pornographic page or glance at yet another potential object for gratification walking by, male or female. True love we are absolutely giddy about\u2014as I am about Sister Holland; we shout it from the housetops. But lust is characterized by shame and stealth and is almost pathologically clandestine\u2014the later and darker the hour the better, with a double-bolted door just in case. Love makes us instinctively reach out to God and other people. Lust, on the other hand, is anything but godly and celebrates self-indulgence. Love comes with open hands and open heart; lust comes with only an open appetite.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/place-no-more-for-the-enemy-of-my-soul.p11\" class=\"\">These are just some of the reasons that prostituting the true meaning of love\u2014either with imagination or another person\u2014is so destructive. It destroys that which is second only to our faith in God\u2014namely, faith in those we love. It shakes the pillars of trust upon which present\u2014or future\u2014love is built, and it takes a long time to rebuild that trust when it is lost. Push that idea far enough\u2014whether it be as personal as a family member or as public as elected officials, business leaders, media stars, and athletic heroes\u2014and soon enough on the building once constructed to house morally responsible societies, we can hang a sign saying, \u201cThis property is vacant.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-09205_000_020\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Fairlie, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Seven Deadly Sins Today,<\/span> 175.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/place-no-more-for-the-enemy-of-my-soul.p12\" class=\"\">Whether we be single or married, young or old, let\u2019s talk for a moment about how to guard against temptation in whatever form it may present itself.

Seek that help and welcome it. Talk to your bishop. Follow his counsel. Ask for a priesthood blessing. Use the Church\u2019s Family Services offerings or seek other suitable professional help. Pray without ceasing. Ask for angels to help you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Along with filters on computers and a lock on affections, remember that the only real control in life is self-control. Exercise more control over even the marginal moments that confront you. If a TV show is indecent, turn it off. If a movie is crude, walk out. If an improper relationship is developing, sever it. Many of these influences, at least initially, may not technically be evil, but they can blunt our judgment, dull our spirituality, and lead to something that could be evil.

Replace lewd thoughts with hopeful images and joyful memories; picture the faces of those who love you and would be shattered if you let them down.
