I deeply and sincerely sympathize with the family, the wives and children of the deceased, Bro. William Clayton, who remain to mourn the loss of the society of their husband and father for a little season. And yet, when we consider all the circumstances, we may conclude that we have not very great cause to mourn. For when a man has lived to a good old age, worn out as it were through toil, passes away, we can realize at least that he has accomplished his mission, that he has performed his work on this earth, and is ready to return to the father from whence he came; behind the veil. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n22\"> Brother Clayton had reached a ripe age, after laboring unceasingly among his brethren from his first connection with the Church. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n23\"> He has had a long and varied experience among this people. He was a friend and companion of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and it was to his pen to a very great extent that we are indebted for the history of the Church&#x2014;that is, the history of the Prophet Joseph more particularly, during his acquaintance with <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"9b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD21\/JoD21_0009.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;9b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7900\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> him and the time he acted for him as his private secretary, in the days of Nauvoo. We have the journals which he kept during that time, in the Historian's Office, from which&#x2014;in connection with those of Elders Willard Richards and Wilford Woodruff and the <span class=\"italic\">Times and Seasons<\/span>, a publication of the Church at that time&#x2014;we have obtained the history of the Church during that period. It was his pen that wrote for the first time the revelation in relation to the eternity of the marriage covenant and of a plurality of wives. Although that revelation had been given to the Prophet Joseph many years before, it was not written until the 12th of July, 1843, at which time Elder William Clayton, acting as a scribe for the Prophet, wrote it from his dictation.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"91423\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 91423)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(91423)\">D&amp;C 132:1-66<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n24\"> I am happy to say that he has left on record a statement in the shape of an affidavit, prepared by himself, in relation to this important subject, for it is a subject that is of the most vital importance, not only to the Latter-day Saints, but to the whole world; for without the knowledge contained in that revelation, we never could consummate the object of our mission to this  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"10a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD21\/JoD21_0010.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;10a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7899\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>earth, we never could fulfill the purposes of God in this estate. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n26\"> I have this paper in my possession, and have had for a number of months past. In fact, it was written at my request, and then given into my care, and I have preserved it with a view, when thought proper, to have it published. And as it is a sermon of itself, it would perhaps be more interesting than anything I could say on the present occasion, and therefore, with President Taylor's permission, I will read it to the congregation. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27\"> [The affidavit was then read by Elder Smith.] <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.1\"> William Clayton&#x2019;s Testimony <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.2\">  <span class=\"italic\">The following statement was sworn to before John T. Caine, a notary public, in Salt Lake City, Feb. 16, 1874:<\/span>  <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.3\"> &#x201C;Inasmuch as it may be interesting to future generations of the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to learn something of the first teachings of the principle of plural marriage by President Joseph Smith, the Prophet, Seer, Revelator and Translator of said Church, I will give a short relation of facts which occurred within my personal knowledge, and also matters related to me by President Joseph Smith. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.4\"> &#x201C;I was employed as a clerk in President Joseph Smith&#x2019;s office, under Elder Willard Richards, and commenced to labor in the office on the 10th day of February, 1842. I continued to labor with Elder Richards until he went east to fetch his wife to Nauvoo. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.5\"> &#x201C;After Elder Richards started east I was necessarily thrown constantly into the company of President Smith, having to attend to his public and private business, receiving and recording tithings and donations, attending to land and other matters of business. During this period I necessarily became well acquainted with Emma Smith, the wife of the Prophet Joseph, and also with the children&#x2014;Julia M. (an adopted daughter), Joseph, Frederick and Alexander, very much of the business being transacted at the residence of the Prophet. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.6\"> &#x201C;On the 7th of October, 1842, in the presence of Bishop Newel K. Whitney and his wife Elizabeth Ann, President Joseph Smith appointed me Temple Recorder, and also his private clerk, placing all records, books, papers, etc., in my care, and requiring me to take charge of and preserve them, his closing words being, &#x2018;When I have any revelations to write, you are the one to write them.&#x2019; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.7\"> &#x201C;During this period the Prophet Joseph frequently visited my house in my company and became well acquainted with my wife Ruth, to whom I had been married five years. One day in the month of February, 1843, date not remembered, the Prophet invited me to walk with him. During our walk, he said he had learned that there was a sister back in England, to whom I was very much attached. I replied there was, but nothing further than an attachment such as a brother and sister in the Church might rightfully entertain for each other. He then said, &#x2018;Why don&#x2019;t you send for her?&#x2019; I replied, &#x2018;In the first place, I have no authority to send for her, and if I had, I have not the means to pay expenses.&#x2019; To this he answered, &#x2018;I give you authority to send for her, and I will furnish you with means,&#x2019; which he did. This was the first time the Prophet Joseph talked with me on the subject of plural marriage. He informed me that the doctrine and principle was right in the sight of our Heavenly Father, and that it was a doctrine which pertained to celestial order and glory. After giving me lengthy instructions and informations concerning the doctrine of celestial or plural marriage, he concluded his remarks by the words, &#x2018;It is your privilege to have all the wives you want.&#x2019; After this introduction, our conversations on the subject of plural marriage were very frequent, and he appeared to take particular pains to inform and instruct me in respect to the principle. He also informed me that he had other wives living besides his first wife Emma, and in particular gave me to understand that Eliza R. Snow, Louisa Beman, Desdemona W. Fullmer and others were his lawful wives in the sight of Heaven. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.8\"> &#x201C;On the 27th of April, 1843, the Prophet Joseph Smith married to me Margaret Moon, for time and eternity, at the residence of Elder Heber C. Kimball; and on the 22nd of July, 1843, he married to me, according to the order of the Church, my first wife Ruth. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.9\"> &#x201C;On the 1st day of May, 1843, I officiated in the office of an Elder by marrying Lucy Walker to the Prophet Joseph Smith, at his own residence. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.10\"> &#x201C;During this period the Prophet Joseph took several other wives. Amongst the number I well remember Eliza Partridge, Emily Partridge, Sarah Ann Whitney, Helen Kimball and Flora Woodworth. These all, he acknowledged to me, were his lawful, wedded wives, according to the celestial order. His wife Emma was cognizant of the fact of some, if not all, of these being his wives, and she generally treated them very kindly. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.11\"> &#x201C;On the morning of the 12th of July, 1843, Joseph and Hyrum Smith came into the office in the upper story of the &#x2018;brick store,&#x2019; on the bank of the Mississippi River. They were talking on the subject of plural marriage. Hyrum said to Joseph, &#x2018;If you will write the revelation on celestial marriage, I will take and read it to Emma, and I believe I can convince her of its truth, and you will hereafter have peace.&#x2019; Joseph smiled and remarked, &#x2018;You do not know Emma as well as I do.&#x2019; Hyrum repeated his opinion and further remarked, &#x2018;The doctrine is so plain, I can convince any reasonable man or woman of its truth, purity or heavenly origin,&#x2019; or words to their effect. Joseph then said, &#x2018;Well I will write the revelation and we will see.&#x2019; He then requested me to get paper and prepare to write. Hyrum very urgently requested Joseph to write the revelation by means of the Urim and Thummim, but Joseph, in reply, said he did not need to, for he knew the revelation perfectly from beginning to end. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.12\"> &#x201C;Joseph and Hyrum then sat down and Joseph commenced to dictate the revelation on celestial marriage, and I wrote it, sentence by sentence, as he dictated. After the whole was written, Joseph asked me to read it through, slowly and carefully, which I did, and he pronounced it correct. He then remarked that there was much more that he could write, on the same subject, but what was written was sufficient for the present. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.13\"> &#x201C;Hyrum then took the revelation to read to Emma. Joseph remained with me in the office until Hyrum returned. When he came back, Joseph asked him how he had succeeded. Hyrum replied that he had never received a more severe talking to in his life, that Emma was very bitter and full of resentment and anger. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.14\"> &#x201C;Joseph quietly remarked, &#x2018;I told you you did not know Emma as well as I did.&#x2019; Joseph then put the revelation in his pocket, and they both left the office. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.15\"> &#x201C;The revelation was read to several of the authorities during the day. Towards evening Bishop Newel K. Whitney asked Joseph if he had any objections to his taking a copy of the revelation; Joseph replied that he had not, and handed it to him. It was carefully copied the following day by Joseph C. Kingsbury. Two or three days after the revelation was written Joseph related to me and several others that Emma had so teased, and urgently entreated him for the privilege of destroying it, that he became so weary of her teasing, and to get rid of her annoyance, he told her she might destroy it and she had done so, but he had consented to her wish in this matter to pacify her, realizing that he knew the revelation perfectly, and could rewrite it at any time if necessary. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.16\"> &#x201C;The copy made by Joseph C. Kingsbury is a true and correct copy of the original in every respect. The copy was carefully preserved by Bishop Whitney, and but few knew of its existence until the temporary location of the Camps of Israel at Winter Quarters, on the Missouri River, in 1846. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.17\"> &#x201C;After the revelation on celestial marriage was written Joseph continued his instructions, privately, on the doctrine, to myself and others, and during the last year of his life we were scarcely ever together, alone, but he was talking on the subject, and explaining that doctrine and principles connected with it. He appeared to enjoy great liberty and freedom in his teachings, and also to find great relief in having a few to whom he could unbosom his feelings on that great and glorious subject. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.18\"> &#x201C;From him I learned that the doctrine of plural and celestial marriage is the most holy and important doctrine ever revealed to man on the earth, and that without obedience to that principle no man can ever attain to the fulness of exaltation in celestial glory. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.19\"> (Signed) <span class=\"small-caps\">William Clayton<\/span>. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.20\"> &#x201C;Salt Lake City, February 16th, 1874.&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n27.21\"> Jenson, Andrew, ed. <span class=\"italic\">The Historical Record<\/span>.

And I am, and so was the deceased when living, at the defiance of the world to dispute those statements. They are made from personal knowledge derived from personal associations with the Prophet Joseph Smith himself, not with a view to gain notoriety, but rather to leave behind him his testimony with regard to this important principle. He has done so. And as he has here stated, as having come from the mouth of the Prophet, this doctrine of eternal union of husband and wife, and of plural marriage, is one of the most important doctrines ever revealed to man in any age of the world. Without it man would come to a full stop; without it we never could be exalted to associate with and become gods, neither could we attain to the power of eternal increase, or the blessings pronounced upon <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"10b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD21\/JoD21_0010.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;10b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7899\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the fathers of the faithful.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"92191\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 92191)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(92191)\">D&amp;C 138:41<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n30\"> There are but a few witnesses now living in relation to the coming forth of this revelation; there never were many that were intimately acquainted with the prophet and his teaching upon this subject.
