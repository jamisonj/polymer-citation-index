I have served as one of the Presidency of this quorum for the past seven years.

It is the greatest philosophy of life ever given to man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p14\" class=\"\">A mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is to establish this peace and happiness in the hearts and homes of the people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p15\" class=\"\">Certainly one of the greatest messages given to man by Jesus Christ is known as the Sermon on the Mount.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p16\" class=\"\">Practically all of the basic principles in man\u2019s relationship with others are contained in this great sermon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p17\" class=\"\">Part of this sermon is referred to as the Beatitudes, and these begin with the word <span class=\"emphasis\">Blessed.<\/span> These Beatitudes outline conditions which bring about peace and happiness.

I would like to mention a few possibilities.

Where misunderstandings exist between children and parents we can encourage adjustments on the part of both. We can pray together for the spirit of peace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p21\" class=\"\">Homes can be seriously disrupted because of family strife.

Many of these divorces undoubtedly could have been avoided if peacemakers had been involved during periods of strife.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p23\" class=\"\">An interesting example that I was closely associated with and which I have referred to previously was one in which several young adults became peacemakers in their homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p24\" class=\"\">A very wise bishop called several young people into his office and said to them: \u201cI would like you to help me in an experiment. I would like to prove the impact and influence of one member on the spirit of the family. For one month, I would like each of you to be the peacemaker in your home. Don\u2019t say anything about this to your family, but be thoughtful, kind, and considerate. Be an example. Where there is quarreling or bickering among members of your family, do whatever you can to overcome these faults by creating an atmosphere of love, harmony, and helpfulness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen you are irritated\u2014and irritations arise in almost every family\u2014control yourself and help the others to control themselves.

One young fellow said: \u201cI had no idea I would have so much influence in my home. It\u2019s really been different this last month. I\u2019ve been wondering if much of the turmoil and strife we used to have was caused by me and my attitudes.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p28\" class=\"\">A young lady said: \u201cI guess we were just the normal family with our selfishness causing little daily conflicts. But as I have worked with my brothers and sisters, a lot of this has been eliminated, and there has been a much sweeter spirit in our home. I believe you really have to work at it to have the spirit of peace in your home.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p29\" class=\"\">Another young lady reported: \u201cYes, there has been a much sweeter and cooperative and unselfish spirit in our home since I began this experiment, but the biggest difference of all has been in me. I\u2019ve tried hard to be a good example and a peacemaker, and I feel better about myself than I have ever felt. A wonderful feeling of peace has come over me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p30\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, how would you like to try the bishop\u2019s experiment in your home by being a peacemaker for one month? In the words of the bishop, \u201cWhere there is quarreling or bickering among the family members, do whatever you can to overcome these faults by creating an atmosphere of love, harmony, and helpfulness. When you are irritated, control yourself and help the others to control themselves.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p31\" class=\"\">I can promise you as you try this experiment and become a peacemaker in your home that the rewards will be most gratifying.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p32\" class=\"\">Another way we can be a peacemaker both in our home and our social and business relationships is by avoiding criticism.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p33\" class=\"\">Did you ever stop to think that every time you criticize, you are judging?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p34\" class=\"\">Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount, said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p35\" class=\"\">\u201cJudge not, that ye be not judged.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p36\" class=\"\">\u201cFor with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36918\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36918)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36918)\">Matt. 7:1\u20132<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/be-a-peacemaker.p37\" class=\"\">We can also be a peacemaker by practicing and teaching forgiveness.

Under such circumstances, patience will develop within us the capacity to accept criticism if warranted or not.
