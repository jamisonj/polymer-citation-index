Considering all the Savior has done for us, I replied it should be easy to offer something in service to Him and our fellowmen.

I thought of some others who said they stopped going to Church because the Church was \u201cnot meeting their needs.\u201d Which needs could they be expecting the Church to meet? If persons are simply seeking a satisfying social experience, they might be disappointed in a particular ward or branch and seek other associations. There are satisfying social experiences in many organizations. If they are simply seeking help to learn the gospel, they could pursue that goal through available literature. But are these the principal purposes of the Church? Is this all we are to receive from the gospel of Jesus Christ?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p10\" class=\"\">Someone has said that what we get depends on what we seek.

If we act with the right preparation and attitude, partaking of the sacrament renews the cleansing effect of our baptism and qualifies us for the promise that we will always have His Spirit to be with us. A mission of that Spirit, the Holy Ghost, is to testify of the Father and the Son and to lead us into truth (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"27018\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27018)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27018)\">John 14:26<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"3391\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3391)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3391)\">2 Ne. 31:18<\/a><\/span>). Testimony and truth, which are essential to our personal conversion, are the choice harvest of this weekly renewing of our covenants. In the day-to-day decisions of my life and in my personal spiritual growth, I have enjoyed the fulfillment of that promise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p14\" class=\"\">I am sorry when any Latter-day Saint does not understand the precious blessing that comes to those who keep the commandment to offer up their sacraments upon each Sabbath day. What is there in life\u2014on the lakes or streams, in places of commercial recreation, or at home reading the Sunday paper\u2014that can provide anything comparable to these blessings? No recreational pleasure can equal the cleansing renewal and the spiritual guidance and growth God has promised those who faithfully partake of the sacrament and honor Him each Sabbath day. I give thanks for the fulfillment of those promises in my life and affirm their availability to all.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p15\" class=\"\">As I came to the age of accountability and understood and experienced the effect of personal sin, the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ gave me the peace and courage to go forward in the knowledge that my sins could be forgiven and that there is always hope and the possibility of mercy for those who fall short.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p16\" class=\"\">As I experienced the death of loved ones, including my father, my mother, and my wife, the comforting revelations of the Holy Ghost gave me the strength to carry on.

Teachers and classmates in Sunday School and Primary, in scouting and other youth activities, in quorum and ward and stake activities have given me the finest possible role models and friends. Of course, our Church does not have a monopoly on good people, but we have a remarkable concentration of them. My associations in the organizations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have given me the basis to recognize, appreciate, and enlarge my associations with people of quality in other churches and organizations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p21\" class=\"\">Because my father died before I was eight years old, I had early cause to wonder about the purposes of the Lord in depriving me of a relationship other boys enjoyed and took for granted. As with so many other mortal challenges, the perspective of the gospel of Jesus Christ filled that void. How grateful I am that my brother and sister and I were raised by a widowed mother who used her faith and our parents\u2019 temple marriage to make our departed father a daily presence in our lives. We never had cause to feel that we were without a father. We had a father, but he was away for a season. There are few things more important in this life than knowing your place in mortality and your potential in eternity. Marriages sealed for eternity in a temple of the Lord provide that possibility for every child and for every adult.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p22\" class=\"\">Over the years, my active participation in the Church has provided me access to the counsel and inspiration of the leaders of the Church on things I should do as a husband and father and leader in my family. Again and again, in stake and general conferences, in priesthood quorums, and in Sunday School classes, I have been taught and inspired by wonderful and experienced fathers, mothers, and grandparents. I have sought to follow those teachings to improve my participation in those associations that will persist for eternity. To cite only one example, I have been taught the power of a priesthood blessing\u2014not just a blessing of healing, but a blessing of comfort and guidance that a father holding the Melchizedek Priesthood is privileged to give to members of his family. Learning and applying that principle has favored me and my loved ones with the sweetness and closeness that can only come from sensing the significance of the priesthood of God in an eternal family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p23\" class=\"\">I am also grateful for the warnings of the scriptures and Church leaders on things to avoid.

Alcohol, tobacco, drugs, pornography, and gambling are but a few examples of dangerous substances and addictive practices we have been warned to avoid. I appeal to all\u2014especially to young people\u2014to hear and heed the words of the men and women God has called as your leaders and teachers.
