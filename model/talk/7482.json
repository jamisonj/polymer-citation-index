The talk was titled \u201cMrs. Patton, Arthur Lives.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-00611_000_009\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[In Conference Report, Apr. 1969, 126\u201329.]<\/span><\/sup> I addressed my remarks to Arthur\u2019s mother, Mrs. Patton, who was not a member of the Church. Although I had little hope that Mrs. Patton would actually hear my talk, I wanted to share with all who were within the sound of my voice the glorious gospel message of hope and love. Recently I have felt impressed to refer once again to Arthur and to relate to you what transpired following my original message.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/mrs-patton-the-story-continues.p7\" class=\"\">First, may I tell you about Arthur. He had blond, curly hair and a smile as big as all outdoors. He stood taller than any boy in the class. I suppose this is how, in 1940, as the great conflict which became World War II was overtaking much of Europe, Arthur was able to fool the recruiting officers and enlist in the navy at the tender age of 15. To Arthur and most of the boys, the war was a great adventure. I remember how striking he appeared in his navy uniform. How we wished we were older or at least taller so we too could enlist.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/mrs-patton-the-story-continues.p8\" class=\"\">Youth is a very special time of life.

It represented to every passerby that her son wore the uniform of his country and was actively serving. When I would pass the house, she often opened the door and invited me in to read the latest letter from Arthur. Her eyes would fill with tears; I would then be asked to read aloud. Arthur meant everything to his widowed mother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/mrs-patton-the-story-continues.p14\" class=\"\">I can still picture Mrs. Patton\u2019s coarse hands as she would carefully replace the letter in its envelope. These were hardworking hands; Mrs. Patton was a cleaning woman for a downtown office building. Each day of her life except Sundays she could be seen walking along the sidewalk, pail and brush in hand, her gray hair pulled back into a tight bob, her shoulders weary from work and stooped with age.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/mrs-patton-the-story-continues.p15\" class=\"\">In March 1944, with the war now raging, Arthur was transferred from the USS<span class=\"emphasis\"> Dorsey,<\/span> a destroyer, to the USS <span class=\"emphasis\">White Plains,<\/span> an aircraft carrier.

Arthur was one of those on board who was lost at sea.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/mrs-patton-the-story-continues.p16\" class=\"\">The blue star was taken from its hallowed spot in the front window of the Patton home. It was replaced by one of gold, indicating that he whom the blue star represented had been killed in battle. A light went out in the life of Mrs. Patton. She groped in utter darkness and deep despair.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/mrs-patton-the-story-continues.p17\" class=\"\">With a prayer in my heart, I approached the familiar walkway to the Patton home, wondering what words of comfort could come from the lips of a mere boy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/mrs-patton-the-story-continues.p18\" class=\"\">The door opened, and Mrs. Patton embraced me as she would her own son.

It was from Mrs. Terese Patton. I share with you a part of that letter:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/mrs-patton-the-story-continues.p62\" class=\"\">\u201cDear Tommy,<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/mrs-patton-the-story-continues.p63\" class=\"\">\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind my calling you Tommy, as I always think of you that way.

Nor do I believe it was a coincidence that Mrs. Terese Patton was invited by neighbors to join them in their home for that particular session of conference. I am certain our Heavenly Father was mindful of her needs and wanted her to hear the comforting truths of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/mrs-patton-the-story-continues.p69\" class=\"\">Although Mrs. Patton has long since left mortality, I have felt a strong impression to share with you the manner in which our Heavenly Father blessed and provided for her, a widow, in her need. With all the strength of my soul I testify that our Heavenly Father loves each one of us. He hears the prayers of humble hearts; He hears our cries for help, as He heard Mrs. Patton. His Son, our Savior and Redeemer, speaks to each of us today: \u201cBehold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote16-00611_000_009\">16<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"51255\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51255)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51255)\">Revelation 3:20<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/mrs-patton-the-story-continues.p70\" class=\"\">Will we listen for that knock?
