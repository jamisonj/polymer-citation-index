We cannot conceive of our lives without his teachings. Without him we would be lost in a mirage of beliefs and worship, born in fear and darkness where the sensual and materialistic hold sway. We are far short of the goal he set for us, but we must never lose sight of it; nor must we forget that our great climb toward the light, toward perfection, would not be possible except for his teachings, his life, his death, and his resurrection.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> June 1971, p. 34.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/christ-is-the-light-to-all-mankind.p8\" class=\"\">I testify that Christ is the light to all mankind.
