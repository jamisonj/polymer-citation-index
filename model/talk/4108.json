Hinckley, in a commencement address at BYU\u2014Hawaii, admonished graduates to \u201cstop seeking out the storms and enjoy more fully the sunlight.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Church News,<\/span> 3 July 1983, p. 10.) He pointed out that we can be negative and look for the ugly in life and the faults and failings of those around us, or we can develop positive attitudes and see the beautiful in life and the good, the strong, the decent, and the virtuous in people, which brings joy and happiness. It is a matter of attitude.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/look-for-the-beautiful.p4\" class=\"\">Shortly after beginning three years of service as a mission president, I was reminded of my personal attitude concerning the world and the people in it. One evening I looked up to see my thirteen-year-old daughter walking up to my desk. She stopped and looked intently at me, with her hands on her hips. She finally said, \u201cDad, I think I have you figured out.\u201d Now she had my complete attention. Then she said, \u201cYou have devoted your life to the beautiful, haven\u2019t you?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/look-for-the-beautiful.p5\" class=\"\">I thought for a few moments and then replied, \u201cYes, Carole, you do have me figured out.

Carole had now correctly concluded that I had an even greater interest in the creation of beautiful people\u2014the type of radiant beauty that comes from righteous living and acceptance of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as taught by our missionaries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/look-for-the-beautiful.p7\" class=\"\">In recent months in traveling to many parts of the world, I have observed this same beauty and spiritual glow in so many of those with whom I have associated.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/look-for-the-beautiful.p8\" class=\"\">During these travels I have also observed many types of buildings.
