I lived for two years on a farm. We rarely went to town. Our Christmas shopping was done in the Sears, Roebuck catalog. I spent hours poring over its pages.

There were three degrees of quality: good, better, and best. For example, some men\u2019s shoes were labeled <span class=\"emphasis\">good<\/span> ($1.84), some <span class=\"emphasis\">better<\/span> ($2.98), and some <span class=\"emphasis\">best<\/span> ($3.45).<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-00611_000_039\">1<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog, Fall and Winter 1944\u201345, 316E.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/good-better-best.p11\" class=\"\">As we consider various choices, we should remember that it is not enough that something is good.

Of course it is good to view wholesome entertainment or to obtain interesting information. But not everything of that sort is worth the portion of our life we give to obtain it. Some things are better, and others are best.

Many breadwinners worry that their occupations leave too little time for their families. There is no easy formula for that contest of priorities. However, I have never known of a man who looked back on his working life and said, \u201cI just didn\u2019t spend enough time with my job.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/good-better-best.p15\" class=\"\">In choosing how we spend time as a family, we should be careful not to exhaust our available time on things that are merely good and leave little time for that which is better or best. A friend took his young family on a series of summer vacation trips, including visits to memorable historic sites. At the end of the summer he asked his teenage son which of these good summer activities he enjoyed most. The father learned from the reply, and so did those he told of it. \u201cThe thing I liked best this summer,\u201d the boy replied, \u201cwas the night you and I laid on the lawn and looked at the stars and talked.\u201d Super family activities may be good for children, but they are not always better than one-on-one time with a loving parent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/good-better-best.p16\" class=\"\">The amount of children-and-parent time absorbed in the good activities of private lessons, team sports, and other school and club activities also needs to be carefully regulated. Otherwise, children will be overscheduled, and parents will be frazzled and frustrated. Parents should act to preserve time for family prayer, family scripture study, family home evening, and the other precious togetherness and individual one-on-one time that binds a family together and fixes children\u2019s values on things of eternal worth.
