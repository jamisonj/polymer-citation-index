Some of the young men had been asked to deliver it. A bag of flour was brought to Sister Stucki\u2019s home. Since she felt that there were other families in the ward that needed that flour worse than she did, she declined to keep it, telling the young man that she was trying to teach her family to be independent and self-reliant. While worthy members of the Church should feel free to accept help from the Church proffered by the bishop, Sister Stucki was trying to teach the young man who came to her door a lesson. You see, the young man delivering the flour was her own son! All the surviving children attended college and became very successful people.

But those members who haven\u2019t begun early in their religious life may resolve to seek the Lord more diligently. We learn to recognize the Lord\u2019s hand in helping us. In hard times we have a chance to reevaluate and reorder our priorities in life. We learn what is most important to us. The way is open to strengthen faith and testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p28\" class=\"\">Second, we may learn the need for humility.

Her herd was soon recognized as one of the finest in the area, and she was able to support her family and care for their needs. Until Karen was well into her eighties, she milked her cows night and morning and cared for her farm with the help of her sons and grandsons.

This seeking includes the payment of our tithes and a generous fast offering and thus being blessed both spiritually and temporally by our obedience. Seeking first the kingdom of God will involve striving to keep the law the Apostle James called \u201cthe royal law,\u201d which is, \u201cThou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26317\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26317)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26317)\">James 2:8<\/a><\/span>.) Seeking first the kingdom of God involves the keeping of the divine commandments. Spiritual strength comes from many sources, including personal prayer, the study of the scriptures, and the willingness to \u201csubmit to all things \u2026 the Lord seeth fit to inflict.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40499\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40499)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40499)\">Mosiah 3:19<\/a><\/span>.)

Budgeting money together will produce a special unity, as will the holding of family councils. We should work together toward storing a year\u2019s supply of food, clothing, and other necessities. In times of stress extra acts of kindness are particularly needed and appreciated. When there is limited money available, it is easier to teach children the wise use of money, including the need to save for the future. The family can be reminded to maintain an eternal perspective rather than concentrate on worldly possessions and wealth. Family organizations are helpful to render the individual help that may be needed. It is also important to learn how to accept family help graciously.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Exercise faith.<\/span> The Savior reminds us, \u201cAll things are possible to him that believeth.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33321\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33321)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33321)\">Mark 9:23<\/a><\/span>.)

In times of economic difficulty it may be necessary to work for less pay. We should be willing to learn new, marketable skills. There are a great many men who have found new joy and satisfaction in having a second career wholly unrelated to the work for which they were originally trained. Family members need to find ways to supplement income through appropriate work opportunities. Being flexible in our approach to our work opportunities may just make it possible to keep afloat financially. Giving a full day\u2019s work for a full day\u2019s pay has saved many jobs.
