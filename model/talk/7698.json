During this visit I traveled on the tube\u2014a subway system of underground trains that people use frequently to get from place to place. In each of these busy subway stations, there are warning signs about dangers that people may encounter. Lights flash on and off to notify people that a train is approaching and they need to stand back. There is also a sign to remind people that there is danger\u2014a gap between the train and the station platform. The sign says, \u201cMind the Gap.\u201d This reminds people not to let their foot get caught in the gap and not to drop anything in the gap because it will go under the train and be lost. The caution sign is needed and warns people of a very real danger.

For many, this is an exciting time when we feel that we are adults and ready to take on the world and conquer it. For young women in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, this is also a time when we complete many of our Personal Progress goals, come into Relief Society, and accept callings of service in the Church. Our testimonies have been strengthened in Young Women, and we have mapped out a set of goals that will lead us to temple marriage and eternal families of our own.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/mind-the-gap.p21\" class=\"\">Unfortunately, some of our younger sisters are taking a \u201cleave of absence\u201d from full participation in the gospel and in Relief Society.

My husband was to have a large income so I wouldn\u2019t need to work, and then I planned to do Church and community service. Thankfully, one of my goals was to be an active and faithful member of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/mind-the-gap.p23\" class=\"\">Well, as you may know, many of my goals were not realized in the way I had hoped. I finished college, served a mission, got a job, continued on with my schooling to earn a master\u2019s degree, and continued working in my profession for many years. (I thought marriage was sure to happen 13 years ago when I opened a fortune cookie and read, \u201cYou will be married in less than a year.\u201d) But there was no handsome man, no marriage, and no children. Nothing had gone as I had planned except for one thing. I tried to be an active and faithful member of the Church. For this I am most grateful. It has made all the difference in my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/mind-the-gap.p24\" class=\"\">I had the opportunity to serve many years in Young Women and felt that gave me an opportunity to teach and testify to younger women who were developing their testimonies and seeking to progress in God\u2019s appointed way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/mind-the-gap.p25\" class=\"\">I also had the opportunity to serve in Relief Society callings, which helped me to learn to serve others and increase my faith and gave me a great feeling of belonging. Even though I wasn\u2019t married and had no children, I felt my life had meaning. There were times of discouragement, and at times I questioned the plan.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/mind-the-gap.p26\" class=\"\">One work colleague who was not a member of our Church said to me, \u201cWhy do you continue to go to a church that puts so much emphasis on marriage and families?\u201d My simple answer to her was, \u201cBecause it is true!\u201d I can be just as single and just as childless outside of the Church. But with the Church and gospel of Jesus Christ in my life, I found happiness and I knew I was on the path the Savior would have me follow.
