This was an honor and a real temptation. However, in my early life I had definitely decided that I would like to go on a mission, and I could now see that if I accepted the Naval Academy appointment I probably would not be able to serve as a missionary.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/thy-will-be-done-o-lord.p33\" class=\"\">After prayerful consideration I declined the appointment, as I felt it was the will of the Lord that I go on a mission.

Roberts, in his letter of release to me, promised me that I would \u201cfind new beginnings from time to time \u2026 even more missions.\u201d As I left the mission field I prayed fervently and at length that this promise might be fulfilled. Twenty-four years later it was partially fulfilled when I was called to be the stake mission president of the East Mill Creek Stake. At that time Elder Gordon B. Hinckley was president of that stake, and also at that time President Harold B. Lee gave me a beautiful blessing as he set me apart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/thy-will-be-done-o-lord.p36\" class=\"\">Four years later it was further realized when I was called to preside over the Northwestern States Mission.

Others who have been called to important church assignments have set aside, to a large extent, their personal affairs, to give the needed attention to the work of the Lord; and all have borne witness of the happiness and blessings they and their families have received.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/thy-will-be-done-o-lord.p38\" class=\"\">In my opinion, the strength and vitality of the Church is due, to a large extent, to the willingness of its members to live the principle, \u201cThy will be done, not mine.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/thy-will-be-done-o-lord.p39\" class=\"\">In 1959 when I received my call to preside over the Northwestern States Mission, it came at a most inconvenient time.
