Tom Perry made reference this afternoon to additional millions and millions of people who now may hear the glorious message of the restored gospel. The Lord has, in the recent past, opened the doors of nations long denied the blessings of gospel covenants. Elder Perry reissued the Lord\u2019s clarion call for every worthy young man to serve a mission. With a deep desire to in no way detract from his clear and urgent message, I would like to ask the question, What kind of missionaries must they be?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-disciple-of-jesus-christ.p5\" class=\"\">The Church was less than eighteen months old when the Lord encouraged the early Saints by saying: \u201cWherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work.

Elder Heber C. Kimball recorded: \u201cThe Prophet Joseph came to me \u2026 and \u2026 said, \u2018Brother Heber, the Spirit of the Lord has whispered to me: \u201cLet my servant Heber go to England and proclaim my Gospel, and open the door of salvation to that nation.\u201d\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-disciple-of-jesus-christ.p9\" class=\"\">The thought was overpowering. \u201cO, Lord,\u201d wrote Elder Kimball, \u201cI am a man of stammering tongue, and altogether unfit for such a work; how can I go to preach in that land, which is so famed throughout Christendom for learning, knowledge and piety; the nursery of religion; and to a people whose intelligence is proverbial!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-disciple-of-jesus-christ.p10\" class=\"\">Note this: \u201cHowever, all these considerations did not deter me from the path of duty; the moment I understood the will of my Heavenly Father, I felt a determination to go at all hazards, believing that He would support me by His almighty power, and endow me with every qualification that I needed.\u201d (In Orson F.

When I left them, my feelings were such as I cannot describe. As I walked down the street I was followed by numbers; the doors were crowded by the inmates of the houses to bid me farewell, who could only give vent to their grief in sobs. \u2026 While contemplating this scene I was constrained to take off my hat, for I felt as if the place was holy ground. The Spirit of the Lord rested down upon me and I was constrained to bless that whole region of country. \u2026 My heart was like unto theirs, and I thought my head was a fountain of tears, for I wept for several miles after I bid them adieu.\u201d (Ibid., p. 187.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-disciple-of-jesus-christ.p13\" class=\"\">The Lord needs missionaries with a willing heart and mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-disciple-of-jesus-christ.p14\" class=\"\">Truly effective missionaries have many talents, varied and beautiful, but one quality they all seem to have is the ability to stick with their commitments\u2014that is, the power to <span class=\"emphasis\">do<\/span> what they agree to do. They tell themselves to get up in the morning, on time, and do it. They don\u2019t depend on companions, district leaders, or anyone else. They commit to the mission president that they will follow the gospel study program every morning and not run out of steam in a few days. They understand that the Lord has called them to teach and testify, baptize and build the kingdom in His name, and they are happily at their work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-disciple-of-jesus-christ.p15\" class=\"\">From whence came this power to make a decision and stay with it?

Monson spoke at the general priesthood meeting concerning a very important message. It has been published for all of us in a pamphlet called <span class=\"emphasis\">For the Strength of Youth. <\/span>Permit me to read a short paragraph: \u201cSome people knowingly break God\u2019s commandments. They plan to repent before they go on a mission or receive the sacred covenants and ordinances of the temple. Repentance for such behavior is difficult and painful and may take a long time. It is better to not commit the sin. Certain sins are of such gravity that they can put your membership in the Church and your eternal life at risk. Sexual sins are among those of such seriousness.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">For the Strength of Youth,<\/span> Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1990, p. 17.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-disciple-of-jesus-christ.p17\" class=\"\">It is my judgment that some of our youth <span class=\"emphasis\">do not believe <\/span>that repentance for serious transgression \u201cis difficult and painful and may take a long time.\u201d Where has this grave misunderstanding come from?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-disciple-of-jesus-christ.p18\" class=\"\">To you young people, if any of us who are older have given you the impression that it isn\u2019t too serious to disobey the commandments of God, forgive us.
