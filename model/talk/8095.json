I feel the weight of that opportunity because I know something of the trust that the Lord has placed in you. With your acceptance of the priesthood, you have received the right to speak and to act in the name of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">That right will become a reality only as you receive inspiration from God. Only then will you be able to speak in His name. And only then can you act in His name. You might have made the mistake of thinking, \u201cOh, that isn\u2019t so difficult. I could get inspiration if I am ever asked to give a talk or if I ever need to give a priesthood blessing.\u201d Or the young deacon or teacher might take comfort in the thought, \u201cWhen I am older or when I am called as a missionary, then I will know what God would say and what God would do.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">But think of the day when you must know what God would say and what He would do. It has already come for us all\u2014wherever you are in your calling in the priesthood. I grew up in the mission field in the eastern United States during World War II. The members of the Church lived far apart, and there was strict gas rationing. I was the only deacon in the branch. The members gave their fast-offering envelopes to the branch president when they came to fast and testimony meeting in our home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">When I was 13 years old, we moved to Utah to live in a large ward. I remember my first assignment to walk to homes to collect fast offerings. I looked at the name on one of the envelopes I was given and noticed the last name was the same as one of the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon. So I knocked on the door with confidence. The man opened the door, looked at me, scowled, and then barked at me to go away. I went away with my head down.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">That was nearly 70 years ago, but I still remember the feeling I had that day on the doorstep that there was something I was supposed to have said or done. If only I had prayed in faith as I went out that day, I might have been inspired to stand a moment longer on that doorstep, smile, and say something like: \u201cIt is good to meet you. Thank you for what you and your family have given in the past. I look forward to seeing you next month.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">Had I said and done that, he might have been even more irritated\u2014and even offended. But I know now how I might have felt. Rather than feeling sadness or failure as I walked away, I might have felt the soft commendation in my mind and heart: \u201cWell done.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">All of us must speak and act in the name of God in moments when our unaided judgment will not be enough without inspiration. Those moments can come upon us when there is not time to make preparation. That has happened to me often. It did many years ago in a hospital when a father told me and my companion that the doctors had told him that his critically injured three-year-old daughter would die within minutes. As I placed my hands on the one spot on her head not covered with bandages, I had to know, as God\u2019s servant, what He would do and say.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">The words came to my mind and my lips that she would live. The doctor standing by me snorted in disgust and asked me to get out of the way. I walked out of that hospital room with a feeling of peace and love. The little girl lived and walked down the aisle into a sacrament meeting on my last day in that city. I still remember the joy and satisfaction I felt from what I had said and done in the Lord\u2019s service for that little girl and her family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">The difference in my feelings at the hospital and the sadness I felt as I walked away from that door as a deacon came from what I had learned about the connection of prayer to priesthood power. As a deacon, I had not yet learned that the power to speak and act in God\u2019s name requires revelation and that to have it when we need it requires praying and working in faith for the companionship of the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">On the evening before I went to that door for fast offerings, I had said my prayers at bedtime. But for weeks and months before that phone call came from the hospital, I had followed a pattern of prayer and made the effort that President Joseph\u00a0F. Smith taught will allow God to give us the inspiration necessary for us to have power in the priesthood. He put it simply:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">\u201cWe do not have to cry unto him with many words. We do not have to weary him with long prayers. What we do need, and what we should do as Latter-day Saints, for our own good, is to go before him often, to witness unto him that we remember him and that we are willing to take upon us his name, keep his commandments, work righteousness; and that we desire his Spirit to help us.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-12455_000_031\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph\u00a0F.

He said: \u201cWhat do you pray for? You pray that God may recognize you, that he may hear your prayers, and that he may bless you with his Spirit.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-12455_000_031\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings: Joseph\u00a0F.

It is an approach to your Heavenly Father with the intent to be recognized by Him personally. He is the God above all, the Father of all, and yet willing to give undivided attention to one of His children. That may be why the Savior used the words \u201cOur Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-12455_000_031\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130726\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130726)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130726)\">Luke 11:2<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">It is easier to get the proper feeling of reverence when you are kneeling or bowing your head, but it is possible to feel that you are approaching your Heavenly Father in less formal and even in silent prayer, as you will often need to do in your priesthood service. There will be noise and people around you most of your waking day. God hears your silent prayers, but you may have to learn to shut out the distractions because the moment you need the connection with God may not come in quiet times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">President Smith suggested that you will need to pray that God will recognize your call to serve Him.

Think of the families or even individuals you have been called to serve.

You will need the Holy Ghost not once but as much as God will grant it to you for your constant companion. That is why we must always pray that God will guide us in our service to His children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p28\" class=\"\" id=\"p28\">Because you cannot rise to your priesthood potential without the Spirit going with you, you are a personal target for the enemy of all happiness.

That is why President Smith said that you should always pray that God will warn and protect you from evil.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-12455_000_031\">6<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings: Joseph\u00a0F.

You must pray that God will bless you with His Spirit, that He will lead you into all truth and show you the right way.

I\u2019m thinking of a meeting for our group next Monday. Two members can take us for a tour of the Conference Center. We could use some members to drive them and some Scouts to push wheelchairs. Depending upon who signs up, we may have enough oldsters to do it ourselves, but it would be good to know we have backup if needed.
