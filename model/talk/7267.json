Members who take the sacrament are reminded to take upon themselves the name of the Son, always remember Him, keep His commandments, and seek to have His Spirit to be with them.

They began to think of it as a chore, something that no one else wanted to do. They often came in late, and sometimes they didn\u2019t dress appropriately. One Sunday their priesthood adviser told them: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about the sacrament today. It\u2019s been taken care of.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/a-royal-priesthood.p7\" class=\"\">They were, of course, surprised to hear this, but as usual, they were late for sacrament meeting.

That\u2019s when they noticed who was sitting on the deacons\u2019 bench\u2014their adviser and the high priests of the ward, who included men who had served as bishops and stake president. They were all dressed in dark suits with white shirts and ties. But more than that, their bearing was one of total reverence as they took the sacrament trays from row to row. Something was deeper and more significant about the sacrament that day. Those deacons who had become so perfunctory in their duties learned by example that passing the sacrament was a sacred trust and one of the greatest of honors.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-26905_000_020\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Adapted from Laird Roberts, \u201cOn Water and Bread,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Tambuli,<\/span> Oct. 1984, 40\u201341; <span class=\"emphasis\">New Era,<\/span> May 1984, 8\u20139.]<\/span><\/sup> They began to realize that the priesthood is, as the Apostle Peter called it, \u201ca royal priesthood.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-26905_000_020\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44884\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44884)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44884)\">1 Pet. 2:9<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/a-royal-priesthood.p8\" class=\"\">Generally, the Aaronic Priesthood, under the direction of the bishopric, has the responsibility to administer and pass the sacrament.

In ancient and modern times angels have appeared and given instruction, warnings, and direction, which benefited the people they visited. We do not consciously realize the extent to which ministering angels affect our lives. President Joseph F. Smith said, \u201cIn like manner our fathers and mothers, brothers, sisters and friends who have passed away from this earth, having been faithful, and worthy to enjoy these rights and privileges, may have a mission given them to visit their relatives and friends upon the earth again, bringing from the divine Presence messages of love, of warning, or reproof and instruction, to those whom they had learned to love in the flesh.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-26905_000_020\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Doctrine,<\/span> 5th ed.

As a young man, he was numbered among the unbelievers and \u201cled many of the people to do after the manner of his iniquities.\u201d One day, \u201cwhile he was going about to destroy the church of God\u201d in company with the sons of Mosiah, an \u201cangel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake.\u201d The angel then cried out, \u201cAlma, arise and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/a-royal-priesthood.p12\" class=\"\">Alma was so overcome by this experience that he fainted and had to be carried to his father.

Laman and Lemuel, on the other hand, did not believe, nor did they change their behavior as a result of the angelic visit.
