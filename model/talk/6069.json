This salvation requires more than repentance and baptism by appropriate priesthood authority. It also requires the making of sacred covenants, including eternal marriage, in the temples of God, and faithfulness to those covenants by enduring to the end. If we use the word <span class=\"emphasis\">salvation<\/span> to mean \u201cexaltation,\u201d it is premature for any of us to say that we have been \u201csaved\u201d in mortality. That glorious status can only follow the final judgment of Him who is the Great Judge of the living and the dead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/have-you-been-saved.p30\" class=\"\">I have suggested that the short answer to the question of whether a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been saved or born again must be a fervent \u201cyes.\u201d Our covenant relationship with our Savior puts us in that \u201csaved\u201d or \u201cborn again\u201d condition meant by those who ask this question. Some modern prophets have also used \u201csalvation\u201d or \u201csaved\u201d in that same present sense. President Brigham Young declared:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/have-you-been-saved.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cIt is present salvation and the present influence of the Holy Ghost that we need every day to keep us on saving ground. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/have-you-been-saved.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cI want present salvation. \u2026 Life is for us, and it is for us to receive it today, and not wait for the Millennium.

After many years of Communist hostility to religion, these countries were suddenly and miraculously given a measure of religious freedom. When that door opened, many Christian faiths sent missionaries. As part of our preparation to do so, the First Presidency sent members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to meet with government and church leaders in these countries. Our assignment was to introduce ourselves and to explain what our missionaries would be doing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/have-you-been-saved.p36\" class=\"\">Elder Russell M. Nelson and I called on the leader of the Orthodox Church in one of these countries. Here was a man who had helped keep the light of Christianity burning through the dark decades of Communist repression. I noted in my journal that he was a warm and gracious man who impressed me as a servant of the Lord. I mention this so that you will not think there was any spirit of arrogance or contention in our conversation of nearly an hour. Our visit was pleasant and cordial, filled with the goodwill that should always characterize conversations between men and women who love the Lord and seek to serve Him, each according to his or her own understanding.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/have-you-been-saved.p37\" class=\"\">Our host told us about the activities of his church during the period of Communist repression. He described the various difficulties his church and its work were experiencing as they emerged from that period and sought to regain their former position in the life of the country and the hearts of the people. We introduced ourselves and our fundamental beliefs. We explained that we would soon be sending missionaries into his country and told him how they would perform their labors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/have-you-been-saved.p38\" class=\"\">He asked, \u201cWill your missionaries preach only to unbelievers, or will they also try to preach to believers?\u201d We replied that our message was for everyone, believers as well as unbelievers. We gave two reasons for this answer\u2014one a matter of principle and the other a matter of practicality. We told him that we preached to believers as well as unbelievers because our message, the restored gospel, makes an important addition to the knowledge, happiness, and peace of all mankind. As a matter of practicality, we preach to believers as well as unbelievers because we cannot tell the difference. I remember asking this distinguished leader, \u201cWhen you stand before a congregation and look into the faces of the people, can you tell the difference between those who are real believers and those who are not?\u201d He smiled wryly, and I sensed an admission that he had understood the point.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/have-you-been-saved.p39\" class=\"\">Through missionaries and members, the message of the restored gospel is going to all the world. To non-Christians, we witness of Christ and share the truths and ordinances of His restored gospel. To Christians we do the same. Even if a Christian has been \u201csaved\u201d in the familiar single sense discussed earlier, we teach that there remains more to be learned and more to be experienced. As President Hinckley recently said, \u201c[We are] not argumentative. We do not debate. We, in effect, simply say to others, \u2018Bring all the good that you have and let us see if we can add to it\u2019\u201d (\u201cThe BYU Experience,\u201d BYU devotional address, 4 Nov. 1997).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/have-you-been-saved.p40\" class=\"\">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints offers all of the children of God the opportunity to learn the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ as restored in these latter days.
