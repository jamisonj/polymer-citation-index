It was cattle country. The road was straight and narrow for numerous miles, and on either side was a four-wire barbed fence. Parallel to the fence line was a series of poles on which were strung the wires for telephone communication to the world. Upon each telephone pole was a crossbar, and strung from crossbar to crossbar were the communication lines.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p15\" class=\"\">As we traveled along where the grass had been heavy but now was burned, we found where some of the telephone poles, being in the wake of the fire, were burned off near the ground. Someone had carelessly thrown a lighted cigarette from a car window. It had ignited the grass, the telephone communications were ended or limited, and communication was down.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p16\" class=\"\">Nearly all the poles for a distance were scorched or burned. Some had been burned off the first few feet from the ground and were hanging by the top part in the air from the wires they were intended to support. Dangling in the air, these sagging wires had let the poles touch the ground as they were swinging in the wind, each time creating static on the line.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p17\" class=\"\">The poles had been set to hold up the lines, but here they were sagging.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p18\" class=\"\">Many a time during the three years that I was in charge of the work in South America, I tried to get long-distance calls through to these distant places. When the connection was made, almost invariably there would be static, and the words were cut in two and grating sounds were heard. In my mind\u2019s eye I could see the telephone line on the Salta Road swaying in the breeze, hitting the ground and occasionally breaking connection.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p19\" class=\"\">I thought that telephone lines and telephone poles are a little like people. They are built for one purpose and sometimes serve another. They are designed to be firm and stout and to give support; but in many cases they are leaning and swaying and sagging until communications are greatly impaired, if not actually cut off.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p20\" class=\"\">In my experience I find that in a large number of marital cases, the problem is lack of communication; the wires are down, the poles are burned, husbands and wives are jangling, and there is static where there should be peace. There is growing disgust and hate where there should be love and harmony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p21\" class=\"\">This typical young couple, only a few hectic years into their eternal marriage\u2014only two children away from the eternal vows they had made in the holy temple of God\u2014were each going a separate way. Their ideas of life were different as to spiritual matters (as well as many others)\u2014one wishing to move along almost to what the other thought was fanaticism and the other moving along in a path that the other spouse thought to be almost apostasy; and both were wrong.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p22\" class=\"\">They talked about it and lost their tempers and drew farther and farther away from their common goal. Both were good people basically, but they needed unburned telephone poles and untangled wires of communication that were now sagging. Their inability to communicate in reasonableness led to anger, hard words, misunderstandings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p23\" class=\"\">In time, each found another person and set up different communication lines for sympathy and understanding and comfort; and this disloyalty led to physical adventures that resulted in adulteries and two broken homes and disillusioned spouses and crushed hopes and injured children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p24\" class=\"\">And all this because two basically good people let their communication lines get down and permitted the security poles to drag the ground. This is not one couple, it is tens of thousands of couples who started out in a blaze of glory, sweet felicity, and an interresponsibility and with the highest of hopes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p25\" class=\"\">At a distant stake conference one Sunday I was approached after the meeting by a young man whose face was familiar. He identified himself as a returned missionary whom I had met out in the world a few years ago. He said he had not attended the conference but had come at its conclusion, wanting to say hello. Our greetings were pleasant and revived some choice memories. I asked him about himself. He was in college, still single, and fairly miserable.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p26\" class=\"\">I asked him about his service in the Church, and the light in his eyes went out and a dull, disappointed face fashioned itself as he said, \u201cI am not very active in the Church now. I don\u2019t feel the same as I used to feel in the mission field. What I used to think was a testimony has become something of a disillusionment. If there is a God, I am not sure any more. I must have been mistaken in my zeal and joy.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p27\" class=\"\">I looked him through and through and asked him some questions: \u201cWhat do you do in your leisure?

What are your associations?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p28\" class=\"\">The answers were what I expected. He had turned loose his hold on the iron rod. He associated largely with unbelievers. He read, in addition to his college texts, works by atheists, apostates, and Bible critics. He had ceased to pray to his Heavenly Father. His communication poles were burned, and his lines were sagging terribly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p29\" class=\"\">I asked him now, \u201cHow many times since your mission have you read the New Testament?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cNot any time,\u201d was the answer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cHow many times have you read the Book of Mormon through?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p32\" class=\"\">The answer was, \u201cNone.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/keep-the-lines-of-communication-strong.p33\" class=\"\">\u201cHow many chapters of scripture have you read?

He was not receiving all the things he could have had.
