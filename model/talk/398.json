Petersen<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Mark E. Petersen, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1949, pp. 144-146<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nFive years ago, I stood at this pulpit trembling from head to foot, when I accepted a call to\nthe Council of the Twelve. I have lived now these five years, in close association with the\nmen you sustained today as the leaders of this Church. I have come to know them well. I\nknew most of them well before I came to this position, but not nearly so well as I now know\nthem.\n<\/p><p>\nGREAT MEN\n<\/p><p>\nI have discovered that these men are great men&mdash;great in the sense of true greatness. I know\nthat in the Presidency of the Church are men who are great in the same sense in which\nLincoln was great. I know they are prophets of God in the same sense in which Moses and\nJeremiah and Elijah, Peter and Paul were prophets of God. I have discovered that these men\ndo not have any selfish motives, that they are giving of their time and their talents, of their\nphysical and mental and spiritual strength, giving all they have for the upbuilding of the\nkingdom of God. I have discovered that they are honest and true; that they are faithful and\ndevoted; that they love the Lord their God with all their hearts, and with all their souls. I\nknow that they are men of God in the real sense of the word.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so I was thrilled as you voted here today on these men, thrilled to see this vast ocean of\nhands come up in a sustaining vote for these men whom you accept as your prophets, seers,\nand revelators. As I saw those hands, and raised mine with yours, I couldn't help thinking of\nsome of the insulting letters that come to these brethren from men and women who think that\nthese men would lead you astray&mdash;letters from men and women who do have selfish\nmotives&mdash;letters from people who would trip up the prophets of God if they only could.\n<\/p><p>\nGUIDED BY HOLY GHOST\n<\/p><p>\nI want to bear you my testimony, and I do it with God as my witness, that these men who\nlead your Church are honest, true, great men of God; that they do receive the revelation and\nthe inspiration of the Almighty; that they are guided by the Holy Ghost: that this is God's\nChurch; and that if you desire to have guidance from heaven, then you follow the guidance of\nthese men whom you sustain as the prophets of God. They are prophets. They are prophets\njust as Jeremiah and Moses were prophets. They are Apostles in the same sense in which\nPeter, James, and John were Apostles, because those three gave the powers of the apostleship\nto modern men, and those powers have been handed down to the men who stand and sit\nbefore you today.\n<\/p><p>\nI think it is a very serious thing when anybody raises his hand against the prophets of God.\nHave you read carefully the story, of Jeremiah in the Old Testament and seen there how men\nand women raised their hands and their voices and their heels against the prophet\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26472\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26472)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26472)\">Jer. 20:1-2<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26473\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26473)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26473)\">Jer. 26:8-11<\/a><\/span>)? I want you\nto know that it is just as serious for us who live today to raise our hands against these modern\nprophets as it was for ancient Israel to raise their hands against Jeremiah whom they put in a\ndungeon and whom they would have been glad to see die\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26475\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26475)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26475)\">Jer. 37:15-16<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26476\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26476)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26476)\">Jer. 38:6-13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA GREAT CHURCH\n<\/p><p>\nThis is a great Church. It is indeed the kingdom of God. We have a great man at the head of\nthe Church. He is the revelator, the seer, and the prophet of God in this day. It is a reality\nthat we walk in the presence of a living prophet of God. Let us be willing to accept him as\nsuch. And these others who uphold his hands and sustain him, likewise are the prophets of the\nLord.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful for the experience of the past five years. I have learned a better appreciation of\nthis, the great restored Church, of its principles, of the men who lead it. I humbly submit to\nyou my solemn testimony that Mormonism is true, that the restored Church, the Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is God's own Church, and that through it we find salvation.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we have the courage to live the gospel. May we have the courage to keep the\ncommandments. May we have the loyalty to stand by and follow the leaders, whom God has\nplaced in the earth in these last days is my humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
