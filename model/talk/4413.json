We go, of course, to renew our covenants in partaking of the sacrament. This is the most important element of these meetings. And we also go to be instructed, to meditate upon the things of God, and to worship the Lord in spirit and in truth. We go because of the commandment of the Lord, who said in revelation:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cThou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteousness, even that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cFor verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18618\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18618)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18618)\">D&amp;C 59:8\u201310<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p9\" class=\"\">We need, every one of us needs, to pause from the hectic pace of our lives and to reflect upon things sacred and divine. I recall that when I was a missionary in London, England, more than fifty years ago, we held our meetings in the Battersea town hall, which we rented. The floors were hard, and we sat on chairs. Every time a chair moved there was a noise. But this was not the worst aspect of the situation. Far worse was the noisy socializing of the members of the branch.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p10\" class=\"\">On one occasion we invited a family whom we had met while tracting. With great expectation we as missionaries stood by the door to welcome them. There was the usual convivial spirit in the hall, with the members talking noisily one with another. When this family came into the room, they quietly moved toward some chairs, knelt for a moment, and closed their eyes in a word of prayer. They then sat in an attitude of reverence amidst all the commotion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p11\" class=\"\">Frankly, I was embarrassed. They had come to what they regarded as a worship service, and they behaved themselves accordingly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p12\" class=\"\">At the close of the meeting they left quietly, and when we next met they spoke of their disappointment in what they had experienced. I have never forgotten that.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p13\" class=\"\">I invite you brethren of the priesthood, wherever you may be, and particularly you members of bishoprics, to begin an earnest effort to cultivate a more beautiful spirit of worship in our sacrament meetings and an attitude of increased reverence generally in our church buildings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p14\" class=\"\">I am grateful that we now have carpeted aisles in our chapels, and in many of the newer buildings, carpet over the entire floor. Fixed pews are in place rather than folding chairs. In planning, in renovating, in maintaining our structures, we ought always to have in mind the importance of those physical aspects which contribute to a spirit of worship.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p15\" class=\"\">Music, of course, is an important factor. Our buildings for the most part are equipped with organs, which when properly played, can add much to the worship atmosphere of the service. The singing of hymns and the rendition of selections from the great sacred oratorios by ward choirs all enhance the spirit of worship.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p16\" class=\"\">Socializing is an important aspect of our program as a church. We encourage the cultivation of friends with happy conversations among our people. However, these should take place in the foyer, and when we enter the chapel we should understand that we are in sacred precincts. All of us are familiar with the account in Exodus of the Lord\u2019s appearance to Moses at the burning bush. When the Lord called, Moses answered, \u201cHere am I\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22957\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22957)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22957)\">Ex. 3:4<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p17\" class=\"\">And the Lord said, \u201cDraw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22958\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22958)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22958)\">Ex. 3:5<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p18\" class=\"\">We do not ask our people to remove their shoes when they come into the chapel. But all who come into the Lord\u2019s house should have a feeling that they are walking and standing on holy ground and that it becomes them to deport themselves accordingly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p19\" class=\"\">The example of those on the stand will do much to create the proper atmosphere. If there is preparation beforehand, if there is a brief prayer meeting preceding the service, it would be exceptional when there might be any need for conversation among those seated on the stand while the service is in progress.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p20\" class=\"\">The young men of the Aaronic Priesthood should be trained to know that the sacrament which they administer is sacred and holy unto the Lord. Encouragement and training should be given to see that the prayers are spoken plainly and in a spirit of communion with our Father in Heaven. The priest at the sacrament table places all in the congregation under sacred covenant. The offering of the prayer is not a ritual to be thoughtlessly spoken. It is, rather, the voicing of an obligation and a promise. Cleanliness of hands, as well as purity of heart, should be taught to the priests who officiate at the sacrament table.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p21\" class=\"\">At the conclusion of the administration of the sacrament, it is not uncommon for the priests and even the deacons to leave their places and scatter all over the chapel. Possibly the bench on which the priests sit is not comfortable. If so, perhaps space could be reserved on the front row to which they could quietly move at the conclusion of the sacrament service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p22\" class=\"\">Most important of all is the training of our people, and particularly our young people, in the importance of reverence in the chapel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p23\" class=\"\">I wish that every father in the Church would make this a matter of discussion with his family at the next family home evening and occasionally in family home evenings thereafter. The subject for discussion might be something like this: \u201cWhat each of us can do to improve the spirit of our sacrament meetings.\u201d Wonderful things will happen if this is done.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p24\" class=\"\">With our block-plan scheduling, three hours is a long time for a small child to sit in meetings. It is a long time for a mother who has small children around her. But with thoughtful training and careful consideration of all elements of the situation, a great improvement can be brought to pass. Mothers with small babies may plan to sit near the aisle so that, if necessary, they can leave quietly to care for their children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p25\" class=\"\">To ancient Israel Jehovah said, \u201cYe shall keep my sabbaths, and <span class=\"emphasis\">reverence my sanctuary:<\/span> I am the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30943\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30943)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30943)\">Lev. 19:30<\/a><\/span>; italics added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p26\" class=\"\">Brethren, we ask that you discuss this important matter in your homes and that you who are officers discuss it in your planning meetings. There is much room for improvement, and with a little effort it can happen. As reverence is improved, all will be blessed. I leave the matter in your hands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p27\" class=\"\">I speak next on an item of great delicacy. I pondered much over whether it should be discussed in the leadership meeting last night or whether it should be discussed in this general priesthood meeting. I concluded that the subject is of such widespread concern and that some knowledge about it is had so generally, even by boys and girls of the deacons\u2019 age, that I might properly treat it here. I do so with sensitivity for the nature of the subject.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/reverence-and-morality.p28\" class=\"\">There is a plague of fearsome dimensions moving across the world.
