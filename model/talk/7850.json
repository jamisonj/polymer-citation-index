We meet each six months to strengthen one another, to extend encouragement, to provide comfort, to build faith. We are here to learn. Some of you may be seeking answers to questions and challenges you are experiencing in your life. Some are struggling with disappointments or losses. Each can be enlightened and uplifted and comforted as the Spirit of the Lord is felt.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/as-we-gather-once-again.p5\" class=\"\">Should there be changes which need to be made in your life, may you find the incentive and the courage to do so as you listen to the inspired words which will be spoken. May each of us resolve anew to live so that we are worthy sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. May we continue to oppose evil wherever it is found.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/as-we-gather-once-again.p6\" class=\"\">How blessed we are to have come to earth at such a time as this\u2014a marvelous time in the long history of the world. We can\u2019t all be together under one roof, but we now have the ability to partake of the proceedings of this conference through the wonders of television, radio, cable, satellite transmission, and the Internet\u2014even on mobile devices. We come together as one, speaking many languages, living in many lands, but all of one faith and one doctrine and one purpose.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/as-we-gather-once-again.p7\" class=\"\">From a small beginning 182 years ago, our presence is now felt throughout the world. This great cause in which we are engaged will continue to go forth, changing and blessing lives as it does so. No cause, no force in the entire world can stop the work of God. Despite what comes, this great cause will go forward. You recall the prophetic words of the Prophet Joseph Smith: \u201cNo unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10405_000_004\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith<\/span> (2007), 444.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/as-we-gather-once-again.p8\" class=\"\">There is much that is difficult and challenging in the world today, my brothers and sisters, but there is also much that is good and uplifting.
