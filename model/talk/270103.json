I made some inquiry after his name, but received no definite answer. We soon\n  commenced talking on the subject of religion, and, after I had made some remarks concerning the\n  Bible, I commenced giving him a relation of the circumstances connected with the coming forth of\n  the Book of Mormon, as recorded in the former part of this history.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">While I was relating a brief history of the establishment of the Church of Christ<span class=\"footRef\">1<\/span> in the last days,\n  Joshua seemed to be highly entertained. When I had closed my narration, I observed that the hour\n  of worship and dinner had arrived, and invited him to tarry, to which he consented. After dinner, the\n  conversation was resumed, and Joshua proceeded to make some remarks on the prophecies, as\n  follows&mdash;he observed that he was aware that I could bear stronger meat<span class=\"footRef\">2<\/span> than many others, therefore\n  he should open his mind the more freely:<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">Daniel has told us that he is to stand in his proper lot,<span class=\"footRef\">3<\/span> in the latter days; according to his vision\n  he had a right to shut it up, and also to open it again after many days,<span class=\"footRef\">4<\/span> or in latter times. Daniel&rsquo;s\n  image, whose head was gold, and body, arms, legs and feet, were composed of the different\n  materials described in his vision,<span class=\"footRef\">5<\/span> represents different governments. The golden head was to\n  represent Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon;<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> the other parts, other kings and forms of governments\n  which I shall not now mention in detail, but confine my remarks more particularly to the feet of the\n  image.<span class=\"footRef\">7<\/span> The policy of the wicked spirit<span class=\"footRef\">8<\/span> is to separate what God has joined together,<span class=\"footRef\">9<\/span> and unite what\n  He has separated, which the devil has succeeded in doing to admiration in the present society, which\n  is like unto iron and clay.<span class=\"footRef\">10<\/span><\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112698\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112698)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112698)\">3 Ne. 26:21<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"113327\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 113327)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(113327)\">D&amp;C 20:1<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">2. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110169\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110169)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110169)\">Heb. 5:12,14<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">3. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107589\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107589)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107589)\">Dan. 12:13<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">4. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107571\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107571)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107571)\">Dan. 8:26<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">5. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107511\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107511)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107511)\">Dan. 2:31-33<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">6. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107513\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107513)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107513)\">Dan. 2:38<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">7. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107515\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107515)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107515)\">Dan. 2:41-43<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">8. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112017\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112017)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112017)\">Alma 22:15<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">9. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108118\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108118)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108118)\">Matt. 19:6<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">10. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107517\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107517)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107517)\">Dan. 2:43<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
