I think I shall name him: President Edward L.\nClissold from the Hawaiian Islands. We were boyhood chums together; went through grade\nschool together; were on missions together; and as I shook his hand and felt the strength of\nthose long years of friendship and common ideals, I was singularly impressed with the power\nof unity; and during the morning session yesterday, as we listened to the message of the living\nprophet of Almighty God, I was impressed again with his iteration of the need for unity.\n<\/p><p>\nUNITY AN ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE\n<\/p><p>\nWe are gathered here together at a particularly significant season, even though it be more or\nless paganistically celebrated by the Christian world; a season whose significance is genuinely\nappreciated only by Latter-day Saints. The Savior not long before he went to His crucifixion\nadmonished the Twelve and then He prayed to His Father in Heaven, and among other things\nHe said these words:\n<\/p><p>\nHoly Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be\none as we are;. . . and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they might also be sanctified\nthrough the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which believe on me\nthrough their word, that they may all be one, as thou, Father, art in me and I in thee, that they\nalso may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory\nwhich thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them\nand thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; that the world may know that thou\nhast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27165\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27165)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27165)\">John 17:11,19-23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nDisunity is forever a destructive force whether it be war among nations; whether it be civil\nstrife within the state; whether it be schism within the Church, discord within the family, or\neven turmoil and conflict within the soul of the individual person; for a man divided against\nhimself can no more stand than a divided house. A society cannot be unified except as its\nmembers are one together and except as individually they are one with themselves. The matter\nof wholeness is essential.\n<\/p><p>\nCAUSES FOR DELINQUENCY\n<\/p><p>\nModern psychologists have said much in recent years about the integrated personality, and our\nhospitals for mental defectives are full of persons suffering from conflicts within themselves.\nThey are not whole. It is profoundly significant that this word \"whole\" is used frequently as a\nsynonym for \"health.\" You remember when the Pharisees saw the Savior sitting at meat with\nPublicans, sinners, and so on, they found fault with Him, and He told them\nthat the whole have no need of a physician\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33896\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33896)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33896)\">Matt. 9:10-12<\/a><\/span>).\nIt is the basic business of the Gospel of Jesus\nChrist to bring about a oneness, a wholeness in the individual, a wholeness collectively among\nthe children of God. I should like to leave this one idea this afternoon in the matter of helping\nthe individual to be whole.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have heard a good deal about juvenile delinquency, a grave problem; and one of the\nalarming, particularly alarming, aspects of our present juvenile delinquency is that not so great\na percentage of it any longer comes from the broken home. While the broken home is still a\ntremendous contributing factor, we are alarmed to find out that among the so-called \"best\nfamilies\" many young persons are running amuck, I am of the opinion that much of this\ndelinquency is the result of conflicts within the individual souls of the young people. What of\nparents who actually foster and abet internal conflict in their children? I am speaking of\nLatter-day Saints, or at least members of the Church, who, through certain Church loyalty,\nsend their children to their Church meetings, their Primary and their M.I.A. and their Sunday\nSchool; who have their sons go to Priesthood meetings and in due course encourage them to\nreceive the Priesthood and yet who, in their own homes, do not set worthy examples. In such\ncase, the youngster goes to Sunday School and is taught that he should be loyal to the\nChurch; he is taught the principles of the Gospel. He comes home only to find those\nprinciples disobeyed in his home. Moreover, the Church teaches him the words of the Savior\n\"Honor thy father and thy mother!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22543\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22543)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22543)\">Ex. 20:12<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33907\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33907)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33907)\">Matt. 15:4<\/a><\/span>).\nHere he is faced with a divided loyalty. If he is loyal to\nhis parents, how can he be loyal to the Church which teaches doctrines and advocates conduct\nwhich his parents by their very lives reject?\n<\/p><p>\nMany parents, in so simple a thing as keeping the Word of Wisdom excuse themselves\nsometimes on the basis of social exigency, sometimes on the basis of business exigency.\nThere is only one basis for it and that is either a lack of belief or moral cowardice. No parent\nwould deliberately subject his child to physical suffering. Any parent who would do that we\nwould say is cruel, and yet it is just as much an act of cruelty and ultimately more damaging,\nto impale the child on the horns of a dilemma of conflicting loyalties. He cannot be fully\nloyal to a Church which teaches one doctrine and fully loyal to parents who decline to\nobserve that doctrine. That conflict will be resolved either by the destruction of one or other\nor both of those loyalties. We need oneness.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Doctrine and Covenants has explained what the human soul is; what the soul of man is. The body and the\nspirit are the soul of man (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12009\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12009)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12009)\">D&amp;C 88:15<\/a><\/span>),\nand the purpose of our mortal sojourn is to bring about a complete\nfusion, to bring about an indissoluble oneness, of spirit and body. If parents will live\naccording to the Gospel, will send their children to be taught in Church organizations and\nindeed will augment that teaching with teaching and example in the home, then two great\nforces, the family and the Church, will converge upon the individual youngster to bring about\na wholeness, a spiritual health, a oneness without which neither happiness nor salvation can\nbe obtained.\n<\/p><p>\nHUNGER FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO BE CULTIVATED\n<\/p><p>\nWe have a grave responsibility to establish in our young people righteous hunger. Everyone\nof us knows that he has hungers for particular foods. Even now, when I'm very hungry the\nfirst thing I think of is a big bowl of beans and a piece of new bread and butter. Why?\nBecause as a youngster, every Monday afternoon that is what I got, and now when I am\nhungry nothing else tastes so good. We hunger for those things we are used to. When we are\nhungry, we don't think of a bowl of bird-nest soup, though thousands of Chinese do. These\nboys who have gone out into the service of their country and get away from home and look\nabout them for a Church to go to, hunt up other boys who are members of the Church and get\ntogether to meet. Why do they do it? Because they have a hunger in them established for it.\n\"Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33873\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33873)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33873)\">Matt. 5:6<\/a><\/span>). That is no mere figure of\nspeech. Those words were wisely chosen. If we deliberately implant righteous hungers in our\nchildren, then when they are from under our roof trees they will bend their dearest efforts to\nsatisfy the healthful appetite wise parentage has helped to cultivate. One can hunger for\nrighteousness just as one can develop evil appetites.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my prayer that we shall have the wisdom and the courage so to live that our very lives\nwill be dynamically persuasive examples to our young people of what the Church teaches, so\nthat we may not be guilty of inflicting upon them the agonies of conflicting loyalties, and I\nask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
