In the next few minutes I would like to explain the message of this church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p4\" class=\"\">It is the message of the restored gospel. I speak of the restoration, for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the restored church. In organization and power, it is as the Savior established it when he walked the earth. The Church of Jesus Christ of \u201cLatter-day Saints\u201d distinguishes it from the Church of Jesus Christ of former-day saints. It has been established in what the Lord has called \u201cthe dispensation of the fulness of times\u201d or the last gospel dispensation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p5\" class=\"\">The cornerstone of our message is the divine sonship of Christ. He was the Son of God, the Eternal Father, from whom he inherited immortality, or the power to live. He was the son of Mary, from whom he inherited mortality, or the power to die. Hence, he could say: \u201cNo man taketh \u2026 [my life] from me, but I lay it down of myself. \u2026 This commandment have I received of my Father.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28632\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28632)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28632)\">John 10:18<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p6\" class=\"\">As the Son of God, he had power to atone for the sins of all mankind. He broke the bonds of death, initiated the resurrection, and became the first fruits thereof. In another seven days, on Easter morning, the Christian world will celebrate the resurrection of our Savior. He arose from the grave, took up his earthly body, and, the scriptures say, \u201che shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God: \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p8\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 two men stood by them in white apparel;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cWhich also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, <span class=\"emphasis\">shall so come in like manner <\/span>as ye have see him go into heaven.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8122\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8122)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8122)\">Acts 1:3, 9\u201311<\/a><\/span>.

He came in the meridian of time as had been predicted. Old Testament prophets prophesied of his coming. The Lord promised Adam that a Messiah would come. In fact, the law of sacrifice was given to Adam and his posterity. It was symbolic of the death of the Lamb of God. This sacrifice was dramatically explained by Moses in the Feast of the Passover. A lamb, a male of the first year, without blemish, was to be slain. Its blood was to be shed, but no bones were to be broken. This ordinance was to turn men\u2019s hearts and minds <span class=\"emphasis\">toward <\/span>the day when the Lamb of God himself would be sacrificed for the sins of men. The sacrifice which the Father gave of his Only Begotten Son ended sacrifice by the shedding of blood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p12\" class=\"\">In its place and to point our minds <span class=\"emphasis\">back <\/span>to the atoning sacrifice, the Savior instituted the ordinance of the sacrament:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p13\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 the Lord Jesus \u2026 took bread:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cAfter the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cFor as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord\u2019s death till he come.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"534\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 534)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(534)\">1 Cor. 11:23\u201326<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p17\" class=\"\">We declare the divine Sonship of Christ.

The priesthood authority to administer the ordinances was lost. The Church dwindled in unbelief. Political power usurped what was left of the organization, and complete apostasy occurred. Just as this falling away was prophesied, so also was the time of restoration\u2014or \u201cthe times of restitution of all things.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8126\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8126)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8126)\">Acts 3:21<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p19\" class=\"\">In the spring of 1820 a boy not yet fifteen, whose \u201cmind was called up to serious reflection,\u201d pondered the question which, if any, church was true.

He prophesied. He taught gospel principles. He translated. He brought forth books of scripture\u2014both ancient and modern. He built temples and cities. He was a revealer of the knowledge of Christ. He was the authorized servant of God. He fulfilled every requirement to complete the profile of a prophet. In due time Joseph received the \u201ckeys of the kingdom.\u201d With this apostolic power he reestablished the true church in its fullness and power. The Lord said to him: \u201c\u2026 this generation shall have my word through you.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15683\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15683)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15683)\">D&amp;C 5:10<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p24\" class=\"\">There is no greater prophet in any dispensation than Joseph Smith. He translated the Book of Mormon from ancient plates. Its purpose is to be another witness that Jesus is the Christ. Concerning this book, the Lord declared: \u201cAnd he has translated the book, even that part which I have commanded him, and as your Lord and your God liveth it is true.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15692\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15692)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15692)\">D&amp;C 17:6<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p25\" class=\"\">We know that it is not a popular thing to teach that a backwoods boy from Vermont, reared in New England and trained on the frontier, was a prophet. But, popular or not, it is a fact! <span class=\"emphasis\">Joseph Smith was a prophet, and all of the calumny and aspersion to the contrary cannot controvert that fact. <\/span>Anyone who has concern for the welfare of his eternal soul should give attention to this message. Every man who has lived since the days of Joseph Smith is subject to accepting him as a prophet of God in order to enter into our Heavenly Father\u2019s presence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p26\" class=\"\">If you do not know of the divine calling of Joseph Smith, perhaps it is because you have not considered it.

At ninety-five he is moving a bit beyond middle age! But then, the Lord has never specified how old or young a prophet should be. Nor has he said how short or tall. He has not required that he be possessed of any particular academic degrees. But he has made it abundantly clear that he must be \u201ccalled of God\u201d and empowered by <span class=\"emphasis\">him. <\/span>It is to be so called and ordained that qualifies President Joseph Fielding Smith. He is like other men, it is true. He will chuckle at a pleasantry. If you prick him he will bleed. His great tender heart will cause him to weep at another\u2019s sorrow. He is subject to sickness and pain. But there is one thing different about President Joseph Fielding Smith\u2014you see, he is the prophet of God. I know this man. I love him. He has lived a life of rigorous service in which there was always intense opposition from the evil one. He has withstood all of that. The Lord has honored him by this great call to be his prophet. I love the stalwart counselors at his side. I love the Twelve. I love all my brethren.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-message-of-the-restoration.p30\" class=\"\">Now, what is the destiny of this church? It will go forward. It cannot fail. It will grow until it fills the whole earth. With Christ at its head, in constant communication with the leaders of this church, we are destined to carry out the work God has assigned it. This church will carry the gospel message to all of our Father\u2019s children. It will save the living and the dead. This church will be maligned. It will be attacked. Many will doubt. Some will apostatize. However, it will bring the righteous and honest in heart into its fold and set their feet on the way to exaltation. Some think it strange today that so many Christian churches are empty. They wonder why this church progresses and grows. To us it is understandable. We know that an apostasy occurred in ancient days. We know that there has been a restoration of the true gospel in our day. We know that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been organized with power and authority and with a living prophet to head it. We know its great destiny, and we are willing to live in order to achieve it. We know Christ is our head. We believe in the final, inevitable triumph of truth expressed in the gospel of Jesus Christ. We know we shall succeed. We invite all men of goodwill to join us in achieving this great destiny. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
