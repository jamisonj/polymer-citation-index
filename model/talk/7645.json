People run from one new idea to the next, hoping to find something that will answer the burning questions of their souls. They attend seminars and buy books, CDs, and other products. They get caught up in the excitement of looking for something new. But inevitably, the flame of each new theory fades, only to be replaced by another \u201cnew and improved\u201d solution that promises to do what the others before could not.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/the-way-of-the-disciple.p15\" class=\"\">It\u2019s not that these worldly options don\u2019t contain elements of truth\u2014many of them do.

It springs from the pure and everlasting waters of the Creator of the universe, who knows truths we cannot even begin to comprehend.
