This couple has spent a lifetime of service, meekly, faithfully, and effectively trying to build up the Church in many places in the world. Elder Condie noted, \u201cIsn\u2019t it remarkable what people with five loaves and two fishes do to build up the kingdom of God.\u201d This kind of quiet, devoted service to me is surely a fulfillment of the word of God \u201cthat the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20023\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20023)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20023)\">D&amp;C 1:23<\/a><\/span>).

I refer to the marvels of modern transportation and the increasing sophistication of all scientific knowledge, including the new electronic highway. We have forgotten that this amazing knowledge comes to mankind only as God chooses to reveal it, and it should be used for purposes nobler and wiser than mere entertainment. This knowledge permits the words of the prophets of God to be bounced off satellites hovering over the earth so it is possible for much of mankind to hear their messages.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p15\" class=\"\">With this great knowledge has come also some skepticism about the simple and profound eternal truths taught in the miracle of the loaves and of the fishes\u2014namely, that God rules in the heavens and the earth through his infinite intelligence and goodness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p16\" class=\"\">We are also to understand and remember that we too, like the lad in the New Testament account, are the spirit children of our Heavenly Father, that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior, and the Redeemer of the world. We believe that in the centuries following the establishment of his kingdom upon the earth, the doctrines and the ordinances were changed, resulting in a falling away and the loss of the keys of priesthood authority from the earth. A miracle even greater than that of the loaves and the fishes was the vision of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who saw the Father and the Son in the Sacred Grove near Palmyra, New York. Subsequently the keys, the priesthood, and the saving ordinances were restored in their fulness, and Christ\u2019s church was reestablished in our time. Thus God has again \u201cfed\u201d us and filled our \u201cbaskets\u201d to overflowing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p17\" class=\"\">It has been said that this church does not necessarily attract great people but more often makes ordinary people great. Many nameless people with gifts equal only to five loaves and two small fishes magnify their callings and serve without attention or recognition, feeding literally thousands. In large measure, they make possible the fulfillment of Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s dream that the latter-day gospel of Christ would be like a stone cut out of the mountains without hands, rolling forth until it fills the whole earth (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"10813\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10813)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10813)\">Dan. 2:34\u201335<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20108\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20108)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20108)\">D&amp;C 65:2<\/a><\/span>). These are the hundreds of thousands of leaders and teachers in all of the auxiliaries and priesthood quorums, the home teachers, the Relief Society visiting teachers. These are the many humble bishops in the Church, some without formal training but greatly magnified, always learning, with a humble desire to serve the Lord and the people of their wards.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p18\" class=\"\">Any man or woman who enjoys the Master\u2019s touch is like potter\u2019s clay in his hands. More important than acquiring fame or fortune is being what God wants us to be. Before we came to this earth, we may have been fashioned to do some small good in this life that no one else can do. The Lord said to Jeremiah, \u201cBefore I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26596\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26596)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26596)\">Jer. 1:5<\/a><\/span>). If God has a work for those with many talents, I believe he also has an important work for those of us who have few.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p19\" class=\"\">What is the central characteristic of those having only five loaves and two fishes? What makes it possible, under the Master\u2019s touch, for them to serve, lift, and bless so that they touch for good the lives of hundreds, even thousands? After a lifetime of dealing in the affairs of men and women, I believe it is the ability to overcome personal ego and pride\u2014both are enemies to the full enjoyment of the Spirit of God and walking humbly before him. The ego interferes with husbands and wives asking each other for forgiveness. It prevents the enjoyment of the full sweetness of a higher love. The ego often prevents parents and children from fully understanding each other. The ego enlarges our feelings of self-importance and worth. It blinds us to reality. Pride keeps us from confessing our sins and shortcomings to the Lord and working out our repentance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p20\" class=\"\">What of those who have talents equal only to two loaves and one fish? They do much of the hard, menial, unchallenging, poorly compensated work of the world. Life may not have been quite fair to them. They struggle to have enough to hold body and soul together. But they are not forgotten. If their talents are used to build the kingdom of God and serve others, they will fully enjoy the promises of the Savior. The great promise of the Savior is that they \u201cshall receive [their] reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20096\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20096)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20096)\">D&amp;C 59:23<\/a><\/span>). The one who had only two talents was able to say, \u201cLord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.\u201d Thus said the Lord, \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter \u2026 into the joy of thy lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37567\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37567)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37567)\">Matt. 25:22\u201323<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p21\" class=\"\">It is a blessing for some to be given minds and talents equal to fifteen loaves and ten fishes. They have so very much that they can contribute, but some become less than they might. They do not reach their potential of service, perhaps because they take so much pride in what they think they know and what they have. They seem unwilling or unable to yield \u201cto the enticings of the Holy Spirit, \u2026 and [become] as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [them], even as a child doth submit to his father\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40901\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40901)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40901)\">Mosiah 3:19<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p22\" class=\"\">During much of my life, a few journalists and dissidents have predicted the imminent downfall of this church. They have often pointed to the alleged disaffection of the youth of the Church. The lives and the dedication of our almost 50,000 young missionaries are testament enough of the faithfulness of many of our youth. In addition, during my lifetime, the Church has grown from 525,000 to about 8,500,000. I believe and testify that this is because of the restoration of the fulness of the keys and authority of the gospel of Christ to Joseph Smith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p23\" class=\"\">Recently an out-of-state journalist used the phrase that there were appearing \u201ccracks in the walls of the temple,\u201d figuratively speaking, of course. By this I suppose he meant that the moorings of the Church were being shaken by a very few who do not fully sustain the leaders of the Church or keep their covenants. To dispel this perception of cracks in our members\u2019 faith, we need only to observe the joyful people who worship in any of our forty-five temples worldwide. Many are couples clutching their little bags and holding hands, and many are the unmarried, seeking the peaceful blessings of the house of the Lord. Their countenances reflect much joy and satisfaction in their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p24\" class=\"\">A major reason this church has grown from its humble beginnings to its current strength is the faithfulness and devotion of millions of humble and devoted people who have only five loaves and two small fishes to offer in the service of the Master. They have largely surrendered their own interests, and in so doing have found \u201cthe peace of God, which passeth all understanding\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41341\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41341)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41341)\">Philip. 4:7<\/a><\/span>).

They are parents of Jeralee and their other five children. Jeff works on a building maintenance team that cares for some of our chapels in Pocatello, Idaho. Joyce is a mother and homemaker. One day last July, their daughter Jeralee, age eleven, was going door to door collecting money for her newspaper route. Jeralee never returned home\u2014not that day, nor the next day, nor the next, nor ever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p26\" class=\"\">Two thousand people from the area had gone out day after day to search for her. Other churches sent support and food for the searchers. It was learned that Jeralee had been abducted and brutally murdered by an evil man. When her body was found, the whole city was horrified and shocked. All segments of the community reached out to Joyce and Jeff in love and sympathy. Some became angry and wanted to take vengeance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p27\" class=\"\">After Jeralee\u2019s body was found, Jeff and Joyce appeared with great composure before the television cameras and other media to publicly express their profound thanks to all who had helped in the search and who had extended sympathy and love. Joyce said, \u201cI know our Heavenly Father has heard and answered our prayers, and he has brought our daughter back to us.\u201d Jeff said, \u201cWe no longer have doubt about where she is.\u201d Joyce continued, \u201cI have learned a lot about love this week, and I also know there is a lot of hate.

The Holy Spirit blessed that gathering in a remarkable way and spoke peace to the souls of all who attended. Later, President Kert W.
