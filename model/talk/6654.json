In short, a net can be anything that pulls us away from our relationship with our Heavenly Father or from His restored Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/follow-me.p14\" class=\"\">Let me give you a modern example. A computer can be a useful and indispensable tool. But if we allow it to devour our time with vain, unproductive, and sometimes destructive pursuits, it becomes an entangling net.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/follow-me.p15\" class=\"\">Many of us enjoy watching athletic contests, but if we can recite the statistics of our favorite players and at the same time forget birthdays or anniversaries, neglect our families, or ignore the opportunity to render acts of Christlike service, then athletics may also be an entangling net.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/follow-me.p16\" class=\"\">Since the days of Adam, mankind has, by the sweat of his brow, earned his daily bread. But when our work consumes us to the point where the spiritual dimensions of life are neglected, work can also be an entangling net.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/follow-me.p17\" class=\"\">Some have been ensnared in the net of excessive debt. The net of interest holds them fast, requiring them to sell their time and energies to meet the demands of creditors. They surrender their freedom, becoming slaves to their own extravagance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/follow-me.p18\" class=\"\">It is impossible to list the many nets that can ensnare us and keep us from following the Savior.

Our lives are so easily filled with appointments, meetings, and tasks. It is so easy to get caught in a multitude of nets that sometimes even a suggestion of breaking free of them can be threatening and even frightening to us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/follow-me.p20\" class=\"\">Sometimes we feel that the busier we are, the more important we are\u2014as though our busyness defines our worth. Brothers and sisters, we can spend a lifetime whirling about at a feverish pace, checking off list after list of things that in the end really don\u2019t matter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/follow-me.p21\" class=\"\">That we do a lot may not be so important.

I remember a few years that were particularly challenging for me. Our family had grown to seven children. I had served as a counselor in the bishopric and was then given the sacred call as bishop of our ward. I was striving to manage our business that required long hours each day. I pay tribute to my wonderful wife, who always made it possible for me to serve the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/follow-me.p24\" class=\"\">There was simply too much to do in the time available. Instead of sacrificing things of significance, I decided I\u2019d get up earlier, take care of my business, then spend the time required to be a good father and husband and a faithful member of the Church. It wasn\u2019t easy. There were mornings when the alarm clock went off that I cracked open an eyelid and glared at it, daring it to keep ringing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/follow-me.p25\" class=\"\">Nevertheless, the Lord was merciful and helped me to find the energy and time to do all I had committed to do.
