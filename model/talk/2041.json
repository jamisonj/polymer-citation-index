Under this test, those affected by certain forms of color blindness are able to distinguish the solid colors without difficulty, but the shaded areas in between the solid colors present problems. Those who are color blind do not discern correctly; and, no matter how hard they try, they are not able to distinguish the differences in hue that are obvious to the normal eye.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p4\" class=\"\">In this Ishihara eye test I found an important message, one that has broad application in our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p5\" class=\"\">Is there not similarity between the color-blind condition just described and the condition of a member of the Church who claims that he is seeking the truth, is anxious to develop a strong testimony pertaining to the truth, and yet is not willing or able to humble himself before the Lord, to exercise faith, and to live the gospel? By failing to do these things, he is letting his sins of omission close the door to the great source of all truth\u2014our Father in heaven. As a result, his vision is faulty.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p6\" class=\"\">As we journey along through life we, as individuals, come in contact with many shaded areas, twilight zones, and even dark alleys, where we, unless aided by a higher power, are not able to see clearly, to interpret correctly, and to come to sound conclusions. Some of these shaded areas are found in the physical world, some in the intellectual world, and some in the realm of the spiritual. Let us remember, however, that the Lord has said that all things unto him are spiritual.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, for my commandments are spiritual; they are not natural nor temporal, neither carnal nor sensual.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15703\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15703)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15703)\">D&amp;C 29:34\u201335<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p9\" class=\"\">As individuals, we have some limitations when it comes to our understanding of things as they really are. We can see so far, and then the earth and the sky come together, so to speak, and we cannot see beyond. But there is something beyond. In the physical world, all we have to do to realize this is to improve our vantage point by getting on top of a building, on a mountain, or in an airplane.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p10\" class=\"\">We need to improve our vantage points in all aspects of our living\u2014in the intellectual and the spiritual realms as well as in the physical. As we attempt to do this, we should remember that, in every situation, there are facts and there are opinions. There are also causes of difficulties and there are symptoms that express themselves. To the extent that we are willing and able to get at the facts and at the causes and to see relationships among them clearly, we are in a good position to interpret correctly and to arrive at sound conclusions. But to the extent that we just fool around with opinions and symptoms, we may prolong our difficulties and postpone the time for arriving at lasting, satisfying solutions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p11\" class=\"\">It is important that we remember also that no matter how intelligent we may be, no matter how hard we work, no matter how good our teachers are or how favorable the other conditions for learning, in our allotted span of years on earth we can master only a very small fraction of the total field of knowledge; and what we do master usually is in a narrowed-down, specialized area. Consequently, we, in and of ourselves, have limitations. Our thinking is often highly selective and segmented and our judgment is often faulty. Should we not, then, be willing to heed the counsel given by Solomon:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cTrust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cIn all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41507\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41507)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41507)\">Prov. 3:5\u20136<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p14\" class=\"\">Without divine guidance, we will have difficulty in the shaded areas of life. But we need not walk alone. Our Father in heaven and his Son Jesus Christ and the prophets\u2014both ancient and modern\u2014have given us a well-charted course for our journey through life.
