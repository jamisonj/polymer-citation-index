If any\n  of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the Lord thy God gather\n  thee, and from thence will He fetch thee (Deut. 30:1-4).<span class=\"footRef\">1<\/span><\/p>\n  <div class=\"topic \">The New Jerusalem<\/div>\n  <p class=\"std\">It has been said by many of the learned and wise men, or historians, that the Indians or\n  aborigines of this continent, are of the scattered tribes of Israel. It has been conjectured by many\n  others, that the aborigines of this continent are not of the tribes of Israel, but the ten tribes have been\n  led away into some unknown regions of the north.<span class=\"footRef\">2<\/span> Let this be as it may, the prophecy I have just\n  quoted &ldquo;will fetch them,&rdquo; in the last days, and place them in the land which their fathers possessed.\n  And you will find in the 7th verse of the 30th chapter, quoted, &ldquo;And the Lord thy God will put all\n  these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">3<\/span><\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">Many may say that this scripture is fulfilled, but let them mark carefully what the prophet says:\n  &ldquo;If any are driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven,&rdquo; (Which must mean the breadth of the\n  earth). Now this promise is good to any, if there should be such, that are driven out, even in the last\n  days, therefore, the children of the fathers have claim unto this day. And if these curses are to be laid\n  over on the heads of their enemies, wo be unto the Gentiles. (See Book of Mormon, 3 Nephi, Chap.\n  16, current edition). &ldquo;Wo unto the unbelieving of the Gentiles, saith the Father.&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">4<\/span> And again (see\n  Book of Mormon, 3 Nephi 20:22, current edition, which says), &ldquo;Behold this people will I establish\n  in this land, unto the fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your father Jacob, and it shall be\n  a New Jerusalem.&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">5<\/span> Now we learn from the Book of Mormon<\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"106333\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 106333)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(106333)\">Deut. 30:1-4<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">2. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"115624\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 115624)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(115624)\">D&amp;C 110:11<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">3. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"106335\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 106335)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(106335)\">Deut. 30:7<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">4. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112629\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112629)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112629)\">3 Ne. 16:8<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">5. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112671\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112671)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112671)\">3 Ne. 20:22<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
