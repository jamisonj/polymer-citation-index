What followed made his experience the most important event that had transpired in nearly 1,800 years. God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to him in person\u2014face to face.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p4\" class=\"\">Subsequently, through this young man, whose name was Joseph Smith, God restored his church and the fulness of his gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p5\" class=\"\">This restoration is what made that experience so important.

Each of the Beatitudes represents a specific step in our orderly progression towards perfection, and teaches us how to qualify ourselves for exaltation, for the Bible concludes the chapter on the Beatitudes with the words, \u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36504\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36504)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36504)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p15\" class=\"\">The Savior began his sermon saying, <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\u201d <\/span>(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36490\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36490)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36490)\">Matt. 5:3<\/a><\/span>; italics added.)

In the summertime we would occasionally sit on the mountainside with binoculars and watch the herd as they roamed and grazed on the flat below. For the most part the horses appeared to be a mangy lot, but there was one that had a grace, a dignity, and a spirit that qualified him to lead the herd. We tried on several occasions to put a rope on this stallion. One day we succeeded, but we soon found that we had on the end of the rope a bundle of fury that we couldn\u2019t manage. As hard as we tried, we couldn\u2019t ride him. After several attempts we gave up and turned him loose. He was of no value to us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p17\" class=\"\">I was reading recently that when professionals train Arabian horses they work with them for several months. At the conclusion of the training period they are placed in a corral without food or water. After several days both food and water are placed some distance away, but within sight. The gate is then opened and the horses run to satisfy their appetites.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p18\" class=\"\">Just before they reach the food and water, the trainer blows a whistle. Those that respond to the trainer\u2019s whistle are singled out as the most valued. They are submissive to the master\u2019s call.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p19\" class=\"\">Under a mandate from the Lord we have 25,000 young men who are sifting the people of the world to find those that are submissive to Him and to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit. We are finding an increasing number throughout the nations of the world who respond, but the vast majority prefer to satisfy their own appetites and to do things their own way instead of the Lord\u2019s way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p20\" class=\"\">When we love the Lord we will submit ourselves to <span class=\"emphasis\">his<\/span> plan and serve him with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength. This is the <span class=\"emphasis\">first<\/span> step. We must take it in order to qualify for exaltation. The miracle of change begins when we come forth with a contrite spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p21\" class=\"\">The Savior then said, <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cBlessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.\u201d <\/span>(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36491\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36491)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36491)\">Matt. 5:4<\/a><\/span>; italics added.) This is the <span class=\"emphasis\">second step.<\/span> It is an essential one. The apostle Paul spoke of a godly sorrow for our sins when he said, \u201cFor godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"636\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 636)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(636)\">2 Cor. 7:10<\/a><\/span>.) It is necessary to repent of our sins if we are to be forgiven and if the atonement of Jesus Christ is to be effective in our lives. Oh! how joyous it is to work with a person as he goes through the process of repentance, enters the water of baptism, and comes into the kingdom of God. There develops a bond of love and unity with those who have gone through this purifying process that the world does not understand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p22\" class=\"\">The Savior next said, <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cBlessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\u201d <\/span>(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36492\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36492)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36492)\">Matt. 5:5<\/a><\/span>; italics added.) To be meek is to be teachable. Those who are willing to listen can learn much. Those who are unwilling to listen deny themselves great blessings. You needn\u2019t worry about being deceived, for the prophet Moroni wrote, \u201cBy the power of the Holy Ghost you may know the truth of all things.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38420\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38420)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38420)\">Moro. 10:5<\/a><\/span>.) You have the receiving set within you to distinguish false doctrine from true doctrine. Follow the steps outlined by the Savior in the Beatitudes and your receiving set will become finely tuned. Then pray to God in sincerity for an answer and your receiving set will work. This is God\u2019s way for us to discern the truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p23\" class=\"\">The Savior further said, <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cBlessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.\u201d<\/span> (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36494\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36494)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36494)\">Matt. 5:6<\/a><\/span>; italics added.) The Book of Mormon account reads, \u201cFor they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5851\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5851)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5851)\">3 Ne. 12:6<\/a><\/span>.) This is important. The Holy Ghost is the great teacher and teaches us the truth of all things. God has documented his plan of salvation\u2014a plan for <span class=\"emphasis\">our<\/span> salvation. It is found in the holy scriptures and the Lord has commanded us to \u201csearch the scriptures.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28916\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28916)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28916)\">John 5:39<\/a><\/span>.) The plan is not complicated, but it is comprehensive. It is so comprehensive that we never stop learning, yet it is beautifully simple. The Lord has promised us all that if we follow his program we will learn \u201cline upon line, precept upon precept\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16925\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16925)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16925)\">D&amp;C 98:12<\/a><\/span>), until the perfect day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p24\" class=\"\">This promise is to every man. We should develop an insatiable appetite for knowledge pertaining to our salvation, for the Savior said, \u201cAnd this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28936\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28936)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28936)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>.) There is no more important, exciting, and exhilarating subject than to learn about him who created the worlds and the plan he has prepared for us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p25\" class=\"\">As we begin to follow the teachings of the Savior, our thoughts and our hearts turn to others. The Savior continued, <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cBlessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\u201d<\/span> (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36495\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36495)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36495)\">Matt. 5:7<\/a><\/span>; italics added.) Happiness is a by-product of helping others. No man ever finds happiness by thinking of himself. True happiness comes when we lose ourselves in the service of others\u2014when we are merciful to our fellowmen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p26\" class=\"\">Being merciful to others leads to purity of heart, for the Savior said, <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cBlessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\u201d <\/span>(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36497\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36497)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36497)\">Matt. 5:8<\/a><\/span>; italics added.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p27\" class=\"\">The by-product of a pure heart is inner peace.

When a man obtains inner peace he wants peace in his family. He wants peace in his community. He wants peace in the nation.

Along the way were signs painted on walls and bus stop enclosures: \u201cBrits out\u2014Peace in.\u201d That is not the way nor the road to peace. Peace comes from within the individual. Establish peace in the hearts and minds of the citizens of a country and you\u2019ll have peace in the nation. We declare to the world that living the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith will bring peace to the hearts of men and in turn will bring peace to the nations of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-beatitudes-and-our-perfection.p29\" class=\"\">Teaching the doctrine of the Savior was never done without opposition.
