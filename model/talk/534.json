I was\ngreatly impressed by that masterful sermon of our President as he opened the conference; and\nwith these other brethren. I surely sustain him as the prophet, seer, and revelator of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nI was more than happy to see Brother Thomas E. McKay here, and I am so glad that he bore\nthat wonderful testimony to you. I think I would like to tell you another testimony about\nBrother Thomas E. McKay, and I believe I will make that my address to you here in this\nconference.\n<\/p><p>\nINCIDENT OF HEALING\n<\/p><p>\nNot very long ago I was down in one of the California stakes attending a stake conference. At\nthe close of the morning meeting, one of the bishops brought his mother to the stand as she\nwished to shake hands and send a message back home. When she reached the stand, she said,\nWill you give a message from me to Brother Thomas E. McKay?\n<\/p><p>\nI said, \"I shall be very glad to.\"\n<\/p><p>\nShe said: \"It has been a couple of years since he was here to stake conference, but I want you\nto take a message to him.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAt that time I was holding in my hands a Book of Mormon that I had used during the\nconference. She took the Book of Mormon from my hands and opened it and read a\nparagraph to me then she closed the book and gave it back.\n<\/p><p>\nShe said, \"Two years ago Elder Thomas E. McKay was down here to our stake conference. I\nwas blind. I knew that if he would lay his hands upon my head I would receive my sight\nagain. I sent over to the conference and had him come. He and the other brethren laid their\nhands upon my head, and blessed me. Now you see that without even the use of glasses I\nhave been able to read a paragraph from your book. When you get back to Salt Lake City\nwill you tell him what I have done here today and express to him the gratitude I feel to the\nLord that one of his chosen servants came down here and was willing to lay his hands upon\nmy head? Whereas I was blind two years ago, now I can see and I can read without glasses\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27488\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27488)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27488)\">John 9:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA TRUE SERVANT\n<\/p><p>\nI thought that was a beautiful testimony she bore to one of the servants of God. I have loved\nBrother McKay ever since I first became acquainted with him some years ago. I can testify to\nyou along with this good sister from California that indeed Thomas E. McKay through his life\nhas been a true servant of God, and I am glad that he stood here today and bore that fervent\ntestimony that he knows that God lives; that he knows that Jesus is the Christ; that he knows\nthat Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God; and that all the men who have succeeded him in\nthe presidency of this Church likewise are prophets of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear you this testimony also because I know that these things are true, and I give you this\ntestimony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
