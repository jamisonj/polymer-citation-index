My profession then was in the field of printing and publishing. President Clark made me welcome in his office and then produced from his old rolltop desk a large sheaf of handwritten notes, many of them made when he was a law student long years before. He proceeded to outline for me his goal of producing a harmony of the Gospels. This goal was achieved with his monumental work <span class=\"emphasis\">Our Lord of the Gospels.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/miracles-then-and-now.p4\" class=\"\">Recently I took down from my library shelf a personally inscribed, leather-bound copy of this classic treatment of the life of Jesus of Nazareth.

I grieve, however, for the many, similarly afflicted, who knew not how to find the Master, to learn of His teachings, and to become the beneficiaries of His power. I remember that President Clark himself suffered heartache and pain in the tragic death at Pearl Harbor of his son-in-law, Mervyn S. Bennion, captain of the battleship <span class=\"emphasis\">West Virginia.<\/span> That day there had been no ram in the thicket, no steel to stop the shrapnel, no miracle to heal the wounds of war.

They presented to me a beautiful booklet where each one had prepared a special page illustrating those blessings for which he or she was most thankful at Christmastime.

The citation contained the words, \u201cIt is often within our homes and among our own family members that the eternally significant\u2014but usually unheralded\u2014dramas of daily living occur. The people in these plain but important places bring stability to the present and promise to the future. Their lives are filled with struggle and deep feeling as they face circumstances that rarely fit neatly within the formulae of plays, films and newscasts.

Smith Shumway, then her \u201cfriend and sweetheart of nine years,\u201d in 1948. The courtship was longer than most because Smith, an infantry officer in World War II, was blinded and severely wounded by a land-mine explosion in the advance on Paris, France. During his long rehabilitation, Sarah learned braille so that she could correspond with him in privacy. She couldn\u2019t tolerate the idea of others reading her letters aloud to the man she loved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/miracles-then-and-now.p32\" class=\"\">Something of the spirit of this young couple comes to us in the simple candor of Smith Shumway\u2019s proposal of marriage.

It was our joy to be with them. Each wore an identifying T-shirt on which was a map depicting the location of each child and family, along with the names of all. Brother Shumway, with justifiable pride, pointed to the location on his shirt of his precious ones and beamed the smile of gladness. Only then did I ponder that he had never seen any of his children or grandchildren. Or had he?
