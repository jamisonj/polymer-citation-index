Never before in the history of the\nChurch has the responsibility which has been given to the Priesthood been more necessary of\nfulfilment than today. Never before have we been under greater obligation to serve the Lord\nand keep His commandments, and magnify the callings which have been assigned to us.\n<\/p><p>\nThe world today is torn asunder. Evil is rampant upon the face of the earth. The members of\nthe Church need to be humble and prayerful and diligent. We who have been called to these\npositions in the Priesthood have that responsibility upon our shoulders to teach and direct the\nmembers of the Church in righteousness. I would like to read the words of John as found in\nthe third chapter of the First Epistle of John:\n<\/p><p>\nBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the\nsons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. Beloved,\nnow are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that,\nwhen he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man\nthat hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1019\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1019)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1019)\">1 Jn. 3:1-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJohn was speaking to the men who held the Priesthood. He calls them the sons of God. We\nare the sons of God. That same divine authority has been bestowed upon us. We, too, in this\nday should be just as grateful and just as willing to serve and keep the commandments of the\nLord and magnify the callings which have been given unto us as were these men in former\ndays who were the sons of God. I wonder if we realize the greatness of our callings&mdash;yes, all\nthe elders in this Church&mdash;do they realize that they hold the Melchizedek Priesthood? Do they\nknow that through their faithfulness and their obedience, according to the revelations of the\nLord, they are entitled to receive all that the Father has\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11780\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11780)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11780)\">D&amp;C 84:38<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;to become the sons of God, joint\nheirs (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50097\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50097)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50097)\">Rom. 8:17<\/a><\/span>)\nwith our Elder Brother, Jesus Christ, entitled to the exaltations in the celestial kingdom?\nDo we realize that? We, too, if we do realize it, should be like those of former days, and\nevery man that hath this hope in him, will purify himself even as Christ is pure. Brethren,\nthat we may do so, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. \n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
