This sister was faithful. She joined the Church 18 years ago and believed with all of her heart that she could have a family united in the gospel of Jesus Christ. However, her husband was not prepared to make the necessary lifestyle changes. He supported her decision but would not join. She had two sons who were being influenced by the decisions of her husband. In the course of her struggle, a dear sister gave her a tape of a talk by Elder M. Russell Ballard. From that tape she learned that faith and doubt cannot be in the mind at the same time. She firmly grasped onto this hope that the Lord would support her in her righteous desires if she would be faithful. She told no one but set a goal for her husband\u2019s baptism and the reactivation of her two sons. New ideas kept coming into her mind as to what she could do to bring about this great promise. Slowly but surely she began to see progress. Her husband accepted the challenge <span class=\"emphasis\">to take the discussions again, and her sons felt a new spirit in their home and started reacting positively.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/for-such-a-time-as-this.p26\" class=\"\">First, both sons became active in the Church again.

About 13 miles out of Baker, Oregon, the car spun out of control, left the road, and rolled two and a half times. The second time it rolled over, the mother, who was driving, and her youngest daughter, who was 10 years old, were thrown from the car. Because the car did not have enough momentum to complete the third roll, it rocked back and pinned the mother and her daughter beneath its weight. The father quickly surveyed the situation and, knowing that if the car was not moved quickly his wife would die, he bowed his head in humble prayer and then proceeded to lift the huge Buick, with its wheels still spinning. The youngest daughter crawled from beneath as his 12-year-old daughter pulled her mother from beneath the car. The mother was critically injured and in terrible pain. As the father tended to the others, the 12-year-old daughter knelt beside her mother to comfort her. The mother reached for the girl\u2019s hand and said, \u201cAlways remember who you are, and always be a good girl.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/for-such-a-time-as-this.p42\" class=\"\">The ambulance soon arrived, and the mother was whisked off to the nearest hospital. Amid the critical moments of that evening as the mother teetered between life and death, she pled with her Father in Heaven to spare her life long enough to see her six daughters married to worthy men in the house of the Lord. She promised that if He would grant her this righteous desire, she would then be ready to go, and she would dedicate her life to Him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/for-such-a-time-as-this.p43\" class=\"\">Miraculously, the woman steadily progressed over the days and weeks that followed until she fully recovered from her near-fatal injuries. More committed than ever, she faithfully served the Lord and focused her attention on raising her six daughters in righteousness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/for-such-a-time-as-this.p44\" class=\"\">Years later, while serving as the stake Relief Society president in Clearfield, Utah, she saw her youngest daughter married for time and all eternity. That day was the fulfillment of a sacred covenant between a beloved daughter of God and her loving Heavenly Father. The woman, her husband, their six daughters, and their eternal companions stood together in the house of the Lord. Her earnest plea from a hospital bed years before had been heard and fulfilled.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/for-such-a-time-as-this.p45\" class=\"\">From that day forward, the woman\u2019s health quickly declined under the ravages of cancer.
