That changed the course of their lives and was a great influence in the lives of their children and grandchildren.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p5\" class=\"\">Growing up in the Church in Uruguay and being a witness of this wonderful work in other countries of South America, I have carefully observed the effect that diligently and humbly listening to the voice of the Lord has had in the lives of people. I observed the same effect when I went back to live in Spain and saw the change produced in the lives of people when they diligently listened to the servants of the Lord and developed sufficient faith to obey the commandments.

While some people indicate a willingness to listen attentively and to be obedient to the words of the Lord, others seem to close their ears, not wanting to hear nor to obey. There are others who are slow to hear but who eventually do listen and become obedient. For all of these people, the result of their attitudes concerning the voice of the Lord will bring into their lives consequences which, in many instances, may be of an eternal nature.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p13\" class=\"\">An example of those who close their ears can be found in chapter 15 of 1 Samuel when Saul, who had been anointed king over Israel, set aside the counsel and warnings of the prophet of the Lord and tried to justify the error of his ways. Samuel the prophet reproved Saul and taught him that \u201cto obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.\u201d He then indicated to Saul the consequences of his attitude: \u201cBecause thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2713\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2713)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2713)\">1 Sam. 15:22\u201323<\/a><\/span>).

This response was not pleasing to Naaman, who went away in anger. Thanks to the intervention of his servants who persuaded Naaman to follow the instructions of the prophet, finally \u201cwent he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3235\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3235)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3235)\">2 Kgs. 5:14<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p15\" class=\"\">From his experience we learn that frequently the words of the prophets do not agree with our expectations or with our way of seeing things.

This humble woman possessed no more than a handful of meal and a little oil for herself and for her son. With these she planned to prepare a final meal and then die. The prophet Elijah asked her to first give him something to eat with the promise that if she did so the meal and the oil would not decrease until it rained again:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1322\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1322)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1322)\">1 Kgs. 17:15\u201316<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p19\" class=\"\">Thus we see how, when people listen to and accept with humility and simple faith the words of the prophets, they receive the Lord\u2019s blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p20\" class=\"\">In summary, the voice of the Lord may be received by listening to the Lord\u2019s servants, studying the scriptures, and being prompted through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
