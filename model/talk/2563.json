In the interior of our consciousness, each of us has a private hall of fame reserved exclusively for the real leaders who have influenced the direction of our lives. Relatively few of the many men who exercise authority over us from childhood through adult life meet our test for entry to this roll of honor. That test has very little to do with the outward trappings of power or an abundance of this world\u2019s goods. The leaders whom we admit into this private sanctuary of our reflective meditation are usually those who set our hearts afire with devotion to the truth, who make obedience to duty seem the essence of manhood, who transform some ordinary routine occurrence so that it becomes a vista whence we see the person we aspire to be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/my-personal-hall-of-fame.p10\" class=\"\">For a moment, perhaps each of us could be the qualifying judge through whom each hall of fame entry must pass.

First, that noble example of fidelity\u2014even Ruth. Sensing the grief-stricken heart of her mother-in-law, who suffered the loss of each of her two fine sons, and feeling perhaps the pangs of despair and loneliness which plagued the very soul of Naomi, Ruth uttered what has become that classic statement of loyalty: \u201cIntreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43016\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43016)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43016)\">Ruth 1:16<\/a><\/span>.)

When we obey, as did Adam, endure as did Job, teach as did Paul, testify as did Peter, serve as did Nephi, give ourselves as did the prophet Joseph, respond as did Ruth, honor as did Mary, and live as did Christ, we are born anew. All power becomes ours. Cast off forever is the old self and with it defeat, despair, doubt, and disbelief. To a newness of life we come\u2014a life of faith, hope, courage, and joy. No task looms too large. No responsibility weighs too heavily. No duty is a burden.

Let me illustrate. Today Craig Sudbury presides over a ward here in Salt Lake City, but let me turn back the clock just a few years to the day he and his mother came to my office prior to Craig\u2019s departure for the Australia Melbourne Mission. Fred, Craig\u2019s father, was noticeably absent. Twenty-five years earlier, Craig\u2019s mother had married Fred, who did not share her love for the Church and indeed did not belong to the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/my-personal-hall-of-fame.p34\" class=\"\">Craig confided to me his deep and abiding love for his parents. He shared his innermost hope that somehow, in some way, his father would be touched by the Spirit and open his heart to the gospel of Jesus Christ. He pleaded earnestly with me for a suggestion. I prayed for inspiration concerning how such a desire might be rewarded. Such inspiration came, and I said to Craig, \u201cServe the Lord with all your heart. Be obedient to your sacred calling. Each week write a letter to your parents and, on occasion, write to Dad personally and let him know that you love him, and tell him why you\u2019re grateful to be his son.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/my-personal-hall-of-fame.p35\" class=\"\">He thanked me and, with his mother, departed the office. I was not to see Craig\u2019s mother for some 18 months. She came to the office and, in sentences punctuated by tears, said to me, \u201cIt has been almost two years since Craig departed for his mission. His faithful service has qualified him for positions of responsibility in the mission field, and he has never failed in writing a letter to us each week. Recently my husband Fred stood for the first time in a testimony meeting and said, \u2018All of you know that I am not a member of the Church, but something has happened to me since Craig left for his mission. His letters have touched my soul.

I suppose I have known this truth for a long time, but my son\u2019s mission has moved me to action. I have made arrangements for my wife and me to meet Craig when he completes his mission.
