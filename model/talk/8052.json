Monson. Recently, several deacons were asked, \u201cWhat do you admire most about President Monson?\u201d One deacon recalled how President Monson, as a child, gave his toys to needy friends. Another mentioned how President Monson cared for the many widows in his ward. A third noted that he was called as an Apostle at a very young age and has blessed people all around the world. Then one young man said, \u201cThe thing I admire most about President Monson is his strong testimony.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/i-know-these-things-of-myself.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">Indeed, we have all felt our prophet\u2019s special witness of the Savior Jesus Christ and his commitment to always follow the promptings of the Spirit. With each experience he shares, President Monson invites us to live the gospel more fully and to seek for and strengthen our own personal testimonies. Remember what he said from this pulpit just a few conferences ago: \u201cIn order for us to be strong and to withstand all the forces pulling us in the wrong direction\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, we must have our own testimony.

To quote President Monson again: \u201cI maintain that a strong testimony of our Savior and of His gospel will \u2026 protect you from the sin and evil around you. \u2026 If you do not already have a testimony of these things, do that which is necessary to obtain one.

Joseph allowed the scriptures to penetrate his heart. He pondered them deeply and applied them to his own situation. He then acted on what he had learned. The result was the glorious First Vision\u2014and everything that came after it. This Church quite literally was founded on the principle that anyone\u2014including a 14-year-old farm boy\u2014can \u201cask of God\u201d and receive an answer to his prayers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"topic\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>So What Is a Testimony?<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/i-know-these-things-of-myself.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">We often hear members of the Church say that their testimony of the gospel is their most prized possession. It is a sacred gift from God that comes to us by the power of the Holy Ghost. It is the calm, unwavering certainty we receive as we study, pray, and live the gospel. It is the feeling of the Holy Ghost bearing witness to our souls that what we are learning and doing is right.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/i-know-these-things-of-myself.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">Some people speak of a testimony as if it were a light switch\u2014it\u2019s either on or off; you either have a testimony, or you do not. In reality, a testimony is more like a tree that passes through various stages of growth and development. Some of the tallest trees on earth are found in Redwood National Park in the western United States. When you stand at the base of these massive trees, it is amazing to think that each one grew from a tiny seed. So it is with our testimonies. Although they may begin with a single spiritual experience, they grow and develop over time through constant nourishment and frequent spiritual encounters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/i-know-these-things-of-myself.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">It\u2019s not surprising, then, that when the prophet Alma explained how we develop a testimony, he spoke of a seed growing into a tree. \u201cIf ye give place,\u201d he said, \u201cthat a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, \u2026 it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves\u2014It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote12-10911_000_022\">12<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130122\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130122)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130122)\">Alma 32:28<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/priesthood-session\/i-know-these-things-of-myself.p22\" class=\"\" id=\"p22\">This is often how a testimony begins: with sacred, enlightening, assuring feelings that demonstrate to us that the word of God is true. However, as wonderful as these feelings are, they are only the beginning. Your work to grow your testimony is not done\u2014any more than the work of growing a redwood tree is done when the first tiny sprout pokes out of the ground.

It also follows that the gospel was restored in these latter days through Joseph Smith\u2014including the restoration of both the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote15-10911_000_022\">15<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Thomas\u00a0S.

We bear that holy priesthood.
