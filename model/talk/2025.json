The often-quoted questions came to mind: Where did we come from? Why are we here? Where are we going?\u2014but a variation of one of these suggested itself: Where are you <span class=\"emphasis\">really <\/span>going? And to this we might have added: What do you <span class=\"emphasis\">really <\/span>want?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/where-are-you-really-going.p5\" class=\"\">We use much of our time in rushing around, not thinking always what we ought to be, nor what it is that matters most.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/where-are-you-really-going.p6\" class=\"\">Sometimes we set our hearts on things we feel we have to have, and when we get them find they don\u2019t mean as much as once we thought they would.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/where-are-you-really-going.p7\" class=\"\">And so the years move by\u2014and even while yet young we become aware that we are older than we were.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/where-are-you-really-going.p8\" class=\"\">Soberingly, more than one-fourth of this year already has passed\u2014partly in pursuit perhaps of things that don\u2019t matter very much\u2014which reminds us of a dream that John Ruskin said he had:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/where-are-you-really-going.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cI dreamed,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I was at a child\u2019s \u2026 party, in which every means of entertainment had been provided \u2026 by a wise and kind host. \u2026 The children had been set free in the rooms and gardens, with no care whatever but how to pass the afternoon rejoicingly. \u2026 There was music \u2026 all manner of amusing books \u2026 a workshop \u2026 a table loaded with everything nice to eat \u2026 and whatever a child could fancy \u2026 but in the midst of all this it struck two or three of the more \u2018practical\u2019 children that they would like some of the brass-headed nails that studded the chairs, and so they set to work to pull them out. In a little while all the children, nearly, were spraining their fingers in pulling out brass-headed nails. With all that they could pull out they were not satisfied; and then everybody wanted some of somebody else\u2019s. And at last the really \u2018practical\u2019 and \u2018sensible\u2019 ones declared that nothing was of any real consequence that afternoon except to get plenty of brass-headed nails. \u2026 And at last they began to fight for nail heads, \u2026 <span class=\"emphasis\">even though they knew they would not be allowed to carry so much as one brass knob away with them. <\/span>But no! it was \u2018Who has most nails? \u2026 I must have as many as you before I leave the house or I cannot possibly go home in peace.\u2019 At last they made so much noise that I awoke, and thought to myself, \u2018What a false dream that is of <span class=\"emphasis\">children. <\/span> \u2026 Children never do such foolish things.

All of us will realize the results of how we live our lives. And don\u2019t let anyone say that mere men have the right or power to repeal God\u2019s commandments or ever set them aside\u2014commandments that are so practical and essential, a part of life, dealing as they do with health and happiness and peace, with honesty and morality and cleanliness, and excellence, and all else that pertains to life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/where-are-you-really-going.p19\" class=\"\">If someone tells you, my beloved young friends, that you can set the commandments of God aside without realizing the results\u2014if someone tells you <span class=\"emphasis\">that, <\/span>then you may know that you are listening to someone who doesn\u2019t know, or isn\u2019t telling you the truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/where-are-you-really-going.p20\" class=\"\">These minds, these bodies God has given, with their wondrous physical functioning, must last a mortal lifetime\u2014and to impair or dull the senses, or damage their physical functioning, or abuse or fail to care for them\u2014to indulge in body-destroying, mind-dulling, spirit-blighting substances is a foolish, wicked <span class=\"emphasis\">un<\/span>wisdom.
