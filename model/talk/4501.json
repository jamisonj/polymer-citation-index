I couldn\u2019t help but think of the words of that great hymn, \u201cSacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven\u201d (\u201cPraise to the Man,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 25).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p4\" class=\"\">I have always felt, however, that, really, it is impossible for us to sacrifice in building the kingdom of God. I would much rather consider it, instead of a sacrifice, a great opportunity to serve God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p5\" class=\"\">Sister Richards and I lived in Washington, D.C., for fifteen years. When we returned to Salt Lake City, we moved into the Mount Olympus area. Within a year or so, the East Millcreek Stake was divided, as I remember, and President Gordon B. Hinckley was called to be the president of the stake. I was called to be the stake mission president, and for three and a half years, I had the opportunity of serving under President Hinckley.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p6\" class=\"\">I was later called to be a full-time mission president, and then, twenty-seven years ago this conference, President N. Eldon Tanner, Elder Theodore M. Burton, and I were called to be General Authorities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p7\" class=\"\">My first assignment was supervising the nine missions on the East Coast from Canada to Florida for five years. That was a great experience. My next assignment was with President Spencer W. Kimball, who was then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, supervising South America.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p8\" class=\"\">We organized the first stake in South America in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in May of 1966. As Elder Lynn A. Sorensen mentioned, the growth there has been tremendous. I remember that President Kimball said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to call any North Americans to the major leadership positions.\u201d And there were many Latter-day Saints living in Sao Paulo at that time working in businesses associated with the United States. He said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to call the local people.\u201d And so our policy was to call local men and women to those positions and to be missionaries. At that time, in 1966, there were no stakes in South America, whereas now there are nearly two hundred stakes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p9\" class=\"\">I then had the opportunity to spend three years with Elder Delbert L. Stapley supervising the missions in Central America and Mexico. As I recall, there were two stakes in Mexico then, one in the Colonies and one in Mexico City. Now there are nearly a hundred stakes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p10\" class=\"\">The Church has grown and developed with their local leadership and local missionaries. If I had time, I could relate some tremendous experiences that I have had with young men and women and older men and women involved in missionary service there. I would just like to stress again what Elder M. Russell Ballard said about how important it is to make contributions to the General Missionary Fund of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p11\" class=\"\">You know, every member is a missionary. I think President David O. McKay first emphasized that duty. I was up in Montana some time ago visiting a stake conference. After the morning session, I was wandering around outside. I saw this young boy standing there all dressed up in his Sunday clothes. I went over to him and said, \u201cSon, you\u2019re a fine-looking boy. What\u2019s your name?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p12\" class=\"\">He said, \u201cJoseph Smith Curdy.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p13\" class=\"\">I said, \u201cJoseph Smith Curdy! That\u2019s a fine name. You\u2019re going to be a great missionary.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p14\" class=\"\">He said, \u201cI\u2019m already a great missionary. Down the street a couple of blocks from where we live there\u2019s a family with a couple of boys about my age, and over a period of three or four months, I have been bringing them to church with me. A month or so ago, I said to them, \u2018How would you like to have the missionaries give you the discussions?\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cThey said, \u2018Oh, we\u2019d have to talk to our parents.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cSo we talked to the parents, and the parents said, \u2018Well, if you will let us listen in, why we\u2019ll be glad to have the missionaries teach them.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p17\" class=\"\">There wasn\u2019t any problem with that, so the missionaries gave the family the discussions. Joseph Smith Curdy told me, \u201cThat whole family is going to be baptized next Saturday. I\u2019m already a great missionary.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p18\" class=\"\">I couldn\u2019t help but agree with him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p19\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, it is wonderful to have the opportunities we have in this Church, not only in the missionary program but also in the areas of temple work and genealogy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p20\" class=\"\">I\u2019m grateful that I was reserved to be born at this particular time in the history of the world when the gospel has been restored in its fulness. I\u2019m convinced that the Spirit of the Lord is being poured out upon the face of the earth more today than ever before in the history of the world through the restoration of the gospel in its fulness. Because of the Restoration, you and I can bear witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph Smith was a great prophet of God. We\u2019re told that Joseph Smith has done more for the salvation of mankind than any other man who has ever lived on the earth, save Jesus Christ himself. I bear that witness to you. The Church has been reestablished, the power to act in the name of God has been restored, and we have a great prophet standing at the head of this church today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/opportunities-to-serve.p21\" class=\"\">May the Lord bless him. And may the choice blessings of our Father in Heaven go with you as you leave this conference, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
