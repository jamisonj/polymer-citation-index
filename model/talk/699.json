His question was: \"What is your concept of a Christlike life? Please\nexplain in detail the qualifications necessary for one to gain an exaltation in the kingdom of\nheaven.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI was intrigued by that question, and if the Spirit of the Lord is willing, I should like to make\nan answer to that young man within the time limitations this morning; and if the congregation\nhere will pardon me, I will talk directly to that young man who may\npossibly be in attendance because I believe that his question is the question that is being asked\nby every serious-minded Latter-day Saint youth today.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung man, your question is not unique.  It is not different.  It is the same question that has\nbeen asked by the honest-hearted ever since the world began.  It is the question that was in\nthe mind of Nicodemus, the master in Israel, when he came to the Savior by night, and the\nMaster discerning the purpose of his coming, explained to aim what was necessary in order\nfor him to enter or even to see the kingdom of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27583\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27583)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27583)\">John 3:3-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt was the same question asked by the zealous Saul of Tarsus on that memorable occasion\nwhile on his way to Damascus when he was blinded by the light; he heard a voice speak out\nof heaven; humbled as only one can be humbled in the presence of a great spiritual\nexperience.  In answer to the Lord's rebuke, the humble Saul asked, \"Lord, what wilt thou\nhave me to do?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7721\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7721)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7721)\">Acts 9:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt was the cry of the sinful David who, amidst his pleadings\nand his sufferings, granted the knowledge of the course which he must pursue, in order that\nhis soul would not be left in hell\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41783\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41783)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41783)\">Ps. 16:10<\/a><\/span>).\nIt was the same thing the Jews asked on the day of\nPentecost: \"What must we do to be saved?\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7708\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7708)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7708)\">Acts 2:37<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo answer your question fully, and that of these others to which I have made reference would\nrequire a full explanation of the plan of salvation given in the gospel of Jesus Christ.  While\nyet in your youth, you have done well to ask that question, young man, to seek counsel as to\nyour course in life, for every soul who lives has the possibility, as you have, of an exaltation\nin the celestial kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nI wish you could have been here to the general priesthood meeting on Saturday night, but\nmaybe you were.  I wish you could have repeated under President McKay's direction the First\nArticle of Faith, \"We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in\nthe Holy Ghost\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6674\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6674)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6674)\">A of F 1:1<\/a><\/span>), and then listened intently to every word as you repeated with President\nMcKay the Thirteenth Article of Faith: \"We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent,\nvirtuous, and in doing good to all men\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6683\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6683)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6683)\">A of F 1:13<\/a><\/span>).\nBut I would have you this morning think of\nanother of the Articles of Faith in connection therewith because it has a particular significance\nin the answer to your question: \"We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all\nmankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6676\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6676)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6676)\">A of F 1:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA great philosopher has said the same thing in other words when he declared: \"Every one of\nus, with of God and within the limitations of human capability, himself makes his own\ndisposition, his character, and his permanent condition.\" (Emil Souvestre.)\n<\/p><p>\nMay I give you in answer to your question the example of three youths who, faced with the\nstern temptations of life, met those tests and came through nobly and victoriously, despite the\nodds against them. I say I give you these examples in order that you may learn and recognize three of\nthe great dangers which confront youth today.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first, an example of a young girl, whom I met when I was asked address a group of\nyoung girls a few years ago over at the Lion House where they were being shepherded under\nthe direction of the great Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association.  At the close of\nour meeting this lovely girl took me aside, and from her purse she unfolded a picture of a\nhandsome young soldier.  Underneath the picture was something about love, and his name\nsigned.  I asked, \"Well, what does this mean?\" Tears were swimming in her eyes.  She\nreplied, \"I met that young man here in an army camp.  He was not a member of the Church. \nHe was clean and fine, and he had the ideals I had longed for in a companion, all except one\nthing, he was not a member of the Church.  And when he proposed marriage\nto me, I said, 'Only will I be married when I can be married in the house of the Lord because\nlove means something more than just a thing that pertains to this life.  It is an eternal thing,\nand I want to be married in the temple.'\"\n<\/p><p>\nWell, he reasoned with her, he pleaded with her, he scolded, and then came angry; and finally\nafter repeated efforts to break down her religious objection to a marriage out of the temple, he\nfinally left her.  It was now time to go overseas, and she cried her heart out the night he left\nthinking that maybe she had made a mistake because her heart had gone out to this fine\nyoung man.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring a long ocean voyage over to Australia where he was to be stationed and from where\nhe was to go into combat, he began to think about this young woman.  He began to think that\nhe had been a little hasty in his judgment about her religious convictions.  Perhaps it was her\nreligion that had made her the fine girl that she was.  With that on his mind, he began to seek\ncompanionship with our Latter-day Saint men. He finally met a Latter-day Saint chaplain\nthere and became associated with the Latter-day Saint boys of the camp and began to study\nthe gospel. On her birthday he had sent her this picture attached, and behind the picture was a\nslip of paper which proved to be a certificate evidencing the fact that he had been baptized a\nmember of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  In the letter which accompanied\nthe picture, he had said, \"I am preparing now to live worthy so that when I come home, I can\nbe ordained an elder and together we can be married in the house of the Lord.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThere, young man, is the first thing that you must think of, if you would have an exaltation in\nthe celestial kingdom.  Marriage is eternal, and there was a youth who realized the foundation\non which she must build if she were to have a fullness of eternal happiness. The second\nexample is that of an impetuous young man.  One morning he was confronted by his mother\nwith rather a startling statement.  His mother said to him, \"Son, last night I had a\npremonition.  I had a feeling that you are going to be faced with a grave temptation by a\ncertain woman who is setting her cap for you.  I warn you to be on guard.\" And this youth\nbrushed it aside in his characteristic way, \"Oh, Mother, you are silly; nothing is farther from\nthe fact.  She is a fine woman.\" And the mother replied, \"Well, be careful, my son.\" Within\nthirty days from the time of his mother's warning, that youth stood face to face with the\ntemptation about which his mother had been warned.\n<\/p><p>\nYouth, if you want to be guided by wisdom, stay close to your parents.  Listen to the counsel\nof your father and your mother and lean heavily upon the experience of their lives because\nthey are entitled to inspiration in the rearing of their family.  Young man, may I plead with\nyou to keep yourself morally clean?  Revere womanhood.  May I remind you of what you\nrepeated some years ago as a slogan in the MIA.  It was a quotation from a portion of a\nmessage of the First Presidency particularly to servicemen in military service during some of\nthese strenuous, difficult times through which you and others like you have lived.  This is\nwhat the First Presidency wrote: \"How glorious and near to the angels is youth that is clean.\nThis youth has joy unspeakable here and eternal happiness hereafter.  Sexual purity is youth's\nmost precious possession.  It is the foundation of all righteousness.  Better dead clean, than\nalive unclean.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHonor your name, young man.  You come of an illustrious family. Not to maintain the high\nstandards which the Presidency have suggested would not only be a blight upon you, but a\nblight upon that great family name you bear, and a blight upon the Church for which your\nforefathers and ancestors sacrificed their lives to establish.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the prayer at the dedication of the Idaho Falls Temple the First\nPresidency said something of  great  importance to the girls about the purity of life.  This is what\nthe Presidency wrote in that inspired prayer: \"We pray for the daughters of Zion.  May they\nbe preserved in virtue, chastity, and purity of life, be blessed with vigorous bodies and minds,\nand with great faith. May they develop into true womanhood and receive choice companions\nunder the new and everlasting covenant for time and for all eternity in thy temples provided\nfor this priceless privilege and purpose.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung man, should you find companionship with a beautiful young girl, will you remember\nthat quotation, and will you take occasion during your courtship to read to her that most vital\nmessage from the prophets of the living God in our day to warn her also against one of the\nbesetting sins of this world in which we live?\n<\/p><p>\nMay I now give you the third example to suggest a third danger?  The story of this incident\ncomes from the testimony of the wife of a mission president who just returned from one of\nour Communist-dominated countries. A young girl attending a school in that country one day\nwas abused by her teacher when he learned of her identity as a Latter-day Saint girl, having\nfaith in a living God.  As a punishment to her he demanded that she sit down and write fifty\ntimes, there is no God.\" This little girl, shaken by the punishment imposed by that teacher,\nwent home and talked it over with mother.  Her mother said, \"No, girl, you must never write,\n'There is no God.' You go back and tell your teacher you know there is a God and you can't\nlie.\" And the girl went back and faced this teacher, and he said, more angrily than ever, \"You\ngo back and write that and write it a hundred times, 'There is no God,' or I warn you that\nsomething terrible will happen to you.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe mother and daughter prayed nearly all night that night, and then next morning they fasted\nand went together to the room of that teacher. They waited for him to come.  The he didn't\nshow up, and the principal, seeing that they were waiting, came to them and asked, \"Are you\nwaiting for your teacher?\" She said, \"Yes, we are waiting for him.\" \"Well, I am sorry to tell\nyou that he suffered a heart attack and died suddenly this morning.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSomething terrible did happen, but it wasn't to that young girl.  It happened to a man inspired\nwith satanic motives.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung man, I would warn you, along with the others of your age, to be forewarned of the\nthreats to your faith. I warn you against the man-made philosophies and the doctrines which\nwould destroy that faith in God basic to exaltation in the celestial kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nIf you remember those examples, young man, and live worthy of your name, the marvelous\nrewards of our heavenly Father will be yours.  Listen to what the Lord promised: \n<\/p><p>\nVerily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul that forsaketh his sins and\ncometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keep my\ncommandments, shall see my face and shall know that I am\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13288\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13288)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13288)\">D&amp;C 93:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd after you begin to understand that, then, young man, go to the 76th Section of the\nDoctrine and Covenants, in some respects, one of the most glorious visions that has ever been\ngiven to mortal man.  Read from the 50th to the 70th verses of that great vision\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13267\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13267)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13267)\">D&amp;C 76:50-70<\/a><\/span>), and you will\nhave understanding in better words than I can give you today.\n<\/p><p>\nMy son, go and have your patriarchal blessing, for there under inspiration your patriarch will\ngive you, as someone has said, \"paragraphs from the book of your own possibilities.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now after this brief conversation with you, my young brother, may I close it by a little\nquotation from a great thinker who said this: \n<\/p><p>\nThe highest of all arts is the art of living well.  Beyond the beauty of sculpture and painting,\nof poetry or music, is the beauty of a well-spent life.  Here all can be artists.  Every man can\nbe a hero.\n<\/p><p>\nObedience to that divine command, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in\nheaven is perfect\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34615\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34615)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34615)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>),\nwill ally man with God and will make of earth a paradise.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you, my young friend. Keep on thinking the serious thoughts and asking those\nserious questions, and in time, as you keep your eyes fixed upon the stars to guide you on and\non and upward, you will reach your objective&mdash;an exaltation in the celestial kingdom of our\nHeavenly Father, which I pray for you and all youth of Zion, and all the world if that were\npossible, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
