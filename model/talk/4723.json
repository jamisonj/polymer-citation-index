The Lord was speaking of our pioneer forefathers, and also of the Saints of this day. In view of that implied responsibility, I would like to discuss with you today the way to perfection, which not only applies to this life but to the next one as well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-way-to-perfection.p4\" class=\"\">A fortnight ago I received an interesting letter from a member of the Church who grew up in a country located high in the Himalaya Mountains of southern Asia. He wrote: \u201cI was brought up in a royal, aristocratic, Hindu priest family. I was taught to work but not to hope for a reward. I thought, Why should I work if there is no reward? Am I following the right way? I was offended with polytheistic and pantheistic philosophy. I wanted to know the <span class=\"emphasis\">real<\/span> truth and the [<span class=\"emphasis\">right<\/span>] way.\u201d He told how he had found the truth and the only right way through the Mormon missionaries in Seoul, Korea. He bore a powerful testimony of the divinity of Jesus Christ that brought tears to my eyes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-way-to-perfection.p5\" class=\"\">I was intrigued by his statement concerning the need for a reward. The Lord has promised us resurrection and immortality, but these are not a reward. According to Webster\u2019s dictionary, a reward is \u201csomething that is given for some service or attainment.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-way-to-perfection.p6\" class=\"\">Resurrection is the reuniting of the body and the spirit. As Jesus was resurrected, eventually every person who was ever born into this world will be resurrected, whether he wants to be or not. When a person is resurrected, he receives immortality, which is to live forever in the resurrected state. Likewise, every person who was ever born into this world will receive immortality regardless of his or her behavior in this life. Thus, <span class=\"emphasis\">resurrection<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">immortality<\/span> are synonymous. They are not a reward\u2014they are a gift\u2014for we have rendered no service nor attained any accomplishment to warrant these as a reward. The gift is from the Savior; it comes through His atoning sacrifice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-way-to-perfection.p7\" class=\"\">The scriptures teach us that there <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> promise beyond\u2014that there <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> a reward for service rendered and for attainment. The reward is exaltation in the celestial kingdom of God. Exaltation is the highest of three degrees of glory in the celestial kingdom. The celestial kingdom is the highest of three kingdoms in the realm of immortality. Exaltation is earned by accepting Jesus Christ and His divine sonship and following His precepts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-way-to-perfection.p8\" class=\"\">Jesus showed us the way. Its simplicity is encompassed in His Beatitudes, which have echoed down through the centuries of time and will yet echo through the millenniums of time: \u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37268\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37268)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37268)\">Matt. 5:3<\/a><\/span>.) In repeating the Sermon on the Mount to the people in ancient America, He said it differently: \u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit <span class=\"emphasis\">who come unto me,<\/span> for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6167\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6167)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6167)\">3 Ne. 12:3<\/a><\/span>; italics added.) This addition, \u201cwho come unto me,\u201d enables one to better understand the meaning of this verse. The Lord said he is angered with the inhabitants of the earth, for \u201cthey seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18916\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18916)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18916)\">D&amp;C 1:16<\/a><\/span>.)

Socrates took the young man to the seaside and out into the water. Then he pushed his head under the water for almost too long. The young man struggled, came up gasping for air, and demanded the meaning of such an unwarranted action. The great Socrates responded, \u201cWhen you want to learn as badly as you want a breath of air, only then can I teach you what you want to know.\u201d To understand the gospel of Jesus Christ, one must first have a strong desire to learn and a willingness to study.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/the-way-to-perfection.p14\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Step 5.<\/span> \u201cBlessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37272\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37272)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37272)\">Matt. 5:7<\/a><\/span>.)

While these steps follow one another in a natural sequence, we should always be striving to perfect ourselves in each of these virtues. We should always help others as they strive to improve.
