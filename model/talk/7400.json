The familiar lyrics remind us that prayer is the source of comfort, relief, and protection, willingly granted by our loving, compassionate Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>The Gift of Prayer<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer.p7\" class=\"\">Prayer is a supernal gift of our Father in Heaven to every soul. Think of it: the absolute Supreme Being, the most all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful personage, encourages you and me, as insignificant as we are, to converse with Him as our Father. Actually, because He knows how desperately we need His guidance, He commands, \u201cThou shalt pray vocally as well as in thy heart; yea, before the world as well as in secret, in public as well as in private.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-00605_000_006\">1<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50405\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50405)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50405)\">D&amp;C 19:28<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer.p8\" class=\"\">It matters not our circumstance, be we humble or arrogant, poor or rich, free or enslaved, learned or ignorant, loved or forsaken, we can address Him. We need no appointment. Our supplication can be brief or can occupy all the time needed. It can be an extended expression of love and gratitude or an urgent plea for help. He has created numberless cosmos and populated them with worlds, yet you and I can talk with Him personally, and He will ever answer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>How Should You Pray?<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer.p10\" class=\"\">We pray to our Heavenly Father in the sacred name of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. Prayer is most effective when we strive to be clean and obedient, with worthy motives, and are willing to do what He asks. Humble, trusting prayer brings direction and peace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer.p11\" class=\"\">Don\u2019t worry about your clumsily expressed feelings. Just talk to your compassionate, understanding Father. You are His precious child whom He loves perfectly and wants to help. As you pray, recognize that Father in Heaven is near and He is listening.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer.p12\" class=\"\">A key to improved prayer is to learn to ask the right questions. Consider changing from asking for the things you want to honestly seeking what He wants for you. Then as you learn His will, pray that you will be led to have the strength to fulfill it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer.p13\" class=\"\">Should you ever feel distanced from our Father, it could be for many reasons. Whatever the cause, as you continue to plead for help, He will guide you to do that which will restore your confidence that He is near. Pray even when you have no desire to pray. Sometimes, like a child, you may misbehave and feel you cannot approach your Father with a problem. That is when you most need to pray. Never feel you are too unworthy to pray.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer.p14\" class=\"\">I wonder if we can ever really fathom the immense power of prayer until we encounter an overpowering, urgent problem and realize that we are powerless to resolve it. Then we will turn to our Father in humble recognition of our total dependence on Him. It helps to find a secluded place where our feelings can be vocally expressed as long and as intensely as necessary.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer.p15\" class=\"\">I have done that. Once I had an experience that caused me immense anxiety. It had nothing to do with disobedience or transgression but with a vitally important human relationship. For some time I poured my heart out in urgent prayer. Yet try as I might, I could find no solution, no settling of the powerful stirring within me. I pled for help from that Eternal Father I have come to know and trust completely. I could see no path that would provide the calm that is my blessing generally to enjoy. Sleep overcame me. When I awoke, I was totally at peace. Again I knelt in solemn prayer and asked, \u201cLord, how is it done?\u201d In my heart, I knew the answer was His love and His concern for me. Such is the power of sincere prayer to a compassionate Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer.p16\" class=\"\">I have learned much about prayer by listening to President Hinckley offer supplications in our meetings. You can also learn from him by carefully studying the exceptional public prayer he offered at the conclusion of the October 2001 conference for Father\u2019s children throughout the world. He prayed from his heart, not from a prepared manuscript. (For convenience that prayer is reproduced at the end of this message.)<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-00605_000_006\">2<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cO God, our Eternal Father, Thou great Judge of the Nations, Thou who art the governor of the universe, Thou who art our Father and our God, whose children we are, we look to Thee in faith in this dark and solemn time.

He combines simple words eloquently. He prays as a humble, trusting son who knows well his beloved Father in Heaven. He confides in the certainty that His answer will come when most needed. Each prayer is tailored to its purpose, with a clear statement of what needs resolution, as well as ample expression of gratitude for specific, recognized blessings. His spontaneous prayers are like crafted gems, a silent witness to the fundamental place prayer has occupied in his life for many, many years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>How Are Prayers Answered?<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer.p19\" class=\"\">Some truths regarding how prayers are answered may help you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer.p20\" class=\"\">Often when we pray for help with a significant matter, Heavenly Father will give us gentle promptings that require us to think, exercise faith, work, at times struggle, then act.

Seldom will you receive a complete response all at once. It will come a piece at a time, in packets, so that you will grow in capacity. As each piece is followed in faith, you will be led to other portions until you have the whole answer. That pattern requires you to exercise faith in our Father\u2019s capacity to respond. While sometimes it\u2019s very hard, it results in significant personal growth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer.p22\" class=\"\">He will always hear your prayers and will invariably answer them. However, His answers will seldom come while you are on your knees praying, even when you may plead for an immediate response. Rather, He will prompt you in quiet moments when the Spirit can most effectively touch your mind and heart. Hence, you should find periods of quiet time to recognize when you are being instructed and strengthened. His pattern causes you to grow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer.p23\" class=\"\">President David O.
