I have a\nprayer in my heart that God will sustain and be with me on this occasion.\n<\/p><p>\nAS A MAN THINKETH\n<\/p><p>\nThe ancient statement, \"As [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41389\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41389)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41389)\">Prov. 23:7<\/a><\/span>), is a\ndivine, sublime, and eternal truth. Every act that we have committed and every word that we\nhave spoken have come about as a result of our thoughts. Your character and my character\ntoday are the results of the complete sum of all our thoughts. Thus a man is literally what he\nthinks. Every plant springs forth from its seed. So it is with the deeds of man. Every one of\nhis acts springs forth from the hidden seeds of thought. Our minds are as\nfertile gardens. If we plant in these gardens seeds of impure and unholy thoughts, these seeds\ngrow as weeds and crowd out that which is pure and noble. Under these conditions, our lives\nbecome filled with filthy, ungodly, and immoral actions. Paul, the ancient Christian apostle to\nthe Gentiles, warned humanity against sowing evil thoughts which always result in wicked\ndeeds.\n<\/p><p>\nBe not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\nFor he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the\nSpirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23226\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23226)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23226)\">Gal. 6:7-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn my humble opinion, there is no single passage of scripture that would do more toward\nsaving the world from misery and destruction if the human family would heed its injunction.\nIf all the holy scriptures were suddenly taken from mortal beings but one single\npassage, and if I were asked to select the passage which I thought would be of most benefit to\nthe human family, I believe I would choose that statement made by Paul. Furthermore, I\nwould print that statement indelibly on a large placard and hold it before the eyes of the\npeople continuously.\n<\/p><p>\nHuman beings are so prone to flatter each other and to use the art of sophistry that a true\nmeasure of character cannot always be accurately ascertained by the words we speak. We\nadults are not as little children. They are frank and honest in expressing their opinions.\nPerhaps that is one reason why Jesus declared that except we become as little children we\ncannot enter into the kingdom of heaven\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34091\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34091)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34091)\">Matt. 18:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nCHARACTER SUM TOTAL OF THOUGHTS\n<\/p><p>\nThe only sure measuring rod of character, therefore, is the sum-total of all our thoughts. The\nclaim has been made that if we could look into the hearts and minds of boys and girls and\nperceive their thoughts&mdash;especially their thoughts when their minds are operating undisciplined\naway from their daily assigned tasks&mdash;we could have a rather safe criterion by which to judge\ntheir future happiness and sorrow. It is a well-known fact that as thoughts blossom forth into\nactions, joy and sorrow are the results. Thus it can be said to a young man or to a young\nwoman: \"You tell me your thoughts, and I will tell you your future.\"\n<\/p><p>\nJesus, the Master of life and salvation, proclaimed that:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good\ntreasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure\nbringeth forth evil things (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34075\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34075)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34075)\">Matt. 12:34-35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSince all that is evil and all that is good in human nature comes forth from the heart of man,\nwe shall be held accountable before the judgment seat of God for all that comes from the\nheart. In fact, the gospel plan of salvation proclaims that every man and every woman\nwho have their free agency to choose the course that they follow and who\nare mentally sound and capable of making choices are held responsible for the actions that\nthey commit. God our Eternal Father is both merciful and just. He is very merciful in that he\ngave to the human family the gospel; and to be completely just, he requires each of us to\nobey every word that has come from his mouth.\n<\/p><p>\nRESPONSIBLE FOR OUR WORDS AND ACTS\n<\/p><p>\nAlma the Younger, a great Nephite prophet-teacher, declared that all men, women, and\nchildren who come into this mortal world will eventually be \"brought before the bar of God,\nto be judged according to our works\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8847\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8847)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8847)\">Alma 12:12<\/a><\/span>).\nIf we have lived wicked lives while in mortality,\naccording to this Nephite prophet, at the judgment day:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we shall not be found\nspotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8848\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8848)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8848)\">Alma 12:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAt the judgment day, so great will be the shame of those who have lived wicked lives in\nmortality that they will cry for the mountains to fall upon them and hide them from the\npresence of God (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42176\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42176)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42176)\">Rev. 6:16<\/a><\/span>).\nBut this cannot be the case. Every individual will have to acknowledge that\nJesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, and that his judgments are just and true\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21203\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21203)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21203)\">Deut. 32:4<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42180\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42180)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42180)\">Rev. 15:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAlma was not the only prophet of God who declared that we shall be held responsible for\nevery act that we commit, for every word that we speak, and for every thought that we think.\nJesus, who is the great Judge, Law-giver, and Savior of the world, proclaimed that we shall be\nheld accountable for the secret thoughts of our hearts. He also declared:\n<\/p><p>\nI say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in\nthe day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be\ncondemned (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34076\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34076)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34076)\">Matt. 12:36-37<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior also maintained that all of our secrets eventually shall be made public. To quote\nhis exact words:\n<\/p><p>\nFor there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.\nTherefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which\nye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31189\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31189)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31189)\">Luke 12:2-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf it is true that our baa unspoken thoughts are recorded against us, will it not be just as true\nthat all our good thoughts unspoken, the kindness, tenderness, sympathy, pity, love, beauty,\nand charity that enter the breast and cause the heart to throb with silent good, find\nremembrance in the presence of God, also? Yes, I firmly believe that all of our good impulses\nand thoughts will find remembrance with the Lord just as much as will the evil that we have\nthought, said, or done; and certainly Since God is our loving Father, he will remember\nthe good with a greater degree of satisfaction and joy than he will the evil.\n<\/p><p>\nTHINK PURE THOUGHTS\n<\/p><p>\nMy friends, it will pay high dividends for us to guard our lips, as James, the ancient Christian\nwriter, so plainly taught. \". . . If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and\nable also to bridle the whole body.\" . . . for the tongue which is unbridled \"is a fire, a world\nof iniquity\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26061\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26061)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26061)\">James 3:2,6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf it pays well to guard our lips, it pays just as well and even better to guard our thoughts, for\nevery word that we speak is preceded by the thought. We, as Saints of the Most High, should\naccustom ourselves at all times to think such pure thoughts that if our minds and hearts were\nlaid open before the world, nothing would appear which when brought to light would cause us\nto blush. Since the key to every man is his thoughts, we should thoroughly understand that\nour habitual thoughts will completely determine our character, for the soul is truly dyed by\nthe thoughts. Therefore, thought and character are one. Our reputation is what men believe us\nto be, but our character is what God and angels actually know of us. The Lord gave us the\nkey in modern revelation by which we can build lives of righteousness:\n<\/p><p>\nLet thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let\nvirtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence\nof God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.\nThe Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of\nrighteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without\ncompulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12312\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12312)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12312)\">D&amp;C 121:45-46<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf we would do as the Lord has commanded, we could rest assured of receiving blessings in\ngreat abundance. Surely then we could sing with the psalmist of old:\n<\/p><p>\nWho shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath\nclean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn\ndeceitfully. He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of\nhis salvation (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41738\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41738)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41738)\">Ps. 24:3-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod has revealed to us as Latter-day Saints the true plan of salvation; therefore, it is not only\nour opportunity, but, according to modern revelation, it is the duty of each of us to \"serve him\nwith all [his] your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at\nthe last day\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12223\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12223)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12223)\">D&amp;C 4:2<\/a><\/span>).\nLet us heed the solemn warning found in Ecclesiastes which is\none of the greatest statements in the Old Testament:\n<\/p><p>\nLet us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for\nthis is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into\njudgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21401\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21401)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21401)\">Eccl. 12:13-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nROOTS OF SIN IN OUR THOUGHTS\n<\/p><p>\nThroughout history, men of God have put forth strenuous efforts to reform those individuals\nwho have strayed from the path of truth into the byways of sin. Repentance has been their\ntheme. It is true that repentance is the only pathway back from sin to God; but when one\nbecomes steeped in iniquity, repentance is a long and difficult process. The Master Teacher\nhad a more keen insight into the building of character than did any of the other great teachers\nof history. He declared:\n<\/p><p>\nYe have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say\nunto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with\nher already in his heart (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34043\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34043)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34043)\">Matt. 5:27-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn this and similar statements Jesus declared that the roots of sin lie in our thoughts. This\nbeing true, the proper time to reform people is not after they have formed thought habits but\nto teach our children while they are in their childhood and youth to think no other than pure\nand noble thoughts. At that time their minds are clean and pliable, and it is possible for us\nmore easily to implant in their hearts seeds of purity, truth, and righteousness. Surely, as the\nwriter of the proverb aptly stated:\n<\/p><p>\nTrain up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41388\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41388)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41388)\">Prov. 22:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nRESPONSIBILITY TO DEVELOP PROPER HABITS\n<\/p><p>\nParents in Israel, a heavy responsibility rests on each of us to help our children develop\nproper habits of thinking. The Savior has laid the responsibility on us to be the principal\nagents in teaching our children the gospel plan of salvation. I tremble when I realize the\nresponsibility that is mine as a father. To quote one of the commandments:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are\norganized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the\nSon of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the\nhands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents. For this shall be a law\nunto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized. And their children\nshall be baptized for the remission of their sins when eight years old, and receive the laying\non of the hands. And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before\nthe Lord (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12266\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12266)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12266)\">D&amp;C 68:25-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTeachers throughout the Church who are working in the seminaries and institutes of religion,\nin the Sunday Schools, Primaries, and Priesthood classes, your opportunities and\nresponsibilities are as great as any opportunities and responsibilities that can rest on\nthe shoulders of men. In your charge is given our most priceless\nblessing&mdash;our sons and daughters. It is your duty and calling to assist the parents in Israel in\nplanting in the hearts of the youth of the Church seeds of thought that will shoot forth into\ndeeds of righteousness. What greater calling could men and women have than to be the\nmolders of character? May God bless you in your noble callings; and may he continuously\nbless every one of us that we may think pure and holy thoughts, for \"as [a man] thinketh in\nhis heart, so is he\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41390\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41390)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41390)\">Prov. 23:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn conclusion, I desire to bear testimony that I know that God lives and is indeed our Eternal\nFather, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, and that Joseph Smith is the Prophet\nwhom God foreordained and sent into the world in the last days to establish the only true\nChurch of Jesus Christ, which Church is endowed with power from on high to bring salvation\nto the human family. I also bear witness that President George Albert Smith is also a prophet\nof the Most High and that he holds the keys of the priesthood just as the other holy prophets\nhave done. I humbly pray that God will bless us all in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
