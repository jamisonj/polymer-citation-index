I think that quite generally we do not understand his mission as\nfully in this regard as it is possible for us to do.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the sixth chapter of Exodus there is a statement which is a mistranslation which I will read\nto you: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty,\nbut by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22632\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22632)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22632)\">Ex. 6:2-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, the Hebrew scriptures inform us that he referred to himself and is referred to throughout\nthe Old Testament as Jehovah, so this cannot be a correct translation. It should read: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob. I am the Lord God Almighty, the\nLord JEHOVAH, and was not my name known among them?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThat changes the whole meaning of it.\n<\/p><p>\nNow an advocate is one who defends or pleads for or in behalf of another. A mediator is one\nwho reconciles or brings about agreement between parties. I want to read one or two passages\nof scripture on this point.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Lift up your hearts and be glad, for I am in your midst, and am your advocate with the\nFather; and it is his good will to give you the kingdom\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13099\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13099)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13099)\">D&amp;C 29:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\n\"Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did not sin in whom thou wast\nwell pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou\ngavest that thyself might be glorified\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13114\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13114)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13114)\">D&amp;C 45:3-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold, and hearken, O ye elders of my church, saith the Lord your God even Jesus Christ,\nyour advocate, who knoweth the weakness of man and how to succor them who are tempted\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13126\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13126)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13126)\">D&amp;C 62:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate\nwith the Father\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13174\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13174)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13174)\">D&amp;C 110:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"These are they who are just men made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new\ncovenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13140\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13140)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13140)\">D&amp;C 76:69<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"The power and authority of the higher, or Melchizedek Priesthood, is to hold the keys of all\nthe spiritual blessings of the Church,\n<\/p><p>\n\"To have the privilege of receiving the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,\nto have the heavens opened unto them to commune with the general assembly and church of\nthe Firstborn, and to enjoy the communion and presence of God the Father, and Jesus the\nmediator of the new covenant\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13168\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13168)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13168)\">D&amp;C 107:18-19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis from the First Epistle of John Verse 1, Chapter 2: \"My little children, these things write\nI unto you, that ye sin not.

He\nlearned his language. The first part of Genesis dealing with the creation and with Adam in the\nGarden of Eden is when the Father was present with him.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter he was driven out of the Garden of Eden the scene changed. Adam was banished\nbecause of his transgression from the presence of the Father. The scriptures say he became\nspiritually dead&mdash;that is, he was shut out from the presence of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8938\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8938)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8938)\">Alma 42:9<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24680\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24680)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24680)\">Hel. 14:16<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13101\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13101)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13101)\">D&amp;C 29:41<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFrom that time on Jesus Christ comes on the scene as our advocate, pleading for us as our\nmediator through his ministry and labors to reconcile us, to bring us into agreement with God,\nhis Father.\n<\/p><p>\nThat is part of his great mission. He stands between the Father and man. He pleads our cause.\nYou know when he was upon the earth he prayed frequently, and he prayed for his disciples\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27570\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27570)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27570)\">John 17:20<\/a><\/span>),\npleading with his Father in their behalf, and he has been pleading ever since, and he stands\nbetween us and God, our Father.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to call your attention to one little thing in the first vision of the Prophet Joseph\nSmith. It is very significant, and Joseph Smith did not know it. If he had been perpetrating a\nfraud, he would not have thought of it. You will recall in your reading that the Father and the\nSon appeared, and the Father introduced the Son and told the Prophet to hear the Son\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30324\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30324)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30324)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow suppose the Prophet had come back from the woods and had said the Father and the Son\nappeared to him, and the Father had said, \"Joseph, what do you want?\" and when he asked\nthe question and told him what he wanted, the Father had answered him; then we would know\nthat the story of the Prophet could not be true.\n<\/p><p>\nAll revelation comes through Jesus Christ. I have not time to go into the scriptures and give\nyou references for that, but that is the fact. He it was who led Israel, and if I do not\nprocrastinate upon the time, I will take the rest of it to read to you the statement from\nPresident George Q. Cannon, bearing on this point.\n<\/p><p>\n\"There is in modern Christendom a strong tendency to ascribe to the Father visits and\ncommunications with mankind that were really made by the Lord Jesus. There is even a\nrespectable percentage of the members of his Church, established in these days, who have the\nidea that it was the Father and not the Son who appeared to the patriarchs and prophets of\nold, who delivered Israel from Egypt, who gave the law on Sinai, and who was the guide and\ninspirer of the ancient seers. This was not the understanding of the true servants of God either\nbefore or after his coming. Those who preceded the advent of the Messiah understood that he\nwhom they worshiped as Jehovah should in due time tabernacle in the flesh, and the writings\nof Justin Martyr and other of the early fathers show that this was the belief of the early\nChristian Church on the eastern continent. The writings of the Hebrew prophets, as we have\nthem in the Bible, are perhaps not as plain on this point as are those of the Nephite seers that\nare revealed to us in the Book of Mormon. But we have in this latter record some quotations\nfrom the earlier Hebrew prophets that make this point very clear. Nephi writes,\n<\/p><p>\n\"'And the God of our fathers, who were led out of Egypt, out of bondage, and also were\npreserved in the wilderness by him, yea, the God of Abraham and of Isaac, and the God of\nJacob, yieldeth himself, according to the words of the angel, as a man, into the hands of\nwicked men, to be lifted up, according to the words of Zenock, and to be crucified, according\nto the words of Neum, and to be buried in a sepulchre according to the words of Zenos'\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1515\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1515)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1515)\">1 Ne. 19:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Here we have the testimony of Zenock, Neum, and Zenos that the God of Abraham, Isaac,\nand Jacob was by wicked men to be lifted up, crucified and afterwards buried in a sepulchre,\nshowing that these ancient worthies understood that it was the God of Israel who should come\nto his own. Nephi who himself was a Hebrew and the son of a prophet of that same race, also\ntestifies in the above passage that it was the same God of their fathers who led them out of\nEgypt and preserved them in the wilderness. About four hundred years later another Nephite\nseer, King Benjamin, testifies that an angel came to him and made this glorious promise: \n<\/p><p>\n\"'For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent\nwho reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven\namong the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth\namongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the\nlame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of\ndiseases' (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40249\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40249)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40249)\">Mosiah 3:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA little further on he says: \n<\/p><p>\n\"'And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the\nCreator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.\n<\/p><p>\n\"'And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come unto the children of men even\nthrough faith on his name; and even after all this they shall consider him a man and say that\nhe hath a devil, and shall scourge him and shall crucify him'\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40251\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40251)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40251)\">Mosiah 3:8-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"But we have the word of the Savior himself on this point that puts controversy to an end.\nWhen, after his resurrection and ascension into heaven he first appeared to his Nephite\ndisciples on this land, he declared, 'Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified\nshall come into the world.\n<\/p><p>\n\"'. . . I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins\nof the world' (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5520\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5520)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5520)\">3 Ne. 11:10,14<\/a><\/span>).\nLater during his ministry among the Nephites he affirms:\n'Behold, I say unto you that the law is fulfilled that was given unto Moses.\n<\/p><p>\n\"'Behold, I am he that gave the law, and I am he who covenanted with my people Israel;\ntherefore, the law in me is fulfilled'\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5524\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5524)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5524)\">3 Ne. 15:4-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Should any still have a lingering doubt that the Jehovah who revealed himself to Abraham,\nto Moses and to others was any other than he whom we know in the flesh as Jesus Christ,\nthat doubt is set at rest by the revelations given in these days. In the vision seen by the\nProphet Joseph Smith and by Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple, 3rd of April, 1836, the\nfollowing appears: \n<\/p><p>\n\"'We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and under his feet\nwas a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber.\n<\/p><p>\n\"'His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his\ncountenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the\nrushing of great waters, even the voice of Jehovah, saying: \n<\/p><p>\n\"'I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate\nwith the Father' (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13173\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13173)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13173)\">D&amp;C 110:2-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Somewhat curiously an ancient Syriac manuscript has within the last few months been\nunearthed that is known as the gospel of the Twelve Apostles. Whether the\nTwelve Apostles had anything to do with writing it has nothing to do with the point under\nconsideration. The writing was originally in Hebrew, and what we wish to draw attention to is\nthat whenever the manuscript was first written, the writers of the original believed that Jesus\nwas he who spake with the ancient Israelites. It commences: \n<\/p><p>\n\"'The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, according as it was\nsaid by the Holy Spirit, I send an angel before his face who shall prepare his way.\n<\/p><p>\n\"'It came to pass in the 309th year of Alexander, the son of Philip the Macedonian, in the\nreign of Tiberius Caesar in the government of Herod, the ruler of the Jews, that the Angel\nGabriel, the chief of the angels, by command of God went down to Nazareth to a virgin\ncalled Miriam, of the tribe of Judah the son of Israel (her who was betrothed to Joseph the\nJust), and he appeared to her and said, \"Lo! there ariseth from thee the one who spake with\nour fathers, and he shall be a Savior to Israel; and they who do not confess him shall perish,\nfor his authority is in the lofty heights, and his kingdom does not pass away.\"'\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord bless you all I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
