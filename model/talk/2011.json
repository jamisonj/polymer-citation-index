Frequently married people commit adultery and single people indulge their passions in acts of fornication. The results are unhappiness, the loss of love, breaking up of homes and destroying of family life, increase in the number of divorces, shame, loss of spirituality, apostasy, and eventually loss of eternal salvation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/thou-shalt-not-commit-adultery.p5\" class=\"\">Let us cite only a few of the numerous cases that have come to my personal attention recently.
