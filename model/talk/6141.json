Great was the suffering and terrible were the consequences to all involved in that war. Millions lost their lives. Although my father was not killed, he carried mental and physical scars until he died. Despite his terrifying experiences, he prefaced his diary as follows: \u201cIf I had to do it again, I would do it because it was my duty.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-98911_000_020\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[George A.

In the military cemetery outside Paris, with my hand resting on Stanford Hinckley\u2019s cross, I called President Hinckley on a cellular phone to express my feelings on that occasion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/by-what-power-have-ye-done-this.p6\" class=\"\">World War I was particularly tragic for our family because my father had some second cousins serving on the other side of that conflict in some of the same general battle areas. We eventually became acquainted with these relatives and found them to be decent, God-fearing Christians. They had nothing to do with the grand geopolitics or causes of the war. Like my father, they were serving their country because it was their duty. World War I and the wars that followed brought such great suffering and caused the deaths of countless innocent people. In its simplest terms, wars are so often caused by a great lust for power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/by-what-power-have-ye-done-this.p7\" class=\"\">Tonight I wish to talk to you young men of the priesthood about power and its proper use and its companion, the performance of duty. Power is highly attractive. It can be both good and bad. In your formative years, you young men are attracted to power figures of one kind or another. These often include sports idols, entertainers, people of wealth, and those who have political power. Unfortunately, some young men, particularly those who fall short scholastically, who don\u2019t make the team, or who are not chosen to sing in a specially selected choir may feel rejected and be lured into groups that they think will compensate for their inadequacies. This hunger for acceptance or power draws them like a moth to a flame to street gangs and other associations that can be violent and encourage habits which are dangerous to the body and to the soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/by-what-power-have-ye-done-this.p8\" class=\"\">You young holders of the priesthood have access to the greatest power source in the world. It is the priesthood of God. In complete contrast to other power sources, the holy priesthood, through its proper exercise, continues to build spiritual and physical strength which endures through the eternities. It is\u201dinseparably connected with the powers of heaven\u201d and can be \u201chandled only upon the principles of righteousness.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-98911_000_020\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20999\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20999)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20999)\">D&amp;C 121:36<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Regarding the priesthood, the Prophet Joseph Smith stated: \u201c[It] is the channel through which all knowledge, doctrine, the plan of salvation, and every important matter is revealed from heaven. \u2026 It is the channel through which the Almighty \u2026 has continued to reveal Himself to the children of men to the present time, and through which He will make known His purposes to the end of time.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-98911_000_020\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 4:207.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/by-what-power-have-ye-done-this.p9\" class=\"\">This power comes in proportion to our faithfulness in fulfilling our duties.

Indeed, we can enjoy priesthood power only when we do our duty. The priesthood of this Church has in the past received some hard lessons regarding its duty. The early brethren were untested and untried. Under the Prophet Joseph\u2019s leadership, the Lord taught them and sifted them. They were persecuted and driven unmercifully in learning to do their duty. Many failed.
