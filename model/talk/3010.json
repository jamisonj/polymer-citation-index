We have heard the prophet of God emphasize the importance of this great work and encourage each and every one of us to become fully engaged in the programs. We have heard his call and must respond wholeheartedly. President Romney, the great authority on welfare and chairman of the Church Welfare Committee, has spoken to us and instructed all of us in our duties.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/latter-day-samaritans.p5\" class=\"\">The General Welfare Committee of the Church is made up of the First Presidency of the Church, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Presiding Bishopric, and the presidency of the General Board of the Relief Society, and the secretary, Quinn Gardner\u2014all of whom have been represented here this morning and have contributed greatly. I only hope that I have adequately caught the spirit of this session and may add something of value.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/latter-day-samaritans.p6\" class=\"\">As President Kimball referred to the origins of the modern-day effort in welfare, my thoughts turned to the story of the Good Samaritan, as recorded in the tenth chapter of Luke. In this story the Savior taught perhaps his most stirring lesson on welfare in the meridian of time.

Let us examine what really took place here.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/latter-day-samaritans.p21\" class=\"\">First, the Samaritan \u201chad compassion.\u201d He had the urge to help, for he felt sympathetic to the wounded man\u2019s problem. This kindly affection is brought forth in the heart of anyone who has been touched by the Spirit of the Lord. These empathetic feelings should be felt by each of us toward one another. Indeed, the Savior said that covenant Israel should be known and distinguished by the love they show one for the other. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"28929\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28929)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28929)\">John 13:35<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/latter-day-samaritans.p22\" class=\"\">Second, the Samaritan \u201cwent to him.\u201d He did not wait to be approached by the one in need, but rather perceived the need and stepped forth without being asked to do so. In that great hymn \u201cA Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 153), so loved by the Prophet Joseph, we sense that the high reward promised by the Savior came not just because acts of kindness were performed, but also because they were done spontaneously, consistently, and selflessly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/latter-day-samaritans.p23\" class=\"\">Third, the Samaritan \u201cbound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine.\u201d He provided medical attention and refreshed the sufferer\u2019s thirst. This immediate relief may well have saved the man\u2019s life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/latter-day-samaritans.p24\" class=\"\">Fourth, the Samaritan \u201cset him on his own beast\u201d\u2014that is, he provided transportation and \u201cbrought him to an inn,\u201d a place of rest and care. By providing this appropriate accommodation he ensured the proper conditions for healing to take place.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/latter-day-samaritans.p25\" class=\"\">Fifth, the Samaritan \u201ctook care of him.\u201d Notice that during the critical stages of healing, the Samaritan did not turn the care of the wounded man over to others, but sacrificed of his own time and energy to perform this healing service <span class=\"emphasis\">himself.<\/span> In a time when it is so easy to leave things to someone else, it is important to have so powerful an example as this good Samaritan.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/latter-day-samaritans.p26\" class=\"\">Sixth, the Samaritan \u201con the morrow \u2026 took out two pence, and gave them to the host.\u201d He took of his own money, not someone else\u2019s, and paid for the services he could not render himself. He thus consecrated of his means for the care of the poor and the needy [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"125248\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125248)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125248)\">D&amp;C 84:104\u2013105<\/a><\/span>].<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/latter-day-samaritans.p27\" class=\"\">Seventh, the Samaritan, needing to continue earning his own living, told the innkeeper to \u201ctake care of him.\u201d In this way he enlisted <span class=\"emphasis\">others\u2014resource persons\u2014<\/span>to help and to continue the care.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/latter-day-samaritans.p28\" class=\"\">Eighth, the Samaritan then promised that \u201cwhatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.\u201d Here the ultimate in compassion is shown! He puts no limit on the extent to which he will help. And, perhaps even more significant, he does not drop it there and forget it, but commits himself to return and ensure that all that could be done has been done.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/latter-day-samaritans.p29\" class=\"\">This seems to be the consummate story of service. Inherent in it we find many if not all of the elements of our modern welfare plan. And while we as individuals cannot always fulfill these eight steps of relief by ourselves, we can, through the welfare system, accomplish all of this:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/latter-day-samaritans.p30\" class=\"\">\n\t<span class=\"emphasis\">We can and should have compassion.<\/span>\n      <\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/latter-day-samaritans.p31\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">We can and should seek out those in need.<\/span> The Lord expressly lays this charge on the bishops in the Eighty-fourth Section of the Doctrine and Covenants.

As was stressed last April, I want to give emphasis to the three crucial meetings that must be held if Welfare Services is to be carried forward as the Lord intended. These three are the weekly Ward Welfare Services Committee meeting, the monthly Stake Welfare Services Committee meeting, and the monthly Stake Bishops Council meeting. (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1977, pp. 88\u201390.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">4.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Teach Welfare Services principles and exemplify them in your own life.<\/span> Make it a habit to read the report of these Welfare Services sessions of conference. They contain splendid material on the principles of Welfare Services. Today we have been instructed as fathers in what to teach to our families, as bishops in what to teach our wards. And President Kimball has reminded us of the foundational principles of this Welfare Services work with which we should all familiarize ourselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">5.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Establish and maintain those facilities and systems required to respond to needs.<\/span> Much has been said over the years regarding establishing production projects, storehouses, the employment program, appropriate use of LDS Social Services agencies, and Deseret Industries. I needn\u2019t elaborate on what ought to be or how it should be established. Simply let me remind you that, according to an appropriate plan, we must go forth in establishing the Lord\u2019s complete program.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">6.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Keep the program volunteer centered.<\/span> As a stake president, I observed the transformation in lives and the happiness gained by those who, on a Church service and volunteer basis, gave of themselves as Good Samaritans and as good Christians to heal and prosper the lives of others. I believe it was President Lee who said that we must never let this program become one of professionals. To the extent possible, we should rely on church service\u2014brothers and sisters\u2014to accomplish much of this work. When it is required that we have full- or part-time employees, then let us make certain that those we hire are fully qualified.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/latter-day-samaritans.p44\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, the work of this Church is moving forward as perhaps never before.
