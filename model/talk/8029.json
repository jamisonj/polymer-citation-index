I was relieved and told him that I would consider it my \u201cseven years of plenty.\u201d Well, here I am; my seven years of plenty have come to an end.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/where-your-treasure-is.p6\" class=\"\">Last January my sweetheart, Grace, and I received an assignment to visit the members in the Philippines who were devastated by a major earthquake and a super typhoon. We rejoiced because the assignment was an answer to our prayers and a testament to the mercy and goodness of a loving Father in Heaven. It provided some closure to our longing to personally express to them our love and concern.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/where-your-treasure-is.p7\" class=\"\">Most of the members we met were still living in temporary shelters like tents, community centers, and Church meetinghouses. The homes we visited had either partial roofing or no roofing at all. The people did not have much to begin with, and what little they had was swept away. There was mud and debris everywhere. However, they were full of gratitude for the little help they received and were in good spirits despite their very difficult circumstances. When we asked them how they were coping, everyone responded with a resounding, \u201cWe\u2019re OK.\u201d Obviously, their faith in Jesus Christ gave them hope that everything would work out eventually. Home after home, tent after tent, Sister Teh and I were being taught by these faithful Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/where-your-treasure-is.p8\" class=\"\">In times of calamity or tragedy, the Lord has a way of refocusing us and our priorities. All of a sudden, all the material things we worked so hard to acquire do not matter. All that matters is our family and our relationships with others. One good sister put it this way: \u201cAfter the water receded and it was time to begin cleaning up, I looked around my home and thought, \u2018Wow, I have accumulated a lot of garbage these many years.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/where-your-treasure-is.p9\" class=\"\">I suspect that this sister has gained a better perspective and henceforth will be very cautious in deciding which things are necessary and which ones she really can live without.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/where-your-treasure-is.p10\" class=\"\">In working with many members over the years, we have been pleased to observe an abundance of spiritual strength. We have also seen both an abundance and a lack of material possessions among these faithful members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/where-your-treasure-is.p11\" class=\"\">Out of necessity, most of us are involved in earning money and acquiring some of the world\u2019s goods to be able to sustain our families. It requires a good part of our time and attention. There is no end to what the world has to offer, so it is critical that we learn to recognize when we have enough. If we are not careful, we will begin to chase after the temporal more than the spiritual. Our pursuit for the spiritual and eternal will then take a backseat, instead of the other way around. Sadly, there appears to be a strong inclination to acquire more and more and to own the latest and the most sophisticated.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/where-your-treasure-is.p12\" class=\"\">How do we make sure that we are not drawn down this path?
