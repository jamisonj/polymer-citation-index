Kimball, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1951, pp. 82-90<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy beloved brethren and sisters, I want to assure you today of my humility and my desire to\nsay something which will be helpful. I assure you also of my loyalty, my love for, and my\nfaith in the prophet, seer, and revelator, President David O. McKay, and his Counselors.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the statistics were read this morning of the growth of the Church, the thought came to me\nthat perhaps our beloved President George Albert Smith, President Heber J. Grant, President\nJoseph F. Smith, all of whom I knew personally, and those others who have presided in this\nTabernacle and over this Church, would be gratified to see the tremendous development in the\nChurch. We hope that the spiritual growth has kept pace.\n<\/p><p>\nNEW CHURCH OFFICERS\n<\/p><p>\nToday we have sustained some new men in official positions as General Authorities of the\nChurch. Having known each of these men, my heart is filled with gratitude to have them close\nto us. I have watched Brother Longden grow these past eight years since I met him first. I\nhave been in Brother Stayner Richards' stake and have seen the precision with which his\nwork was carried on. With Brother Moyle I helped to install Brother ElRay Christiansen as\npresident of the East Cache Stake over which he now presides, and there I came in contact\nwith a man of God, one whose love for his Heavenly Father was unsurpassed. It was my\nprivilege just very recently to spend a week with President George Q. Morris in the Eastern\nStates. I had never had the privilege of getting intimately acquainted with him before, but this\nweek convinced me that he is one of God's great servants. And so I am grateful for these four\nmen who are going to be associated with us a little closer than they have been in the past, and\nI am sure you people will be inspired by them. For a decade Brother Romney has been\ngrowing ever closer to his Maker. He has served faithfully; he has proved himself; he has\nstood the test and measured up. I am grateful to have Brother Marion Romney as one of our\nCouncil, and I shall fully sustain him.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I think of the calling of these brethren, I am reminded of the statement made by the\nSavior in the ninth chapter of Luke, in which he says,\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord,\nI will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Jesus said unto him, foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son\nof man hath not where to lay his head.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and\nbury my father.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom\nof God.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell,\nwhich are at home at my house.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking\nback, is fit for the kingdom of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31293\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31293)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31293)\">Luke 9:57-62<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFive men today have put their hands firmly on the plow, never to turn back. They have been\nwilling to make adjustments, whatever is required, and the adjustments will not be few. They\ndo not fear sacrifice. And so it is with the members of the Church to a greater or lesser\nextent.\n<\/p><p>\n\"PROVE THEM HEREWITH\"\n<\/p><p>\nBefore we came into the world, the Lord said to us and to the great multitude,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . we will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and\nwe will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to\nsee if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7184\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7184)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7184)\">Abr. 3:24-25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI believe it was from this very pulpit that my grandfather presented a sermon in which he\nsaid, \"The test, the test, the TEST is coming.\" Well, the test is here. The test has always been\nhere. We came into the world as a test. All the way down the line there are adjustments to\nmake. There are sins to overcome. There is much to learn. There are weaknesses above which\nwe must rise. We must gain self-mastery, become righteous, and attain unto perfection.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the early days of the ministry of the Savior, he gave to us in a great sermon: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy\ncloak also.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34416\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34416)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34416)\">Matt. 5:40-41<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he says a little later,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and\npray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; \n<\/p><p>\nThat ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the\npublicans the same?\n<\/p><p>\nBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34417\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34417)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34417)\">Matt. 5:44-46,48<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSPIRIT GIVETH LIFE\n<\/p><p>\nThe letter killeth and the spirit giveth life\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3022\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3022)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3022)\">2 Cor. 3:6<\/a><\/span>),\nand in all of our activities we should remember that.\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Romney spoke of the beautiful life of the Savior, his life of sacrifice. I wonder as we\ngo into our testimony meetings if we ponder on the atonement and his sacrifice. The letter\nkilleth, but the spirit giveth life. Do we take the bread and the water in remembrance of the\nbody, the flesh and the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, or do we just take bread and water?\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we pray to our Heavenly Father, do we follow routine procedures and pray a prayer of\nwords or do we pray unto the Lord with all our hearts and souls? The letter killeth, and the\nspirit giveth life. Just this week a young woman said to me that she had been praying for light\nand for the solution to some of her problems, but though she had uttered many prayers she felt\nthat her petitions had not gone higher than the ceiling.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd with the other principles of the gospel&mdash;are we sincere and devout? Do we pay our\ntithes with a great devotion&mdash;with a gratitude for the privilege, or do we pay as a matter of\nfact and through routine, or because we feel under pressure? It is my candid opinion that the\nLord does not need the tithes we pay. Certainly he puts them to beneficial use, in the erection\nof chapels, temples, in missionary work, in educational endeavors, but the Lord could find\nother ways and means to finance his program without the tithes. It is you and I who are\nblessed when we pay the tithes. We have obeyed a principle; we have mastered our desires;\nwe have obeyed a commandment without necessarily knowing fully why. You will remember\nthat the angel said to Adam, \"Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said\nunto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38996\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38996)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38996)\">Moses 5:6<\/a><\/span>). Adam was a\nman of God with a great faith, and he continued to offer sacrifices unto the Lord because it\nhad been commanded, even though he did not fully understand why, and even though it\nmeant a considerable financial sacrifice to him. Why did he offer sacrifices&mdash;because it was a\ncommandment of his Heavenly Father. He had been told to perform this act by one whom he\nknew to be his God. He had absolute faith and confidence that blessings would come through\nsuch obedience, and he did not hesitate. After he had lived the law, then came the\nunderstanding, for the miracle follows the faith rather than faith the miracle. The angel\nexplained to him that it was to keep him in constant memory of the coming of the Christ who\nwould save the world, and exalt those of the people who would live the commandments.\n<\/p><p>\nHad Adam waited until he could have fully understood and rationalized the program, perhaps\nin the meantime his family would have fallen away from the truth, and he himself might have\nlost his faith. He needed something tangible&mdash;a constant sacrifice&mdash;to help him to remember\nthe coming of the Savior at a later time. And so we partake of the sacrament to remind us of\nthe sacrifice that the Savior did make, and now we may pay our tithes which will be a\nconstant reminder to us of the promises and the requirements of our Heavenly Father. So each\ntime we pay our tithes it is a personal sacrifice and brings with it a blessing in faith and\ncloseness to our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE WORD OF WISDOM\n<\/p><p>\nFrequently I hear people talk about the Word of Wisdom and emphasize the fact that it will\nincrease the period of their lives if they observe it strictly. I, also, believe that it is the Lord's\nlaw of health and that it will extend our lives and will give us better health while we live. But\nthat is not the reason I obey the law of the Word of Wisdom, and I wish to digress to\nemphasize again that the Word of Wisdom is a law. From this very pulpit it has been declared\nby prophets of God to be a law&mdash;not just a suggestion.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Francis M. Lyman, in the April 1908 general conference said: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . I believe the time is ripe for the Latter-day Saints, particularly, to place\nthemselves in accord with this revelation, the Word of Wisdom, which was given in\nthe beginning by the Prophet Joseph as a Word of Wisdom, with promises which are\nvery precious. In the beginning, it was not laid down as a strict commandment. I do\nnot know whether or not the Lord took into account the fact that our forefathers, and\nour fathers had been so used to many things forbidden in the Word of Wisdom that it\nmight be difficult for them to order their lives in harmony with those requirements: so\nwe were given perhaps thirty to forty years of training and experience before the Lord\nannounced, through his servant the Prophet Brigham Young, that the Word of Wisdom\nhas now become a commandment of the Lord. President Young laid it down very\nstrictly and exactly from this stand that from that time henceforth the Word of\nWisdom is a commandment from the Lord, and all Latter-day Saints are required to\nobserve it. (Conference Report, April 1908, 14-15.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has insisted upon our refraining from the use of liquor, tobacco, and tea and coffee.\nI am sure that such abstinence will increase the length of our lives and increase the vigor of\nour lives. But I am sure that a deeper value comes from the observance of the Word of\nWisdom than the mere length of life, for after all we must finally all pass away. The time will\ncome when our bodies and spirits are separated, and our bodies will be laid in Mother Earth\nto go through the regular process, and though we do wish to continue our mortal existence as\nlong as we can consistently, I am confident that there are greater blessings which will come to\nus than the strictly physical.\n<\/p><p>\nOBEDIENCE BRINGS BLESSINGS\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I refrain from the use of these forbidden things, I am obeying my Heavenly Father, and\nwhether or not I understand the purpose I will still receive the blessing. The Lord has\npromised to all of us who obey his commandments and live his statutes that all that he has is\nours. The living of the Word of Wisdom is a test. Perhaps he chose to make a part of this test\nthose things which would be universally used and would take character and courage and\nstrength to leave alone. It was given as a principle and \". . . adapted to the capacity of the\nweak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12919\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12919)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12919)\">D&amp;C 89:3<\/a><\/span>). If one\nobeys the Word of Wisdom only because of the physical, perhaps it is of the letter. But if he\ncan stand the test and prove himself that he will obey the commands of God, then it is of the\nspirit, and he will reap rich blessings. There may be other things which are destructive to the\nbody, but since the Lord through his prophets has specifically mentioned certain items, then\nthese we must refrain from using. Should the Lord later include in the Word of Wisdom any\nother things which are difficult, we will also obey them.\n<\/p><p>\nLAW OF THE FAST\n<\/p><p>\nThe law of the fast is another test. If we merely go without food to supply welfare funds, it is\nmuch of the letter, but in real fasting, for spiritual blessings, come self-mastery and increased\nspirituality.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the fourteenth chapter of Luke the Lord says,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren,\nneither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors; lest they also bid thee again, and a\nrecompense be made thee.\n<\/p><p>\nBut when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be\nrecompensed at the resurrection of the just\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31297\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31297)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31297)\">Luke 14:12-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAre we interested in what we can get or are we interested in what we can give? The Savior's\nlife was one of unselfish service. The Savior's doctrine and gospel is one of selflessness. Are\nwe interested in the glamorous and in the spectacular? Is our Church service like the prayer of\nthe Pharisee or like the Publican? You will remember the Savior gave us the parable,\n<\/p><p>\nTwo men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a\npublican.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as\nother men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.\n<\/p><p>\nI fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the publican, standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven,\nbut smote upon his breast saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.\n<\/p><p>\nI tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every\none that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be\nexalted (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31300\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31300)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31300)\">Luke 18:10-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHE MANSION\n<\/p><p>\nIn his booklet, The Mansion, Henry Van Dyke gives us a most interesting picture of the type\nof man who prays for show and for his great words, who makes his gifts where they will\nbring him personal return, who serves himself first and his neighbor as a convenience to\nhimself. (See Henry Van Dyke The Mansion, pp. 16-23, 55 ff., 57-59.) His story is of one\nJohn Weightman who lived in a large stone house which carried the air of calm and reserved\nopulence. Like his house he was a self-made man, firm, solid, successful. The stern\narchitecture of his home was symbolical of his social position, religious doctrine, and business\ncreed. He gave generously to established charities. There were foundations which he\nestablished. He gave his family luxuries, trips, court presentations, seasons on the Riviera. His\nname was known and respected far and wide. Over a hundred million dollars had sat around\nhis table at banquets.\n<\/p><p>\nWeightman had expressed to his critical son, \"I have never made a single dollar that the\ncourts would not uphold, at least in the long run, and yet my affairs have prospered. Not one\nof my charities but has brought me in a good return, either in the increase of influence, the\nbuilding up of credit, or the association with substantial people. Of course, you have to be\ncareful how you give to secure the best results. No indiscriminate giving, no pennies in\nbeggars' hats.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHis check in the collection plate was far more valuable to him than an equal amount in cash\nwould have been. He identified himself with all public drives and reminded his son, \"You will\nlearn, my boy, that it is wisdom to put your gifts where they can be identified and do you\ngood also.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHis son would have him assist a sick man whose business was failing, but the father said,\n\"Give him a few hundred, but don't overwork your gratitude. All you'll get from him will be\na letter of thanks. Don't get sentimental. Religion is not a matter of sentiment, but principle.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the son had left, John Weightman sat alone in his carved chair feeling strangely old and\ndull. On the library table were clippings praising him for his benevolence. One editor called\nthem the \"Weightman Charities.\" There were hospitals he had endowed, schools he had\nhelped, community enterprises which he had fostered. His son's denunciation had caused him\nto think. Could he be wrong in his philosophy of life? He sat at the table; the opened Bible\nlay before him. His eyes fell upon the words, \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth\"\nthen sleepily, heavily, he tried to fix his mind upon it. He read further, \". . . but lay up\nfor yourselves treasures in heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34428\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34428)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34428)\">Matt. 6:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\nThe book seemed to float away&mdash;the light vanished.\nCould this be death? The thought came quietly, irresistibly. He sank to the table and slipped\ninto the blank unknown.\n<\/p><p>\nHis life seemed to be returning to him after a blank interval and Mr. Weightman found\nhimself in a strange land traversing paths and meeting friendly groups clothed in white,\namong whom he recognized the old village doctor, a plain, hard-working, self-sacrificing man.\nAnother one he recognized was a poor bookkeeper who had slaved through the years to care\nfor a crippled daughter while the mother was in an institution for the insane. This also had\nbeen a life of sacrifice. He saw a widow who had labored long and with much sacrifice for\nher children: a schoolmaster who had devoted himself to the training of youth, and many\nothers with joyful countenances and light steps&mdash;all these people seemed to be going to the\nEternal City to possess their mansions.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the stream of people came to the Holy City, a robed personage welcomed them. \"Come in,\nyour mansions are ready.\" One by one the individuals left the party and entered the mansions\nwhich were prepared for them. There was evidence of surprised joy, as though their buildings\nwere lovelier than they had expected. From within came sweet voices of welcome, low\nlaughter, and sweet songs.\n<\/p><p>\nThe largest mansion and the most beautiful of them all was pointed out to the doctor as his,\nand John Weightman was left alone with the guide.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Where do you wish to go?\" asked the guide. And Weightman recounted his many charities,\nhis gifts, and his endowments, and when the guide stopped before a rude hut, small as the\nshepherd's shelter, apparently made of discarded scraps and cast-off materials, the earth-man\nwas shocked! Surely there must be a mistake! He renamed the many things he had done for\nschools and churches and hospitals, and the angel-guide said, \"We have saved and used\neverything you sent to us&mdash;this is the mansion prepared for you. All the things you did on\nearth&mdash;many of them were good&mdash;but verily you have had your reward for them. Would\nyou be paid twice? The good you accomplished in the world counted where you counted it,\nbut it does not belong here.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe deep, searching, flaming look of the guide seemed to strip John Weightman naked and\nwithered him as he winced and cried brokenly, \"Tell me, then, if my life has been of such\nlittle worth, how came I here at all?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Through the mercy of the King,\" it came softly.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Then how have I earned it?\" John asked.\n<\/p><p>\n\"It was not earned&mdash;it was&mdash;given. <i>Only that good which is done for the love of duty, only<\/i>\n<i>those plans in which the welfare of others is the master-thought, only those labors in which<\/i>\n<i>the sacrifice is greater than the reward, only those gifts in which the giver forgets himself.<\/i>\nWas there nothing like that in your life?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Nothing,\" he sighed. \"If so, they were few, and I have long ago forgotten them.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe guide smiled gently, \"These are the things that the King never forgets; and because there\nwere a few of them in your life, you have a little place here.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"John Weightman's numbness prickled into normalcy. Bodily weariness and lassitude\nweighted upon him, but he was calm, resolute, and light of heart. What had happened to him\nhe knew not. But this he knew&mdash;great truths had been forced into his consciousness.\n<\/p><p>\nThis man Weightman, like many of the moderns, forgot the admonition of the Lord when he\nsaid: \n<\/p><p>\nBut when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: That\nthine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward\nthee openly (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34421\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34421)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34421)\">Matt. 6:3-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThey also forget that the Lord said: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray\nstanding in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of\nmen. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34422\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34422)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34422)\">Matt. 6:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThey forget also that the Lord said again: \n<\/p><p>\nMoreover, when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they\ndisfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you,\nThey have their reward (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34427\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34427)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34427)\">Matt. 6:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGRATITUDE FOR UNSELFISHNESS\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful that all through this great Church there are many people who live unselfishly,\nwho pray in the quiet of their homes, who are far more interested in paying their tithes of\nwhich no one knows except their bishop, than they are to pay large contributions which may\nbe heralded far and wide. I am grateful that there are numerous people in this Church who go\nquietly week after week to attend their meetings; worship the Lord in their assemblies; bear\ntestimony in their fast meetings; serve faithfully as ward teachers, stake missionaries, or in the\nauxiliaries or priesthood quorums without glamour, without praise, without public notice.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us, brothers and sisters, that we may \"seek first the kingdom\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34429\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34429)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34429)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>), that we may forget\nall else, and that we may project ourselves out of ourselves into the great world of service to\nour fellow men, realizing that after all, the two great commandments which the Lord gave to\nus did this very thing. He did not mention ourselves, he mentioned others. He said,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with\nall thy mind, and with all thy strength . . . love thy neighbor as thyself\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33047\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33047)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33047)\">Mark 12:30-31<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAll of this is service to others&mdash;love of others, not love of nor service to ourselves. May the\nLord bless us that we may be unselfish in this kingdom, give of ourselves generously that we\nmay live by the spirit rather than by the letter, that we may continue to rear large families,\ntraining them in righteousness to the end. And all this I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
