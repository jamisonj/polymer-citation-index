It is not easy for many of them. We are grateful to you. I should like to say some things particularly to you, and I do so by recounting a portion of a story with which you are already familiar. It is the story of David, the son of Jesse.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/overpowering-the-goliaths-in-our-lives.p4\" class=\"\">As you will recall, the army of Israel under the leadership of King Saul was engaged in a deadly war with the army of the Philistines. One army was poised on one hill, the other on an opposite hill, with a valley in between. Now, the Philistines had among their men a great giant of a man named Goliath of Gath. His height was six cubits and a span. If I have figured correctly, that would put him somewhere in the neighborhood of nine feet tall. What a basketball center he might have made!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/overpowering-the-goliaths-in-our-lives.p5\" class=\"\">Clad in his armor, he came down to the valley and called out to the army of Israel:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/overpowering-the-goliaths-in-our-lives.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cChoose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/overpowering-the-goliaths-in-our-lives.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cIf he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/overpowering-the-goliaths-in-our-lives.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cI defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2660\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2660)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2660)\">1 Sam. 17:8\u201310<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/overpowering-the-goliaths-in-our-lives.p9\" class=\"\">When Saul and the army of Israel looked at this giant and heard his chilling challenge, they were frightened because they had no one of their own of such stature.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/overpowering-the-goliaths-in-our-lives.p10\" class=\"\">Now, while all of this was going on, Jesse, David\u2019s father, asked his young son to take some food to his three brothers in the army. When he arrived at the battleground, Goliath came out again, issuing the same challenge, which David heard. There was fear throughout the army of Israel. David, who was no more than a boy, said to the king, (and I paraphrase his language): \u201cKing, why are you so afraid of this giant?

He told the king of how he had fought with a lion and a bear to save his father\u2019s sheep and concluded by saying that the Lord would deliver him out of the hand of the Philistine. Saul, possibly thinking that one more life lost would not be serious among the great losses they had already sustained, said to David, \u201cGo, and the Lord be with thee.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2662\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2662)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2662)\">1 Sam. 17:37<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/overpowering-the-goliaths-in-our-lives.p13\" class=\"\">Saul then placed armor on David until the boy could scarcely walk.

I would like to bring it down into your own lives. There are Goliaths all around you, hulking giants with evil intent to destroy you. These are not nine-foot-tall men, but they are men and institutions that control attractive but evil things that may challenge and weaken and destroy you. Included in these are beer and other liquors and tobacco. Those who market these products would like to enslave you into their use. There are drugs of various kinds which, I am told, are relatively easy to obtain in many high schools. For those who peddle them, this is a multimillion-dollar industry, a giant web of evil. There is pornography, seductive and interesting and inviting.

Within its walls he kept his fine automobiles and his expensive jewelry. Then, fearful of intruders who might enter and rob him, he had installed expensive dead-bolt locks so that he had to use a key to get out as well as to get in. He put bars on the windows and doors, and was like a prisoner looking out of his own home, as one might do out of a jail. He installed costly electronic surveillance devices to turn on lights and set off sirens should any unwelcome individual enter. He landscaped largely without trees or shrubbery so there would be no place for a thief to hide. And he smugly said to himself, \u201cNow I am secure.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/overpowering-the-goliaths-in-our-lives.p31\" class=\"\">But what he did not realize is that neither bars nor dead-bolts, neither lights nor sirens nor anything of the kind would have the slightest effect on intruders of another variety who could destroy the lives of his children, despoil the marriage which had been the source of his happiness over many years, bind him with cords of meanness and bitterness and hate toward those he had once loved, and lock him in a dungeon cell of despair and misery.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/overpowering-the-goliaths-in-our-lives.p32\" class=\"\">Brethren, I spend much time listening to the tales of unhappy people.

I recall an assignment some years back to restore the blessings of a man who had been excommunicated from the Church because of his sin. He came to my office with his wife. I spoke with them individually. I asked him how it all began. He held a responsible position in the Church.

It intrigued him. It appealed to him. He found himself buying more of these things. Then he sought out movies which titillated him and excited him. Knowing that his wife would be a party to none of this, he went alone. He found occasion to leave town and go to other cities where he could more easily indulge his desires. He then found excuses to stay late at his office and asked his secretary to stay with him.

He spoke of his love for the wife who had forgiven him and remained true to him. He spoke of his love for his children, who had been shamed and embarrassed by his actions. He told of the hell through which he had walked for some four years from the time of his excommunication. He spoke of his love for the Church and of his desire to again enjoy its full blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/overpowering-the-goliaths-in-our-lives.p37\" class=\"\">In the presence of his wife, I placed my hands upon his head and in the authority of the holy priesthood restored his priesthood, his temple endowment, his temple sealing, and all other blessings which he had formerly held.
