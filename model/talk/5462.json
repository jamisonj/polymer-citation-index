Our friendship goes back, I guess, over three decades. Of course, I\u2019ve always wondered why when I moved to New York, you moved to Boston. And then when I moved to Boston, you moved back to New York. No longer can you escape! You join the greatest quorum that you can possibly belong to because of the brotherhood and fellowship that is there. Welcome, Elder Hales!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p4\" class=\"\">The Book of Mormon begins with these words: \u201cI, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2076\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2076)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2076)\">1 Ne. 1:1<\/a><\/span>). What a different world this would be if the personal journals of each of our Father in Heaven\u2019s children could begin with a similar phrase\u2014having goodly parents and being taught by them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p5\" class=\"\">We live in such a special time in history, a time when the Lord\u2019s gospel has been restored in its fulness. Our missionary force is increasing in quality and quantity; thus, the gospel is being taught in more languages to more nations, and to greater numbers of listening ears than ever before. As wards and stakes are being established in most parts of the world, creative minds have been inspired to develop communication instruments which are capable of bringing the instructions of the prophets to the ears of many, many more people. The good news of the gospel can now spread more rapidly to bring the hope of everlasting peace to the hearts of mankind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p6\" class=\"\">One of the great messages of the gospel is the doctrine of the eternal nature of the family unit. We declare to the world the value and importance of family life, but much of the confusion and difficulty we find existing in the world today is being traced to the deterioration of the family. Home experiences where children are taught and trained by loving parents are diminishing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p7\" class=\"\">Family life, where children and parents communicate together in study, play, and work, has been replaced by a quick, individual, microwaved dinner and an evening in front of the TV set. In 1991 the National Association of Counties, meeting in Salt Lake City, thought that the lack of home influence had reached such a point of becoming a crisis in our nation and spent time in their meetings discussing their concerns. They identified five basic concepts that could increase every family\u2019s chances for success.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p8\" class=\"\">First, strengthen relationships through family activities; second, establish reasonable rules and expectations; third, build self-esteem; fourth, set achievable goals; and fifth, periodically evaluate family strengths and needs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p9\" class=\"\">Suddenly the urgent and warning voice of our prophets from the very beginning of time has special relevance. As we have been counseled and encouraged, we must be attentive to our own families and accelerate our missionary effort to bring others to a knowledge of the truth and the importance of the family unit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p10\" class=\"\">In the very beginning, the Lord\u2019s instructions to Adam and Eve made clear their responsibilities as parents. Their roles were well defined.

In the ninety-third section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we find the Lord chastising some of the brethren for not paying attention to their family responsibilities. The scriptures read:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cBut I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cYou have not taught your children light and truth, according to the commandments; and that wicked one hath power, as yet, over you, and this is the cause of your affliction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now a commandment I give unto you\u2014if you will be delivered you shall set in order your own house, for there are many things that are not right in your house\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20151\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20151)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20151)\">D&amp;C 93:40, 42\u201343<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p19\" class=\"\">Years ago the Church admonished all parents to hold weekly family home evenings. Today that admonition has been institutionalized in the homes of Church members. Monday night has been set aside as an evening for families to be together. No Church activities or social appointments should be sponsored on this night. We have been promised great blessings if our families would be faithful in this regard.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p20\" class=\"\">President Lee once counseled us:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cNow keep in mind this; that when the full measure of Elijah\u2019s mission is understood, that the hearts of the children will be turned to the fathers, and the fathers to the children [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32910\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32910)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32910)\">Mal. 4:5\u20136<\/a><\/span>]. It applies just as much on this side of the veil as it does on the other side of the veil. If we neglect our families here in having family home night and we fail in our responsibility here, how would it look if we lost some of those through our own neglect? Heaven would not be heaven until we have done everything we can to save those whom the Lord has sent through our lineage\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Relief Society Courses of Study, 1977\u201378,<\/span> Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1977, p. 2).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p22\" class=\"\">Then he continued:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cSo, the hearts of you fathers and mothers must be turned to your children <span class=\"emphasis\">right now,<\/span> if you have the true spirit of Elijah, and not think that it applies merely to those who are beyond the veil. Let your hearts be turned to your children, and teach your children; but you must do it when they are young enough to be properly schooled. And if you are neglecting your family home evening, you are neglecting the beginning of the mission of Elijah just as certainly as if you were neglecting your research work of genealogy\u201d (ibid.; emphasis added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p24\" class=\"\">I\u2019ve often thought of the happy times we had when our family was young and our children were at home. I have made a mental review of those days and considered the changes I would make in our family organization and administration if we had the opportunity to live that period over again. There are two areas I would determine to improve if that privilege were granted to me to have young children in our home once again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p25\" class=\"\">The first would be to spend more time as husband and wife in a family executive committee meeting learning, communicating, planning, and organizing to better fulfill our roles as parents.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p26\" class=\"\">The second wish I would like, if I could have those years over, would be to spend more family time.

If you want to live in a world of peace, security, and opportunity, the family you contribute to can add to the well-being, yes, even of the whole world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p29\" class=\"\">I remember an example of this that occurred over the Christmas holidays one year when we had the grandchildren on an outing with us. In order to have a real togetherness experience, we had arranged for a van to travel together. In the van were Grandpa and Grandma and my son and his three older children. My son\u2019s wife had stayed at home with the younger members of the family. I was taking my turn at the wheel, and my wife was seated next to me acting as our navigator. From the back end of the van, I heard Audrey, the eldest child, counseling with her father. She was saying, \u201cDad, one of our goals this year was to finish the Book of Mormon in our family study. This is the last day of the year. Why don\u2019t we complete it now so that we will be on schedule?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/05\/therefore-i-was-taught.p30\" class=\"\">What a special experience it was to listen to my son and his three children, each taking turns reading aloud the final chapters of Moroni and completing their goal of reading the entire Book of Mormon.

You have so much to give to add to the growth and development of the families to which you belong. I challenge you to step forward in your family units with that special, enthusiastic spirit of your youth to make the gospel really live in your homes. Remember the counsel of President Joseph F.

There is nothing that can compensate for its loss. There is nothing on earth that can compare with the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ. Let, therefore, all the parents in Zion look after their children, and teach them the principles of the gospel, and strive as far as possible to get them to do their duty\u2014not mechanically, because they are urged to do it, but try to instill into the hearts of the children the spirit of truth and an abiding love for the gospel, that they may not only do their duty because it is pleasing to their parents, but because it is pleasing also to themselves\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Masterpieces of Latter-day Saint Leaders,<\/span> comp.
