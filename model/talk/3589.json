And yet every day we see people whose lives become entangled and who are bumped and bruised because they fail to plan, to think, to consult with others, to follow the teachings of the gospel. I appreciate what has been said tonight to the boys of the Aaronic Priesthood. And since they constitute a very substantial part of this vast congregation, boys whose lives are largely ahead of them, I should like to speak to them, to help save them from some of the bumps and bruises of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/four-bs-for-boys.p15\" class=\"\">I should like to offer what I have chosen to call \u201cFour Bs for Boys.\u201d They are: (1) Be Smart, (2) Be Fair, (3) Be Clean, and (4) Be True.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Be smart.<\/span>\n\t  <\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>By this I do not mean be smart-alecky or anything of that nature. I mean be wise. Be smart about training your minds and hands for the future. Each of you is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Each of you is a son of God. You have an obligation to make the most of your life. Plan now for all the education you can get, and then work to bring to pass a fulfillment of that plan.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>You live in a complex age. The world needs men and women of ability and training. Do not short-circuit your education.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I am not suggesting that all of you should become professional men. What I am suggesting is this: whatever you choose to do, train for it. Qualify yourselves. Take advantage of the experience and learning of those who have gone before you in whatever field you choose. Education is a shortcut to proficiency. It makes it possible to leapfrog over the mistakes of the past. Regardless of the vocation you choose, you can speed your journey in getting there through education.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Lord himself has said to all of us: \u201cSeek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17646\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17646)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17646)\">D&amp;C 88:118<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Over the years the Church has put vast sums of money into education, secular as well as religious. From the beginning of this work, our leaders have taught us the importance of training.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Be smart. Do not forfeit the schooling that will enhance your future in order to satisfy your desire for immediate, fleeting pleasure. Cultivate the long view of your life. Most of you are going to be around for a good while.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Be smart\u2014in your appearance, in your deportment, in your manners. I am not suggesting that you go about dressed as a fashion plate. I am suggesting that you be clean and neat in your appearance, that you be gentle in your speech, that you be courteous and respectful in your manner. Each of you is a Mormon boy. Whether you think it or not, you will reflect good or ill on the Church by reason of your behavior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Be smart. Do not be so shortsighted as to indulge in the use of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. It simply is not smart to do so. It is stupid, if you will pardon that harsh word, to use cocaine, marijuana, or any of the other drugs that rob you of control of your mind. After every drug-induced \u201chigh,\u201d there is a reactionary \u201clow.\u201d Why spend money on that which can only harm you? Why become enslaved to a habit that can only hinder and short-circuit your future?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Beer and other forms of alcohol will do you no good. Their use will be expensive, will dull your conscience, and could lead to the disease called alcoholism, which is humiliating, dangerous, and even deadly. Tobacco will shorten your life. Studies show that it will enslave you, weaken your lungs, and statistically that it will shorten your life seven minutes for each cigarette smoked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Be smart. Take the Lord at his word. His is the wonderful promise that those Saints who follow his counsel in these matters \u201cshall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cAnd shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17651\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17651)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17651)\">D&amp;C 89:19\u201320<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Young men, do you wish to run and not be weary and to walk and not faint and to grow in knowledge and understanding?

Most of you will go on missions, we hope all of you. You will learn the importance of friendshipping and fellowshipping. Now is the time to practice these principles, to reach out with appreciation and kindness to others. Many a young man has come into this Church because of the friendship of a high school associate. I earnestly hope that no boy within the sound of my voice will ever do anything to prejudice an associate against the Church or its people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I should like to add that I feel that there is no real basis for such charges of discrimination. But, be they true or not, I want to suggest that we develop an outreaching attitude to help those who are not of us, to encourage them, to lead them in a gracious and kindly way toward those associations which could expose them to the wonderful programs of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I think of Edwin Markham\u2019s poem:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t\t<span class=\"emphasis\">He drew a circle that shut me out\u2014<\/span>\n\t      <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t\t<span class=\"emphasis\">Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout.<\/span>\n\t      <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t\t<span class=\"emphasis\">But Love and I had the wit to win:<\/span>\n\t      <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t\t<span class=\"emphasis\">We drew a circle that took him in!<\/span>\n\t      <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/four-bs-for-boys.p37\" class=\"\">(\u201cOutwitted,\u201d in <span class=\"emphasis\">The Best Loved Poems of the American People,<\/span> sel.

Your chances for a happy and lasting marriage will be far greater if you will date those who are active and faithful in the Church. Such dating is most likely to lead to marriage in the House of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>What I am speaking against is any attitude whatever that demeans, that downgrades, that leads to evil speaking of another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In athletic contests there is no occasion for booing and catcalls. Of course mistakes are made by umpires and referees. Of course players do things outside the rules. But the score will not be changed by all the booing in the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Be fair. As you move onward in your lives, in your university studies and beyond, avoid shady and unfair practices. Clean competition is wholesome; but immoral, dishonest, or unfair practices are reprehensible, and particularly on the part of a Latter-day Saint.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Be fair. The best rule ever given concerning standards of fairness was spoken by the Lord when he said, \u201cWhatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36753\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36753)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36753)\">Matt. 7:12<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Be clean.<\/span>\n\t  <\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Lord himself said, \u201cBe ye clean.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17592\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17592)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17592)\">D&amp;C 38:42<\/a><\/span>.) I speak particularly of moral cleanliness. There is no substitute under the heavens for personal virtue.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>We live in a time when the world considers virtue lightly. You young men of the Church cannot consider it lightly. For a Latter-day Saint, loss of virtue inevitably means loss of self-respect, loss of respect for her with whom he transgresses, loss of discipline in managing one\u2019s mind and body, and loss of integrity as a holder of the priesthood. Of course there is repentance, and of course there is forgiveness. But there will also be heartache and regret and disappointment. There may likewise be cast a cloud upon your opportunity for future service in the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I am not asking you to be prudish. I am asking you to be virtuous, and I think there is a vast difference between the two.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Be clean. Watch what you read. No good and much harm can come of reading pornographic magazines and other such literature. They will only stimulate within you thoughts that will weaken your discipline of yourself.

This elderly man, who had known so much of sorrow and trouble, as well as love for the Lord and His great work, stood before that congregation and said in measured words:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/four-bs-for-boys.p51\" class=\"\">\u201cI cannot expect to tarry a great while longer with you, but I want to give you a few words of counsel.

I want you to look at this. Young men, listen to the counsel of your brethren. Live near to God; pray while young; learn to pray; learn to cultivate the Holy Spirit of God; link it to you and it will become a spirit of revelation unto you, inasmuch as you nourish it.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Wilford Woodruff: History of His Life and Labors,<\/span> sel.

In 1856 more than a thousand of our people, some of them perhaps your forebears, found themselves in serious trouble while crossing the plains to this valley. Because of a series of unfortunate circumstances, they were late in getting started. They ran into snow and bitter cold in the highlands of Wyoming. Their situation was desperate, with deaths occurring every day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/four-bs-for-boys.p53\" class=\"\">President Young learned of their condition as the October general conference was about to begin. He immediately called for teams, wagons, drivers, and supplies to leave to rescue the bereft Saints. When the first rescue team reached the Martin Company, there were too few wagons to carry the suffering people. The rescuers had to insist that the carts keep moving.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/four-bs-for-boys.p54\" class=\"\">When they reached the Sweetwater River on November 3, chunks of ice were floating in the freezing water. After all these people had been through, and in their weakened condition, that river seemed impossible to cross. It looked like stepping into death itself to move into the freezing stream. Men who once had been strong sat on the frozen ground and wept, as did the women and children. Many simply could not face that ordeal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/four-bs-for-boys.p55\" class=\"\">And now I quote from the record: \u201cThree eighteen-year-old boys belonging to the relief party came to the rescue, and to the astonishment of all who saw, carried nearly every member of the ill-fated handcart company across the snowbound stream. The strain was so terrible, and the exposure so great, that in later years all the boys died from the effects of it. When President Brigham Young heard of this heroic act, he wept like a child, and later declared publicly, \u2018that act alone will ensure C. Allen Huntington, George W. Grant, and David P. Kimball an everlasting salvation in the Celestial Kingdom of God, worlds without end.\u2019\u201d (Solomon F.
