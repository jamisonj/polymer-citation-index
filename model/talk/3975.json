It is interesting to note that Nephi did not only express his decision and determination to be obedient in carrying out his father\u2019s request, but he further explained the reason for acting in this manner when he said, \u201cFor I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1800\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1800)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1800)\">1 Ne. 3:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/the-sure-sound-of-the-trumpet.p14\" class=\"\">On another occasion Nephi received the following assignment from the Lord: \u201cThou shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1805\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1805)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1805)\">1 Ne. 17:8<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/the-sure-sound-of-the-trumpet.p15\" class=\"\">After receiving this commandment, Nephi\u2019s reaction was not the usual one that many people would expect, or that would be a logical response for some: \u201cLook, Lord, I have never before built a ship.

In these words, Nephi\u2019s firm determination and his decision to do what was asked of him are reflected in carrying out the mission which the Lord had assigned to him.
