So with your indulgence and President McKay's permission, I will bring\nbefore you a few items first affecting our missionary service, in the hope that their mention\nhere may be helpful to the carrying forward of our missionary procedure.\n<\/p><p>\nThese items are not necessarily related.\n<\/p><p>\nINTERRUPTIONS TO MISSIONARY WORK\n<\/p><p>\nWe would appreciate it, and we speak for the mission presidents, if you would discourage\nparents, other relatives and friends, visiting missionaries in the missions. We have had a large\nnumber of instances brought to our attention where serious interruption has come to the\nmissionary work by reason of these visits, some of which have been very protracted. If you\ncan use your influence and give the information to discourage these visits and ask the parents\nand their other friends to let these missionaries pursue the courses which have been arranged\nfor them, they will contribute very greatly to our work.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have had numbers of requests for leaves of absence for missionaries to come home to the\nfunerals of their kinspeople. We appreciate the fact that their hearts are touched on these sad\noccasions, but we have learned that very frequently the visit home only serves as an\ninterruption to the mission, that no considerable good is accomplished, and that the missionary\nhimself is often disappointed to think that he left the mission field, his companion, and his\nassigned work to go home for such funerals.\n<\/p><p>\nI am very grateful to note that it has been the disposition of most of our missionaries in the\nfield to desire to stay with their labors, and they themselves, have, in a number of instances,\ndiscouraged their kinspeople from requesting their return. If you can bring this matter, as\noccasion requires, to the attention of the families, it will serve a good purpose in the\ncontinuity of our missionary work.\n<\/p><p>\nCALLING OF SEVENTIES\n<\/p><p>\nNow we are confronted with some new questions in missionary work on responses to the call\nof the seventy to go into the mission field. May I first express for the First Presidency\nappreciation and gratitude for the generous response coming to this call. We have on file at\nthe present time responses from many stakes of the Church, indicating that they will fully\ncomply with the request, and that their quotas will be met. This is encouraging.\n<\/p><p>\nIMPORTANCE OF GOOD HEALTH\n<\/p><p>\nThere are, however, brethren, in the sending of these older men, some safeguards that should\nbe considered. First, the question of health. Our mission presidents have advised us that many\nof the older men have not been able to endure the rigorous work, the climate in some cases,\nand the exactions that are put upon our missionaries. These older missionaries are often asked\nto be companions to younger men. You heard this day something of the vigorous work that\nthey do, the long hours they spend, entailing a good deal of walking and very strenuous\nexercise.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is not possible in many instances to assign older men to the so-called easier jobs. If they are\nto make their greatest contribution they must fit into our missionary program, and in order to\ndo that they must have good health. We have a great sympathy for our mission presidents.\nThey have many problems, so many, indeed, that a great part of the time their attention must\nbe given to exceptional cases, so that we ask you brethren as you send these older men to us,\nto make careful inquiry into their health. Sometimes our doctors' examinations&mdash;we are\ngenerally grateful for their service&mdash;are not too searching and we find when they get to the\nmission field, particularly some of our older brethren, have some weaknesses that deter them,\nand sometimes preclude them, from carrying forward their missionary work.\n<\/p><p>\nI know that it is difficult to get the older men to come, but we must have them in good\nhealth. There may be a few exceptional cases where older couples with a car can do some\nspecial service in a mission, but generally speaking the seventies must enter into the work\nwith the same vigor and we hope with full physical equipment to carry forward the mission\nprogram as the younger men.\n<\/p><p>\nWELFARE OF FAMILIES\n<\/p><p>\nWe have discovered, too, in recent months in the coming of these older men, that very\nconsiderable apprehension is feared for the welfare of some of their families. It is reported in\ncases that come to us that families are left without adequate support, and we have a few cases\nwhere couples have been recommended with the understanding that they would leave minor\nchildren with relatives or friends and without parental guidance.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay has long taken the position that that is not wisdom to call parents away\nfrom their children, even for this great missionary service, so before both of the parents are\nsent, they must always be free from the parental responsibility that goes to minors in the\nhome. Where the man is sent, care must be exercised to see that his family may have proper\ncare in his absence. That will entail a discernment on the part of the bishop, and he should\nexercise caution and wisdom before recommending a man whose children and family may\nsuffer too greatly in his absence.\n<\/p><p>\nWe do not want to take the sacrifice out of missionary work. We know the history of it in the\npast, and we know that it does entail, sometimes great deprivations and sacrifices, but we\nwant to use wisdom in taking men away from their families.\n<\/p><p>\nMISSIONARY EXPENSES\n<\/p><p>\nAnother item&mdash;it is a part of our traditional missionary custom for the family to pay\nmissionary expense. Exceptions are made. There are friends sometimes who like to contribute.\nSometimes the ward, sometimes the quorum, will contribute. But it is deemed preferable to\nhave men sent, who, either by themselves, or through their families, can make some\nsubstantial contribution to their missionary labors.\n<\/p><p>\nWe do not look with favor, because we feel that it lacks in certain material elements in our\nmissionary work, upon having support come wholly either from the quorum or from the ward,\nor from outside sources. It is true that there are many generous people who send funds into\nthe Church itself, to be helpful to missionaries who need help, and I assure you that it is a\ngreat satisfaction to have at our disposal some limited funds which can help out a missionary\nwho hasn't quite been able to finish, whose parents have perhaps reached the end of their\nfinancial resources. But in the main it is preferable to send missionaries who can contribute\nsubstantially to their own support.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE LANGUAGE OF PRAYER\n<\/p><p>\nWe have discovered in the mission field in particular, and in other places, also a lack of\nproper teaching with reference to prayer. I know that I myself have been shocked out in the\nmission field as I have heard missionaries called on for prayer who seem to have had no\nexperience or training whatever in the use of the language of prayer.\n<\/p><p>\nI do not know that it is a matter of vital importance, but I think, my brethren, that in the\nquorums and in the classes, you would do well, as in the homes also, to teach the language of\nprayer&mdash;\"Thee and Thou,\" rather than \"you.\" It always seems disappointing to me to have our\nFather in Heaven, our Lord, addressed as \"you.\" It is surprising how much we see of this in\nthe mission field among the young men who come to serve there. I think you might make\nnote of it, and avail yourselves of any opportunities that may come in order to teach the\nsacred and reverential language of prayer.\n<\/p><p>\nSUPPORT FOR DESERET NEWS\n<\/p><p>\nThat is all that I had for you, my brethren, with reference to the missionary items. I would\nlike to take a few moments to mention a few other items of general import, and also with\nreference to our Priesthood work. I am not going to preach about it, but I know that Brother\nPetersen will not object if I say to you that I think that the loyalty of this Priesthood can well\nbe shown in supporting the official organ of this Church, the Deseret News. I don't think that\nwe ought to have to appeal for your support in that respect.\n<\/p><p>\nWe need an organ for the Church, of course we do, and a good one. We have one. Why\nshould Latter-day Saints forsake that paper and give help to competition? I believe we can\nseriously think over that matter. Personally, I love the paper. My grandfather was its first\neditor. I am proud of it, and proud of its history. I appeal for your support for it.\n<\/p><p>\nAPPEAL TO ELDERS\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren, I have taken occasion on times before, and there isn't time now, to elaborate\nmuch, to make as earnest an appeal as I know how to make to the elders of this Church who\nhave been neglectful and careless, and who have set themselves in process of losing that\nPriesthood of which President Clark has so impressively spoken.\n<\/p><p>\nI do not suppose that I can appeal to too many of them here tonight. They are probably not\nhere. They are in your quorums. Their presidencies are here, at least in large measure.\nBrethren, will you obey the injunction given by President Clark to go out for these lost sheep\nand bring them in, and succor them, encourage them, and if necessary, rebuke them in order\nto bring them to a realization of what they are losing.\n<\/p><p>\nSome years ago I took the liberty of sounding a little slogan to our brethren, as I went around\nthe Church, in the care of these people. It was a very simple thing. I do not know whether\nyou will agree with it or not. \"If they don't come to us, we will go to them.\" I put that\nforward once, and a young elders' quorum president said, \"I don't believe it.\" He said, \"We\nprovide the quorum facilities for them. If they don't come it is their own fault.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOf course it was not long before he changed his mind when we reminded him that that was\nnot the missionary spirit. I think we can't go to any who need our help more than to these\nbrethren who have been careless and neglectful about their Priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nI sincerely hope that in the administration of the quorums you are emphasizing the fraternal\naspects of these great institutions. I have long been persuaded that these quorums ought to be\nour clubs. They ought to be the places where we find our dearest associations and we need\nnot look far beyond them for that fraternity which we all crave. The fraternity of the\nPriesthood in our own quorums!\n<\/p><p>\nNEED FOR EFFECTIVE VISITING\n<\/p><p>\nIn your visits to these people, I am sure that you need to exercise great discretion and\njudgment. I wish all of the Melchizedek Priesthood&mdash;perhaps many of them did last\nnight&mdash;might have seen the demonstration in the bishops' meeting which was held on this stand last\nevening. There were some very excellent constructive suggestions which were given.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe, my brethren, that you will make far more progress in frankness than in attempting\nto beat about the bush with these men. I believe if you have the proper spirit you can go to\nthem and talk about their condition, and their needs without spending time in visits talking\nabout the weather and politics and current affairs.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the most successful missionaries that I ever knew, when I asked him what the\nelements of his success were, said, among other things, that he always told people on whom\nhe called that he never had time to talk anything else but the Gospel, and be begged them to\nexcuse him from any other discussion.\n<\/p><p>\nI am persuaded that if we went to our members and talked to them about their faith, and the\nthings they were losing, and the things the quorum and the Church hold out for them, that we\nwould make more progress in their reformation. It requires some courage, it requires some\ntact, and most of all it requires love. They say love is, in the end, the only irresistible force in\nthe world, and if we have love sufficient, and friendship, and these brethren know our love\nfor them, I think we can approach them and speak frankly to them, and thus help them. I\nsincerely trust that we may.\n<\/p><p>\nNearly all of these men are good at heart, but careless. There are a few that are mean.\nPerhaps they deserve rebuke, and rebuke might be the best means of bringing them to an\nunderstanding of their position, but remember how that rebuke has to be made, \"reproving\nbetimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12941\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12941)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12941)\">D&amp;C 121:43<\/a><\/span>). That is the only rebuke that is\npermissible under the constitution of the Priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nPRIESTHOOD DIVINE\n<\/p><p>\nNow, my brethren. I love this Holy Priesthood. I know that it is genuine. Every interpretive\nsense that the Lord has given me testifies to me that it is divine. I have felt its influence as I\nhave administered in the ordinances of the Gospel. I have felt its stimulation. I have felt an\nessence pass from me in administering to the Saints that I know was of divine origin. I have\nseen its results. I know that it is divine. I know that it is authentic. Its source is not far\nremoved from us&mdash;into the area of dim antiquity. We do not have to debate about its origin.\nWhy, it is proximate to us.\n<\/p><p>\nA man today said that I ordained him a High Priest some time ago, and asked if I had a card\nto give him the derivation of my Priesthood. I said, \"No, I don't have a card for you, but I\nthink you can remember it&mdash;four steps. I was ordained by President Joseph F. Smith. He was\nordained by President Brigham Young. Brigham Young was ordained by the three witnesses,\none of whom was Oliver Cowdery, who with Joseph was ordained by angelic ministers.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThat is how close it is to us. There is no debate about it. There is no question about the\nauthenticity of this great power. We are fortunate indeed not to have to search the records of\nancient days in order to establish this divine authority, upon which the Church and Kingdom\nof God is founded.\n<\/p><p>\nGRATITUDE FOR ASSOCIATIONS\n<\/p><p>\nI express my gratitude for it, and I express my gratitude for my association with my brethren\nof the Priesthood. I have had a most impressive experience in the last six months. I had\nthought I had always been close to my brethren, but I found that I had never been into the\nfull confidence of this wonderful relation until I came to be associated with my beloved\nPresident, and President Clark&mdash;without any reservations, without a necessity of concealing\nprivate feelings, but with a freedom of thought and expression welcomed by all, that to my\nthinking, is the badge of true friendship, brotherhood and understanding.\n<\/p><p>\nI thank the Lord that somehow, in his providence, I have been brought to that great blessing,\nand I ask the Lord to help me that I may be in a measure worthy of it. And I ask the Lord to\nbless every one of you, my brethren, that each may magnify the sacred calling that the Lord\nhas vouchsafed to him.\n<\/p><p>\nI do so humbly in the name of Jesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
