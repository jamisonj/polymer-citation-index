(See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"19867\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19867)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19867)\">D&amp;C 84:33\u201342<\/a><\/span>.)

Unfortunately, we know also that too many young men of the priesthood pay little attention to the serious nature of their sacred promises made with Heavenly Father. Let me explain why you young men and women must keep your covenants you have made with God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/keeping-covenants.p11\" class=\"\">In the premortal world before we left the presence of Heavenly Father, He warned and cautioned us about new experiences we would have in mortality. We knew that we would have a physical body of flesh and bone. Never having been mortal before, we had no experience dealing with the temptations of mortality. But Heavenly Father knew and understood. He charged us to control our mortal bodies and to make them subject to our spirits. Our spirits would have to master the physical temptations that our bodies would encounter in a temporal world. Spiritual power over the influence of Satan comes to us by keeping the commandments of our Lord, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/keeping-covenants.p12\" class=\"\">Being here on earth for the first time in our eternal existence, we are away from the protective presence of our Father in Heaven and are subject to the influence of Satan and his followers. Remember that Satan even tried to tempt the Savior into betraying the promises He had made to God. After Jesus was baptized, He went into the wilderness to fast and pray for forty days. Satan chose that moment during Christ\u2019s hunger and physical weakness to tempt Him. But Jesus did not succumb; He stood firm. [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"37494\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37494)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37494)\">Matt. 4:1\u201311<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/keeping-covenants.p13\" class=\"\">Satan will seek to tempt us at times and in ways that exploit our greatest weaknesses or destroy our strengths. But his promises of pleasure are short-lived deceptions. His evil design is to tempt us into sinning, knowing that when we sin we separate ourselves from our Heavenly Father and the Savior, Jesus Christ. We begin to move away from Heavenly Father\u2019s promised blessings toward the misery and anguish in which Satan and his followers languish. By sinning we put ourselves in Satan\u2019s power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/keeping-covenants.p14\" class=\"\">Now, my dear young friends, I understand the struggles you face every day in keeping the commandments of the Lord. The battle for your souls is increasingly fierce. The adversary is strong and cunning. However, you have within your physical body the powerful spirit of a son or daughter of God. Because He loves you and wants you to come home to Him, our Father in Heaven has given you a conscience that tells your spirit when you are keeping the Lord\u2019s commandments and when you are not. If you will pay more attention to your spiritual self, which is eternal, than to your mortal self, which is temporary, you can always resist the temptations of Satan and conquer his efforts to take you into his power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/keeping-covenants.p15\" class=\"\">You must be honest with yourself and remain true to the covenants you have made with God.

Some young men and women in the Church talk openly about sexual transgression. They seem to forget that the Lord forbids all sexual relations before marriage, including petting, sex perversion of any kind, or preoccupation with sex in thought, speech, or action. Some youth foolishly rationalize that it is \u201cno big deal\u201d to sin now because they can always repent later when they want to go to the temple or on a mission. Anyone who does that is breaking promises made to God both in the premortal life and in the waters of baptism. The idea of sinning a little is self-deception. Sin is sin! Sin weakens you spiritually, and it always places the sinner at eternal risk. Choosing to sin, even with the intent to repent, is simply turning away from God and violating covenants.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/keeping-covenants.p16\" class=\"\">Gratefully, many of you young men honor your priesthood and many young women \u201cstand for truth and righteousness\u201d as stated in the Young Women\u2019s motto.
