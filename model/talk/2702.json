For example, we speak of our knowledge that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that this is the true Church. There are times, however, when we do not always show the same faith in more specific parts of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p6\" class=\"\">I have heard some say that they believe in everything but the welfare plan or everything except tithing. Some people used to say they could follow the Prophet Joseph Smith or David O. McKay, but not Brigham Young or Heber J. Grant. Now such selectivity is simply not consistent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p7\" class=\"\">I would like to ask tonight, \u201cWhat kind of a testimony do you have concerning the power of the priesthood?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p8\" class=\"\">How many brethren here are home teachers? Would you please raise your hands. Those of you who are listening in may also raise your hands. Now since we have just closed out the month of September, how many of you home teachers \u201cgot your home teaching done?\u201d Well, brethren, that\u2019s a catch phrase. You know, the devil taught us to say those words: \u201cDid you get your home teaching done?\u201d That is a very poor way to refer to the comprehensive mission embodied in home teaching. By getting us to ask \u201cDid you get your home teaching done?\u201d the devil destroys 90 percent of our effectiveness. All that question implies is a quick visit the last day of the month so that we can send in the report.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p9\" class=\"\">Now there are other examples that we don\u2019t always fully appreciate the nature of the priesthood. When the bishopric wants some event to be especially well organized, to whom do they assign the responsibility? That\u2019s right\u2014it\u2019s the Relief Society. Now why not the priesthood? It\u2019s because we have a habit of saying, \u201cThe priesthood won\u2019t do it.\u201d Why don\u2019t some stake presidents use their home teachers to bring the people to stake conference? It\u2019s because there\u2019s a saying abroad in the land that \u201cthe home teachers won\u2019t do it.\u201d Other sayings are \u201cFathers won\u2019t do it,\u201d or \u201cPeople in our ward won\u2019t accept assignments.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p10\" class=\"\">Seriously, these expressions indicate either a lack of faith in or lack of understanding of the power of God. When one fine stake president, without thinking, let those words slip out, \u201cThe home teachers won\u2019t do it,\u201d I answered him, \u201cPresident, do you know what you have just said? I think you just said that although the Lord established a procedure by which we should lead his church, his system won\u2019t work. So you have devised a better one.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p11\" class=\"\">I went to a conference in President Rex Reeve\u2019s stake. He took me through the building and showed me 2,000 chairs prepared for the people. I asked him how he knew there would be 2,000 people present, and he answered, \u201cWe sent the home teachers out to invite everyone to come, and they have given us their report. They have informed us that 2,000 people will be here tomorrow.\u201d Evidently the word got out that I would be one of the speakers because seventy-five of those 2,000 didn\u2019t show up. But they had an attendance of 49 percent and it has since grown much higher.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p12\" class=\"\">For several years I had the privilege of sitting at the feet of President Marion G. Romney, who taught us about the \u201cconstitution of the Church\u201d\u2014meaning that revelation given on the occasion of the organization of the Church wherein the Lord outlined the procedures by which it should be governed. The elders, it says in section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants, assisted by the lesser priesthood, are to \u201cwatch over the Church.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16437\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16437)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16437)\">D&amp;C 20:42, 53<\/a><\/span>.) A part of that \u201cwatching over\u201d is done by visiting the houses of the members and in instructing them to do their duty. In another revelation the elders quorum is specifically mentioned as a body of \u201cstanding ministers.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16572\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16572)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16572)\">D&amp;C 124:137<\/a><\/span>.) Those who hold the Aaronic Priesthood are also called \u201cstanding ministers.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16519\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16519)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16519)\">D&amp;C 84:111<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p13\" class=\"\">Five years ago if you had asked, \u201cWho\u2019s the \u2018minister\u2019 of your Church?\u201d most of us would have answered, \u201cOh, the bishop.\u201d Today we can\u2019t give that simple answer because we know that many of the duties have now been shifted over to the elders, where the revelations say they rightfully belong. Now a ward should have at least fifty \u201cministers\u201d in place of the one we thought of a few years ago.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p14\" class=\"\">Now think of the increased power to carry the gospel forward when fifty men do their duty as the bishop has done it in the past.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cOh, but the home teachers won\u2019t do it.\u201d Well, do you have faith in the Lord\u2019s system or don\u2019t you, and why not try it?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p16\" class=\"\">To further mention limited understanding concerning the priesthood, I refer you to an incident common in the fast and testimony meeting. Someone frequently gives the experience that a relative or friend was very ill and the elders were called in to administer to him. The person was healed. And so we say we have a testimony of the power of the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p17\" class=\"\">Now please understand, I do not belittle the virtue of this sacred and wonderful ordinance. It frequently means the difference between life and death for ourselves and our loved ones, and I have witnessed its marvelous influence. But why limit your testimony to that? Why not as readily send the elders to administer help to a father whose son is about to die spiritually on drugs or alcohol? Why not call on the priesthood to bless a home that is about to die through divorce or transgression? Why not administer through the priesthood to those who love the world more than God? Why do we blithely say, \u201cWe did our home teaching\u201d when half of the families in the Church are in a condition to be \u201cwasted\u201d when the Savior comes because they have not been \u201csealed up\u201d to eternal life? There is a ministry here for the elders far more extensive than that of laying hands on the sick. A person healed of bodily sickness will eventually become sick again and die. When you administer the gospel, the cure can be permanent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p18\" class=\"\">Now this is an appropriate time to think in terms of an expanded power in the priesthood because everyone here knows the watchwords for our day are \u201clengthen your stride,\u201d \u201cquicken your pace,\u201d and \u201cextend your vision.\u201d When I first became a mission president and during a visit by President Kimball, I expressed my concern that I would not be able to keep up the vigorous pace of the former president. His answer went something like this: \u201cNow here, here, we won\u2019t listen to any more of that kind of talk. You can\u2019t be satisfied with what happened in the past. Everything in the Church has to go forward. Didn\u2019t you know that? Now remember, under your leadership things must improve.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p19\" class=\"\">Now you can see why I have a testimony of the power of the priesthood. I was told to go out and get one. And I really do have one.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cWhich priesthood,\u201d saith the Lord, \u201ccontinueth in the church of God in all generations.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16507\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16507)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16507)\">D&amp;C 84:17<\/a><\/span>.)

But because of the \u201cgreat power\u201d which has been given to them, and through their great faith, the Holy Ghost draws near to them. Its influence is felt, and people respond, repent, and obey. When these elders administer baptism to such a person, the teaching and the ordinance combine to be a powerful administration of the priesthood. Children of God are reborn into eternal life. And when this army of missionaries is increased from 10,000 to 20,000, the power of the priesthood is vastly increased.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p22\" class=\"\">In the quorums the same thing ought to be true. If we expand from one \u201cminister\u201d to fifty, we should multiply the power of the priesthood by fifty. And the miracles they can perform should multiply vastly beyond those performed on the physically sick. When you have the great joy of hearing someone say, \u201cThere\u2019s the man who brought me the gospel,\u201d or \u201cThere is the man who changed my whole life,\u201d you can bear your testimony to a great miracle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p23\" class=\"\">Now the priesthood president of deacons, teachers, and priests is the bishop and their quorum presidents. The priesthood president of fathers in the Church is the elders quorum president or, of course, in some cases the high priests and seventies presidents. All fathers must, says the scripture, \u201ccome unto this priesthood.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16512\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16512)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16512)\">D&amp;C 84:42<\/a><\/span>.)

If you don\u2019t believe in that system and if you don\u2019t use it, you don\u2019t have a true testimony of the power of the priesthood, and you cannot succeed. If you use this system and are faithful, your success is guaranteed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p25\" class=\"\">I know people respond when you obtain the power of God which pertains to the priesthood.

He said, \u201cHis name is Hershel Pedersen. Perhaps you have heard of him. They used to call him \u2018Bones\u2019 when he played for BYU.\u201d Well, I, along with many of you had heard of Brother Pedersen. As a matter of fact he grew up in my stake. He is one of the seven sons of Oliver Cowdery Pedersen, who all went on missions, most of them to Denmark. I heard his report when he returned from his mission, and I signed his temple recommend when he was married. So I was interested.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p27\" class=\"\">The stake president continued: \u201cBrother Pedersen has committed himself to qualify every man in his quorum for a temple recommend. They are all qualified now except six.\u201d Some time later when I was with the Church Home Teaching Committee, we remembered this story and asked Brother Pedersen to report on how his quorum had turned out. He said, \u201cWe got them all but three. Then they released me to become president of the stake mission. But since my release we got the other three.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/the-power-of-the-priesthood.p28\" class=\"\">Think of the potential if all who bear the priesthood were deeply involved in the work of the Lord.

Not a testimony like Laman and Lemuel. And I know some say, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand how tough it is in our quorum.\u201d Well, Nephi didn\u2019t either; but Nephi had a testimony.
