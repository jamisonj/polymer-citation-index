Truly it\nseems that human beings are more prone to war than to peace.\n<\/p><p>\nThe latest (I wish we could say confidently the last) was one of the most devastating in the\nhistory of the world. What destruction, sorrow, and suffering it has caused. According to\nreliable estimates, its direct cost is over one trillion thirty billion dollars, not counting the\ndestruction and damage of property. There have been over a million casualties in the United\nStates. Another million and a half in Britain, making a combined loss in these two countries\nalone of killed, wounded, missing, and prisoners, of two and a half million. Flying bombs\ncost British civilians a hundred and forty-seven thousand seven hundred and sixty casualties.\nOf these, fifteen thousand three hundred fifty-nine were children under sixteen. (A half\nthousand bodies never have been identified.) The Russian and Chinese losses exceed those\nnumbers by millions. Add the millions of dead, wounded, and missing by the Germans, the\nJapanese, and those of the crushed countries of Europe, and the cost in wealth and in human\nlife becomes staggering. We are close enough to the tragedy to realize that war is \"the greatest\ncurse that can be entailed upon mankind.\" \"Under its standards gather violence, malignity,\nrage, fraud, perfidy, rapacity, and lust.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe wonder how many more years will pass before \"they shall sit every man under his vine\nand under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid,\" when, in Alfred Lord Tennyson's\nwords:\n<\/p><p>\nThe war-drums shall throb no longer, and the battle-flags be furled,<br \/>\nIn the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nFUTURE SAFETY OF THE WORLD DEPENDS UPON CHANGE OF HUMAN HEARTS\n<\/p><p>\nRestrictions incident to the great conflict have largely been abrogated, and once again we\nmeet in a general conference of the Church without fear of molestation from a murderous\nenemy. We join the Allied Nations in giving thanks that gangsters who, through evil\nmanipulations and clever strategies, seized control of nations, have been defeated; that their\nattempt to set up dictatorial government has been frustrated; that freedom has been preserved,\nand liberty kept within the grasp of those who cherish the right of self-government.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the outcome of this great conflict God's overruling power has been manifest. Let the\nnations not forget him in the hour of victory.\n<\/p><p>\nBecause of terrible forces, newly discovered, scientists and military experts are now saying\nthat all present means of defense are inadequate, are in fact already antiquated, and must be\nchanged if the world is to be protected from future devastation.\n<\/p><p>\nI would that these men of reputed wisdom and foresight would lay equal emphasis on the fact\nthat the future safety of the world depends not so much upon the changing of defenses as\nupon the changing of men's way of thinking, and acting. Men and nations must have a change\nof heart. Hate and envy, suspicion and greed must be supplanted by sympathy, forbearance,\ntolerance, and justice before the hoped-for time comes that \"nation shall not lift up sword\nagainst nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow that another terrible war is over, the paramount question is&mdash;are human minds equal to\nthe problems they must face; are hearts sufficiently filled with virtues needed in the present\ncrisis? I echo the cry of one who pleads&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nO human hearts, beating through fear, through jealousy, through pride, through avarice,\nthrough bitterness, through agony, through death; beating shame and forgiveness,\nbewilderment and love.\n<\/p><p>\nO my own country, my new world, prepare, prepare&mdash;not to avenge wrong, but to exalt right.\nNot to display honor, but to prove humility. Not to bring wrath, but vision; not to win war,\nbut a people. And not people only, but all peoples. Not to exact justice from your enemies\nonly, and not from your friends only, but from yourselves!\n<\/p><p>\nTruly,\n<\/p><p>\nThe world is in the Valley of Decision.<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;        And out of it there is but one sure road: <br \/>\nEyes unsealed can still foresee the mighty vision<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;        Of a world in travail turning unto God.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, World War II is ended, but old battles are yet to be fought; new victories yet to be won\nbefore the peace for which we pray can be realized.\n<\/p><p>\nOne is man's suspicion and lack of trust in his fellow man. Man's suspicion and lack of trust\nis one of the greatest enemies of peace. Nations are distrustful of one another. Russia is afraid\nthat Britain will scheme to win Germany as an ally. Great Britain and the United States look\nwith suspicion upon Russia and fear her possible alliance with China or Japan. Argentina\nimpugns the motives of the United States, and the United States is suspicious of Argentina.\nThus the seeds of envy and enmity are sown.\n<\/p><p>\nThis lack of confidence in one's fellow man is even more of an individual than a national\nvice. We are prone to magnify weaknesses and to imagine vices in others that do not exist.\nWe chew the cud of slander with satisfaction&mdash;slander, \"whose whisper over the world's\ndiameter, as level as the cannon to its blank, transports his poisoned shot.\" Talk about battles\nyet to be fought! Backbiting and evil speaking head the list!\n<\/p><p>\nIf any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, . . . this man's\nreligion is vain (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26057\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26057)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26057)\">James 1:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHE GOSPEL TAUGHT BY THE SAVIOR A SURE GUIDE\n<\/p><p>\nThe battle against godlessness must still be fought. Nietzsche even before the first World War\ndenounced Christianity as a cunningly devised system that has \"debauched and undermined\nand sapped the vigor of the modern European world, and is the most powerful instrument of\nracial degeneration ever devised by common herd.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNietzsche is dead, but the poisonous seeds that he and others like him have sown in blindness\nand bitterness still produce fruit of skepticism and unbelief. In charity we can say that the\nChristianity Nietzsche condemns is not the gospel of Jesus Christ as taught by the Redeemer\nof man. But egotists and misled people who cannot discriminate between truth and error still\nfind themselves wavering with respect to the divine mission of Jesus Christ. Every true\nChristian, and especially every faithful member of the Church of Christ should be militant in\ndefending the principles of the gospel as given by our Lord and Savior, for, in the words of\nMark Hopkins, true Christianity \"promotes industry, honesty, truth, purity, kindness. It\nhumbles the proud, exalts the lowly, upholds law, favors liberty, is essential to it, and would\nunite men in one great brotherhood. It is the breath of life to social and civil well-being here,\nand spreads the azure of that heaven into whose unfathomed depth the eye of faith loves to\nlook.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThere has been but one perfect character in this world&mdash;the peerless personality of Jesus of\nNazareth, the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world. No man can do better than to accept\nChrist as the great Exemplar and the safest Guide.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is not an easy thing in this old world to make God the center of our being. To do so we\nmust determine to keep his commandments. Spiritual attainment, not physical possessions, not\nthe indulgence and the gratification of the body, must become the chief goal.\n<\/p><p>\nOnly in the complete surrender of our inner life may we rise above the selfish, sordid pull of\nnature. We should seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. What the spirit is to\nthe body, God is to the spirit. As the body dies when the spirit leaves it, so the spirit dies\nwhen we exclude God from it. I cannot imagine peace in a world from which God and\nreligion are banished.\n<\/p><p>\nSELFISHNESS THE CAUSE OF THE WORLD'S ILLS\n<\/p><p>\nAnother old battle still raging, and one we must win before permanent peace is established on\nearth is the battle against selfishness. Selfishness is the root from which spring most human\nills and suffering. Selfishness promises satisfaction, but its fruit is disappointing, and produces\nonly ill will and unhappiness. Selfishness and enmity caused the first recorded murder and the\nfirst implied rejection of the great truth that man is his brother's keeper.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was selfishness that caused the violation of the Munich Pact, which led, in September,\n1939, to the murderous invasion of Poland, and the subsequent destruction of European\nnations with all its attendant horrors and human suffering. It was selfishness and inordinate\nambition that caused the Pearl Harbor tragedy.\n<\/p><p>\nUnless the battle against selfishness is won at the peace table, our hopes for a permanent\npeace may be shattered, and the world again stricken in warfare.\n<\/p><p>\nNature's law demands us to do everything with self in view. Self-preservation is the first law\nof mortal life. But Jesus says:\n<\/p><p>\nHe that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33976\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33976)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33976)\">Matt. 10:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJesus on the Mount of Temptation triumphed over all appeals to selfishness, and thereby set\nan example to all men who would strive for spiritual attainment. As Jesus resisted the tempter,\nso selfishness must be overcome by subjugation and resistance. There is no development of\ncharacter without resistance; there is no growth of spirituality without overcoming.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over\nthe nations (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42170\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42170)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42170)\">Rev. 2:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nINTEMPERANCE AN ENEMY TO PEACE\n<\/p><p>\nA fourth battle still raging, and in which the opposition seems to be gaining ground, is the\nbattle against intemperance. The attitude of the Church of Jesus Christ towards temperance is\nunmistakable. February 27, 1833, the Prophet Joseph Smith received what is known as the\nWord of Wisdom for the benefit of the council of the high priests assembled in Kirtland, and\nthe Church, and also the Saints in Zion, given by revelation which sets forth the order and\nwill of God in the temporal salvation of all Saints in the last days\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12161\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12161)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12161)\">D&amp;C 89:1-2<\/a><\/span>). Wine and \"strong drinks\"\nare condemned as beverages, and the use of them discountenanced in all cases except in the\nuse of wine for sacramental purposes, and even this should be \"pure wine of the grape of the\nvine, of your own make\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12163\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12163)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12163)\">D&amp;C 89:5-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTobacco is condemned also as being \"not good for man\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12164\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12164)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12164)\">D&amp;C 89:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAt the time the Church took this decided stand against whisky and tobacco, no state in the\nUnion had passed any law against the liquor traffic. It is true that temperance societies had\nbeen organized, and the cause of temperance was gaining impetus, but it was not until\n1851&mdash;eighteen years after the revelation on the Word of Wisdom&mdash;that the first permanent\nprohibition law was passed in Maine. Later religious denominations began to organize\ntemperance societies. It appears, therefore, that the Mormon Church was among the very first\norganizations, if not the first organization or church in the United States to legislate as an\norganized body against the use of alcoholic drinks and tobacco.\n<\/p><p>\nIn 1908, President Joseph F. Smith in his opening address at the seventy-eighth annual\nconference said:\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a general movement throughout the land looking toward local option of temperance\namong the people of our state and adjoining states. I sincerely hope that every Latter-day\nSaint will cooperate with this movement in order that we may curtail the monstrous evils that\nexist especially in our cities. I wish to say that I am in sympathy with this movement, and I\nknow my brethren are united with me, and in harmony with the efforts that are being made to\nestablish temperance throughout the land.\n<\/p><p>\nMany of you will remember how President Grant pleaded with the people of Utah to retain\nthe Eighteenth Amendment. To the day of his death he regretted that Utah was in the column\nof states that repealed the prohibition law.\n<\/p><p>\nStatistics today seem to indicate that our fight for temperance is making little progress. For\nexample, there was spent in Utah during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1945, for\n<\/p><p>\nCigarettes. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 4,978,196\n<\/p><p>\nBeer. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  11,197,806\n<\/p><p>\nLiquor. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  10,862,677\n<\/p><p>\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $27,038,679\n<\/p><p>\nIntemperance goes hand in hand with lawlessness, and lawlessness is an enemy of peace.\n<\/p><p>\nTRUE RELIGION ALONE BRINGS PEACE\n<\/p><p>\nI know of no force so potent in eradicating these and all other enemies of peace from the\nhuman heart as the gospel of Jesus Christ. True religion is today the world's greatest\nneed&mdash;in a sense by the individual of a relationship with God&mdash;that indefinable something which\nenters into the soul of man and which unites him with his Creator.\n<\/p><p>\nThe wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell\nwhence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27179\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27179)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27179)\">John 3:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA celebrated British statesman, Edmund Burke, in the latter half of the eighteenth century\nwrote: \"True religion is the foundation of society. When that is once shaken by contempt the\nwhole fabric cannot be stable nor lasting.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"I have now disposed of all property to my children,\" said Patrick Henry; \"there is one thing\nmore I wish I could give them, and that is the Christian religion. If they had that, and I had\nnot given them one cent, they would be rich. If they have not that, and I had given them all\nthe world, they would be poor.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOnly through the application of righteous principles by individuals and by governments, can\nnations learn war no more, and establish a permanent peace.\n<\/p><p>\nO Brother Man! fold to thy heart thy brother;<br \/>\n        Where pity dwells, the peace of God is there;<br \/>\nTo worship rightly is to love each other,<br \/>\n        Each smile a hymn, each kindly deed a prayer.\n<\/p><p>\nFollow with reverent steps the great example<br \/>\n        Of him whose holy work was \"doing good\";<br \/>\nSo shall the wide earth seem our Father's temple,<br \/>\n        Each loving life a psalm of gratitude.\n<\/p><p>\nThen shall all shackles fall; the stormy clangor<br \/>\n        Of wild war music o'er the earth shall cease;<br \/>\nLove shall tread out the baleful fire of anger,<br \/>\n        And in its ashes plant the tree of peace.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter the passing of centuries God has given mankind another opportunity to end war. The\nmost momentous decision of all time must now be made by the peoples of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nGod grant that they will never again revert to the law of the jungle but will \"beat their swords\ninto plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks, neither shall they learn war any more\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37873\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37873)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37873)\">Micah 4:3<\/a><\/span>), I\nearnestly pray with you in the name of the Prince of Peace, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
