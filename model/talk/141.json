Saying, If thou hadst\nknown, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now\nthey are hid from thine eyes (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31132\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31132)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31132)\">Luke 19:41-42<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAccording to tradition, when these words were spoken, Jesus stood on the Mount of Olives,\nopposite a point in the walls surrounding Jerusalem a few yards south of the Gate Beautiful.\nFrom this spot one may behold a beautiful view of that historic city.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is wonderfully picturesque, with its quaint, flat-roofed houses, church towers, and mosque\ndomes covering the four hills on which Jerusalem is built. The view is impressive even now;\nit must have been inspiring when Jesus beheld it in all its Herodian splendor.\n<\/p><p>\nBut it was the inhabitants of the city, not the beautiful buildings or the commanding view that\nthe Savior saw through tear bedimmed eyes when he cried: \"If thou hadst known . . . the\nthings which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31133\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31133)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31133)\">Luke 19:42<\/a><\/span>). He\nsaw the people divided into conflicting and contending sects, each professing more holiness\nand righteousness than the other and all closing their eyes to the truth. There were the\nconservative Hebraic Jews, holding rigidly to the Mosaic law; there were the more liberal\nminded, Hellenistic Jews whose views had been modified by pagan philosophy: there were a\nfew Essenes with their asceticism and rejection of the Aaronic Priesthood; there were the\nSadducees with their lifeless and formal observance of the Sabbath, and their denial of the\nresurrection; and, finally, the Pharisees with their \"ostentatious almsgiving,\" \"broadened\nphylacteries,\" \"greedy avarice,\" \"haughty assertion of pre-eminence,\" \"ill-concealed hypocrisy\"\nwhich was often hidden under a venerable assumption of superior holiness.\n<\/p><p>\nNo wonder the Savior, seeing such division among the people, prayed to the Father so\nearnestly in behalf of his own little flock to keep them \"one as we are one\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27166\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27166)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27166)\">John 17:11,22<\/a><\/span>). No wonder the\nSavior, discerning perfectly the deceit and hypocrisy underneath the glassed-over outside of\nreligion, uttered such scathing denunciation when he said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven\nagainst men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33928\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33928)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33928)\">Matt. 23:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSuch were the people whom the Son of Man saw when he stood twenty centuries ago on the\nMount of Olives and \"beheld the city and wept over it\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31131\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31131)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31131)\">Luke 19:41<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHISTORY BEING REPEATED\n<\/p><p>\nSo we may picture him today weeping over a world weltering in an orgy of blood because a\nfew gangsters fired by selfishness, revenge and desire for conquest have gone mad. Impelled\nby greedy avarice, and arrogating to themselves racial superiority, they strode forth to subdue,\nto conquer, and to kill. There was nothing left for law-abiding, peace-loving people to do but\nto try to prevent their depredations and murder. The result is the thunder-roar of a million\ncannons, the devastation of cities and farms, the wailing and suffering of women and children,\nthe groans of the wounded and of the dying, and the death of the chosen youth of our land.\n<\/p><p>\nApproximately only a quarter of a century ago, the world listened to the clanging of arms of\nnations fighting in a worldwide war that was supposed to end war forever. Up to that time it\nwas the bloodiest war in history.\n<\/p><p>\nAgain, misguided leaders of nations, worshiping the god of materialism, have brought on\nWorld War II, and unless the nations avoid the evil things which caused this war, there will\nbe a World War III even more destructive, more terrible than the present murderous conflict.\nLike causes produce like effects.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, while the trying exigencies of war are wringing our hearts, it would seem the part of\nwisdom for men to examine some of the basic causes that produce armed conflict with the\nview of avoiding them in the future.\n<\/p><p>\nDEVELOPMENT OF BRUTAL INSTINCTS\n<\/p><p>\nThe seeds of war lie in man's nature. These seeds germinate at the first natural urge for\nself-preservation, self-perpetuation or a desire for conquest.\n<\/p><p>\nThe fruit of such seeds is hatred and brutality.\n<\/p><p>\nKnowing this, the world's chief gangster trained his youth to be brutal. In anticipation,\nindeed, in glorification of armed conflict, this man declared that he would train youth to be\nbrutal. \"In my great educative work,\" said he, \"I am beginning with the young. . . . Weakness\nhas to be knocked out of them. . . . A violently active, dominating, intrepid, brutal youth&mdash;that\nis what I am after. There must be no weakness or tenderness in it. I want to see once more in\nits eyes the gleam of pride and independence of the beast of prey.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt is significant that one hundred years before this egotistic leader began to poison the minds\nof youth, a German philosopher&mdash;Heinrich Heine&mdash;warned the German people that:\n<\/p><p>\nEvils will follow the rise of \"Germanic pantheism,\" because then there will awake in him\nthat fighting folly that we find among the ancient Germans, that fights neither to kill nor to\nconquer, but simply to fight. Christianity has&mdash;and that is its fairest merit&mdash;somewhat mitigated\nthat brutal German lust for battle. But it could not destroy it; and once the taming talisman,\nthe cross, is broken, the savagery of the old battlers will flare up again, the insane rage of\nwhich Nordic bards have so much to say and sing. That talisman is brittle. The day will come\nwhen it will pitiably collapse. Then the old stone gods will rise from forgotten rubble and rub\nthe dust of a thousand years from their eyes; and Thor will leap up and with his giant\nhammer start smashing Gothic cathedrals, . . and when you hear a crash as nothing ever\ncrashed in world history, you'll know that the German thunder has hit the mark. At that sound\nthe eagles will fall dead from the sky, and the lions in the farthest desert of Africa will put in\ntheir tails and slink away into their royal caves.\n<\/p><p>\nA play will be performed that will make the French Revolution seem like a harmless idyll in\ncomparison. . . .\n<\/p><p>\nBeware! I wish you well; that is why I tell you the bitter truth. You have more to fear from a\nliberated Germany than from the whole Holy Alliance with all its Croats and Cossacks.\n(Heinrich Heine, Works of Prose, ed. by Herman Kesen, pp. 51-53.)\n<\/p><p>\nTHE COLLAPSE OF HUMANITARIAN PRINCIPLES\n<\/p><p>\nThe substitution of ancient gods for Christianity was followed by the collapse of humanitarian\nprinciples, and, as Will Erwin said in \"An Appeal to Common Sense,\" men were back to the\nethics of the barbarian hordes. Barbarians of the twentieth century before Christ killed in any\nmanner which their imagination suggested. And so now do civilized men of the twentieth\ncentury after Christ. The barbarians of the twentieth century before Christ killed the women\nand children of the enemy as tribal self-interest seemed to dictate, and so now do so-called\ncivilized men of the twentieth century after Christ. The barbarians of the twentieth century\nbefore Christ made slaves of the conquered people, or forced them to pay tribute; so virtually\ndo civilized men of the twentieth century after Christ.\n<\/p><p>\n\"A brutal youth,\" having in their eyes \"the gleam of the beast of prey\" hark back to the law of\nthe jungle, as far as from the teaching of Christ as hades from Heaven! It is the doctrine of\navarice, selfishness, and hate.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are some things which man should hate&mdash;he should hate injustice, hate hypocrisy; hate\nwickedness in all its forms, but never hate mankind.\n<\/p><p>\nWe hope and pray that this second World War will soon come to an end, and that war-weary,\nheavy-hearted peoples may again have peace. What then? After all the suffering, after all the\ndestruction of human life, shall we be so blind as to have it start all over again? If the germ\nof hate is permitted to develop, if strong nations strive to dominate the weak as Mussolini did\nEthiopia, as Japan did Manchuria; if the few ruling nations, mighty in the implements of\nwarfare, seek to dominate weaker nations and to tell them how to live and what to do; if they\nseek success only in materialism and shut their eyes to the value of human souls; if they reject\nthe teachings of Christ and pursue their selfish interests, history will repeat itself, the world\nwill be plunged into another war, and again the Lord in pity and sorrow will weep over the\nfolly and blindness of the human race.\n<\/p><p>\nPeace will come and be maintained only through the triumph of the principles of peace, and\nby the consequent subjugation of the enemies of peace, which are hatred, envy, ill-gotten\ngain, the exercise of unrighteous dominion of men. Yielding to these evils brings misery to\nthe individual, unhappiness to the home, war among nations, with resultant misery and death.\n<\/p><p>\nTwo thousand years ago Jesus wept over Jerusalem, the inhabitants of which were blind to the\nthings which pertained to their peace. Today contention, strife and hatred are manifest\nbetween capital and labor unions, and bitterness among advocates of Nazism, Fascism,\nCommunism, and Capitalism. No matter how excellent any of these may seem in the minds of\ntheir advocates, none will ameliorate the ills of mankind unless its operation in government be\nimpregnated with the basic principles promulgated by the Savior of men. On the contrary,\neven a defective economic system will produce good results if the men who direct it will be\nguided by the spirit of Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nActuated by that spirit, leaders will think more of <i>men<\/i> than of the success of a system.\nKindness, mercy, and justice will be substituted for hatred, suspicion, and greed. There is no\nroad to universal peace, which does not lead to the heart of humanity.\n<\/p><p>\nTO AVOID ANOTHER WAR, THEN, PEOPLE MUST CHANGE THEIR WAY OF THINKING\n<\/p><p>\nMen say that so long as human nature is as near to the animal nature as it is, that selfishness,\nsuspicion, greed, chicanery, will continue to pervade and govern human society. If that be true\nthen man must rise above the animal instincts, and strive for the higher and more abundant\nlife. If this requires a change of human nature, then human nature must be changed. On this\npoint, Beverley Nichols writes impressively:\n<\/p><p>\nYou <i>can<\/i> change human nature. No man who has felt in him the spirit of Christ, even for half\na minute, can deny this truth, the one great truth in a world of little lies. You <i>do<\/i> change\nhuman nature, your own human nature, if you surrender it to him. To deny this is only to\nproclaim yourself as an uneducated fool. . . .\n<\/p><p>\nHuman nature <i>can<\/i> be changed, here and now. \n<\/p><p>\nHuman nature <i>has<\/i> been changed, in the past.\n<\/p><p>\nHuman nature <i>must<\/i> be changed, on an enormous scale, in the future, unless the world is to be\ndrowned in its own blood. \n<\/p><p>\nAnd only Christ can change it. . . .\n<\/p><p>\nTwelve men did quite a lot to change the world, nineteen hundred years ago. Twelve simple\nmen, with only the wind to bear them over the seas, with only a few pence in their pockets,\nand a shining faith in their hearts. They fell far short of their ideal, their words were twisted\nand mocked, and false temples were built over their bones, in praise of a Christ they would\nhave rejected. And yet, by the light of their inspiration many of the world's loveliest things\nwere created, and many of the world's finest minds inspired.\n<\/p><p>\nIf twelve men did that, nineteen hundred years ago, what might not twelve men do today? For\nGod has now given us the power of whispering across space, of transmitting our thoughts\nfrom one end of the earth to another. What shall we whisper&mdash;what shall we think? That is the\nquestion (<i>The Fool Hath Said<\/i>, p. 272).\n<\/p><p>\nELIMINATE ARROGANCE OF SUPERIORITY\n<\/p><p>\nWith the spirit of Christ in their hearts <i>no nation will arrogate to itself superiority over others,<\/i>\n<i>but give to each nation, however small, however seemingly backward, the right of<\/i>\n<i>self-determination.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nSEEK MATERIAL ADVANCEMENT AS A MEANS TO SPIRITUAL ATTAINMENT\n<\/p><p>\nWith the spirit of the gospel in men's hearts, nations will accept the truth that integrity is\nmore to be desired than intellectual acumen or the accumulation of wealth. Men will then\nlook upon material advancement not as an end in itself, but as a means to spiritual attainment.\nThey will recognize the significance of \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his\nrighteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33887\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33887)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33887)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>). Statesmen, churchmen, school\nteachers, civic officers, newspapers&mdash;all who in any way mold public opinion must grapple\nintelligently with spiritual apathy and moral decay.\n<\/p><p>\nSome day men must realize that only true religion can satisfy the yearning soul.\n<\/p><p>\nTWO GREAT FORCES POINT THE WAY TO PEACE\n<\/p><p>\nI see two great forces leading the way from the abyss of another World War into the realm of\npeace and progress&mdash;<i>America and the gospel of Jesus Christ<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>\nAmerica has the great opportunity to lead the world from political intrigue and cheap\ndemagoguery, from national selfishness, from unrighteous usurpation of power, and from\nunholy aggrandizement. She must prove to the peoples of Europe and of all the world that she\nhas no selfish ends to serve, no desire for conquest, no arrogance of national or race\nsuperiority. When these ideals are established America can blaze the trail and lead the world\nto peace.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is a land where hate should die&mdash;<br \/>\nThis is a land where strife should cease, <br \/>\nWhere foul, suspicious fear should fly <br \/>\nBefore our flag of light and peace.\n<\/p><p>\nBut I repeat, permanent peace will be found only in the application of the principles of the\ngospel of peace. Christ came to earth to bring peace and good will. When he said: \"I came\nnot to send peace, but a sword\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33899\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33899)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33899)\">Matt. 10:34<\/a><\/span>),\nhe perceived how the acceptance of eternal principles might\nrender asunder the dearest ties, and how a man's foes may become those of his own\nhousehold (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33900\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33900)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33900)\">Matt. 10:36<\/a><\/span>).\nAsserting the principles of the gospel over everything else, he added: \"He that\nloveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter\nmore than me is not worthy of me\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33901\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33901)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33901)\">Matt. 10:37<\/a><\/span>).\nThus he but emphasized the great truth that acceptance of\nthe principles of the gospel is the supreme purpose of life.\n<\/p><p>\nAgain the Lord has revealed himself to man, and in that revelation may be found the answer\nto the perplexities and yearnings of the human soul.\n<\/p><p>\nAgain in this age Christ has said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall\nhave the light of life (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27138\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27138)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27138)\">John 8:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI feel that we can join with the poet in saying:\n<\/p><p>\nO Christ, who died to give men life, <br \/>\nBring that victorious hour,<br \/>\nWhen man shall use for peace, not strife, <br \/>\nHis valor, skill, and power.\n<\/p><p>\nGod grant that the nations of the earth will soon open their eyes, and behold the light of the\nworld, and thereby accept in this day the things which belong unto their peace, I pray in the\nname of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
