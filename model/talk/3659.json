Transgression causes us to feel estranged from our Father in Heaven, and we feel unworthy of his love and fearful of his disapproval.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/gods-love-for-us-transcends-our-transgressions.p5\" class=\"\">Yet, having transgressed his laws or disobeyed his commandments, we need the strengthening influence of our Father to help us overcome our weakness, to repent and become reconciled with him. Unrepented sin tends to become habitual and is frequently accompanied by a deepening sense of guilt which may make repentance increasingly difficult. This feeling of estrangement from the Lord becomes, itself, an impediment to repentance and reconciliation with him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/gods-love-for-us-transcends-our-transgressions.p6\" class=\"\">Knowing we have offended our Father in Heaven, we are afraid to ask his help, feeling that we don\u2019t deserve it. Paradoxically, when we are most in need of the Lord\u2019s influence we deserve it least. Nevertheless, in such circumstances he says to us, as Jesus said to the trembling Peter, \u201cFear not.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32100\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32100)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32100)\">Luke 5:10<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/gods-love-for-us-transcends-our-transgressions.p7\" class=\"\">My message today might best be illustrated through the experiences of a young couple whom I will call John and Gayle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/gods-love-for-us-transcends-our-transgressions.p8\" class=\"\">John was a thoughtful, kind young man, affectionate, with a frank and open manner. He sincerely tried to obey the Lord\u2019s commandments and found honest contentment in the joys of family life. Gayle, his wife, was young, attractive, high-spirited, but inclined toward more worldly interests and activities. The society in which they lived was, in general, one of affluence and materialism. People seemed preoccupied with temporal gain, social status, entertainment, and self-gratification. Religious leaders were concerned about the apparent breakdown in family life and moral standards.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/gods-love-for-us-transcends-our-transgressions.p9\" class=\"\">In the early years of their marriage, John and Gayle were blessed with children, first a boy and then a girl; but Gayle seemed uninterested in her domestic responsibilities. She longed for glamour and excitement in her life and was frequently away from home at parties and entertainments, not always with her husband. In her vanity, Gayle encouraged and responded to the attentions of other men until eventually she was unfaithful to her marriage vows.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/gods-love-for-us-transcends-our-transgressions.p10\" class=\"\">Throughout, John encouraged Gayle to appreciate the joys of family life and experience the rewards of observing the laws of God. He was patient and kind, but to no avail. Shortly after the birth of a third child, a son, Gayle deserted her husband and children and joined her worldly friends in a life of self-indulgence and immorality. John, thus rejected, was humiliated and brokenhearted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/gods-love-for-us-transcends-our-transgressions.p11\" class=\"\">Soon, however, the glamour and excitement that had attracted Gayle turned to ashes. Her so-called friends tired of her and abandoned her. Then each successive step was downward, her life becoming more and more degraded. Eventually she recognized her mistakes and realized what she had lost, but could see no way back. Certainly John could not possibly love her still. She felt completely unworthy of his love and undeserving of her home and family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/gods-love-for-us-transcends-our-transgressions.p12\" class=\"\">Then one day, passing through the streets, John recognized Gayle. Surely he would have been justified in turning away, but he didn\u2019t. As he observed the effect of her recent life, all too evident, a feeling of compassion came over him\u2014a desire to reach out to her. Learning that Gayle had incurred substantial debts, John repaid them and then took her home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/gods-love-for-us-transcends-our-transgressions.p13\" class=\"\">Soon John realized, at first with amazement, that he still loved Gayle. Out of his love for her and her willingness to change and begin anew, there grew in John\u2019s heart a feeling of merciful forgiveness, a desire to help Gayle overcome her past and to accept her again fully as his wife.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/gods-love-for-us-transcends-our-transgressions.p14\" class=\"\">Through his personal experience there arose in John another profound awareness, a realization of the nature of God\u2019s love for us, his children. Though we disregard his counsel, break his commandments, and reject him, when we recognize our mistakes and desire to repent, he wants us to seek him out and he will accept us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/gods-love-for-us-transcends-our-transgressions.p15\" class=\"\">John had been prepared, through his personal experiences, for a divine mission.
