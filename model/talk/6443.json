President Joseph F. Smith taught us: \u201cOur first enemy we will find within ourselves.

The story tells us that in the beginning \u201cDr. Jekyll is a highly respected London physician, a good and kindly man, who in his youth had showed inclinations toward evil which, however, he succeeded in suppressing. Interested in drugs, the doctor now chances upon one which enables him to change his external form to that of a repulsive dwarf, the very embodiment of evil, whom he calls Mr. Hyde. A similar dose permits him to return to the form and personality of the benevolent doctor. Many times the doctor becomes Mr. Hyde, thereby giving this side of his nature more and more power. Jekyll finds it increasingly difficult to regain his virtuous entity and also finds himself occasionally becoming Hyde without the use of the drug.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-20911_000_022\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Thesaurus of Book Digests<\/span> (1949), 206.]<\/span><\/sup> In the character of Mr. Hyde, he commits murder, and when the drug will no longer restore him to the kindly Dr. Jekyll, the truth is discovered and Hyde kills himself. The misuse of drugs destroyed his life. So it can be in real life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-enemy-within.p8\" class=\"\">Now the key to never turning into an evil, wicked Mr. Hyde is to determine not to yield to destroying temptations. Never, never experiment with any addictive substance. Do not ever use tobacco in any form or take any other enslaving substances. Stay away from intoxicating liquor. Addictions bring tragic consequences that are hard to overcome.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-enemy-within.p9\" class=\"\">Blessings come from holding true to our principles. When I was the president of the Cottonwood stake, one of our stake patriarchs was Dr. Creed Haymond. He would occasionally bear strong testimony of the Word of Wisdom. As a young man he was the captain of the University of Pennsylvania track team. In 1919 Brother Haymond and his team were invited to participate in the annual Inter-Collegiate Association track meet. The night before the track meet his coach, Lawson Robertson, who coached several Olympic teams, instructed his team members to drink some sherry wine. In those days, coaches wrongly felt that wine was a tonic for muscles hardened through rigorous training. All the other team members took the sherry, but Brother Haymond refused because his parents had taught him the Word of Wisdom. Brother Haymond became very anxious because he did not like to be disobedient to his coach. He was to compete against the fastest men in the world. What if he made a poor showing the next day? How could he face his coach?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-enemy-within.p10\" class=\"\">The next day at the track meet the rest of the team members were very ill and performed poorly or were even too sick to run. Brother Haymond, however, felt well and won the 100- and 220-yard dashes. His coach told him, \u201cYou just ran the two hundred and twenty yards in the fastest time it has ever been run by any human being.\u201d That night and for the rest of his life, Creed Haymond was grateful for his simple faith in keeping the Word of Wisdom.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-20911_000_022\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Joseph J.

But little by little, I saw some of them turn from the decent, God-fearing qualities of Dr. Jekyll and revert to the baseness of a Mr. Hyde. For some, it began by drinking coffee because the water was foul, and the water decontamination pills had such an unpleasant taste. The coffee led some to take an occasional drink of beer. Every soldier serving overseas was allocated a ration of cigarettes and an occasional bottle of whiskey, which were worth considerable money.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-enemy-within.p12\" class=\"\">President George Albert Smith once gave this advice: \u201cIf you cross to the devil\u2019s side of the line one inch, you are in the tempter\u2019s power, and if he is successful, you will not be able to think or even reason properly, because you will have lost the spirit of the Lord.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-20911_000_022\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Sharing the Gospel with Others,<\/span> ed. Preston Nibley (1948), 43.]<\/span><\/sup> Some soldiers stayed on the safe side of the line and never experimented with nor trafficked in these addicting substances, even though they were given to us free. But others would sample the cigarettes or alcohol as a diversion to the challenges of the war. A few were even drawn away into immorality, believing that the stress of war justified lowering their standards and letting the Mr. Hyde side of their personalities take over.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-enemy-within.p13\" class=\"\">After the war, those who had become addicted to tobacco, alcohol, and immorality found that they could not readily shake off these bad habits. The young men who had started out with such potential crossed that line inch by inch, robbing themselves and their families of the promised happiness and experiencing instead divorce, broken families, and heartaches.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-enemy-within.p14\" class=\"\">Those who never lowered their standards did not succumb to these addictions. They came through that stressful period of their lives stronger and more prepared to lead productive, exemplary, and happy lives as faithful fathers and grandfathers of righteous families. They have also served as honored and respected leaders in the Church and in the community.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-enemy-within.p15\" class=\"\">Another false philosophy that appeals to the Mr. Hyde side of our natures is that peeking into pornography is harmless. This is a terrible deception. Pornography is as addictive as cocaine or any illegal drug. I recently received a heartbreaking letter from an excommunicated man whose soul is filled with sorrow and regret. With his permission, I quote the following from his letter: \u201cI hope that this letter will confirm to any who have doubt that the path of destruction only reaps sorrow and grief and no sin is worth this price.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-enemy-within.p16\" class=\"\">He goes on to state: \u201cI have brought grief and sorrow upon myself. Only now do I fully realize the great destruction that I have brought upon myself. No selfish or lustful desire is worth losing your Church membership for. I have brought terrible grief to my wife and two wonderful children. I am grateful for my wife\u2019s great efforts to help me overcome my sins. My wife has been a victim of my sins and had to endure great sorrow and suffering. I long for the day that I can again be a member of the Lord\u2019s Church and for our family to be an eternal family.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-enemy-within.p17\" class=\"\">The letter goes on to admit: \u201cMy sins are a direct result of my early childhood addiction to pornography. Without a doubt, pornography is addictive and is poison. Had I learned early in my life to apply the power of self-mastery, I would be a member of the Church today.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-enemy-within.p18\" class=\"\">One of Mr. Hyde\u2019s deceptions is what some erroneously call \u201cpremeditated repentance.\u201d There is no such doctrine in this Church. This may sound subtly appealing, but it is in fact pernicious and a false concept. Its objective is to persuade us that we can consciously and deliberately transgress with the forethought that quick repentance will permit us to enjoy the full blessings of the gospel, such as temple blessings or a mission. True repentance can be a long, painful process.
