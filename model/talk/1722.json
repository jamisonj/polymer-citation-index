With the active support of some 150 known or suspected Communist fronts and\ninfiltrated groups identified by the FBI (<i>Human Events<\/i>, September 20, 1969); with almost\nhalf the student bodies of colleges and universities of America reported to have elected\npresidents who support the revolution; with acts of treason against the United States\ncommitted daily throughout the nation, and laws on treason and sedition shattered by\ndecisions of the Supreme Court; with riots in 125 cities within five days' time, 2,600\nbuildings burned and 713 of them in the nation's capital; with revolutions interrupting\noperations of 200 colleges and universities since Christmas; with the Reds ordering the New\nLeft to \"close down 100 universities in 1970\"; and with the constant aid of leftists, dupes,\nfellow travelers, and complacent citizens, the conspiracy is now moving into what they claim\nis the final stages for a nationwide \"revolutionary take over\" (<i>The National Program Letter<\/i>;\nDr. McBirnie's <i>Newsletter<\/i>, both October 1969).\n<\/p><p>\nSome of the most prominent targets now under withering fire in this war against us are the\nTen Commandments, the Sermon on the Mount, the Constitution of the United States, the\ninstitution of private property, and the basic concepts of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Surely this\nis a time when consideration might well be given by the people of America, and the entire\nfree world, to the important matter of citizenship responsibility and, more importantly,\nmembership in the churches of the free world.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Insidious evils widespread<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nToday we face insidious, devastating evils that are widespread. Aimed especially at the\ndestruction of America&mdash;the last great bastion of freedom&mdash;with emphasis on our youth, the\nevils are everywhere, sponsored, promoted, and directed by the Communist conspiracy, fellow\ntravelers, and dupes. Never has evil been presented in such an array of appealing forms. We\nface a most dangerous revolution in America, and it is now in progress. According to the FBI,\n\"It is well-planned, well-financed, and well-armed.\" As citizens of the greatest nation of the\nworld, we face a deadly serious crisis. We must do battle with these evil forces on every\nfront, <i>now<\/i>. Any delay will be disastrous. \"We must begin aggression against evil. The time\nfor procrastination and permissiveness is long past.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThese atrocious, destructive evils are now revealed in our music, in our art, in sex perversion\nand so-called sex education in the schools, in destructive sensitivity training&mdash;a powerful\nform of Pavlovian brainwashing, as used by Communists on captured American servicemen in\nKorea and by Hitler in Nazi Germany.\n<\/p><p>\nThese evils are prominent in the promotion of drugs&mdash;LSD, marijuana, and a host of\nothers&mdash;in leading magazines and underground publications for youth; in TV, movie, and radio\nprograms, in pornographic literature, in morally destructive paperback books available to all\non newsstands, and in Communist-oriented anti-American organizations, such as SDS\n(Students for a Democratic Society).\n<\/p><p>\nThese devilish forces \"led generally by dirty minds in dirty bodies,\" seem to\nbe everywhere. They are spreading into every segment of our social, economic, and religious\nlife&mdash;all aimed at the destruction of one whole generation of our choice youth in preparation\nfor the Communist takeover.\n<\/p><p>\nThe godless Communists have declared, \"We are going to destroy the moral character of a\ngeneration of young Americans, and when we have finished you will have nothing with which\nto really defend yourself against us.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Courageous action needed<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe may, as adults, close our eyes to them and keep our heads in the sand, hoping they\nwill go away; but these evils are here, close by, working insidiously and destructively day by\nday, hour by hour, without ceasing. Will parents who have abandoned their responsibilities for\nthe training and guidance of their children awaken and act before it is too late?\n<\/p><p>\nWe may cry, \"peaceful coexistence,\" but there is no such thing with the devil and his\nemissaries. We are at war&mdash;not a cold war, but a burning, searing hot war, the most serious\nwar in the memory of man. We must win this war now. Will parents bestir themselves before\nit is too late? Will our political leaders really awaken to the danger? Will courageous action\ncome before destruction falls? Will we as citizens rally prayerfully and actively to courageous\nleadership?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Eternal verities<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Christian world&mdash;the real Christian world&mdash;knows that there are certain eternal\nverities, principles, that never change. Jesus Christ is in very deed \"the way, the truth, and the\nlife\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28538\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28538)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28538)\">John 14:6<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Ten Commandments are verily true. They form a permanently binding code of\nconduct that man cannot violate without drastic damage to both his material and his spiritual\nwelfare. We know that God is not dead&mdash;that he is watching us even though one of the\nRussian astronauts cracked: \"We've been all over 'heaven' and we didn't see any sign of\nGod.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYes, godless forces do threaten our great civilization. These godless forces are forging a union\nof state and atheism. I quote in substance from the well-known constitutional lawyer, Dean\nClarence E. Manion (see Manion Forum Broadcast 747, January 26, 1969): \n<\/p><p>\n<b>Astronauts' praise of God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nCan you name the three kings who came out of the East bearing gifts for the Infant\nJesus (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35879\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35879)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35879)\">Matt. 2:1,8-12<\/a><\/span>)?\nSt. Matthew called them the Three Wise Men of the Year One A.D. A few months ago\na national magazine called the Apollo 8 Astronauts the Three Men of the Year 1968. But by\nwhatever name they are called, these six famous men are now forever joined across the\ncenturies by their colorful execution of the same high purpose. All of them followed their\nstars from the end of their earth to praise and glorify God.\n<\/p><p>\nThe miracle for St. Matthew's men was the unerring accuracy of the Star of Bethlehem,\nwhich guided them to their divine destination. The wonder of the world for 1968 was the\napparent common faith, wisdom, humility, and, last but not least, the moral courage of\nColonel Borman, Captain Lovell, and Major Anders, who, on Christmas Day, at the apex of\nhistory's then longest and most perilous voyage, gave praise and thanks to God, the Creator of\nheaven and earth, and implored his blessing upon all of the three billion listening people of\nthis world.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen all of the facts, figures, and findings of the first incredible journey to the moon are\nfinally evaluated and computerized, this unscheduled, unprecedented public act of religious\nfaith and worship will be found, like the name of Abou Ben Adhem, to lead all the rest for all\nthe years to come. Without the blessings of the Lord, all this would be quite impossible.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>War against religion<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThose professed atheists, who have confidently relied upon science to dethrone and\neclipse Almighty God, are already doing their manful best, of course, to rub out all reference\nto the prayer in their recapitulation and evaluation of Apollo 8. The\nmonitoring Communists in Moscow decided wisely to ignore it. But some others are unable to\nrestrain their indignation and have probably been back to the United States Supreme Court\nseeking the same kind of prohibition against the public glorification of God in the heavens\nthat they have so successfully maintained here on earth.\n<\/p><p>\nThe justices may or may not welcome this new opportunity to reinforce their strange new\ndoctrine of neutrality in the weird war that is being fronted against God and religion.\nUndoubtedly, the Court's ultimate decision will be influenced by what happens to the attitude\nof the American people in the meantime. For the real question now is this: How much longer\nwill the American people&mdash;the whole Christian world&mdash;continue to tolerate the sadistic\nbeating that religion has been taking in this country and elsewhere for the past 25 years?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Strategy of godless forces<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFrankly recognizing that godless forces in this country have always been\noverwhelmingly outnumbered by the faithful, the first working principle of the anti-God\nstrategists has been to move insidiously and always carefully to avoid anything that resembles\na direct attack or a frontal confrontation with their opponents.\n<\/p><p>\nSo in launching their campaign against God, the attackers proceeded first to ignore him in the\nsecular press; second, to humanize him in the churches; third, to clobber him with ridicule on\nthe campus; and, finally, to induce the courts to enforce official governmental neutrality in all\nlitigated controversies about God and religion.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom a practical standpoint, of course, these decisions establish a union of state and atheism.\nThe accomplishment of this last objective has taken prayer out of the public schools; and if\nand when the judicial conclusion is extended to its logical limits, it will abolish tax exemption\nfor church property, eliminate chaplains from the armed services, remove our motto \"In God\nwe trust\" from our coins, and require major surgery upon our official salute to the flag.\n<\/p><p>\nWe must realize that the anti-prayer decisions are simply a beguiling climax in the\nwide-ranging campaign against God and religion that has been sustained here in this country,\nand in many other nations, for more than three decades.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Recognition of Russia<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt was boldly begun here in 1933 (November 16), when the United States announced\nour diplomatic recognition of atheistic Soviet Russia. For 15 years the United States had\nrefused to recognize the godless Moscow Communists, for the reasons published at length in\n1920 by Bainbridge Colby, Secretary of State in the administration of President Woodrow\nWilson. In concluding his long letter of documentation and explanation, Colby had said this:\n\"There cannot be any common ground upon which the Government of the United States can\nstand with a power whose conceptions are so entirely alien to our own, so utterly repugnant to\nour moral sense.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis recognition, together with the abandonment of the inspired Monroe Doctrine, gave the\nRed atheists a big diplomatic sanctuary for the coordination and direction of their\npropagandist spies and saboteurs. These promptly infiltrated every branch of our federal\ngovernment and later every segment of our economy, and more recently have established a\ngodless base 90 miles from our shores. Our recognition broke the ice of American resistance\nto the acceptance of the Kremlin gangsters into the international community as a legitimate\ngovernment and so strengthened their iron grip upon the tortured people of Russia and her\nsatellites.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Works of atheism<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJudging by its demoralized works, atheism has now quit advancing in this country\nsimply because it has arrived. Not just rhetorically but actually&mdash;our country is in an ungodly\nmess. City streets are terrorized by crime; our biggest and most expensive campuses are\nparalyzed by nihilism and anarchy; with special license from the Supreme\nCourt, theaters are boldly featuring sex perversion and the newsstands are loaded with\nhard-core pornography. Big-name investigating commissions have told us all about riots,\ncrime, progress, and poverty, but always in materialistic terms of money, housing, social\nservice jobs, and birth control&mdash;without a word about the possibilities for personal moral\nself-restraint.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat about our churches? You have heard the startling story of what scientific atheism has\ndone to institutional religion in the United States and elsewhere.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>America's belief in God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nBut if atheism has taken over, then who and where are the atheists? It was sheer\ncoincidence, of course, that the day after the 1968 astronauts gave us their inspiring prayer\nfrom the moon, the Gallup Poll reported that 98 percent of the American people believe in\nGod. Fantastic? Not at all. How many avowed atheists do you know personally?\n<\/p><p>\nGallup also found that 65 percent of us believe in hell and 60 percent of all Americans\nbelieve in the devil. Now just a word to this big majority who believe in the devil. Who, in\nyour opinion, has masterminded this tragic transformation of the official, controlling\nAmerican mind? The devil? Through Satan's communistic counterfeit to the gospel? Then,\nwhy don't we all say so?\n<\/p><p>\nNow to the 98 percent of us who believe in God: Well, the astronauts did something big\nabout it. Now will you please do a little something about it when you get your next captive\naudience, however small it is?\n<\/p><p>\nOrganized atheism, representing just two percent of our population, has contaminated&mdash;is still\ncontaminating&mdash;the whole course of American life, of Christian life everywhere. In this\ncountry today a two percent tail is wagging the big 98 percent dog. Never in all history have\nso many been hornswoggled by so few.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Start working and praying<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFor years we have all been obsessed with the iniquities of the Supreme Court. The\nway to do something about the Supreme Court is for the 98 percent of us to become obsessed\nwith the omnipotent goodness of the Supreme Being. What do you suppose would happen in\nall branches of our government if the 98 percent of us would stop complaining and start\nworking and praying?\n<\/p><p>\nWe Americans have come almost a year with a new national administration in the United\nStates. The world is watching. Perhaps now is the time to return to basic eternal concepts, to\npraise the Lord while we continue to work hard on the Congress, the President, and the\nSupreme Court.\n<\/p><p>\nOther nations might well follow a similar pattern of concern.\n<\/p><p>\nAs Americans&mdash;as members of the worldwide Christian community&mdash;we can defeat the\ngodless, atheistic forces that threaten us. Yes, with the help of Almighty God we can&mdash;we\nmust&mdash;win the war against the evil forces which seem almost to overwhelm us. The eternal\nverities revealed from God, through his inspired prophets, have not and will not change.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us \"put on the whole armour of God, that [we] may be able to stand against the wiles of\nthe devil\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21826\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21826)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21826)\">Eph. 6:11<\/a><\/span>).\nThere is no other way of safety.\n<\/p><p>\nGod is not dead. He lives, for he has appeared&mdash;together with his Beloved Son Jesus\nChrist&mdash;in our day. This I know, as I know that I live, and I bear this humble witness in the name\nof Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
