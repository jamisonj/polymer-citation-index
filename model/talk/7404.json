We also lived near fields of cucumbers, tomatoes, and a variety of vegetables.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/ye-must-be-born-again.p6\" class=\"\">As a boy I always looked forward to canning season. I did not like scrubbing the canning jars or working in our hot kitchen. But I did like working with my mom and dad. And I loved eating my work! I am sure I ate more fruit than ever made it into any of our canning jars.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/ye-must-be-born-again.p7\" class=\"\">My memories of time spent in the kitchen with Mom and Dad are stirred every time I see a bottle of home-canned cherries or peaches. The basic lessons I learned about temporal self-reliance and provident living while picking and canning produce have blessed me throughout my life. Interestingly, simple and ordinary experiences often provide the most important learning opportunities we ever have.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/ye-must-be-born-again.p8\" class=\"\">As an adult I have reflected upon the things I observed in our kitchen during canning season. This morning I want to discuss some of the spiritual lessons we can learn from the process by which a cucumber becomes a pickle. I invite the Holy Ghost to be with us as we consider the significance of those lessons for me and for you as we come unto Christ and are spiritually reborn.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Cucumbers and Pickles<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/ye-must-be-born-again.p10\" class=\"\">A pickle is a cucumber that has been transformed according to a specific recipe and series of steps. The first steps in the process of changing a cucumber into a pickle are <span class=\"emphasis\">preparing<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">cleaning.<\/span> I remember many hours spent on the back porch of my home removing stems from and scrubbing dirt off of the cucumbers we had picked. My mom was very particular about the preparing and cleaning of the cucumbers. She had high standards of cleanliness and always inspected my work to make sure this important task was properly completed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/ye-must-be-born-again.p11\" class=\"\">The next steps in this process of change are <span class=\"emphasis\">immersing<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">saturating<\/span> the cucumbers in salt brine for an extended period of time. To prepare the brine, my mom always used a recipe she learned from her mother\u2014a recipe with special ingredients and precise procedures. Cucumbers can only become pickles if they are totally and completely immersed in the brine for the prescribed time period. The curing process gradually alters the composition of the cucumber and produces the transparent appearance and distinctive taste of a pickle. An occasional sprinkle of or dip in the brine cannot produce the necessary transformation. Rather, steady, sustained, and complete immersion is required for the desired change to occur.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/ye-must-be-born-again.p12\" class=\"\">The final step in the process requires the <span class=\"emphasis\">sealing<\/span> of the cured pickles in jars that have been sterilized and purified. The pickles are packed in canning jars, covered with boiling hot brine, and processed in a boiling-water-bath canner. All impurities must be removed from both the pickles and the bottles so the finished product can be protected and preserved. As this procedure is properly followed, the pickles can be stored and enjoyed for a long period of time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/ye-must-be-born-again.p13\" class=\"\">To summarize, a cucumber becomes a pickle as it is prepared and cleaned, immersed in and saturated with salt brine, and sealed in a sterilized container. This procedure requires time and cannot be hurried, and none of the essential steps can be ignored or avoided.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>A Mighty Change<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/ye-must-be-born-again.p15\" class=\"\">The Lord\u2019s authorized servants repeatedly teach that one of the principal purposes of our mortal existence is to be spiritually changed and transformed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
