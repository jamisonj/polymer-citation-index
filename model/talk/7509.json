My feelings were and are that we, as members of the Church of Jesus Christ, have chosen not to be ordinary men and women. The last words, \u201cif I am able,\u201d made me think that it is not enough to go through the motions of being baptized and confirmed, but rather we have to fulfill and honor the commitment that we made with the Lord on that memorable day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/after-all-we-can-do.p9\" class=\"\">Lehi taught his son Jacob, saying: \u201cWherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man.

It was performed in the Liniers Branch, the first chapel of the Church built in South America. After my baptism, as I was returning home along with my family, my oldest brother started wrestling with me, as he often did. I exclaimed, \u201cDo not touch me! I cannot sin!\u201d As the days passed, I realized that it was not possible to remain sinless for the rest of my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/after-all-we-can-do.p14\" class=\"\">It is difficult to bear the sufferings that are inflicted upon us, but the real torment in life is to suffer the consequences of our own shortcomings and sins which we inflict upon ourselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/after-all-we-can-do.p15\" class=\"\">There is only one way to rid ourselves of this suffering. It is by means of sincere repentance. I learned that if I could present unto the Lord a broken heart and a contrite spirit, feeling a godly sorrow for my sins, humbling myself, being repentant of my faults, He, through His miraculous atoning sacrifice, could erase those sins and remember them no more.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/after-all-we-can-do.p16\" class=\"\">The Argentine poet Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, in his famous book <span class=\"emphasis\">Mart\u00edn Fierro,<\/span> wrote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">A man loses a lot of things<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">and sometimes finds them again,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">but it\u2019s my duty to inform you,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">and you\u2019ll do well to remember it,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">if once your sense of shame gets lost<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">it will never again be found.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/after-all-we-can-do.p23\" class=\"\">(<span class=\"emphasis\">La Vuelta de Mart\u00edn Fierro,<\/span> part 2 of <span class=\"emphasis\">Mart\u00edn Fierro<\/span> [1879], canto 32; bilingual ed., trans.

I felt separated from the group. I felt afraid, and without thinking I went to my bedroom. I closed the door and began to pray from the depths of my soul like I had never prayed before. \u2018Father, if it is true that these young men are Your disciples and have come to help us, please make it known to me.\u2019 It was in that very moment that I began to cry like a small child.
