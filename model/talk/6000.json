Similarly, the early pioneers\u2019 physical hunger posed no greater threat to their well-being than the spiritual hunger experienced by many in our day. The children of earlier pioneers were required to do incredibly hard physical work to survive their environment. That was no greater challenge than many of our young people now face from the absence of hard work, which results in spiritually corrosive challenges to discipline, responsibility, and self-worth.

Upon receiving a testimony of the truth of the restored gospel, they have unhesitatingly sacrificed all that was required to assure that its blessings will be available to their children and to generations unborn. Some have sold all their property to travel to a temple. Some have lost employment. Many have lost friends. Some have even lost parents and extended family, as new converts have been disowned for their faith. This must be the greatest sacrifice of all.

We should also assure that these same qualities are guiding principles for each of us as we have opportunities to sacrifice for our nations, our families, our quorums, our members, and our Church. This is especially important in societies that have exalted personal interest and individual rights to the point where these values seem to erase the principles of individual responsibility and sacrifice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/following-the-pioneers.p17\" class=\"\">Other great qualities in our early pioneers were <span class=\"emphasis\">obedience, unity,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">cooperation.<\/span> We have all thrilled at the example of the Saints who responded to President Brigham Young\u2019s call to rescue the stranded handcart companies, or to pull up roots in settled communities and apply their talents and lives to colonizing new areas.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/following-the-pioneers.p18\" class=\"\">Our people have always been characterized by their loyalty and obedience to the direction of their leaders, by their unity, and by their extraordinary capacity to cooperate in a common venture. We see the modern manifestations of these pioneer qualities in the great contributions our brothers and sisters make in a wide variety of private projects and common efforts that require unity and cooperation. Another modern manifestation of Mormon obedience, unity, and cooperation is our unique missionary program, from the preparation and service of young missionaries to the remarkably diverse activities of mature couples throughout the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/following-the-pioneers.p19\" class=\"\">Our recent Worldwide Pioneer Heritage Service Day, where Church members contributed more than two million hours of service to their local communities, provides visible evidence that the pioneer qualities of obedience, unity, and cooperation live on in our day. In this and the other examples given, I hope we are not too satisfied with an annual demonstration but will practice these pioneer principles all the days of our lives, as individuals, as families, as Church organizations, and as citizens.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/following-the-pioneers.p20\" class=\"\">In a day when our prophet has challenged us to reach out to welcome and fellowship new members and to reawaken the faith and fellowship of those who have strayed, we can gain strength from the example of the pioneers. The pioneer legacy is a legacy of <span class=\"emphasis\">inclusion.<\/span> When the Saints were driven out of Missouri, many were so poor that they lacked teams and wagons to move. Their Church leaders were adamant that none of the poor would be left behind. The response was the same in the exodus from Nauvoo. At a conference of the Church in October 1845, the membership entered into a covenant to take all the Saints with them.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-97911_000_029\">5<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See William G.

As part of their plan, they sought to enlist others in their conspiracy. Among those they invited to a meeting in Nauvoo were two young men still in their teens, Robert Scott and Dennison L. Harris. Dennison\u2019s father, Emer, was the older brother of Martin Harris, one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon. Being loyal to the Prophet, these young men immediately reported the invitation to Dennison\u2019s father, who advised the Prophet Joseph and sought his advice. Joseph asked Emer Harris to request that the young men attend the meeting, pay strict attention to what was said, make no commitments, and report the entire matter to the Prophet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/following-the-pioneers.p44\" class=\"\">As events proceeded, there were three meetings. They began by denouncing Joseph as a fallen prophet, proceeded to considering how Joseph could be overthrown, and concluded with specific planning to kill him. All of this the two young men reported to the Prophet Joseph after each meeting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/following-the-pioneers.p45\" class=\"\">Before the third meeting, the Prophet foresaw what would happen and told the young men this would be the last meeting. He warned them that the conspirators might kill them when they refused the required oath to participate in the murderous scheme. He said he did not think the conspirators would shed their blood because they were so young, but he called upon their loyalty and courage in these words: \u201cDon\u2019t flinch. If you have to die, die like men, you will be martyrs to the cause, and your crowns can be no greater.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-97911_000_029\">8<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">The Martin Harris Story,<\/span> 147.]<\/span><\/sup> He renewed his original caution that they should not make any promises or enter into any covenants with the conspirators.

When the two boys refused, explaining that Joseph had never harmed them and they were unwilling to participate in his destruction, the leaders declared that since the boys knew the group\u2019s plans, they must agree to join them or they must die on the spot. Knives were drawn.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/following-the-pioneers.p47\" class=\"\">Some protested killing the boys, especially since their parents knew of their presence, so their failure to return would cast suspicion on some of the conspirators. By the barest margin, the cautious course was chosen, and those who opposed killing prevailed. The boys were threatened with certain death if they ever revealed what had transpired in the meetings or who had participated, and they were then allowed to leave unharmed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/following-the-pioneers.p48\" class=\"\">As the boys passed beyond the view of the guards, they were met by the Prophet, who was anxiously watching and praying for their safe return.
