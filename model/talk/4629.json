A measurement is a standard by which we determine the capacity or dimension of a person or object. A measurement gives us a basis for comparison.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p4\" class=\"\">If I say, \u201cShe is a three-point student,\u201d you have a pretty good idea of this person\u2019s scholastic ability. A measurement may also be an estimate of what is expected.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p5\" class=\"\">Human measurement, of course, is subject to human fallibility. My generation, for example, was taught that a person\u2019s I.Q. was supposedly a fixed measurement of a person\u2019s capacity to learn. Such a notion is now generally discredited by the teaching profession. Interestingly, the Prophet Joseph Smith taught in the nineteenth century: \u201cWe consider that God has created man with a mind capable of instruction, and a faculty which may be enlarged in proportion to the heed and diligence given to the light communicated from heaven to the intellect.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, p. 51.) He was obviously ahead of his time!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p6\" class=\"\">We also tend to evaluate others on the basis of physical, outward appearance: their \u201cgood looks,\u201d their social status, their family pedigrees, their degrees, or their economic situations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p7\" class=\"\">The Lord, however, has a different standard by which he measures a person. When it came time to choose a king to replace King Saul, the Lord gave this criteria to his prophet Samuel: \u201cLook not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; \u2026 for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2681\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2681)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2681)\">1 Sam. 16:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p8\" class=\"\">When the Lord measures an individual, He does not take a tape measure around the person\u2019s head to determine his mental capacity, nor his chest to determine his manliness, but He measures the heart as an indicator of the person\u2019s capacity and potential to bless others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p9\" class=\"\">Why the heart? Because the heart is a synonym for one\u2019s entire makeup. We often use phrases about the heart to describe the total person. Thus, we describe people as being \u201cbig-hearted\u201d or \u201cgoodhearted\u201d or having a \u201cheart of gold.\u201d Or we speak of people with faint hearts, wise hearts, pure hearts, willing hearts, deceitful hearts, conniving hearts, courageous hearts, cold hearts, hearts of stone, or selfish hearts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p10\" class=\"\">The measure of our hearts is the measure of our total performance. As used by the Lord, the \u201cheart\u201d of a person describes his effort to better self, or others, or the conditions he confronts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p11\" class=\"\">A question I suggest to you is this: How do you measure up? Ultimately you and I will be judged not only for our actions, but also for the desires of our hearts. This truth was revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith at a time when he was shown in vision the celestial kingdom. The revelation is recorded in section 137 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Joseph marveled when he saw his deceased brother Alvin in the celestial kingdom, for Alvin had died before the gospel was restored. Joseph then received this great truth:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cAll who have died without a knowledge of this gospel, who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God; \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cFor I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18912\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18912)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18912)\">D&amp;C 137:7, 9<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p14\" class=\"\">If our works and the desires of our hearts are the ultimate criteria of our character, how do we measure up? What kind of heart should we seek? For what kind of heart should we pray? How should we measure the worth of other people?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p15\" class=\"\">Today, may I suggest four questions that deal with the heart that may help you determine how you are measuring up.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>First Question: How honest in heart am I?<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p17\" class=\"\">We pray that our missionaries will find the honest in heart. What does it mean to be honest in heart? It describes an individual who is open to truth, who will evaluate information or people without prejudice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p18\" class=\"\">Honest-hearted persons are individuals without pretense, without hypocrisy. They are reliable in word and action. They have no \u201chidden agendas\u201d to deceive others or to misrepresent facts. In contrast, those with conniving hearts will deceive and misrepresent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p19\" class=\"\">An honest heart will lead to a change of heart. Spiritually speaking, a change of heart is not only desirable, but essential for eternal life. The Book of Mormon describes the conversion experience, which all of us must have, as a \u201cmighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40700\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40700)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40700)\">Mosiah 5:2<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p20\" class=\"\">The Book of Mormon is a study of interesting contrasts between those who hardened their hearts and those whose hearts were softened by the Spirit of the Lord.

He serves the Lord on the Lord\u2019s terms, not his own. There are no restrictions to where or how he will serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p27\" class=\"\">As one who has tendered calls to serve to many, I am always pleased to see members willing to give their time, energy, and effort to the upbuilding of the Church. They do so for one primary reason\u2014to serve the Lord with all their heart, might, mind, and strength.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p28\" class=\"\">I have a friend who served as a priests quorum adviser. The boys and the adviser planned a kayak activity at Flaming Gorge, Utah. After some initial planning, one of the quorum members quietly approached the adviser and said: \u201cWe better not plan a kayak trip. Mike won\u2019t be able to go because he can\u2019t paddle.\u201d Mike was partially paralyzed on his right side. When he learned that the quorum was not going on the activity because of him, he told the boys, \u201cI want to go. I can paddle.\u201d The quorum adviser placed his hand on Mike\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cOK, Mike. You\u2019re my paddle partner.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p29\" class=\"\">So from January to August, the boys built their kayaks. They departed to the reservoir in the first week in August.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p30\" class=\"\">Rhythm, togetherness, and teamwork are essential to keep a kayak in a straight line. Mike and his partner had more trouble than the others getting their rhythm and strokes coordinated. Mike had almost no stroke of consequence on his right side. His adviser had to compensate by paddling easy on the left and hard on the right.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p31\" class=\"\">After several hours of learning to work together, Mike said to his adviser, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have a Band-Aid, would you?\u201d The adviser pulled his wallet out and gave Mike a Band-Aid. He placed it over a big water blister that had just popped in the crook of his hand between his thumb and his first finger. The hand and arm that was little used now had to help hold the paddle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p32\" class=\"\">Several hours later, Mike turned again to his adviser, who was in the rear cockpit, and said, \u201cDo you have any more bandages?\u201d The adviser pulled out several and handed them to Mike. By now the crook between Mike\u2019s right thumb and his first finger was becoming raw. Mike applied the Band-Aids and resumed paddling.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p33\" class=\"\">The next day the crew set out again. The adviser encouraged Mike to rest from paddling and let his hand have a respite. The words fell on deaf ears. Instantly, Mike was paddling as he had the day before.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p34\" class=\"\">This day found a usual midday and afternoon wind blowing directly at the flotilla of kayak paddlers. It required stronger strokes and took much energy and time. Wincing from the hurt, Mike continued to paddle. Each suggestion that he rest intensified his will to carry his load.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p35\" class=\"\">Throughout the week, Mike persisted in holding his own. Though his hand was as raw as hamburger and awful to look at, he would not give up.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p36\" class=\"\">During the week\u2019s trip, the conversation with his senior companion often centered around his desire to go on a mission. Repeatedly Mike asked, \u201cI hope they will let me go on a mission. Do you think my problem will prevent me from going?\u201d Mike walks with a noticeable limp of his right leg. He has a firm handshake with the left hand, but his right hand doesn\u2019t open up all of the way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-measure-of-our-hearts.p37\" class=\"\">How many who have no visible blemish have a heart like Mike\u2019s?
