The prophet Alma went to the land of Antionum to teach the Zoramite people. Many of the Zoramites desired to worship God but were confused and discouraged. Alma wanted life to change for these good people. He believed that hearing and trying the word of God would be the best way for them to become happy and contented. He believed that the word could actually change the minds of people if they should try it.
