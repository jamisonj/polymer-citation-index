Reuben Clark, Jr., <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1943, pp. 10-14<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy Brethren: With you my heart has rejoiced at the love and the blessings which have just\ncome to us from our respected, honored, loved, and revered president, Heber J. Grant. May\nthe Lord vouchsafe to him for many years to come those blessings of life, strength, vigor of\nmind and body which he shall require to perform the duties and obligations that rest upon\nhim.\n<\/p><p>\nWe thought that perhaps at the beginning of the conference before we return to the more\nhighly spiritual levels to which President Grant has raised us, that it might be well for me to\nmake a few observations regarding the temporal affairs of the Church&mdash;what one might call its\nsemi-business affairs.\n<\/p><p>\nCHURCH FINANCES\n<\/p><p>\nI should like in the first place to say that we of the General Authorities return unto the Saints\nour deepest gratitude for their faithfulness in the payment of tithes. The largest tithing in the\nhistory of the Church up to that time came in 1941. In 1942 our tithes increased over fifty\npercent over 1941. Thus far in 1943 our tithes have increased over 1942 by more than fifty\npercent.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has blessed the people in their crops, and he is continuing to bless them. While I do\nnot personally advocate the payment of tithes on the theory that if you pay\nyour tithes the Lord will give you more money, I do earnestly urge upon you the payment of\ntithes, and a full tithing, because thereby you will have greater joy than through any other\ntemporal activity in which you may engage.\n<\/p><p>\nWe thought perhaps you would like to know something about the way in which the tithing is\nspent.\n<\/p><p>\nYou will recall that the history of the Church, as far as its financial operations are concerned,\nmay be roughly divided into four periods: That which antedated the great revelation given\nFebruary 9, 1831 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11856\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11856)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11856)\">D&amp;C 42:30-39<\/a><\/span>);\nthat which went on from then until June of 1834; that which went forward\nfrom June, 1834, until July 8, 1838, and then from July 8, 1838, until the present time.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first period down to February 9, 1831, was not marked by any systematic plan of Church\nfinancing. The Church was young and few in numbers, but certain great principles were\nestablished at that time regarding the expenditure of the funds, all of them looking to the care\nof the poor and the building of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE UNITED ORDER\n<\/p><p>\nOn February 9, 1831, at Kirtland, the Prophet received the first great revelation on the United\nOrder. We find other revelations bearing upon that subject, the more important concerning it\n(though it was touched upon in many of the others) are sections 42, 51, 56, 70, 72, 78, 82,\n85, 90, 101, and 105. The United Order has not been generally understood, and I think that I\nmay repeat here again what I said on another occasion: that the United Order was not a\ncommunal system. It was an individualistic system. Every man was to own his own property.\nHe was required, however, to give the surplus thereof for the benefit of the poor and for the\nbuilding up of the Church. The United Order and communism are not synonymous.\nCommunism is Satan's counterfeit for the United Order. There is no mistake about this and\nthose who go about telling us otherwise either do not know or have failed to understand or\nare wilfully misrepresenting.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord tried us for three years to see if we could not set up the United Order; we could\nnot. So then at Fishing River on June 22, 1834, following the dissolution of Zion's Camp, the\nLord told us that we should give up the United Order and that he would not reestablish it\nuntil Zion was redeemed (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11908\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11908)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11908)\">D&amp;C 105:9<\/a><\/span>),\nand that time has not yet come.\n<\/p><p>\nBetween that time, June 22, 1934, and July 8, 1838, we again had no regular financial system.\n<\/p><p>\nOn July 8, 1838, the Prophet prayed: \"Oh Lord! show unto thy servant how much thou\nrequirest of the properties of thy people for a tithing.\" In response to that prayer the Lord\ngave the revelations now incorporated in the D&amp;C as sections 119 and 120\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11918\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11918)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11918)\">D&amp;C 119:1-7<\/a><\/span>).\nIn the revelation printed as section 120, the Lord said:\n<\/p><p>\nVerily, thus saith the Lord, the time is now come, that it [the tithing] shall be disposed of by\na council, composed of the First Presidency of My Church and the bishop and his council,\nand by my high council [the Twelve]; and by mine own voice unto them, saith the Lord.\nEven so. Amen (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11919\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11919)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11919)\">D&amp;C 120:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTITHING ADMINISTRATION\n<\/p><p>\nAccordingly the tithing is now administered in the following way: Under the direction of the\nFirst Presidency a budget is drawn up, as nearly as may be at the first of the year, which\nincludes all of the proposed expenditures of the tithing. This budget is the result of the careful\nconsideration of the departments which are responsible for the expenditure of the funds.\n<\/p><p>\nThis budget is then taken before the Council on the Expenditure of the Tithing, composed, as\nthe revelation provides, of the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and the Presiding\nBishopric. This council considers and discusses the budget so submitted, approving or\ndisapproving, as the case may be, individual items, but finally passing the budget.\n<\/p><p>\nThe approved budget as it comes from that meeting is then turned over for its expenditures to\na Committee on Expenditures, composed of the First Presidency, three members of the\nCouncil of the Twelve, representing that council, and the Presiding Bishopric. This committee\nthen passes upon and authorizes the expenditures of the tithing. So that there is a complete\ncheck upon all of the tithing which is paid into the Church. None of it is expended except\nupon the approval and authorization of this committee.\n<\/p><p>\nWELFARE PROGRAM\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to say a little something now about the Welfare program. The first move made\nby the First Presidency in the Welfare program was made in August of 1933, a little over ten\nyears ago, when the First Presidency asked you presidents of stakes and bishops to make a\nsurvey. This you did and your reports came in to the First Presidency. Because of its great\nimportance the matter was then taken under advisement and consideration for three years.\nThen in 1936, the plan was put into operation.\n<\/p><p>\nAt the time it was put into operation, we called attention to the fact that while its immediate\npurpose was the caring for the poor, and only temporarily caring for them so far as the\nindividuals were concerned, yet that back of and behind that service there were other\nconsiderations, among them being that we should rehabilitate temporally and spiritually those\nwho received the assistance. It was also determined that the principle of help Should be the\nactual need of the individual or family; there was not to be a fixed, uniform amount for each\nperson. Also, in so far as it was practicable, everyone should work for what he received, if he\nwere well.\n<\/p><p>\nThat program has gone forward in a very remarkable way, and literally thousands have been\nhelped and many families have been so rehabilitated.\n<\/p><p>\nBut there was another element involved in it, and that was based upon the Savior's principle\nannounced in the Sermon on the Mount, \"It is more blessed to give than to receive\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7510\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7510)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7510)\">Acts 20:35<\/a><\/span>). And the\nhistory of the Welfare movement shows that there has come into the Church an\never-increasing spirituality because of the giving which has been incident to the carrying on\nof the Welfare work. That giving has been not alone a giving of money or\nprovisions or clothing or fuel, but a giving of manual labor, and of all the contributions the\nlatter has perhaps brought the most of a feeling of common brotherhood as men of all training\nand occupation have worked side by side in a Welfare garden or other project.\n<\/p><p>\nOur achievements for this year in the Welfare program and in the activities connected\ntherewith, have been greatly beyond our dreams.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have now under cultivation in the Church in connection with Welfare projects some\n14,578 acres of land. I think all of this is farmed by voluntary, gratuitous labor.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have established in connection with the Welfare work 90 bishop's storehouses.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have set up 65 canneries.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are in the Church, under the Welfare program, 598 livestock projects, and there are\nunder the direction of the quorums 157 such projects. We have established many\nmanufacturing and processing plants, of which Priesthood quorums have established 30 and\nother establishments 294.\n<\/p><p>\nWe do not know just how many families have been rehabilitated in the sense that they have\nbeen established in business of some sort of farming, but it runs not far short of 1200.\n<\/p><p>\nSUPPLEMENTARY CANNING\n<\/p><p>\nThis year, as you know, we have provided that the canneries should be used by ward groups\nwho might wish to put up fruit. This was done in accordance with the expressed approval of\nthe proper governmental agencies. The figures of what we have done this year through the\nWelfare plan, through the group canning activities, and through the home processing of fruits\nand vegetables, are, I think, remarkable.\n<\/p><p>\nIn group canning we shall have put up during this season 1,253,000 cans. In Welfare canning\nwe shall have put up 849,000 cans, the two together making 2,102,000 cans.\n<\/p><p>\nBut that is only the beginning. As careful an estimate as we can make indicates that in the\nwards and stakes, not including the missions, the Church families have put up and have stored\nin their cellars 42,625,000 cans, or a grand total for the wards and stakes and the Welfare of\n44,727,000 cans. We believe that if we included the canning done by Church families in the\nmissions, the total number of cans of fruits and vegetables which we shall have in these three\nways brought into storage for the next year, will approximate, if not exceed, 50,000,000 cans.\nThis represents over 1,000,000,000 points.\n<\/p><p>\nFor this tremendous achievement, the greatest that has come from a unified Church effort in a\ngeneration, the most credit and gratitude is due to the sisters of the Church who have done all\nthe home canning as well as the bulk of the canning for the Welfare program and the ward\ngroups. We ask these sisters to receive the heartfelt thanks and congratulations of the whole\nbody of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nThus we have shown something of what we can do if we set our minds\nthereto. Furthermore, it should be understood that the home canning has processed much, if\nnot in greatest part, the products of home and group gardens, and of fruits that would\notherwise have been wasted. The public supplies of green vegetables and fruits have not been\nseriously drawn upon.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the use of all this material we should remember that it should be used carefully and \nwithout waste. Furthermore, in so far as we may be permitted so to do under governmental\nregulations, we should be prepared to remember during the coming winter our neighbors who\nmay be in need.\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure we have now demonstrated in this Welfare program, and in the more or less\nancillary home canning, in what has heretofore been more or less on an experiment, what we\ncan do, we of the Church, if we set our minds and our hearts on carrying out the admonition\nof our prophet in becoming self-sustaining.\n<\/p><p>\nSPIRITUAL DIVIDENDS\n<\/p><p>\nThis group canning has brought to us this blessing which far outweighs any other that is\nincident thereto. From all over the Church we hear that it has brought into the wards, where it\nhas been carried on, a feeling of unity, a feeling of brotherhood, or respect for our brothers\nand our sisters&mdash;a desire and willingness to help one another, that we have rarely, if ever,\nequaled in the history of the Church before.\n<\/p><p>\nYou will remember that the Lord told his disciples, on the evening of the Passover and\nthereafter, in His great prayer, that they must be one\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27106\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27106)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27106)\">John 17:21<\/a><\/span>),\nand that He expected His people to be\none. They must be unified. In our day He has said: \"Except ye are one ye are not mine\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11853\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11853)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11853)\">D&amp;C 38:27<\/a><\/span>).\nTherefore, this spirit of unity which this work has brought to us has carried us far along the\nroad which the Lord laid down for us to follow.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my prayer that the Lord will bless us, that He will help us still further to unify our\nefforts&mdash;help us to live in peace and quiet and contentment as among ourselves. May He give\nus the power that we may go with Him, as He said we might, and abide with the Father and\nHim, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus, Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
