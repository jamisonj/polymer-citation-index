Youth search for security. They search for answers to be found only in a good home. No national or international treaty can bring peace. Not in legislative halls nor judicial courts will our problems be solved. From the hearthstones of the homes will come the answers to our problems.

In the home youth will receive strength to find happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-things-that-matter-most.p26\" class=\"\">The world is full of foolish schemes.

Security stored up for this lifetime with the world\u2019s situation as it is, could, and probably will, vanish. To really secure one\u2019s children, give them the memory of a happy home life. This is a pattern, a blueprint for them to follow, an image for them to create, an ideal for them to realize.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-things-that-matter-most.p29\" class=\"\">Create a wholesome atmosphere in your home.

Again the home is weakened. Face the fact that true fatherhood and true motherhood are fast disappearing. The failure of fathers and mothers to assume their rightful responsibilities actually creates the disturbed conditions we face. As Latter-day Saints, we must resist the thrust of the world against our homes. Repentance is in order for many of us. We <span class=\"emphasis\">must <\/span>put our values in proper perspective. Put time and attention and means on the things that matter most. Few, in their more sober moments of reflection, do not know where true values rest. It takes a reminder, however, to keep them properly in focus.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-things-that-matter-most.p31\" class=\"\">King Benjamin counseled parents not to \u201csuffer your children that they go hungry, or naked; neither \u2026 that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the devil. \u2026 But \u2026 teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; \u2026 teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40379\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40379)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40379)\">Mosiah 4:14\u201315<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-things-that-matter-most.p32\" class=\"\">The Lord placed upon parents the responsibility to teach their children.

Children from broken homes seldom carry the idea that the family is an adequate problem-solving organization. Children whose entertainment comes largely from television find their needs for involvement in life frequently frustrated. Where a doctor who stops at the scene of an accident may be sued for administering aid, it is difficult to transmit to children the idea of service and responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-things-that-matter-most.p34\" class=\"\">In a home where the accumulation of worldly goods has become so important that the father works inordinately at providing financial security at the expense of spending time with his children and sharing his counsel and encouragement; and in a home, likewise, where the mother forsakes her children in order to get more \u201cthings,\u201d it is a poor place to teach the worth of a human being in terms of love and sacrifice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-things-that-matter-most.p35\" class=\"\">The Lord has said: \u201cI have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15795\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15795)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15795)\">D&amp;C 93:40<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/the-things-that-matter-most.p36\" class=\"\">Dr. [Paul] Popenoe said, \u201cOur youth are not products of their own lives, but of what their parents give them.
