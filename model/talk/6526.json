As I awaited my turn at the midpoint of the session, I stood between two great Apostles: Elders Marvin J. Ashton and Bruce R. McConkie. I felt their love and support as I gazed with no little trepidation at the congregation of Saints gathered in the Tabernacle. Incidentally, we\u2019re four times greater today. Elder Ashton, sensing my feelings, whispered, \u201cI know it\u2019s an awesome sight, but they\u2019re all your friends.\u201d As I stood that first time to speak, I felt the love of the Saints washing over me. Since then, in all the places to which worldwide assignments have taken us, Shirley and I have felt that same love and tried to return it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/united-in-love-and-testimony.p5\" class=\"\">The unity of the Saints is unique and powerful. I have seen and felt it on virtually every continent and in the islands of the sea. That unity is a major reason the Church is progressing. Without it we would falter. As Jesus explained, \u201cEvery city or house divided against itself shall not stand.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-21905_000_032\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33608\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33608)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33608)\">Matt. 12:25<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Division and fault lines abound in the world, but \u201cwe are not divided; all one body we.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-21905_000_032\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cOnward, Christian Soldiers,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 246.]<\/span><\/sup> We have that unity under the spiritual direction of our prophet.

Almost every member could and would respond if called upon to bear their own testimonies in this conference. Yes, we are united in love and testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/united-in-love-and-testimony.p8\" class=\"\">My testimony is built on the firm convictions that the Book of Mormon is true and Jesus is our Savior. This spiritual foundation has helped me weather the storms of challenge and doubt. I started reading the Book of Mormon in my youth and have continued, learning and drinking its spirit with every study.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/united-in-love-and-testimony.p9\" class=\"\">As one in the last large group of missionaries called before demands of the Korean War diverted our young men into military service, I participated in about five days of training in the Salt Lake Mission Home on State Street. One of our trainers was Bryant S. Hinckley, a Church leader of stature and a stimulating teacher. He invited those missionaries assembled to share reasons they believed the Book of Mormon to be true. I was impressed with the variety of reasons shared by the missionaries. On that occasion, I suggested that in addition to the witness of the Holy Ghost, the number of new names identifying people, places, animals, and things in the Book of Mormon had impressed me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/united-in-love-and-testimony.p10\" class=\"\">Now, 50 years later, I am still impressed by these new names. When researchers reported that they have discovered stones in the southern Arabian Desert with the name <span class=\"emphasis\">Nahom<\/span> inscribed on them, I paid attention. These inscriptions appear to be dated about 700 <span class=\"small\">B.C.<\/span> Ishmael, we read, was buried in a place called Nahom. Nahom is one of those names that impressed me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/united-in-love-and-testimony.p11\" class=\"\">Evidence of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon continues to mount. During his mission in Germany, Jack Welch found verses in the Book of Mosiah that clearly form a chiasmus, or an X-shaped configuration. That finding evidenced ancient rather than modern authorship. Scholars continue to find and publish new insights into what the book says and how it says it. A distinguished literature professor has published a recent book containing his lifetime study of the Book of Mormon, detailing its astonishing variety of literary forms.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-21905_000_032\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Richard Dilworth Rust, <span class=\"emphasis\">Feasting on the Word: The Literary Testimony of the Book of Mormon<\/span> (1997).]<\/span><\/sup> Statisticians have found evidence of multiple authors within the covers of the book. Although these evidences have added to my testimony, the original powerful witness of the Holy Ghost has remained unshaken and unaltered. It has also recurred many times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/united-in-love-and-testimony.p12\" class=\"\">I also wonder if we fully appreciate the value and strength of the witnesses\u2019 testimonies published in each copy of the Book of Mormon. Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris saw the plates and the angel. And Joseph also showed the gold plates to eight other men who saw and, using their word, \u201chefted\u201d them.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-21905_000_032\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cThe Testimony of Eight Witnesses,\u201d Book of Mormon.]<\/span><\/sup> These witnesses did not recant their testimonies, nor have their published testimonies ever been otherwise impeached. Those eight additional witnesses, in effect, testified: \u201cYes, we saw and lifted those plates. Joseph had them.\u201d The witnesses have been important to me. The Lord told Joseph that the declarations of these witnesses prove \u201cto the world that the holy scriptures are true, and that God does inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-21905_000_032\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11092\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11092)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11092)\">D&amp;C 20:11<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/united-in-love-and-testimony.p13\" class=\"\">Having discovered that the book is true, we must then ask, \u201cWhat is its message?\u201d Alma\u2014and incidentally, Professor Welch says that they\u2019ve discovered recently ancient usage of the word <span class=\"emphasis\">Alma<\/span>\u2014Alma, in speaking to the people of Gideon, put his finger on the central message of the book.
