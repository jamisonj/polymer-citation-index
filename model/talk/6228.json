Just before this session started, some of our grandchildren stopped by our hotel room. They had obviously been talking about Elder Marlin Jensen\u2019s talk of this morning. One of them said, \u201cAre you scared, Grandpa?\u201d I lied and said, \u201cNot very.\u201d Another one said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Grandpa, if you mess up, we\u2019ll still love you.\u201d But then reality came back into the room when someone added, \u201cBut, Grandpa, it would be very embarrassing.\u201d So I am going to try very hard not to mess up.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-name-is-safe-in-our-home.p5\" class=\"\">On June 26, 1858, what I believe to be the largest standing army in the history of the United States up to that date began its prearranged entry into Salt Lake Valley. They had come to quell a nonexistent rebellion. Almost anyone remotely familiar with the history of the Church can tell you that they marched in relative silence within a few yards of where this building now stands, through a city described by one writer as \u201cdeserted,\u201d and encamped some distance to the west. What followed is far less well known. In due course the army moved approximately 40 miles south of Salt Lake City to the village of Fairfield, a small farming community in Cedar Valley, home to what is estimated to have been less than 200 people. Their local spiritual leader was John Carson, my great-grandfather.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-name-is-safe-in-our-home.p6\" class=\"\">Imagine how this small congregation must have felt. After all, how would you like to wake up some morning and find that several thousand soldiers, together with over 3,000 wagons, 10,000 oxen, and 12,000 mules, had moved into your ward? The challenges were immediate. From our oral family history, and subject to all of the romanticizing and inaccuracies of such histories, we learn that Bishop Carson was gravely concerned about the welfare of the people over whom he presided. All of the challenges that attended army encampments of that time descended upon Fairfield almost overnight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-name-is-safe-in-our-home.p7\" class=\"\">To protect the members of the congregation as much as possible, Bishop Carson met with the commander of the fort, who often dined at his hotel and with whom he developed a good relationship based upon mutual respect. The two leaders surveyed the situation and then by agreement drew a line upon the ground. No army personnel would cross into the civilian community without specific approval of their superiors. And members of the congregation would not cross into the fort without specific approval from Bishop Carson. The line on the ground represented an unspoken command: \u201cOver this line you may not cross.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-name-is-safe-in-our-home.p8\" class=\"\">When we were children, a line on the ground had special significance. Whenever boyhood tempers caused disagreement, the time-honored solution called for a line on the ground. The antagonists stood on opposite sides of the line, attempting to act as intimidating as possible. Someone would say, \u201cStep over the line and you\u2019ll be sorry,\u201d though they usually didn\u2019t say it in those genteel words. In those moments I learned the great value of a line on the ground and the consequences of stepping over it. In the years that have followed, I have come to understand that figurative lines on the ground are placed there by a loving Heavenly Father who seeks to protect us from Lucifer\u2019s army.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-name-is-safe-in-our-home.p9\" class=\"\">While each of us may have dozens of lines on the ground in our life today, I would like to discuss just one of them\u2014the line that says, \u201cKeep each person\u2019s name safe in your home.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-name-is-safe-in-our-home.p10\" class=\"\">During the early years of my service as a General Authority, I was privileged to be in company with Elder Marion D. Hanks on one occasion when he related the following story. I use it here with his permission:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-name-is-safe-in-our-home.p11\" class=\"\">Oscar Kirkham was one of the great men of the Church and among the Church\u2019s most respected Scouters. He served in the First Council of the Seventy and was a significant presence wherever he went. Often in meetings he would rise to a \u201cpoint of personal privilege\u201d and then, when recognized, would proceed to say something good about someone. Near the end of his life, he spoke briefly at Brigham Young University on the theme \u201csay the good word.\u201d On the morning that Elder Kirkham died, Elder Hanks was invited to the Kirkham family home. There he was handed a small, inexpensive notebook in which Elder Kirkham had kept his notes. The last two entries were: \u201cSay the good word\u201d and \u201cYour name is safe in our home\u201d (see Marion D. Hanks, foreword to <span class=\"emphasis\">Say the Good Word,<\/span> by Oscar A. Kirkham [1958], 4).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-name-is-safe-in-our-home.p12\" class=\"\">What a blessing it would be if all of us could follow that counsel, if each of our names truly could be safe in the home of others. Have you noticed how easy it is to cross over the line and find fault with other people? All too often we seek to be excused from the very behavior we condemn in others. Mercy for me, justice for everyone else is a much too common addiction. When we deal with the name and reputation of another, we deal with something sacred in the sight of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-name-is-safe-in-our-home.p13\" class=\"\">There are those among us who would recoil in horror at the thought of stealing another person\u2019s money or property but who don\u2019t give a second thought to stealing another person\u2019s good name or reputation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/your-name-is-safe-in-our-home.p14\" class=\"\">The old adage \u201cNever judge another man until you have walked a mile in his footsteps\u201d is as good advice today as it was the day it was first uttered.
