In all the recorded history of man upon the earth, the God of heaven has\nestablished only two nations with basic divine purposes. One is the nation of Israel which the\nLord by his mighty power led out of Egypt under the guidance of his prophet Moses.\n<\/p><p>\nThe other nation is the United States of America. Prophets in early times foretold the events\nleading to the establishment of this mighty gentile nation and its promised destiny among the\nnations of the earth&mdash;if its people are faithful in keeping the commandments\nof God.\n<\/p><p>\nMoses counseled the newborn nation of Israel to serve the Lord and to keep his laws and\nstatutes. He informed them of God's plans and purposes concerning his chosen people and\nalso outlined his promises for faithful obedience to his laws and commandments and the\ncursings which would befall them if they became disobedient and sinful.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom Deuteronomy, I quote the following teachings and admonitions of Moses to the children\nof Israel:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;\n<\/p><p>\n\"A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but turn aside out\nof the way . . . to go after other gods, which ye have not known\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21245\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21245)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21245)\">Deut. 11:26-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy\nGod, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the\nLord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and\nthou shalt not be beneath\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21246\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21246)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21246)\">Deut. 28:1,13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nRegardless of the many prophets, Israel was periodically blessed with following the death of\nthe great lawgiver, Moses, the continued disobedience and the contentions among its tribes not\nonly divided them as a people but also destroyed them as a nation; and true to his warning,\nGod scattered Israel among all the nations of the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nWith these few pronouncements of God to Israel in mind, I turn to the second nation of\ndestiny, the United States of America&mdash;a nation established by God in these latter days in\nfulfillment of prophecy, with wonderful promises for obedience to the commandments of the\nLord and cursing if it fails to keep his commandments.\n<\/p><p>\nThere were two groups of people before the time of Christ who were led away from eastern\nlands by the Lord to the Americas, and they became, in time, quite numerous. Eventually,\nhowever, because of disobedience and wickedness, they were destroyed, except a remnant of\nthe second group who are the progenitors of the American Indian. These two migrations of\npeople to the Americas received knowledge by revelation through their prophets concerning a\npowerful gentile nation which was to be established in the latter days upon this land by the\nhand of God.\n<\/p><p>\nNow let us briefly examine the revelations and prophecies as recorded in the Book of\nMormon, foretelling America's discovery, its peopling from the European gentile nations, the\nevents leading to the break with Great Britain, the Revolutionary War which secured\nindependence for the colonies from the tyranny of oppression of an unjust king and nation.\nAn angel showed to Nephi, an American prophet who lived about six hundred years before\nChrist, the many waters which separated the gentile nations from the seed of his brethren. He\nrecorded this vision as follows:\n<\/p><p>\n\"And it came to pass that the angel said unto me: Behold the wrath of God is upon the seed\nof thy brethren.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was separated from the seed of my\nbrethren by the many waters; and . . . the Spirit of God . . . came down and wrought upon\nthe man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, who\nwere in the promised land.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And . . . I beheld the Spirit of God, that it wrought upon other Gentiles; and they went forth\nout of captivity, upon the many waters.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And . . . I beheld many multitudes of the Gentiles upon the land of promise . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles, and they did prosper and\nobtain the land for their inheritance . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And . . . the Gentiles who had gone forth out of captivity did humble themselves before the\nLord; and the power of the Lord was with them.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I beheld that their mother Gentiles were gathered together upon the\nwaters, and upon the land also, to battle against them.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I beheld that the power of God was with them, and also that the wrath of God was upon\nall those that were gathered together against them to battle.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered by the\npower of God out of the hands of all other nations.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that they did prosper in the land\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1585\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1585)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1585)\">1 Ne. 13:11-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFrom your knowledge of early American history, you will recognize Columbus as the man\nwho went forth upon the many waters and discovered the Americas. The other facts of this\nprophecy and its fulfillment are also known to you from America's recorded history. This\nsame prophet, speaking of the house of Israel being scattered and confounded, predicted:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . that the Lord God will raise up a mighty nation among the Gentiles, yea, even upon the\nface of this land\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1589\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1589)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1589)\">1 Ne. 22:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLehi, the father of Nephi, and himself a prophet, speaking to his descendants and followers,\ndeclared that the land of America is a land of promise, choice above all other lands.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit which is in me,\n<i>that there shall none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And if it so be that they\nshall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of\nliberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be\nbecause of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the land for their sakes, but\nunto the righteous it shall be blessed forever\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3689\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3689)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3689)\">2 Ne. 1:6-7<\/a><\/span>, italics added).\n<\/p><p>\nJacob, the brother of Nephi, in an inspirational discourse to his people, reaffirmed the Lord's\npromises to the gentiles upon this land. He declared:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . the promises of the Lord are great unto the Gentiles . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . and the Gentiles shall be blessed upon the land.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And this land shall be a land of liberty unto the Gentiles, and there shall be no kings upon\nthe land, who shall raise up unto the Gentiles.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I will fortify this land against all other nations\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3698\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3698)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3698)\">2 Ne. 10:9-12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the Savior's visit to the Nephites in the Americas after his resurrection and ascension\nto glory, he, speaking of the gentiles upon this land, promised that he would pour out the\nHoly Ghost upon the gentiles, \"<i>which blessing upon the Gentiles shall make them mighty above all<\/i>\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5663\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5663)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5663)\">3 Ne. 20:27<\/a><\/span>, italics added).\n<\/p><p>\nWhen God confounded the language of the people at the tower of Babel, he separated a group\nknown as the Jaredites, and under the direction of a prophet, led them to the land of the\nAmericas. He revealed to this ancient prophet:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from\nbondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under <i>heaven, if they will but serve<\/i>\n<i>the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ<\/i>, who hath been manifested by the things which we\nhave written\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22244\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22244)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22244)\">Ether 2:12<\/a><\/span>, italics added).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord also emphasized to this early prophet that whatsoever nation shall possess this land\nof promise shall serve God or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall\ncome upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in\niniquity. \"This,\" said the prophet, \"is an everlasting decree of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22242\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22242)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22242)\">Ether 2:8-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThus, from ancient American prophets, we learn that this United States of America was\nestablished by God for a divine purpose, and that great blessings, which all must admit, as we\nreview the history of this nation, have so far been literally fulfilled; yet the fulfillment of\nfuture promise of blessings is conditional upon the continued righteousness of its people. A\ngreat challenge is presented to the citizens of this land if God is to be on our side and give us\npower as a nation to overcome our enemies and not be brought down into\ncaptivity.\n<\/p><p>\nThis nation did not come into being by chance. God declared that the gentiles who came here\nwere to be brought out of captivity by his hand. The prophecies previously quoted concerning\nthe establishment of this nation have been fulfilled to the letter. The people coming here in\nthe beginning did so to find religious freedom. Nevertheless, they were subjected to tyrannical\nrule, unjust demands, and no representation. They had lost the opportunities, the privileges,\nthe religious freedom and liberty which impelled them to settle in this new land. The colonists\nbecame an aroused group because of oppression; therefore, the time had arrived in the\neconomy of God for the people to break off the yoke of domination which subjected them to\nthese unjust and intolerable conditions. The Lord, knowing beforehand the events which\nwould set the pattern for independence, raised up strong and valiant men to meet this hour of\ncrisis and challenge. The Declaration of Independence came from a determined people. The\nsuccessful Revolutionary War which followed united the colonies; and the gentile nation of\ndestiny and of divine purpose, as foretold by the prophets, was born. A Constitution was\nneeded to set forth the purposes, obligations, and the guide lines for the new nation. God was\nprepared and ready and did not neglect this newborn nation which he had ordained to be\nestablished thousands of years previously.\n<\/p><p>\nI now turn to latter-day scripture to substantiate this statement, which revelations are not only\nimportant for Latter-day Saints to know and understand, but also for the entire citizenry of\nthis favored country. The Lord, through the Prophet Joseph Smith in December of 1833,\ncounseled in the midst of their afflictions that \"the Saints should continue to importune for\nredress, and redemption, by the hands of those who are placed as rulers and are in authority\nover you&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\n\"According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be established,\nand should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy\nprinciples;\n<\/p><p>\n\"That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the\nmoral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own\nsins in the day of judgment.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise\nmen whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of\nblood\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14326\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14326)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14326)\">D&amp;C 101:77-80<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod gave the men chosen to formulate the Constitution the inspiration of heaven to guide\nthem. It becomes, therefore, an enduring document for this nation. It is not the prerogative of\nman to change its basic and fundamental principles and concepts.\n<\/p><p>\nThe dynamic statesman, Daniel Webster, in his last public address before the New, York\nHistorical Society in 1852, said:\n<\/p><p>\nUnborn ages and visions of glory crowned upon my soul, the realization of all which,\nhowever, is in the hands good pleasure of Almighty God; but, under His divine blessing, it\nwill be dependent on the character and the virtues of ourselves, and of our posterity.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And let me say, gentlemen, that if we and our posterity shall be true to the Christian\nreligion&mdash;if we and they shall live always in the fear of God, and shall respect His\ncommandments&mdash;if we and they shall maintain just, moral sentiments, and such conscientious convictions of\nduty as shall control the heart and life&mdash;we may have the highest hopes of the future fortunes\nof our country, and if we maintain those institutions of government and that political union,\nexceeding all praise as much as it exceeds all former examples of political associations, we\nmay be sure of one thing&mdash;that, while our country furnishes materials for a thousand masters\nof historic art, it will afford no topic for a Gibbon. It will have no decline and fall. It will go\non prospering and to prosper.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But if we and our posterity reject religious instruction and authority, violate\nthe rules of eternal justice, trifle with the injunctions of morality, and recklessly destroy the\npolitical constitution which holds us together, no man can tell how sudden the catastrophe\nmay overwhelm us, that shall bury all our glory in profound obscurity.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHow applicable today are these splendid sentiments and warnings by this valiant statesman\nand patriot!\n<\/p><p>\nWhen God established the nation of Israel, he gave them the Ten Commandments, written on\ntablets of stone by his own finger. Man, through the centuries, has not altered or changed the\nTen Commandments. The Constitution of this nation was not written on tablets of stone like\nunto Israel, but wise men were raised up and inspired for the important task of writing a\nconstitution of government which guaranteed the God-given rights of free men.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the revelation to Joseph Smith previously quoted, he was told that the Constitution should\nbe maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles,\nthat it is not right for man to be in bondage one to another. It guarantees what God has\nalways bestowed upon his children&mdash;the rights, privileges, and honor of a free people. So\nimportant is this latter-day gentile nation established by God that he required the land to be\nredeemed by the shedding of blood. The blood of the Revolutionary patriots was freely spilled\nupon the field of battle to insure independence and to redeem the land and make it sacred to\nthose who possessed it. When the North and South became divided over state rights which\nincluded slavery, it was most important in the plan for this nation that it remain united and\nstrong. Only by so doing could the nation fulfil its destiny and God's purposes and work. The\nCivil War resulted in the death and misery of many souls, and thus for the second time the\nland was redeemed by the shedding of blood.\n<\/p><p>\nTruly, God rules in the affairs of men and nations. This nation has always been a beacon light\nto the world, exemplifying the principles of democracy, freedom, opportunity, achievement,\nand happiness. It now wields tremendous influence and power in the affairs of men and will\ncontinue to do so according to the promise of God as long as the people of the land serve the\nGod of the land who is Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Constitution made provision for an expanded nation, but the founding fathers and God\nhad no thought of changing or altering its basic principles, rules, and concepts.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Woodrow Wilson defined the Constitution of the United States as \"Not being a mere\nlawyer's document. It is,\" said he, \"a vehicle of life, and its spirit is always the spirit of the\nage. The explicitly granted powers of the Constitution are what they always were; but the\npowers drawn from it by implication have grown and multiplied beyond all expectation.\"\n<\/p><p>\nTo interpret this valued document understandingly, we need to remember the conditions and\ncircumstances which confronted the founding fathers, who, under the inspiration of the Lord,\nbrought this wonderful instrument of government into being. So important was God's will\nrespecting this nation as revealed to Joseph Smith the Prophet, that in his prayer offered at the\ndedication of the Kirtland Temple, he included this appeal to Almighty God:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Have mercy, O Lord, upon all the nations of the earth; have mercy upon the rulers of our\nland; may those principles, which were so honorably and nobly defended, namely, the\nConstitution of our land, by our fathers, be established forever\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14335\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14335)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14335)\">D&amp;C 109:54<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWith the knowledge of God's declaration that the Constitution of this land is inspired of him,\nit behooves every citizen to analyze the meaning, importance, and significance of this\nprofound document and give loyal support to its spirit and purpose. We cannot afford to\nbecome complacent, forsake vigilance, and thus lose the benefits of the Lord's promise of\nblessings upon the people of this goodly land. Also, we must see to it that the principles, the\nstandards, the ideals, the rights, the privileges, and the protection guaranteed by the\nConstitution are upheld by those who represent us in the executive,\nlegislative, and judicial branches of government.\n<\/p><p>\nA wise and understanding God had all this in mind when he gave the following revelation to\nthe Prophet Joseph Smith in August 1833:\n<\/p><p>\n\"And that law of the land which is constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in\nmaintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is justifiable before me.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my church, in befriending that law\nwhich is the constitutional law of the land;\n<\/p><p>\n\"And as pertaining to law of man, whatsoever is more or less than this, cometh of evil.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I, the Lord God, make you free, therefore ye are free indeed; and the law also maketh you\nfree.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Nevertheless, when the wicked rule the people mourn.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore, honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and good men and\nwise men ye should observe to uphold; otherwise whatsoever is less than these cometh of\nevil\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14324\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14324)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14324)\">D&amp;C 98:5-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf wickedness prevails and wicked men rule, then we will be as other nations. We will stand\nalone without the guiding influence and power of God to sustain us in time of trouble and in\nmeeting the challenge and threat of internal and external Satanic ideologies, also the evil\ndesigns and intrigues of men and nations.\n<\/p><p>\nI quote from a talk given by National Commander James E. Powers of the American Legion\nwhich appeared in the <i>American Legion<\/i> magazine of September 1963:\n<\/p><p>\n\"America's deepest roots are spiritual. This is the most important historical fact of American\nlife. To ignore it is to miss the essence of the heritage, the character, and the destiny of the\nAmerican people. Today, with international and domestic tension tightening, I believe it is\nwell that we see clearly the spiritual core of that creed . . . The American colonies and nation\nwere established in turn by men and women who acknowledged openly their reliance upon\nalmighty God.\"\n<\/p><p>\nContinued righteousness and dependence upon God therefore are the only guarantees we have\nfor the constant enjoyment of his blessings upon us, for he has warned: \". . . my law shall be\nkept on this land\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14272\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14272)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14272)\">D&amp;C 58:19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Constitution of the United States is to this gentile nation what the Ten Commandments\nwere and still are to the nation of Israel.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a strength and comfort it would be to the people of this land for God to fight for this\nnation if the need arises as he fought for Israel during their struggle to build and maintain a\nnation. However, Israel's persistence in disobedience and wickedness destroyed them as a\nnation. This fact stands as a warning to us. What happened to the nation of Israel can happen\nto this nation also if we as a people in this chosen land fail to obey the laws and the counsels\nof God. It will be profitable to all of us in the light of the promises and warnings to this\nnation to read again the biblical history of the nation of Israel. It will help us avoid the\npitfalls which befell them.\n<\/p><p>\nI earnestly pray that we shall always stand firm and steadfast and immovable in upholding\nand sustaining the Constitution of this favored land. May we also selectively and wisely\nchoose those who are equally valiant and patriotic to represent us in the top echelons of\ngovernment&mdash;men who are upright, honest, and willing to keep the commandments of God in\ntheir personal lives.\n<\/p><p>\nThese truths and considerations I bear humble witness and testimony to in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
