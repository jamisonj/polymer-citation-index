Lee<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Harold B. Lee, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1950, pp. 96-102<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nIf I might enjoy the Spirit of the Lord to direct me for a few moments this afternoon,\nI would like to talk about a subject which has been discussed in all the general conferences of\nthis Church by members of the First Presidency&mdash;in every conference, so far as I can recall.\n<\/p><p>\nBLESSINGS OF UNITY\n<\/p><p>\nI refer to the importance of unity and oneness of the Latter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I have pondered the importance of this matter, I have recalled some of the blessings we\ncould enjoy if we would be united as a people. If we would be united in paying our fast\nofferings and observing the law of the fast as fully as the Lord has taught it, and if we were\nunited in carrying out the principles of the welfare program as they have been given to us by\nour leaders today, we would be free from want and distress and would be able fully to care\nfor our own. Our failure to be united would be to allow our needy to become the pawns of\npoliticians in the public mart.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we were fully united as a people in our missionary work, we would rapidly hasten the day\nwhen the gospel would be preached to all people without and within the boundaries of the\norganized stakes of Zion. If we are not united, we will lose that which has been the lifeblood\nand which has fed and stimulated this Church for a generation.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we were fully united in keeping the law of sacrifice and paying our tithes as we have been\nschooled today, we would have sufficient to build our temples, our chapels, our schools of\nlearning. If we fail to do that, we will be in the bondage of mortgage and debt.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we were united as a people in electing honorable men to high places in our civil\ngovernment, regardless of the political party with which we have affiliation, we would be able\nto safeguard our communities and to preserve law and order among us. Our failure to be\nunited means that we permit tyranny and oppression and taxation to the extent of virtual\nconfiscation of our own property.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we are united in supporting our own official newspapers and magazines which are owned\nand operated by the Church and for Church members, there will always be in this Church a\nsure voice to the people, but if we fail to be united in giving this support, we permit ourselves\nto be subject to abuse, slander, and to misrepresentation without any adequate voice of\ndefense.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we were united in safeguarding our youth from promiscuous associations that foster\nmarriages out of the Church and out of the temples, by having socials and recreations as a\nunited people, as has been the practice from our pioneer days, we would be building all our\nLatter-day Saint homes on a sure and happy foundation. Our failure to be united in these\nthings will be our failure to receive eternal blessings that otherwise could be ours.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we were united in safeguarding the Church from false doctrines and error and in standing\nas watchmen upon the tower as teachers and leaders in watching over the Church, then we\nwould be free from these things that cause many to stumble and fall and lose their faith. If we\nare not thus united, the wolves among us will be sowing the seeds of discord, disharmony, all\ntending to the destruction of the flock.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we were united in our temple work and in our genealogical research work, we would not\nbe satisfied with the present temples only, but we would have sufficient work for temples yet\nto come, to the unlocking of the doors of opportunity to those beyond who are our own kin,\nand thus ourselves become saviors on Mount Zion. Our failure to be united will be our failure\nto perpetuate our family homes in the eternity. So we might multiply the blessings that could\ncome to this people if they were fully united in the purposes of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nMASTER'S PRAYER\n<\/p><p>\nThe importance of unity was prayed for by the Master of us all. In that last great\nprayer&mdash;you will recall it&mdash;he prayed: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast\ngiven me, that they may be one, as we are...\n<\/p><p>\nNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe  on me through\ntheir word; \n<\/p><p>\nThat they all may be one; as thou, rather, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may\nbe one in us: that the world may believe that thou  hast sent me\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27462\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27462)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27462)\">John 17:11,20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe purpose of unity in the Church has been expressed by the Lord both from a positive\nstandpoint as herein expressed, and  also in a negative way as given in a revelation at the\nbeginning of this dispensation. The positive purpose of the unity of Saints here is clearly\nsuggested: 'that the world may know.' May know what? That this is the Church and kingdom\nof God on the earth to whom Jesus, the Christ, was sent.\n<\/p><p>\n\"YE ARE NOT MINE\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn the command which he gave in this dispensation, the Master again expressed this same\nthought from a negative view,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . be one; and if ye are not one, ye are not mine\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12783\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12783)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12783)\">D&amp;C 38:27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf we are not united, we are not his. Here unity is the test of divine ownership as thus\nexpressed. If we would be united in love and fellowship and harmony, this\nChurch would convert the world, who would see in us the shining example of these qualities\nwhich evidence that divine ownership. Likewise, if in that Latter-day Saint home the husband\nand wife are in disharmony, bickering, and divorce is threatened, there is an evidence that one\nor both are not keeping the commandments of God.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we, in our wards and our branches, are divided, and there are factions not in harmony, it is\nbut an evidence that there is something wrong. If two persons are at variance, arguing on\ndifferent points of doctrine, no reasonable, thinking persons would say that both were\nspeaking their different opinions by the Spirit of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the writings of the Apostle Paul to the Ephesian saints, after describing the nature of the\nChurch as it was organized in his day he said this organization was given for the purpose of\nthe \"perfecting of the saints . . . till we all come in the unity of the faith\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21646\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21646)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21646)\">Eph. 4:12-13<\/a><\/span>). When men receive\nthe Spirit of God by living righteously, truth and error begin to disappear.\n<\/p><p>\nCOMMAND TO BE ONE\n<\/p><p>\nOne of our early Church leaders nearly a hundred years ago made an expression with\nreference to this important subject in these words; \n<\/p><p>\nThe command to \"Be one\" embraces all other commands. There is no law, statute,\nordinance, covenant nor blessing, but what was instituted to make the Saints one. This\nis the ultimate end and aim of the great plan of salvation. For this, Jesus suffered and\ndied; for this, his servants have toiled and labored day and night in our fallen world;\nfor this, all the powers of heaven will be exerted, until Satan shall be overcome, and\nthe Earth be redeemed, and all the glorified inhabitants thereof become one. (The Seer,\np. 289, 1854.)\n<\/p><p>\nIf it is so important, then, that this people be a united people, we might well expect that upon\nthis principle the powers of Satan would descend for their greatest attack. We might well\nexpect, also, that if there be those of apostate mind among us, they would be Inclined to\nridicule and to scorn this principle of oneness and unity as being narrow-minded or as being\nunprogressive. We would likewise expect that those who are enemies would also seek to fight\nagainst that principle.\n<\/p><p>\nThere were handed to me recently some arguments which were presented before a\ncongressional committee in Washington, D. C. in 1888, by a former mayor of Salt Lake City,\nin which he said this about this same matter. \"The theocratic tenet of the Mormon Church is a\ngreat evil, and opposed to our American institutions. What is a theocracy?\" (Then he gave\nhis own definition.) \"It is government by the priesthood through a direct authority from\nGod... The thing I wish to accomplish is to pass laws which will strike at the foundation of\nthe theocratic system.\" To put his words plainly, the thing he wished to\nstrike at was the unity of the Latter-day Saints, who believe in a government through a direct\nrevelation from God through his appointed agents.\n<\/p><p>\nPLAN FOR UNITY\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has given a plan, a three-fold plan, by which this unity might be fully realized.\nUnity centers in heaven, even as the Master prayed, \"Father, that we might be one\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27463\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27463)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27463)\">John 17:22<\/a><\/span>). The\nSaints might become one with the Father and the Son, spiritually begotten by baptism and\nthrough the Holy Ghost even unto the renewing of their bodies\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12809\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12809)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12809)\">D&amp;C 84:33<\/a><\/span>) as the Lord tells us, and thus\n\". . . become the sons of Moses and of Aaron... the church and kingdom, and the elect of\nGod\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12811\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12811)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12811)\">D&amp;C 84:34<\/a><\/span>),\nand thus become adopted into the holy family, the Church and\nkingdom of God, the Church of the Firstborn.\n<\/p><p>\nThen, besides those ordinances by which we are adopted into that oneness with the Father\nand the Son, he has given to us principles and ordinances all intended to the perfecting of his\nSaints, that this same unity might be realized.\n<\/p><p>\nThen, finally, the Lord has given this generation another principle, that through his appointed\nAuthorities he would teach his laws and administer his ordinances, and through them he\nwould reveal his will. On the very day this Church was organized, he made this principle\nclear to the Saints when he said,\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and\ncommandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all\nholiness before me; \n<\/p><p>\nFor his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.\n<\/p><p>\nFor by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the\nLord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens\nto shake for your good, and his name's glory\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12779\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12779)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12779)\">D&amp;C 21:4-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAbout a year later the Lord expressed that same thing in these words,\n<\/p><p>\nWhat I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself . . . whether by\nmine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12764\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12764)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12764)\">D&amp;C 1:38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat is a bold doctrine, those who are not members of the Church and those who are\nmembers of the Church who have no faith may think, but I would remind all such that it is\nalso a bold doctrine when we declare that this is the Church of Jesus Christ, the only true\nChurch upon the earth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12761\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12761)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12761)\">D&amp;C 1:30<\/a><\/span>).\nThis could not be the Church of Jesus Christ except for that other\ndefined principle of revelation through the prophets of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nTEST OF UNITY\n<\/p><p>\nMay I test your unity as Latter day Saints? Have you received a witness of the Spirit to your\nsouls testifying that this is the truth; that you know this is the Church and\nkingdom of God; that you have received by baptism and by the laying on of hands the power\nof the Holy Ghost by which that unity of testimony might be accomplished? Have you that\ntestimony in your souls?\n<\/p><p>\nMay I ask you another question? Are you living each day so to improve your lives by living\nthe principles and ordinances of the gospel that you are moving toward that day when you\nwill overcome all things?\n<\/p><p>\nFinally, do you believe that these men whom we have sustained in this conference are the\nmen through whom the channels of communication from our Heavenly Father are open? Do\nyou believe&mdash;as Enos, the grandson of the great prophet Lehi, declared in his writing when\nhe said he went into the mountain and prayed and \". . . the voice of the Lord came into my\nmind, again saying\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21476\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21476)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21476)\">Enos 1:10<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;do\nyou believe that the voice of the Lord comes into the\nminds of these men? If you do, then you believe what the Lord said that\n<\/p><p>\nWhatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture,\nshall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the\nLord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12801\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12801)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12801)\">D&amp;C 68:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nCOUNSEL IN TEMPORAL AFFAIRS\n<\/p><p>\nSome there are who are prone to say, \"We will follow their counsel in spiritual matters but\nnot in temporal affairs. If they counsel us in other than that which pertains strictly to the\nspiritual welfare of the people, we will not follow them.\" Have any of you ever heard such\ncomments?\n<\/p><p>\nBrigham Young tells us that this subject had been discussed early in the history of this\nChurch, and there were some, even the early bishops of the Church, who held out that the\nProphet Joseph Smith should not direct them in temporal affairs. He said,\n<\/p><p>\nIn all ages of the world that we have any knowledge of, when there was a people on\nthe earth whom God acknowledged as his people, he has invariably dictated them in\nspiritual and in temporal things. This question was agitated year after year in the days\nof Joseph. The first two bishops in the Church&mdash;Edward Partridge was the first, I was\nwell acquainted with him, and Newel K. Whitney was the second&mdash;questioned the\npropriety of Joseph having anything to do with temporal things. Joseph would argue\nthe case with them a little, and tell them how things were, and bring up scripture to\nshow them that it could not be otherwise&mdash;that it was impossible for the Lord to\ndictate people unless he dictated them in temporal affairs...\n<\/p><p>\nThere were Wm. E. McLellin, John F. Boynton, and Lyman Johnson, who belonged to\nthe Twelve; Frederick G. Williams. second counselor to Joseph, and two-thirds of the\nHigh Council, all talking about this and I went to the Temple and just challenged them\nto show wherein the Lord ever conferred upon any man in the world the power to\ndictate in spiritual affairs, that he did not in temporal affairs? They could not do it\n(<i>Journal of Discourses<\/i>, Vol. 18, p. 242-243).\n<\/p><p>\nLOYALTY TO LEADERSHIP\n<\/p><p>\nAs I have labored among the brethren here and have studied the history of past dispensations,\nI have become aware that the Lord has given tests all down through time as to this matter of\nloyalty to the leadership of the Church. I go back into the scriptures and follow along in such\nstories as David's loyalty when the king was trying to take his life. He wouldn't defile the\nanointed of the Lord even when he could have taken his life. I have listened to the classic\nstories in this dispensation about how Brigham Young was tested, how Heber C. Kimball was\ntested, John Taylor and Willard Richards in Carthage Jail, Zion's Camp that received a great\ntest, and from that number were chosen the first General Authorities in this dispensation.\nThere were others who didn't pass the test of loyalty, and they fell from their places.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been in a position since I came into the Council of the Twelve to observe some things\namong my brethren, and I want to say to you: Every man my junior in the Council of the\nTwelve, I have seen submitted as though by Providence, to these same tests of loyalty, and I\nwondered sometimes whether they were going to pass the tests. The reason they are here\ntoday is because they did, and our Father has honored them.\n<\/p><p>\nI have that same witness about at least two members of the assistants to the Twelve, Brother\nMarion G. Romney and Brother Alma Sonne, for I saw it, and I know the nature of the test,\nand I know how they proved themselves to be the sterling men that they are. And so God has\nhonored them, and it is my conviction that every man who will be called to a high place in\nthis Church will have to pass these tests not devised by human hands, by which our Father\nnumbers them as a united group of leaders willing to follow the prophets of the Living God\nand be loyal and true as witnesses and exemplars of the truths they teach.\n<\/p><p>\nBRIGHAM YOUNG'S LOYALTY\n<\/p><p>\nBrigham Young in his day was invited into a group of some of those who were trying to\nargue against that principle of unity. After he learned that they were trying to \"depose\" as\nthey said, the Prophet Joseph Smith, he stood before them and said something like this: \"You\ncannot destroy the appointment of a prophet of God, but you can cut the thread which binds\nyou to a prophet of God and sink yourselves to hell.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt was that kind of fearlessness which was manifest in him that made him the peerless leader\nhe was to become. It is that same kind of courage, though not always popular, but the kind\nthat has been demanded of every man whom our Father would honor with high places of\nleadership.\n<\/p><p>\nI heard President Smith, and you heard him, four years ago from this stand, after there had\nbeen some scurrilous articles written about the Prophet Joseph Smith. He\nsaid this, and to me it was the ringing voice of a prophet speaking.\n<\/p><p>\nMany have belittled Joseph Smith, but those who have will be forgotten in the remains\nof Mother Earth, and the odor of that infamy will ever be with them; but honor,\nmajesty, and fidelity to God exemplified by Joseph Smith and attached to his name\nwill never die. (April Conference 1946.)\n<\/p><p>\nI paraphrase those words today and make them meaningful to us: \"Many there are today\namong us who would belittle George Albert Smith, and J. Reuben Clark, Jr., and David O.\nMcKay, but those who do will be forgotten in the remains of Mother Earth, and the odor of\ntheir infamy will ever remain with them: but honor majesty, and fidelity to God exemplified\nby the First Presidency and attached to their names will never die.\"\n<\/p><p>\nGod grant us the strength of living to be united with the Saints, to live the principles of the\ngospel, to listen to these men as the leaders among us directed by our Heavenly Father, all to\nthe end that his full blessings might be upon his Church, I pray humbly, in the name of the\nLord, Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
