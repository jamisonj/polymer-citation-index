If man has grown\n  to wisdom and is capable of discerning the propriety of laws to govern nations, what less can be\n  expected from the Ruler and Upholder of the universe? Can we suppose that He has a kingdom\n  without laws?<span class=\"footRef\">4<\/span> Or do we believe that it is composed of an innumerable company of beings who are\n  entirely beyond all law? Consequently have need of nothing to govern or regulate them? Would not\n  such ideas be a reproach to our Great Parent, and at variance with His glorious intelligence? Would\n  it not be asserting that man had found out a secret beyond Deity? That he had learned that it was\n  good to have laws, while God after existing from eternity and having power to create man, had not\n  found out that it was proper to have laws for His government? We admit that God is the great source\n  and fountain from whence proceeds all good;<span class=\"footRef\">5<\/span> that He is perfect intelligence, and that His wisdom\n  is alone sufficient to govern and regulate the mighty creations and worlds which shine and blaze\n  with such magnificence and splendor over our heads, as though touched with His finger and moved\n  by His Almighty word.<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> And if so, it is done and regulated by law; for without law all must certainly\n  fall into chaos. If, then, we admit that God is the source of all wisdom and understanding,<span class=\"footRef\">7<\/span> we must\n  admit that by His direct inspiration He has taught man that law is necessary in order to govern and\n  regulate His own immediate interest and welfare; for this reason, that law is beneficial to promote\n  peace and happiness among men. And as before remarked, God is the source from whence proceeds\n  all good; and if man is benefited by law, then certainly, law is good; and if law is good, then law,\n  or the principle of it emanated from God; for God is the source of all good;<span class=\"footRef\">8<\/span><\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110093\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110093)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110093)\">Titus 1:2<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"114147\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 114147)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(114147)\">D&amp;C 62:6<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">2. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107835\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107835)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107835)\">Matt. 5:18<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">3. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"111796\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 111796)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(111796)\">Alma 5:28<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"111915\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 111915)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(111915)\">Alma 12:24<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112154\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112154)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112154)\">Alma 34:32<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">4. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"114837\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 114837)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(114837)\">D&amp;C 88:36<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">5. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112879\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112879)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112879)\">Ether 8:26<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112900\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112900)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112900)\">Ether 12:28<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">6. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"111031\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 111031)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(111031)\">1 Ne. 17:46<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">7. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"106196\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 106196)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(106196)\">Ex. 31:3<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"106431\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 106431)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(106431)\">1 Kgs. 4:29<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107506\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107506)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107506)\">Dan. 1:17<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112057\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112057)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112057)\">Alma 26:35<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">8. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112951\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112951)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112951)\">Moro. 7:12,24<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
