As the Only Begotten Son of God and the only sinless person to live on this earth, he made a perfect atonement for all mankind. It applies to everyone unconditionally as it pertains to the resurrection from temporal, or physical, death, for all shall rise from the dead with immortal bodies as a result of the Atonement. However, the Atonement is conditional as it pertains to each person\u2019s individual sins. It touches everyone to the degree that he or she has faith in Jesus Christ, repents, and obeys the gospel. Exaltation and eternal life with God are reserved for those who keep the commandments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p11\" class=\"\">Mortality, then, is the time to test our ability to understand our Heavenly Father\u2019s plan and, of course, our willingness to be obedient. Obedience is essential to obtain exaltation and eternal life. King Benjamin explained that \u201cthe Lord God hath sent his holy prophets among all the children of men, to declare these things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe [in] Christ, \u2026 the same might receive remission of their sins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40924\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40924)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40924)\">Mosiah 3:13<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p12\" class=\"\">He also taught his people: \u201cConsider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God.

Sometimes I wonder if we really appreciate what that means and how it should affect our lives. We must give adequate attention to the doctrines of happiness\u2014real happiness, infinite and eternal. They should be the objective of everything we teach in the Church and of everything we do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p14\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph Smith said, \u201cWe cannot keep all the commandments without first knowing them, and we cannot expect to know all, or more than we now know unless we comply with or keep those we have already received\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> p. 256).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p15\" class=\"\">We must understand the basic doctrines and receive the saving ordinances that are essential for our eternal exaltation and happiness.

But even though our present long-range view of eternity is limited, the Lord has not left us without direction. He has provided scriptures and Apostles and prophets through whom he has revealed his plan for our exaltation and eternal life. And we have the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, to guide us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p16\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that \u201cin obedience there is joy and peace unspotted, unalloyed; and as God has designed our happiness \u2026 he never has\u2014He never will institute an ordinance or give a commandment to His people that is not calculated in its nature to promote that happiness which He has designed, and which will not end in the greatest amount of good and glory to those who become the recipients of his law and ordinances\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> pp. 256\u201357).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p17\" class=\"\">Critical to our knowledge of the plan of happiness is an understanding of the great governing principle of agency. A person does not have to spend much time in the schoolroom of mortality to realize that Heavenly Father\u2019s plan does not provide for blissful happiness at every step along our mortal journey. Life is filled with harsh realities that tug at the heart and tear away at the soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p18\" class=\"\">One cannot look at suffering, regardless of its causes or origins, without feeling pain and compassion. I can understand why someone who lacks an eternal perspective might see the horrifying news footage of starving children and man\u2019s inhumanity to man and shake a fist at the heavens and cry, \u201cIf there is a God, how could he allow such things to happen?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p19\" class=\"\">The answer is not easy, but it isn\u2019t that complicated, either. God has put his plan in motion. It proceeds through natural laws that are, in fact, God\u2019s laws. Since they are his, he is bound by them, as are we. I recognize for purposes we mortals may not understand, the Lord can control the elements. For the most part, however, he does not cause but he allows nature to run its course. In this imperfect world, bad things sometimes happen. The earth\u2019s rocky underpinnings occasionally shift and move, resulting in earthquakes. Certain weather patterns cause hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and drought.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p20\" class=\"\">Much adversity is man-made. Men\u2019s hearts turn cold, and the spirit of Satan controls their actions. In foreseeing the day of suffering in our time, the Savior said, \u201cThe love of men shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20307\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20307)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20307)\">D&amp;C 45:27<\/a><\/span>). Violence, immorality, and other evils run rampant on the earth. Much adversity has its origin in the principle of agency.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p21\" class=\"\">We tend to think of agency as a personal matter. If we ask someone to define \u201cmoral agency,\u201d the answer will probably be something like this: \u201cMoral agency means I am free to make choices for myself.\u201d Often overlooked is the fact that choices have consequences; we forget also that agency offers the same privilege of choice to others. At times we will be affected adversely by the way other people choose to exercise their agency. Our Heavenly Father feels so strongly about protecting our agency that he allows his children to exercise it, either for good or for evil.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p22\" class=\"\">The plan of happiness is available to all of his children. If the world would embrace and live it, peace, joy, and plenty would abound on the earth. Much of the suffering we know today would be eliminated if people throughout the world would understand and live the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p23\" class=\"\">We mortals have a limited view of life from the eternal perspective. But if we know and understand Heavenly Father\u2019s plan, we realize that dealing with adversity is one of the chief ways we are tested. Our faith in our Heavenly Father and his beloved Son, Jesus Christ, is the source of inner strength. Through faith we can find peace, comfort, and the courage to endure. As we trust in God and his plan for our happiness with all our hearts and lean not unto our own understanding (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"41647\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41647)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41647)\">Prov. 3:5<\/a><\/span>), hope is born. Hope grows out of faith and gives meaning and purpose to all we do. It can give us comfort in the face of adversity, strength in times of trial, and peace when we have reason for doubt or anguish.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p24\" class=\"\">By focusing on and living the principles of Heavenly Father\u2019s plan for our eternal happiness, we can separate ourselves from the wickedness of the world. If we are anchored to the correct understanding of who we are, why we are here on this earth, and where we can go after this mortal life, Satan cannot threaten our happiness through any form of temptation. If we are determined to live by Heavenly Father\u2019s plan, we will use our God-given moral agency to make decisions based on revealed truth, not on the opinions of others or on the current thinking of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p25\" class=\"\">For example, we are moving into an era when the Information Superhighway will have the capacity to cut a wide path right into our homes. With fiber-optic computer technology, it can link homes to an incredible assortment of messages and influences. This highway will be the conduit of information that will have the power to change our culture and, thus, our very lives. As we consider the importance of nourishing our intellects with the promising potential of Superhighway resources, we must be ever cautious about the choices of programs and the impact of media in our lives. Those who understand our Heavenly Father\u2019s eternal plan for the joy and happiness of his children will be better prepared to make good choices as the Information Superhighway rolls across the world. The computer, television, satellite, microchip, and even the telephone, all can bless and enhance our lives\u2014or can make them miserable.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p26\" class=\"\">This is why making life\u2019s decisions based on our Heavenly Father\u2019s plan is so important. If we truly believe that we are his children and are here on earth to learn to live, by faith, the teachings and the commandments of God and his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, we will make the choices that will qualify us to one day return to live in their presence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/answers-to-lifes-questions.p27\" class=\"\">Understanding the gospel of Jesus Christ and following him as our Savior and our Redeemer will influence every aspect of our lives, including all of our individual choices. Those who live according to Heavenly Father\u2019s eternal plan will not want to absorb any information that is illicit or untoward, nor will they destroy their spiritual sensitivity through immoral acts or the consumption of any harmful substances. Neither will they search for doctrinal loopholes to find reasons to challenge the ordained leadership of the Church nor tamper with the simple truths of the gospel. They will not attempt to justify any lifestyle that is contrary to the plan of happiness. If they do any of these things, they will never find the inner peace and joy that living the gospel brings. All of our Father\u2019s children can seek prayerfully to know who they are and can find real happiness if they obey God\u2019s commandments and endure to the end. President Howard W.
