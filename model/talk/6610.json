I had made that walk many times, but that evening we suddenly found ourselves engulfed by an enormous mob of drunken parade-goers. It was no place for four teenage girls, or their aunt, I might add. But with the streets closed to traffic, we had no choice but to keep walking. Over the din, I shouted to the girls, \u201cStay right with me.\u201d As we maneuvered through the crush of humanity, the only thing on my mind was my nieces\u2019 safety.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/are-we-not-all-mothers.p6\" class=\"\">Thankfully, we finally made it to the chapel.
