James R. Clark, 6 vols., Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965\u201375, 3:54.) We should not, according to the scriptures, need to be commanded in all things.

It will bring an inevitable reduction in programs. That was intended.

Saturday activities can be scheduled to allow our youth to have their activities but on occasion to be home on some Saturdays to be taught how to work, to help, to learn to find recreation in the family setting.

Can you not see them being less firm in pressing their children to attend Church activities when they really can\u2019t afford the costs? When we press them too hard, we infer that they aren\u2019t good enough providers. If you understand the human ego at all, you will know parents will withdraw from activity rather than say they can\u2019t afford the cost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/teach-them-correct-principles.p43\" class=\"\">Can you see a seventeen-year-old boy overhearing his mother on the phone saying: \u201cYes, yes, I know.
