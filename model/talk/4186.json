Frequently, one can view the grandeur of majestic mountains and the mesmerizing surf of the sea all in a single drive. However, when the traffic is heavy, the mountains and seas are set aside, and concentration is focused on the car ahead. Such was the occasion when I read with keen interest the words of a bumper sticker readily visible on the highly polished chrome bumper of a car which was weaving in and out of the traffic stream. The words were these: \u201cHonk if you love Jesus.\u201d No one honked. Perhaps each was disturbed by the thoughtless and rude actions of the offending driver. Then, again, would honking be an appropriate manner in which to show one\u2019s love for the Son of God, the Savior of the world, the Redeemer of all mankind?

The temple provides the ultimate\u2014even the eternal\u2014blessings of a loving Heavenly Father to His faithful Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/those-who-love-jesus.p49\" class=\"\">Ten years ago, on a Sunday morning, April 27, 1975, I stood on an outcropping of rock situated between the cities of Dresden and Meissen, high above the Elbe River. I responded to the promptings of the Holy Spirit and offered a prayer of dedication on that land and its people. That prayer noted the faith of the members. It emphasized the tender feelings of many hearts filled with an overwhelming desire to obtain temple blessings. A plea for peace was expressed. Divine help was requested. I voiced the words, \u201cDear Father, let this be the beginning of a new day for the members of Thy church in this land.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/those-who-love-jesus.p50\" class=\"\">Suddenly, from far below in the valley, a bell in a church steeple began to chime and the shrill crow of a rooster broke the morning silence, each heralding the commencement of a new day. Though my eyes were closed, I felt a warmth from the sun\u2019s rays reaching my face, my hands, my arms. How could this be? An incessant rain had been falling all morning. At the conclusion of the prayer, I gazed heavenward. I noted a ray of sunshine which penetrated an opening in the heavy clouds, a ray which engulfed the spot where our small group stood. From that moment I knew divine help was at hand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/those-who-love-jesus.p51\" class=\"\">Full cooperation of government officials was forthcoming. President Spencer W. Kimball and his counselors provided enthusiastic approval. A temple was planned, a site selected, ground-breaking services held, and construction commenced. At the time of dedication, the attention of the international press was focused on this temple in its unusual setting. Words like \u201cHow?\u201d and \u201cWhy?\u201d were voiced frequently. This was particularly in evidence during the public open house, when 89,872 persons visited the temple. At times the waiting period stretched to three hours, occasionally in the rain. None wavered. All were shown God\u2019s house.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/those-who-love-jesus.p52\" class=\"\">During the actual dedicatory services when President Gordon B.

To understand <span class=\"emphasis\">how,<\/span> to comprehend <span class=\"emphasis\">why,<\/span> it is necessary to know the faith, the devotion, the love of the members of the Church in that nation. Though fewer than five thousand in number, the activity levels exceed those found anywhere else in the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/those-who-love-jesus.p53\" class=\"\">During the many years I have served on assignment in that area, I have noted the absence of spacious chapels with multiple teaching stations and grounds featuring the greenery of lawns and the blossoms of flowers. The meetinghouse libraries, as well as the personal libraries of our members, consist only of the standard works, a hymnbook, and one or two other volumes. These books do not remain on bookcase shelves. Their teachings are engraved on the hearts of members. They are displayed in their daily lives. Service is a privilege. A branch president, forty-two years of age, has served in his calling for twenty-one years\u2014half his life. Never a complaint\u2014just gratitude. In Leipzig, when the meetinghouse furnace failed one cold winter day, the meetings were not dismissed. Rather, the members met in the chill of the unheated building, sitting shoulder to shoulder, wearing their coats, singing the hymns of Zion and worshiping Him who counseled, \u201cBe not weary in well doing,\u201d \u201cFollow me,\u201d \u201cBe thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5058\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5058)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5058)\">2 Thes. 3:13<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"37040\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37040)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37040)\">Matt. 4:19<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18358\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18358)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18358)\">D&amp;C 112:10<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/those-who-love-jesus.p54\" class=\"\">The Apostle Paul taught the Corinthians, \u201cIf any man love God, the same is known of him.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"750\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 750)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(750)\">1 Cor. 8:3<\/a><\/span>.)
