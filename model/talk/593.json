Christiansen, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1952, pp. 120-122<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nWith you, my brothers and sisters, I take great joy in sustaining, in a real sense, these valiant\nservants of the Lord who have proven themselves so well in the past. I sustain them in their\nnew positions with all my heart.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter three days and two evenings of hearing the inspiring remarks of the brethren who have\naddressed us, I can assure you that the only comfort one gets at this stage is the comfort that\ncomes from knowing that that which he thought to say has been more adequately expressed\nthan he could have given it. That is my situation.\n<\/p><p>\nI think we have had a most wonderful conference in that there have been sobriety, seriousness\nof purpose, earnestness of feeling, and it seems to me, a desire on the part of everyone to\naccept that which has been given us. The words that were given to one of the characters by\nWilliam Shakespeare seem to express my feeling: \n<\/p><p>\nO God, who lends me life, lend me a soul replete with thankfulness.\n<\/p><p>\nI hope, my brothers and sisters, that we can go from here, each of us, with \"a soul replete\nwith thankfulness\" for the abundance of blessings which are ours; for the truth which we\nhave; for the authority to act in the name of the Lord and to officiate in his name, and\nthereby bring salvation not alone to ourselves but to our loved ones and to all those who will\nheed the call.\n<\/p><p>\nWe should be thankful, as I am sure we all are, for these inspired men who lead and direct us\nin such a splendid way.\n<\/p><p>\nIf I could condense into a few words the general theme of this conference, it would be\nsomething like this: Forsake the vain practices of the world and serve the God of the land,\nwho is Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, if we can go from here heeding that general thought, this conference will have produced\nmuch. I have often wondered why Latter-day Saints should need to be constantly admonished\nwhen we can declare in testimony and in truth that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, that\nJoseph Smith was an instrument in his hands in restoring the gospel. I have very often\nthought that that should be sufficient for any of us and like Adam, as President Clark\nmentioned this morning, to know what our Father desires should be sufficient.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd as with Adam, so with Abraham&mdash;no matter how great the sacrifice, he did not\nequivocate. He did not hesitate. He did not ask questions. I hope, my brothers and sisters, that\nwe can approach this in our faith and our determination to serve the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are, however, exposed to the philosophies and the practices of the world, and sometimes\nbecome intrigued with certain innovations which many people would have us think are the\nthings to do. Therefore, we need to be reminded from time to time of the things which really\ncount, to put first things first, to love the Lord with all our hearts and with all our might and\nwith all our strength.\n<\/p><p>\nWe Latter-day Saints need not subscribe to those practices which are around us, of which we\nhave been warned in this conference. We need not minimize the religious standards and ideals\nwhich have been set up for us to heed and to follow. We need not be \"lovers of pleasure\nmore than lovers of God,\" as Paul has said that many in the world would be in these last\ndays (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5114\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5114)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5114)\">2 Tim. 3:4<\/a><\/span>).\nWe need not and should not be \"high-minded\" nor self-sufficient, but as\ntrue Latter-day Saints we should walk humbly before the Lord and remember that he is our\nGod.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we can be humble and submissive gentle and easily entreated, we will grow in strength and\nin stature and be able to meet the vicissitudes of life, and to withstand the \". . . evils and\ndesigns which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13019\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13019)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13019)\">D&amp;C 89:4<\/a><\/span>), as we have been urged to do.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is an old Spanish proverb which says,\n<\/p><p>\nHe that loseth wealth, loseth much. He that loseth friends, loseth more. But he that\nloseth spirituality, loseth all.\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems to me that there is a depression on spiritual things. We are in a worldwide \"spiritual\ndepression.\" As I go about and observe the conduct of many men and women, this seems all\nthe more convincing. And we are told\n<\/p><p>\n. . . the whole world lieth in sin, and groaneth under darkness and under the bondage\nof sin.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd by this you may know they are under the bondage of sin, because they come not\nunto me.\n<\/p><p>\nFor whoso cometh not unto me is under the bondage of sin.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd whoso receiveth not my voice is not acquainted with my voice, and is not of me\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13004\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13004)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13004)\">D&amp;C 84:49-52<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat was given to the Church in 1832. I doubt that the world has improved much since then.\nMaybe we have learned a lot more devilment in the intervening time. I am not sure, but it\nwould appear that way.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, my brothers and sisters, through these days of confusion and of doubt where can we\nfind security? On what foundation can we safely build?\n<\/p><p>\nSpeaking of the conditions that would exist in these days, a revelation through the Prophet\nJoseph Smith gave us this assurance: \n<\/p><p>\nFor they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for\ntheir guide, and have not been deceived&mdash;verily I say unto you, they shall not be\nhewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the earth shall be given unto them for an inheritance; and they shall multiply and wax\nstrong, and their children shall grow up without sin unto salvation.\n<\/p><p>\nFor the Lord shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will be their\nking and their lawgiver (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12979\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12979)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12979)\">D&amp;C 45:57-59<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHow marvelous it is, my brothers and sisters, to contemplate such a blessing. It is ours if we\nwill just heed the requirements for it. I very often turn to the scriptures when I speak to these\nyoung people, or did do in the temple, in an effort to get them to hold to the course which is\ngood for them, giving them this admonition in the words of Helaman: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer,\nwho is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil\nshall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his\nhail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag\nyou down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye\nare built, which is a sure foundation a foundation whereon if men build they cannot\nfall (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24678\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24678)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24678)\">Hel. 5:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI commend that to the Latter-day Saints, and to the young people particularly, who are\nmaking a struggle to establish themselves in their homes and in their lives as husbands and\nwives and fathers and mothers, to build upon that sure foundation, for if they do, they cannot\nfall, and they will not be deceived by the practices of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nI sustain the brethren with all my heart. I know that this is the work of the Lord. This is not\njust another Church. This is the Church of Jesus Christ, and he heads it and directs it through\nthese instruments, these holy men in his hands.\n<\/p><p>\nI testify to this, and pledge my allegiance to it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
