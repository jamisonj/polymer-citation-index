Please know how I love Relief Society. I know the love and peace and unity that it brings into the lives of women of this church. Relief Society has been a source of strength in my life, it has helped me raise my family, it has been at the heart of my closest friendships, it has prompted me to learn and grow in the gospel.

You at this hour of need have been called \u2026 to direct the organization which can provide that ameliorating influence, that balm of Gilead [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26602\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26602)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26602)\">Jer. 8:22<\/a><\/span>] to unite all sisters in the Church.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/relief-society-a-balm-in-gilead.p7\" class=\"\">Tonight I want to talk about President Monson\u2019s counsel.

Her husband, who also was leaving for an evening of meetings, detained their three-year-old son, who was determined to accompany his older sisters. Two other girls were arguing in the next room over which video to watch. When all the doors closed, the mother started to cry. It had been, she explained, a long week.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/relief-society-a-balm-in-gilead.p9\" class=\"\">The visiting teachers wisely gave this very busy wife and mother a chance to talk. She discussed her week and how much she was missing her recently deceased mother. The three talked and shared their understanding of the gospel and the difficulties of every day application. The visiting teachers\u2014one is single and has no children and the other is a single parent\u2014praised their sister for all she was doing to raise her family well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/relief-society-a-balm-in-gilead.p10\" class=\"\">The mother felt better. The visiting teachers grew closer to each other and to this dear sister. They all felt better. In the true spirit of Relief Society, these visiting teachers strengthened this sister and her home. I feel better. Why? Because this story witnesses what I know\u2014that Relief Society is indeed a balm that unites us, that helps us in our families. Sisters, I testify to you that one of our most important roles as Relief Society members is to strengthen each other, so all of us are better able to help our families. We come together. We learn from each other. We go home and strengthen our families.

For many in the world this is a time of confusion, mixed signals, scrambled priorities. There will always be problems and pressing issues to draw our attention from the work of the Lord. Remember, Relief Society is the Lord\u2019s organization for women. It is much more than a class we attend on Sunday. Service in Relief Society magnifies every sister.

She went into the kitchen of one home sloshing through mud above her ankles, and opened a cupboard. Inside was coiled a water moccasin snake. She quickly shut the door and tried another cupboard where she was eye-to-eye with yet another snake. In consternation she ran up the stairs to the second floor where she met up with an alligator.

It may be catching someone\u2019s eye, lifting a child for a drink from a fountain, sending a note in the mail, reading the scriptures with someone. Or it may be visiting someone you\u2019ve missed at meetings, someone you hear mentioned in your heart by the still, small voice. These little actions inspire us; they take the edges off our problems.

I realize now that they were one of the constants in my life. My dear father had an unwavering testimony, and at age eighty-eight he gave me his final priesthood blessing. Our grandparents lived just next door, something that doesn\u2019t happen much anymore. My grandfather served as the stake patriarch, and I served as his transcriber.

Homes offer not only physical shelter but a feeling of security, a sense of belonging, a closeness with other family members. Families live in homes.

Families provide a learning environment, a schoolroom from which we never graduate but can always learn. In our families we learn to appreciate the spiritual peace that comes from applying the principles of charity, of patience, sharing, integrity, kindness, generosity, self-control, and service. These are more than family values, sisters; these are the Lord\u2019s way of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/relief-society-a-balm-in-gilead.p41\" class=\"\">The purpose of the Relief Society organization of the Church, stated in our handbook, is to help women and their families come unto Christ.

All forms of the media comment on the fragmentation or even the demise of the family. Economic pressures force families to make difficult choices. We\u2019re pulled in myriad directions, and yet we must hold gospel principles firmly in place. Our efforts may seem unnoticed and unappreciated, but sisters, they are worth it. Families are the framework of our lives here and in the eternities. That families are sealed together indicates their central purpose in the Lord\u2019s plan. And women have a key role in the family. We set the tone in our homes; we set the pattern for daily living; we set the standards for how people are treated; we are teacher, counselor, confidante, advocate, supporter, and companion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/relief-society-a-balm-in-gilead.p43\" class=\"\">We have a long and significant track record in Relief Society for putting families first.
