Our bishopric stressed the sacred responsibility which was ours to pass the sacrament. Emphasized were proper dress, a dignified bearing, and the importance of being clean inside and out. As we were taught the procedure in passing the sacrament, we were told how we should assist Louis McDonald, a particular brother in our ward who was afflicted with a palsied condition, that he might have the opportunity to partake of the sacred emblems.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p7\" class=\"\">How I remember being assigned to pass the sacrament to the row where Brother McDonald sat. I was fearful and hesitant as I approached this wonderful brother, and then I saw his smile and the eager expression of gratitude that showed his desire to partake. Holding the tray in my left hand, I took a small piece of bread and pressed it to his lips. The water was later served in the same way. I felt I was on holy ground. And indeed I was. The privilege to pass the sacrament to Brother McDonald made better deacons of us all.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p8\" class=\"\">Just two months ago, on Sunday, July 31, I was at Fort A.

Approximately 180 deacons then passed the sacrament. Within the time it would take to handle the passing of the sacrament in a crowded ward chapel, this large gathering was served. What an awe-inspiring sight I witnessed that morning as these Aaronic Priesthood young men participated in this holy ordinance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p14\" class=\"\">It is important for each deacon to be guided to a spiritual awareness of the sacredness of his ordained calling. In one ward, the lesson was effectively taught pertaining to the collection of fast offerings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p15\" class=\"\">On fast day, the ward members were visited by deacons and teachers so that each family could make a contribution.

Here they saw needy children receiving new shoes and other items of clothing. Here they witnessed empty baskets being filled with groceries. There was no money exchanged. One brief comment was made: \u201cYoung men, this is what the money you collect on fast day provides\u2014even food, clothing, and shelter for those who are in need.\u201d The Aaronic Priesthood young men smiled more, stepped higher, and served more willingly in filling their assignments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p17\" class=\"\">Now, pertaining to the teachers and priests, every one of you should be given the assignment to home teach with a companion who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood.

He had been converted to the Church years before in Germany, and now, following World War II, he found himself virtually a prisoner in his own land of Hungary. How he longed for contact with the Church. Then his home teachers visited. Brother Walter Krause and his companion went from the northeastern portion of Germany all the way to Hungary to fulfill their home teaching assignment. Before they left from their homes in Germany, Brother Krause had said to his companion, \u201cWould you like to go home teaching with me this week?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p21\" class=\"\">His companion asked, \u201cWhen will we leave?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p22\" class=\"\">Brother Krause\u2019s response: \u201cTomorrow.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p23\" class=\"\">Then came the question, \u201cWhen will we come back?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p24\" class=\"\">Brother Krause did not hesitate; he said, \u201cOh, in about a week.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p25\" class=\"\">And away they went to visit Brother Denndorfer and others. Brother Denndorfer had not had home teachers since before the war. Now, when he saw the servants of the Lord, he was overwhelmed. He did not shake hands with them; rather, he went to his bedroom and took from a secret hiding place his tithing that he had saved for years. This tithing he gave to his home teachers, and then he said, \u201cNow I can shake your hands.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p26\" class=\"\">Now a word for the priests in the Aaronic Priesthood.

As the bishop, I was his quorum president. When he spoke, Robert stuttered and stammered, void of control. He was self-conscious, shy, fearful of himself and everybody else; this impediment was devastating to him. Rarely did he accept an assignment; never would he look another person in the eye; always would he gaze downward. Then one day, through a set of unusual circumstances, he accepted an assignment to perform the responsibility to baptize another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p28\" class=\"\">I sat next to Robert in the baptistry of the Salt Lake Tabernacle. I knew he needed all the help he could get. He was dressed in immaculate white, prepared for the ordinance he was to perform. I asked him how he felt. He gazed at the floor and stuttered almost uncontrollably that he felt terrible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p29\" class=\"\">We both prayed fervently that he would be made equal to his task. The clerk then said, \u201cNancy Ann McArthur will now be baptized by Robert Williams, a priest.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p30\" class=\"\">Robert left my side, stepped into the font, took little Nancy by the hand, and helped her into that water which cleanses human lives and provides a spiritual rebirth. He spoke the words, \u201cNancy Ann McArthur, having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p31\" class=\"\">And he baptized her. Not once did he stutter! Not once did he falter! A modern miracle had been witnessed. Robert then performed the baptismal ordinance for two or three other children in the same fashion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p32\" class=\"\">In the dressing room, I hurried to congratulate Robert. I expected to hear this same uninterrupted flow of speech. I was wrong. He gazed downward and stammered his reply of gratitude.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p33\" class=\"\">I testify to you that when Robert acted in the authority of the Aaronic Priesthood, he spoke with power, with conviction, and with heavenly help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p34\" class=\"\">Just over two years ago it was my privilege to speak at the funeral services for Robert Williams and to pay tribute to this faithful priesthood holder who tried his best throughout his life to honor his priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p35\" class=\"\">Some of you young men here tonight may be shy by nature or might consider yourselves inadequate to respond to a calling.

As a boy, I played team softball in elementary and junior high school. Two captains were chosen, and then they, in turn, selected the players they desired on their respective teams. Of course, the best players were chosen first, then second, and third. To be selected fourth or fifth was not too bad, but to be chosen last and relegated to a remote position in the outfield was downright awful. I know; I was there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p37\" class=\"\">How I hoped the ball would never be hit in my direction, for surely I would drop it, runners would score, and teammates would laugh.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p38\" class=\"\">As though it were just yesterday, I remember the very moment when all that changed in my life. The game started out as I have described: I was chosen last. I made my sorrowful way to the deep pocket of right field and watched as the other team filled the bases with runners. Two batters then went down on strikes. Suddenly, the next batter hit a mighty drive. I even heard him say, \u201cThis will be a home run.\u201d That was humiliating, since the ball was coming in my direction. Was it beyond my reach? I raced for the spot where I thought the ball would drop, uttered a prayer while running, and stretched forth my cupped hands. I surprised myself. I caught the ball! My team won the game.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p39\" class=\"\">This one experience bolstered my confidence, inspired my desire to practice, and led me from that last-to-be-chosen place to become a real contributor to the team.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/do-your-duty-that-is-best.p40\" class=\"\">We can experience that burst of confidence.

She told me that she noticed I often visited with others. Then she said, \u201cNo one visits me or my bedfast husband.
