Grant<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Heber J. Grant, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1945, pp. 4-10<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nIt does not seem possible that another six months have passed since we last had the privilege\nof meeting here in a general conference of the Church. Since then much has happened&mdash;in our\nown lives and in the events of the world. Since then, I have been privileged to complete my\neighty-eighth year and to live into the eighty-ninth year of my life. The Lord has blessed and\nsustained us, both Sister Grant and me, and among the richest of our blessings are our\nbrethren and sisters and our friends, whose prayers in our behalf have blessed our lives, and\nwhose thoughtfulness in many ways has made our days happier.\n<\/p><p>\nJOY IN THE INTEGRITY OF THE OFFICERS OF THE CHURCH\n<\/p><p>\nI rejoice exceedingly in the many blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ that we enjoy. I\nrejoice in having the fellowship and the faith and prayers and good feeling of those with\nwhom I associate, I rejoice in the integrity, the faith, and the diligence of those who preside\nin the various stakes of Zion. I realize that we are beset with faults and failings and\nimperfections, but I am convinced that almost without exception those who have the charge of\nthe Saints in the wards and stakes of Zion, and in the missions are men of God, and that their\nintegrity is beyond question, and that, if need be, they would be ready and willing to lay\ndown their lives for the advancement of the kingdom of God. I believe that the elders of\nIsrael in all the different wards and stakes of Zion earnestly desire to know the mind and will\nof our Heavenly Father, and that they are ready and willing to do anything that is within their\npower, to fulfill that mind and that will and to carry it out in their lives. It is this integrity\nand this desire that give me joy and satisfaction, and that encourage me in the responsibilities\nthat devolve upon me.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE PASSING OF ELDERS SAMUEL O. BENNION AND RUFUS K. HARDY\n<\/p><p>\nSince we last met, the Church has been called upon to mourn the passing of two of our\nbrethren of the General Authorities, Brothers Samuel O. Bennion and Rufus\nK. Hardy, both of the First Council of the Seventy. I honored them and loved them. They\nwere true men of God, and rendered great service in the Lord's latter-day work. We miss\nthem and shall continue to miss them in the presiding councils of the Church&mdash;but their place\nin our Father's kingdom is assured. They were valiant preachers of righteousness and will\nreceive the blessings of the valiant and of the righteous. May God our Father give his peace\nand comfort to their devoted wives, Sister Hardy and Sister Bennion, and to their families.\n<\/p><p>\nCONCERNING TITHING AND OTHER PRINCIPLES\n<\/p><p>\nI rejoice in the increased tithes and offerings of this people, and in the increased numbers who\nare fulfilling their financial obligations to the Lord, and I hope and pray that this principle\nand all the other principles of the gospel are being taught our children in our homes, and in\nour Church organizations.\n<\/p><p>\nIt should be the pride of every bishop and of every bishop's counselor, and of the president of\nevery stake and his counselors, and of every officer and teacher, and of every member of this\nChurch, young and old, that they earnestly and conscientiously pay their tithing. We are\ncapable of accomplishing this if we will only think so and labor to that end.\n<\/p><p>\nI realize and appreciate the fact that the Lord could pour out upon us an abundance of the\nwealth of this world, that he could make us all rich, because the mountains are full of wealth,\nand he could open up avenues to us that we could all become wealthy, but in doing this we\nwould have no opportunity of showing our faith by our works\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26058\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26058)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26058)\">James 2:18<\/a><\/span>); we would have no opportunity\nof developing our manhood and of fitting and preparing ourselves by actual labor to go back\nand dwell in the presence of our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I understand the teachings of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they were that it would\nprofit no man if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33990\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33990)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33990)\">Matt. 16:26<\/a><\/span>). It is by the faithful\ndischarge of the duties and the obligations that rest upon us in the Church of God that we are\ndeveloped. It is by the exercise of our mental faculties that we improve upon them; it is by\nthe exercise of our physical powers that we strengthen them; it is by the cultivation and the\nexercise of our spirits that we grow in spirituality, that we grow in the testimony of the\ngospel, that we grow in ability and strength to accomplish the purposes of our Heavenly\nFather upon the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nOn the subject of tithing I heard a very splendid illustration given by a teacher in one of our\nchildren's classes: She brought with her ten beautiful red apples. She explained that\neverything we have in the world came to us from the Lord, and she said, \"Now, if I give one\nof you these ten apples, will you give me one of them back again? Now, any one of you\nchildren that will do that, hold up your hand.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOf course, they all held up their hands. Then she said, \"That is what the\nLord does for us. He gives us the ten apples, but he requests that we return one to him to\nshow our appreciation of that gift.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe trouble with some people is that when they get the ten apples, they eat up nine of them,\nand then they cut the other in two and give the Lord half of what is left. Some of them cut\nthe apple in two and eat up one-half of it and then hold up the other half and ask the Lord to\ntake a bite. That is about as near as they see fit to share properly and show their gratitude to\nthe Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nOur children often feel that we are under obligation to them if they learn their lessons in\nschool; they feel that they have done something that places the parents under obligation,\nwhile, as a matter of fact, they have done something, if they have learned their lessons, that\nfor all time will be of benefit to them individually. Likewise, a great many people in the\nChurch act as though the Presidency of the Church, or the presidency of the stake, or the\nbishopric of their ward are under obligation to them if they obey the Word of Wisdom or if\nthey obey the law delivered to us regarding tithing, or any other principle of the gospel. They\nfeel that they have done something that places the Church, or the authorities of the Church\nlocally, or the General Authorities, under obligation to them. But every law that is given to us\nin the Church is for our own individual benefit.\n<\/p><p>\nLOOKING AFTER OUR YOUTH\n<\/p><p>\nI wish to impress upon the workers in all the organizations of the Church, the need for\nlaboring prayerfully, untiringly, and diligently at this time to persuade the youth of Zion to be\nmore faithful, more diligent in all their obligations and responsibilities, in safeguarding their\nvirtue, and in observing what is known as the Word of Wisdom. I feel that while there are\ntens of thousands of our young men who are doing this, there may also be some who in order\nto be counted as hail-fellows-well-met, may be tempted to become careless and forgetful.\n<\/p><p>\nI ask our young people, wherever they are in all the world, to remember well all of their\nprinciples and ideals, under all conditions and circumstances, when they are at home, and\nwhen they are away from home.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is nothing like looking after people. It is just the same in the gospel as it is in business.\nIf a man does not look after his trade, it is sure to go from him. We must look after the\npeople, our young people and all others, no matter where they may go, if we hope to keep\nthem in the line of their duty.\n<\/p><p>\nTO OUR YOUNG MEN IN THE ARMED FORCES\n<\/p><p>\nOur hearts, our thoughts, and our prayers go out to those who are in the armed forces. It\nwould appear from all the figures we can gather, that more than one hundred thousand of our\nyoung men are in the services of their country, in uniform. We pray for\nthem continually. We pray for the preservation of their lives and for their faithfulness to those\nthings which are dearer than life.\n<\/p><p>\nWe say to you again to be clean, to keep the commandments of God, to pray, to live\nrighteously; and if you do, peace and understanding will come into your hearts, and our\nFather in heaven will comfort you; and will let his presence be felt in the hour of your need.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung men of Zion, when you return to your homes, return with clean hands and clean\nhearts&mdash;and great will be your happiness, your faith, and your testimony. Your brethren and\nyour loved ones cherish you, pray for you, and await the day of your coming.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I pray with all my heart that if there are those who have made mistakes, that they will\nrepent; and by this we may know that they have repented&mdash;that they will confess their sins and\ndepart from them (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12117\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12117)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12117)\">D&amp;C 58:43<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTO THOSE WHO ARE IN SORROW\n<\/p><p>\nInto many of our homes sorrow has come since last conference. In the days ahead we must\nface the fact that more homes and more families will be broken by news of death and of other\ntragedies. May the peace and comfort of our Father in heaven bring its healing influence to all\nwho are called upon to mourn and to bear affliction. And may we be strengthened with the\nunderstanding that being blessed does not mean that we shall always be spared all the\ndisappointments and difficulties of life. We all have them, even though our troubles differ. I\nhave not had the same kind of trials that others have had to undergo, yet I have had my full\nshare. When, as a young man, I lost my wife and my only two sons, I was earnestly trying\nwith all my heart to keep the commandments of the Lord, and my household and I were\nobserving the Word of Wisdom and entitled to the blessings of life. I have been sorely tried\nand tempted, but I am thankful to say that the trials and temptations have not been any greater\nthan I was able to endure (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"127\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 127)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(127)\">1 Cor. 10:13<\/a><\/span>),\nand with all my heart I hope that we may never have anything\nmore to endure than we will be blessed of the Lord with the ability to withstand.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd may we always remember, because it is both true and comforting, that the death of a\nfaithful man is nothing in comparison to the loss of the inspiration of the good spirit. Eternal\nlife is the great prize, and it will be ours, and the joy of our Father in heaven in welcoming\nus will be great, if we do right; and there is nothing so great that can be done in this life by\nanyone, as to do right. The Lord will hear and answer the prayers we offer to him and give us\nthe things we pray for if it is for our best good. He never will and never has forsaken those\nwho serve him with full purpose of heart; but we must always be prepared to say \"Father, thy\nwill be done\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31161\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31161)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31161)\">Luke 22:42<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless and keep you who are away from home, and bless your wives and your\nchildren, your mothers and your fathers.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless and preserve the Saints and the righteous everywhere, in all nations, in the\nfar-off islands, and in lands torn by war, as well as here among us. To all faithful, we extend\nanew the hand of fellowship, and hold you in remembrance before God; and may he\naccomplish his purposes, overrule in the affairs of nations, hasten the end of the war and of\nwickedness, and bring peace on earth.\n<\/p><p>\nWORK, THRIFT, AND INTEGRITY\n<\/p><p>\nI plead with all the Saints at this time, as all my predecessors in the presidency of the Church\nhave done, to be honest, truthful, industrious, and thrifty; to get out of debt and stay out of\ndebt; to prepare for the time when money may not flow as freely as it does now.\n<\/p><p>\nEven now, we are told that there will be leaner days ahead&mdash;notwithstanding that the war has\nprogressed as far as it has. Let all of us who can, raise what we can of our own food and\nsustenance. Let all of us be industrious and useful to the full extent of our strength and\nability. We are told to earn our bread by the sweat of the brow\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23494\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23494)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23494)\">Gen. 3:19<\/a><\/span>). I believe there may be a\ndisposition on the part of some Latter-day Saints to say, \"Well, after we get to be sixty-five\nwe will not have to work anymore.\" There should be in the heart of every man and woman,\nthe cry, \"I am going to live and work. There is nothing given to me but time in which to live,\nand I am going to endeavor each day of my life to do some labor which will be acceptable in\nthe sight of my Heavenly Father, and if it is possible, do a little better today than I did\nyesterday.\" It is an easy thing to throw a dollar to a man, but it requires sympathy and a heart\nto take an interest in him and try to plan for his welfare and benefit.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it is a principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ, now, as it always has been, to help every\nman to help himself&mdash;to help every child of our Father in heaven to work out his own\nsalvation (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41228\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41228)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41228)\">Philip. 2:12<\/a><\/span>), both temporally and spiritually.\n<\/p><p>\nRESPONSIBILITY OF LEADERSHIP\n<\/p><p>\nI pray for the righteous among all peoples. I ask the Lord to bless those who preside in the\nnation; in the states, in the cities, and in the counties. I pray God to inspire the people that\nthey will obey his commandments and elect good men to positions of public responsibility,\nthat they will bury their political differences, their personal ambitions, and selfish interests,\nand seek for good men to hold office.\n<\/p><p>\nI tell you it is the duty of the presidency of this Church to ask the people to do anything and\neverything that the inspiration of God tells them to do, and you need have no fear that any\nman will ever stand at the head of the Church of Jesus Christ unless our Heavenly Father\nwants him to be there.\n<\/p><p>\nSeveral times I have gone to meetings in the old Endowment House, knowing that a certain\nmatter was to be discussed, and my mind was as perfectly set upon a certain\nposition on that question as it is possible for a man to have his mind set, and I believe I am\nas decided in my opinion as the majority of people. (I have heard it said that there is nobody\nas stubborn as a Scotchman except a Dutchman: and I am Scotch on my father's side and\nDutch on my mother's.) And although I have gone to meetings determined in favor of a\ncertain line of policy, I have willingly and freely voted for the exact opposite of that policy,\nbecause of the inspiration of the Lord that came to give direction. And upon every such\noccasion the action taken was vindicated and proved by later events to be for the best good of\nthe people.\n<\/p><p>\nI could also relate circumstances when the brethren have been sent out to accomplish certain\nlabors under the inspiration of the Lord when they thought they could not accomplish those\nlabors. They have returned and been able to bear testimony that by and with the help of the\nLord they had been able to accomplish the labor placed upon them.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord gives to many of us the still, small voice of revelation\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1187\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1187)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1187)\">1 Kgs. 19:12<\/a><\/span>). It comes as vividly and\nstrongly as though it were with a great sound. It comes to each man, according to his needs\nand faithfulness, for guidance in matters that pertain to his own life. For the Church as a\nwhole it comes to those who have been ordained to speak for the Church as a whole&mdash;and I\nsay to you again, that it is the duty of the presidency of this Church to ask the people to do\nanything and everything that the inspiration of God tells them to do. We as Latter-day Saints,\nholding the priesthood of God, should magnify it, and we should respect the General\nAuthorities of the Church; and as we respect them, God will respect us.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE PATH OF DUTY, THE PATH OF SAFETY\n<\/p><p>\nThere is but one path of safety for the Latter-day Saints, and that is the path of duty. It is not\na testimony only; it is not marvelous manifestations; it is not knowing that the gospel of Jesus\nChrist is true, that it is the plan of salvation&mdash;it is not actually knowing that the Savior is the\nRedeemer, and that Joseph Smith was his prophet, that will save you and me; but it is the\nkeeping of the commandments of God, living the life of a Latter-day Saint.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray constantly for all the officers of this Church, whether in the priesthood or in the\nauxiliary associations. I am sure, in my secret prayers particularly, that I never forget,\nmorning or night, those that have been called to preside, to direct the affairs in the priesthood\nquorums and in the auxiliary associations. My prayer is that each of you holding a place of\nresponsibility shall so order your lives that they shall be examples of diligence and energy and\nof the Spirit of the Living God, that can be followed in every part by those over whom you\npreside.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we do this, what a wonderful power we shall have with the Lord in the furtherance of his\nmighty purposes in the earth. If we keep his commandments, our influence\nwill be not only with the world, but with our own young people. Their strength and power\nwill be multiplied if we shall succeed in having them feel the necessity of observing the\ncommandments of God, particularly concerning the principles of clean and righteous living.\n<\/p><p>\nI say to all Latter-day Saints: keep the commandments of God. That is my keynote&mdash;just these\nfew words: <i>keep the commandments of God!<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nCLOSING TESTIMONY\n<\/p><p>\nThe most glorious thing that has ever happened in the history of the world since the Savior\nhimself lived on earth, is that God himself saw fit to visit the earth with his beloved, only\nbegotten Son, our Redeemer and Savior, and to appear to the boy Joseph\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30230\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30230)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30230)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>). There are thousands\nand hundreds of thousands who have had a perfect and individual testimony and knowledge of\nthis eternal truth. The gospel in its purity has been restored to the earth, and I want to\nemphasize that we as a people have one supreme thing to do, and this is to call upon the\nworld to repent of sin, and to obey the commandments of God. And it is our duty above all\nothers to go forth at home and abroad, as times and circumstances permit, and proclaim the\ngospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is our duty also to be mindful of those children of our\nFather who have preceded us in death without a knowledge of the gospel, and to open the\ndoor of salvation to them in our temples, where we also have obligations to perform.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear witness to you that I do know that God lives, that he hears and answers prayer; that\nJesus is the Christ, the Redeemer of the world; that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of the\ntrue and living God; and that Brigham Young and those who have succeeded him were, and\nare, likewise prophets of God.\n<\/p><p>\nI do not have the language at my command to express the gratitude to God for this knowledge\nthat I possess. Time and time again my heart has been melted, my eyes have wept tears of\ngratitude for the knowledge that he lives and that this gospel called Mormonism is in very\ndeed the plan of life and salvation, that it is in very deed the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nThat God may help you and me and everyone to live it, and that he may help those who\nknow not the truth, that they may receive this witness, is my constant and earnest prayer, and\nI ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
