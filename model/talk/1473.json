Evans, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1966, pp. 88-90<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nOne of the most quoted New Testament texts is this from John: \"For God so loved the world,\nthat he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but\nhave everlasting life\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28234\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28234)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28234)\">John 3:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is comfortingly familiar&mdash;the love of God simply stated&mdash;and what he did about his love\nis the evidence of it: He sent his Only Begotten Son that whoso believeth in him should have\neverlasting life.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Love is expressed by action<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSuppose God had loved the world in a passive way? Suppose he hadn't sent his Son? Suppose\nhe hadn't given us his gospel? Suppose he hadn't set out to save mankind or redeem us from\ndeath? Suppose he had let his children drift without plan or purpose or counsel or\ncommandments? Would that have been love?\n<\/p><p>\nThe point I hope to make, for a particular purpose, is the evidence, the proof, the test of love.\n<\/p><p>\nAn editorial recently read in a medical magazine had an intriguing title: \"Love Is a Verb.\"\nAnd from this the writer turned his attention to the importance of doing, of proving, of\nperforming. The proof of any principle is what it does, and the proof of any person is what he\ndoes&mdash;how he acts, what he becomes&mdash;not simply what he says.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Love Is a Verb.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe might paraphrase and say that service is a verb, that life is a verb; for it is in doing, in\nliving, in learning, and not just in words that we perform our purpose. No one really proves\nhimself or his principles in neutrality or indifference or inaction. No one proves himself by\nmerely thinking or simply sitting.\n<\/p><p>\nThe writer of the article referred to above said that in some primitive languages, with their\nfewness of words, the description of the movement of game, for example, is described simply\nby one word: <i>running<\/i>. Perhaps we could say much more with fewer words by simply\nindicating the action: <i>living, doing<\/i>. \". . . when a noun replaces a verb there is a disadvantage .\n. .\" because a noun is static, and life is movement. Some people \"assign an intrinsic value to\n'things' like purity and gratitude . . . They take credit for possessing nominal virtues. Or they\npunish themselves for having vices . . . [but] we communicate with others in verbs . . .\nGratitude has not even been born until it has been actually conveyed in word or deed\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe same could be said for sanity, said this same physician. It \"is not structural but\nfunctional. It is not something one has or is. It is a measure of what one does.\" (William B.\nMcGrath, M.D., in <i>Medicine at Work<\/i>, February 1966.) If we do sane things, we are sane. If\nwe don't do sane things, we are not sane.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Actions speak louder than words<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nActions do speak louder than words.\n<\/p><p>\nAs to a young person who was speculating upon whether or not she loved someone, there is\nthe reminder that love is not simply a noun and not simply a sentimental feeling. The proof of\nlove is what one is willing to do for the loved one. The proof of love is how one behaves.\n<\/p><p>\nDr. John A. Widtsoe turned his attention to this subject at times: \"The full and essential nature\nof love we may not understand,\" he said, \"but there are tests by which it may be recognized.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Love and truth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"Love is always founded in truth . . . Lies and deceit, or any other violation of the moral\nlaw, are proofs of love's absence. Love perishes in the midst of untruth . . . Thus, the lover\nwho falsifies to his loved one, or offers her any act contrary to truth, does not really love her.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Love does not injure<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"Further, love does not offend or hurt or injure the loved one. By that test any human venture,\npast and present, may be measured for its real value. Cruelty is as absent from love . . . as\ntruth is from untruth.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Love is a positive force<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . love is a positive active force. It helps the loved one. If there is need, love tries to\nsupply it. If there is weakness, love supplants it with strength . . . Love that does not help is\na faked or transient love.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Love gives<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"Good as these tests are, there is a greater one. True love sacrifices for the loved one . . .\nThat is the final test. Christ gave of Himself, gave His life for us, and thereby proclaimed the\nreality of his love for his mortal brethren and sisters. The mother gives of her own flesh and\nblood, and jeopardizes her very life, for her child. In family relationships there must be\nmutual sacrifices among husband, wife, and children, else true love is not there.\" (Dr. John A.\nWidtsoe, <i>An Understandable Religion<\/i>, Ch. 8.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Love is honest<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThus, anyone who would induce someone to do that which it is unworthy to do, or to take\nadvantage, or rob someone of virtue, or embarrass, or hurt, really doesn't love the person he\nprofesses to love. What he feels under such circumstances is something less than love. The\nproving is in the doing.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Virtues are positive forces<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so it is with all the virtues. Either we live pure lives or we don't. Either we think pure\nthoughts or we don't. Purity isn't simply a noun. It is a verb. It is the living of a certain kind\nof life. It is the thinking of certain kinds of thoughts. Its proof is in keeping the\ncommandments.\n<\/p><p>\nGoodness is not theory, it is fact.\n<\/p><p>\nWe may think of tithing as a principle and discuss it and approve it, but if we are really\nconvinced and converted, we will pay our tithing.\n<\/p><p>\nWe may think well of the missionary system, but it works only because some leave home and\nsacrifice and serve sincerely&mdash;not merely because it is a good organization or idea.\n<\/p><p>\nWe may think and talk of chastity as a virtue, but if we are converted and convinced, we will\nlive chaste lives.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we love our children we won't neglect them or let them run loose. If we love our children\nwe won't leave them ignorant of the law, or of the commandments, or ignorant of how to\nbehave, or unacquainted with sound habits of work, or ignorant of courtesy and acceptable\nconduct.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we love our children we will urge them to prepare as fully as they can for life, persuade\nthem to acquire all the training and education possible. If we love our children we will keep\nas close to them as possible and do our utmost to keep them free from sin and from anything\nthat would clutter or scar their lives.\n<\/p><p>\nAs parents there is no greater obligation that is ours&mdash;and neglect is not the evidence of love.\nPart of love is doing our duty in love and loyalty, \"by persuasion, by long-suffering, by\ngentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; \n<\/p><p>\n\"By kindness, and pure knowledge\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14872\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14872)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14872)\">D&amp;C 121:41-42<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJesus said: \". . . lovest thou me? . . .

It is how we live, how we\nserve, how we teach our children, what we do from day to day that both indicate what we are\nand determine what we are; and all the theory and all the speculation, all the quoting of\nscripture, all the searching of the mysteries, and all the splitting of hairs, and all the\nknowledge of the letter of the law don't in the final and saving sense amount to very much\nunless we live the gospel, unless we keep the commandments, unless we prove the principles,\nunless we live lives of effectiveness, sincerity, and service.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The best evidence<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSometimes we hear someone say, \"My life is my own. I am going to do with it as I please.\"\nBut no one's life is his own. Too much of others has gone into the making of all of us.\n<\/p><p>\nWe cannot hurt ourselves without hurting others. A sorrow, an illness, a disgrace, an accident,\ntrouble, or difficulty of any kind&mdash;any loss to loved ones is a loss to family and friends. We\nare too much a part of one another for this not to be so.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we love our parents, wouldn't the evidence of it be to do something about it: to be grateful,\nto help to care for them in their need, to honor them by being honorable, to take them into\nour confidence&mdash;not to worry them?\n<\/p><p>\nThe best evidence of love for parents would be active evidence of kindness, consideration,\nappreciation, respect for their teachings and counsel.\n<\/p><p>\nThe best evidence of love of country would be not what we say&mdash;or say we feel&mdash;but\nserving it, keeping the laws, preserving its principles.\n<\/p><p>\nThe best evidence of love for our Father in heaven would be living lives of honor and\nreverence, not taking his name in vain, living useful, righteous lives; and keeping his\ncommandments.\n<\/p><p>\nAs to those who say they love the Church&mdash;the best evidence of that love would be serving,\ndoing, giving of ourselves, living its standards, keeping the commandments.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to be members not of record only, but members who place doing and serving and\nliving the requirements of the gospel above our comfort or convenience.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he\nthat doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35577\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35577)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35577)\">Matt. 7:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is important to believe; it is important to be; but it is also important to do.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Conviction expressed by conduct<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nEven the devil believes (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"26193\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26193)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26193)\">James 2:19<\/a><\/span>).\n\"Conviction is worthless unless it is converted into\nconduct.\" (Thomas Carlyle.)\n<\/p><p>\nThank God for the gospel, for the personal and literal reality of him who made us in his own\nimage, for his Son our Savior, and for the blessed plan of everlasting life with our loved ones.\n<\/p><p>\nThank God for his patience, for his understanding, for his comfort, for his commandments,\nfor it would be a disillusioning life to be running loose without knowing what was expected\nof us&mdash;or why. Thank God that he sent his Only Begotten Son to show us the way, to\nredeem us from death, to lead us to everlasting life.\n<\/p><p>\nWith you I offer gratitude and a pledge to do my best to demonstrate love for our Lord and\nSavior and his Father who gave us life by living the kind of lives that they would have us\nlive, and leave my witness with you of the truth of that which gathers us here together, in the\nname of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
