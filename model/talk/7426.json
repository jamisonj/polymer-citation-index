In an attempt to overcome this he gathered the eminent divines of the day to Nicaea in the year 325. Each participant was given opportunity to state his views. The argument only grew more heated. When a definition could not be reached, a compromise was made. It came to be known as the Nicene Creed, and its basic elements are recited by most of the Christian faithful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-things-of-which-i-know.p9\" class=\"\">Personally I cannot understand it.

He knelt in Their presence; he heard Their voices; and he responded. Each was a distinct personality. Small wonder that he told his mother that he had learned that her church was not true. And so, one of the great over-arching doctrines of this Church is our belief in God the Eternal Father. He is a being, real and individual. He is the great Governor of the universe, yet He is our Father, and we are His children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-things-of-which-i-know.p11\" class=\"\">We pray to Him, and those prayers are a conversation between God and man.

It was His finger that wrote the commandments on the Mount. It was He who left His royal courts on high and came to earth, born under the most humble of circumstances.
