Thank you, and we come.\n<\/p><p>\n\"If I were a voice&mdash;a persuasive voice<br \/>\n      That could travel the wide world through,<br \/>\n      I would fly on the beams of the morning light,<br \/>\n      And speak to men with a gentle might,<br \/>\n      And tell them to be true.<br \/><br \/>\n      I'd fly o'er land and sea,<br \/>\n      Wherever a human heart might be,<br \/>\n      Telling a tale, or singing a song,<br \/>\n      In praise of the Right and in blame of the Wrong.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;                             &mdash;Charles MacKay\n<\/p><p>\nThe poet who wrote that had but one thought in his mind, and that was that men should be\ntrue to each other and true to their ideals. To the fifty thousand and more men of the\nPriesthood tonight, that is what I should like to say, and I should like to say it in the inspired\nwords of Joseph Smith recorded at the end of that marvelous revelation on Priesthood: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is\nappointed, in all diligence.\n<\/p><p>\n\"He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he that learns not his duty and\nshows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand. Even so. Amen\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13929\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13929)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13929)\">D&amp;C 107:99-100<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTwo things mentioned in that revelation point out important elements in the Priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nFirst, learning one's duty, and that means learning what kind of life a man who holds the\nPriesthood should live, being true to himself, to his loved ones, to the Church, to God. Every\nindividual has that duty, and particularly every individual who holds the Priesthood. If he is\nhonest to himself he is honest with the brethren; he is fair in his dealings in business circles,\nin politics he speaks the truth; he merits the confidence of his associates in business, civic\nareas, and particularly he should live so as to merit the confidence of members of the Church\nwho trust him.\n<\/p><p>\nBut the Lord was not content when he gave to the individual the Priesthood. He organized\nthose men who were true in upholding the ideals of the Priesthood into groups that they might\nrender group service to their fellow men. I hope that the fifty thousand men listening tonight\ncaught that emphasis in the message illustrated so impressively by Brother Lee.\n<\/p><p>\nThe duty of quorum Priesthood members to keep in touch with their members who are out in\nthe service is a very practical idea. I heard of a very successful group of men who were\ndealing with the Senior Aaronic Priesthood. I wrote to a man who I know has been very\nactive in that work, and if he and his associates can obtain the success he reports, so can\nevery quorum of Priesthood in the Church. He and his group were formed into a ward\ncommittee. Listen to a paragraph or two from his interesting report: \n<\/p><p>\n\"We had a fine group of men on our ward committee and we remained together with only a\nfew changes until recently. We held our planning and ward meetings for an\nhour every Sunday morning where we reviewed our activities. We kept books on our\nmembers, reviewing the details of our visits so that we were all aware of the problems in each\nhome. This was interesting work for all of us, discouraging in many ways and often a\nchallenge, one which has not as yet been met to our satisfaction. However, as we go over the\nrecords we find that forty members in our ward have been advanced to the Melchizedek\nPriesthood, all, so far as we can determine, with satisfactory results. Many have moved away,\nbut we have made contact with most of them.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the reactivated members \"has had a fine influence on many of the other members of\nthe league to which he belongs, and many of them are now active in the wards in which they\nlive. On their Golden Wedding day, he and his wife took the entire family to the temple for\nthe necessary sealing work.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe other instances result with equal satisfaction. \"After a while,\" he says, regarding one with\nwhom they worked, \"it was not long until there was no smell of either liquor or tobacco about\nhim, and nothing had ever been mentioned about his use of them. He was ordained a Priest\nlater and made secretary of the Senior Aaronic Priesthood group. He began attending classes\nat Weber College and has continued to take three or four classes each year ever since. This\nman was ordained an Elder and soon afterwards was selected as President of his quorum. He\nchose one of his Senior Aaronic Priesthood associates as a counselor and both are doing fine\nwork as officers at this time. He is a wonderful leader.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt is the duty of leaders in Priesthood quorums to watch over their members, to teach them\ntheir duty. They can do that independently of the Ward bishopric. They do it because it is\ntheir own responsibility, it is their duty to have their members fit to be called into ward\nactivity, stake activity, missionary activity, as already explained.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and\nbring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of\nmy Father!\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the\nkingdom of my Father how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13841\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13841)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13841)\">D&amp;C 18:15-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nQuorums of the Priesthood throughout the world: Keep in touch with your members who are\naway, especially in the armed forces, surrounded by temptations. Keep in touch with your\nmembers here at home, some of whom are negligent, who need the spiritual food you can\ngive them, and you will find as did this eminent physician who made the report I have given\nyou, that there is much joy in bringing one soul, twenty souls, forty souls, into activity.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless all who are assembled in this great meeting tonight. May the spirit of the occasion\ngovern their hearts, first, awakening a desire to live righteously, to keep their own souls free\nfrom the temptations that surround us in our wards and stakes, and second, awakening a\ndetermination to contribute of their earnestness and their purity of living, to the strength of\nthe quorum, thus making it a power for good, not only in the stake or in the ward, but\nthroughout the entire world, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
