As I look at them, I feel the spirit of noble prophets and leaders who made choices to be obedient to the Lord in spite of earthly trials. The examples of their faith, courage, love, humility, service, and endurance sustain me and give me strength to face challenges in my own life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/draw-strength-from-the-book-of-mormon.p4\" class=\"\">So that you might also gain strength from their messages, let me describe some of these plain and simple pictures and share some insights about the powerful principles they teach. The stories are familiar, yet the precepts we learn from them may be different each time we read them. The scriptures have the power to speak to our particular situations wherever we are in life. The insights you gain may be entirely different from the ones that I gain, but they all can strengthen us personally.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/draw-strength-from-the-book-of-mormon.p5\" class=\"\">The first picture is Lehi\u2019s journey.

She was physically weakened, emotionally distraught, and spiritually drained. Every day seemed harder for her to face than the day before. She was desperate for comfort. While lying in a hospital bed anticipating an unwanted but necessary surgery, she felt utterly alone. Her thoughts turned to Joseph Smith and his sufferings in Liberty Jail. Then she thought about our Savior, Jesus Christ. She asked her husband to read to her from 3 Nephi. The Nephites had gathered at the temple in the land Bountiful and twice heard a voice they didn\u2019t understand that seemed to come from heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/draw-strength-from-the-book-of-mormon.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cIt being a small voice \u2026 did pierce them \u2026 to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/draw-strength-from-the-book-of-mormon.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd behold, the third time they did understand the voice. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/draw-strength-from-the-book-of-mormon.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name\u2014hear ye him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/draw-strength-from-the-book-of-mormon.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cThey saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/draw-strength-from-the-book-of-mormon.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/draw-strength-from-the-book-of-mormon.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6192\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6192)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6192)\">3 Ne. 11:3, 6\u20138, 10\u201311<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/draw-strength-from-the-book-of-mormon.p26\" class=\"\">After my friend listened to this passage, a sweet peace enveloped her.
