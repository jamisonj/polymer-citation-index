Hinckley, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1962, pp. 70-73<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brethren and sisters, I rejoice with you in the attendance here of bishops and presidents of\nstakes from foreign lands. This is a great and significant day in the history of the Church, and\nforetells, I think, the time when these general conferences shall become in reality great\nparliaments of men gathered from over the world, endowed with the Holy Priesthood, whose\nonly desire is to promote the cause of peace and goodness among the people\nof the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nI rejoice in the reports which have been given by those who have been supervising the\nmissions in various parts of the world. The manner in which the Lord is pouring out his Spirit\nupon the people of the earth quickens the testimony of each of us.\n<\/p><p>\nAs many of you know, I have some responsibility for the work in the Far East, and I feel a\ncompelling desire in behalf of our dedicated mission presidents and missionaries to give a\nbrief report of what is going on in that part of the Lord's earth, which is strange to many of\nus.\n<\/p><p>\nI have learned to love those faraway places, and those wonderful people with the\nstrange-sounding names&mdash;the Hongs and the Kims, the Fongs and the Kumagais&mdash;and all of\nthe host of faithful Latter-day Saints who in their lives and words bear testimony of the\nconviction which they carry in their hearts that God truly lives; that Jesus is the Christ, the\nRedeemer of the world, the Savior of mankind; and that Joseph Smith is a Prophet, ordained\nof God to bring forth the re-establishment of his work in this generation of time.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is an inspiring experience, my brethren and sisters, to witness the manner in which the Lord\nis weaving the tapestry of his grand design in those foreign parts of the earth. He is gathering\nhis children there as elsewhere&mdash;\"one of a city and two of a family\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26496\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26496)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26496)\">Jer. 3:14<\/a><\/span>). He is remembering the\npromises made of old as he works among those who have seen so much of poverty and\nmisery and evil and oppression. He is answering the prayers of those who have gone before,\nand who struggled to establish a foothold for the gospel in those distant places.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat wonderful people these are whose lives have been touched by the light of the gospel!\nWitnessing the faithful Saints in the Philippines, in Hong Kong, in Taiwan, in Japan, in\nKorea, in Okinawa, one is led to declare with Peter of old: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: \n<\/p><p>\n\"But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7897\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7897)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7897)\">Acts 10:34-35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nToday we have some eight thousand native members of the Church in this part of the world,\nin addition to many faithful American Saints who are in military service and in other\npositions with the government. I would not have you think that this harvest of converts has\ncome easily. Converts are won hard there as they are elsewhere. Heartache and\ndiscouragement and disappointment are all part of the labor that goes on there, and behind\ntoday's achievement is a history of prayer and prophecy and patient waiting for the day when\nthe Spirit of the Lord would move upon these lands.\n<\/p><p>\nI have not walked the crowded streets of the Orient, in which today we are enjoying a\nsignificant measure of success, without remembering with appreciation those of our people\nwho more than a century ago went there under direction of the servants of the Lord to initiate\nthe work.\n<\/p><p>\nIn a special conference held August 2, 1849 in the Bowery that stood on this square, Hosea\nStout and two companions were called to go to China. They arrived in Hong Kong in April\n1853. I can imagine with what misgivings they must have stepped ashore in that place so\ndifferent from the one they had left. They became ill from the oppressive heat and the food to\nwhich they were not accustomed. Their message fell on deaf ears. There was no response\nother than ridicule. In four months they returned home.\n<\/p><p>\nA century passed, but in the meantime the realm of China had been dedicated under authority\nof the holy apostleship for the preaching of the gospel. On January 9, 1921, President David\nO. McKay, while touring the missions of the world, turned the key to unlock the door of this\ngreat area of the earth have read his prayer again and again. It is at once a prayer and a\ndedication and a prophecy.\n<\/p><p>\nOne or two statements from that prayer offered in the \"Forbidden City\" of Peking appear\nparticularly significant to me. He prayed: \"Heavenly Father . . . break the bonds of\nsuperstition, and may the young men and young women come out of the darkness of the past\ninto the glorious light now shining among the children of men. Grant, our\nFather, that these young men and young women may through upright, virtuous lives and\nprayerful study be prepared and inclined to declare this message of salvation in their own\ntongue to their fellow men.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI bear testimony that God is answering that supplication. The shackles of superstition are\nfalling. The young men and the young women are coming out of the darkness of the past. I\nwish that you might have been with us recently in a conference in Hong Kong to hear our\nyoung Chinese brethren and sisters sing the songs of Zion in their native Cantonese and bear\nwitness of the truth of this work to congregations numbering more than eight hundred. I wish\nyou might have talked, as I did, with our young native Chinese elders who are serving as\nmissionaries. One said: \"I hated Americans. I hated all foreigners until I met the\nmissionaries.\" Another responded, paraphrasing an old Chinese proverb, \"As I look at\nforeigners, I think, he is not American; he is not British; he is not Canadian; he is my\nbrother.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI wish you might have been with us in Taiwan to hear a handsome and brilliant young man\ndiscuss the gospel in his native Mandarin. He was a local missionary, a young man whose\nforebears for generations before him had been Buddhists. I have seen nowhere a more able or\ndevoted or personable missionary in this Church.\n<\/p><p>\nIn that same dedicatory prayer offered in 1921 President McKay stated: \"May the elders and\nsisters whom thou shalt call as missionaries have keen insight into the mental and spiritual\nstate of the Chinese mind.... May the work prove joyous, and a rich harvest of souls bring that\npeace to the workers' hearts which surpasseth all understanding\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41260\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41260)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41260)\">Philip. 4:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHow I wish you might have been with us in an upstairs room in Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon,\nwhere for thirteen hours the elders and sisters bore testimony of their love for the Chinese\npeople. I shall not soon forget the words of a young man from a comfortable home in the\nStates, who stood in a cold, barren room in Taipei in the Republic of China and said, \"I am\nthankful for eyes to see and voice to speak and feet to go from door to door to teach the\ngospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSuch is the spirit of those who have been called from Los Angeles and Burbank, from\nRexburg and Logan, from El Paso and Tooele to those strange lands, where under the\ninfluence of the Spirit they learn the difficult languages and bring light and faith and\nunderstanding to the wonderful people who live there.\n<\/p><p>\nThe story is similar in Japan. The work was opened in 1901 by President Heber J. Grant. It\nwas dreadfully discouraging. In twenty years only 127 converts came into the Church, and the\nmission was closed in 1924. Then following World War II it was reopened, and the Spirit of\nthe Lord began to rest upon those people.\n<\/p><p>\nToday we have more than four thousand Japanese members of the Church, intelligent and\nable, as faithful and devoted as those in any mission in the world; and we now have branches\nscattered from Okinawa on the south to as far north as Asahigawa on the island of Hokkaido.\nI feel confident and satisfied in my heart that we have a great work ahead of us among the\ngood people of that great nation.\n<\/p><p>\nI speak with comparable feelings concerning the work in Korea. There are now some 1,300\nmembers of the Church there. For the most part they are well-educated. They are buoyant in\ntheir faith. The tears welled in our eyes as we stood with them in a cold hall and sang that\ngreat hymn from the pen of Brother William W. Phelps: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Now let us rejoice in the day of salvation.<br \/>\nNo longer as strangers on earth need we roam.<br \/>\nGood tidings are sounding to us and each nation,<br \/>\nAnd shortly the hour of redemption will come . . .\"\n<\/p><p>\nI have never met with the Saints in those lands and listened to their testimonies and partaken\nof their spirit without thinking of Paul's statement to the Athenians concerning God, our\nFather, who\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face\nof the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their\nhabitation; \n<\/p><p>\n\"That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7904\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7904)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7904)\">Acts 17:26-27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat which is going on has demonstrated that the gospel is for all of our Father's children,\nand that the good people of the Orient are as responsive to its teachings as are the people of\nany land when the Spirit of the Lord touches their hearts. Here is one of the great evidences\nof the divinity of this work. Wherever it is taught, the honest in heart respond, each in his\nown tongue speaking the same testimony.\n<\/p><p>\nOne sees there the same quiet kind of miracle that one sees everywhere when men and\nwomen bring the gospel into their lives. What a marvelous thing it is to witness a peddler of\nfish, a man from the ranks of poverty and superstition, take on a new grace and a new\ngoodness when he accepts the gospel and is endowed with the Holy Priesthood. He appears\nalmost to become a new man. He literally is born again as he sheds old ways of thought and\nliving and rises from the very waters of baptism to positions of leadership in his native land.\n<\/p><p>\nBut with all of the joy and the inspiration that come of witnessing this marvelous thing, there\ncomes likewise an almost overwhelming sense of obligation. There comes a new\nconsciousness of the magnitude of our great responsibility. The harvest is so great, and the\nlaborers are so few in those lands where dwell millions upon millions upon millions of\npeople. In the city of Tokyo alone are more than ten million, with cities of three and four and\nfive million not far removed.\n<\/p><p>\nBrigham Young, on the occasion of the departure of the first missionaries to China, declared:\n\"The work urges, and is becoming very much enlarged and extended, and requires a\ncommensurate accumulation of men and means, and expansion of mind and energy, ability\nand perseverance.\" (<i>Millennial Star<\/i>, Vol. 15, p. 107.)\n<\/p><p>\nIf that were the case in 1852, how much more urgent is it today? My brethren and sisters, the\nwork is becoming very much enlarged. It does require a commensurate accumulation of men\nand means. It requires an expansion of mind and energy, ability and perseverance. Let us\nprepare ourselves more diligently for the great assignment which God has laid upon us to\ncarry this work to the children of the earth wherever we may be permitted to go.\n<\/p><p>\nTo our young men I would like to say, prepare yourselves, not only financially as you have\nbeen urged to do, but also intellectually and morally and spiritually. Study languages. This\ngospel is not for the people of America only. This gospel is for the people of the earth, and\nwe have incumbent upon us the obligation to learn to speak their tongues. If you be called to\na foreign language mission, you will be better equipped if you have studied the language. If\ncalled to an English-speaking mission, you will understand your own language better.\n<\/p><p>\nLive for\nthe opportunity when you may go out as a servant of the Lord and an ambassador of eternal\ntruth to the people of the world. \"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the\nworld for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35199\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35199)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35199)\">Matt. 24:14<\/a><\/span>). This is our\ncommission, and this is our obligation spoken anciently and reaffirmed in modern revelation.\n<\/p><p>\nGod give us the faith and the wisdom and the foresight and the breadth of vision to go\nforward and fulfill it, I pray, as I leave you my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
