I have never heard him express any pleasure or satisfaction in now or today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-time-is-now.p4\" class=\"\">This brief association brought to mind a notion commonly shared by many that the best of life is just ahead, over the next hill, a few years away, retirement, tomorrow, next month, when I turn 16, or next summer. We become actively engaged in the pastime of conditioning ourselves to believe that happiness and achievement are always somewhere in the future. There is an attitude of tolerating today, even looking past today in anticipation of a better tomorrow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-time-is-now.p5\" class=\"\">To people so inclined, the better future may never come. The pleasant future belongs to those who properly use today. We need to find the abundant life as we go along. How can we be happy tomorrow if our \u201cnows\u201d are filled with self-inflicted unhappinesses and unwise delays? Generally speaking, those inclined to count their daily blessings have more to count because they help make more possible as they learn gratitude. A constant waiting for a brighter future may cause us to lose the beautiful today. Some spend so much time getting ready to live for an unknown future, too late they discover there is no time to live. Very often in our anxiousness for the joys of the future we run away from the very things we are wanting and needing today. An appropriate examination of the passing moment will prove it leads to eternity. We need to constantly remind ourselves eternity is in process now.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-time-is-now.p6\" class=\"\">When the wise counsel \u201cmen should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16472\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16472)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16472)\">D&amp;C 58:27<\/a><\/span>) was said, the time structure referred only to now, today, and without delay. How unwise are those who want to delay repentance until tomorrow. With each passing day the process becomes more difficult to pursue. Most of our hurts and misunderstandings could be cleared away if treated today instead of waiting for them to go away tomorrow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-time-is-now.p7\" class=\"\">To live more fully each hour and to glean the most from each day is wisdom. How unwise we are to waste our todays when they determine the significance of our tomorrows. We should wisely live a day at a time because that is all we have. While our families are available to us we should take time to develop oneness, unity, and character. Girls of today are the women of tomorrow. Boys of today are the men of tomorrow. The kind of men and women we produce for the future depends on how they are taught to use today. How fortunate a child is to be raised in a home where love, respect, honor, integrity, and commitment are appropriately displayed each day. Mothers and fathers, we invite you to enjoy the fruits of improved parent-child relationships beginning now. Mothers and fathers classified as truly wonderful by appreciative children earn that rating by daily performance rather than by threat, procrastination, or purchase. We never give our children a lift when we give them a free ride.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-time-is-now.p8\" class=\"\">If we have good health, we should enjoy it. If we do not have good health, we should begin now to anxiously try to improve it. What a thrill it is to see people all around achieving, conquering, and overcoming through proper daily action, self-discipline, and total commitment. Progression and achievement belong to those who have learned to use the opportunity of now. Our strides of today will determine our locations tomorrow. Let me share with you an example of the results of daily determination and performance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-time-is-now.p9\" class=\"\">In 1960 the Olympics were held in Melbourne, Australia. There on the winner\u2019s platform in the spotlight one day stood a beautiful, tall, blonde American girl. She was being presented a gold medal, symbolic of first place in worldwide competition. As she stood there, some boys whistled and others were heard to say, \u201cThere\u2019s a gal who has everything.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-time-is-now.p10\" class=\"\">Tears ran down her cheeks as she accepted the recognition. Many thought she was touched by the victory ceremony. The thing most of the audience did not know was the story of her determination, self-discipline, and daily action. At the age of five she had polo. When the disease left her body, she couldn\u2019t use her arms or legs. Her parents took her daily to a swimming pool where they hoped the water would help hold her arms up as she tried to use them again. When she could lift her arm out of the water with her own power, she cried for joy. Then her goal was to swim the width of the pool, then the length, then several lengths. She kept on trying, swimming, enduring, day after day after day, until she won the gold medal for the butterfly stroke\u2014one of the most difficult of all swimming strokes\u2014in Melbourne, Australia.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-time-is-now.p11\" class=\"\">What if Shelly Mann had not been encouraged to achieve at age five and to continue and overcome?
