Maxwell was listening attentively to a presentation concerning the development of local leaders. Near the end of the meeting, Elder Maxwell asked, \u201cIs there more that we can do to help bishops bring peace and healing to the Saints?\u201d I was interested in knowing more of his concern, so just prior to his passing and in the privacy of his office, Elder Maxwell expanded on the doctrines associated with obtaining peace and healing. He gave encouragement to my sharing these remarks with Church members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/bringing-peace-and-healing-to-your-soul.p5\" class=\"\">Elder Maxwell was and remains a wonderful example of selfless love. His concerns for others were bone deep, especially for those with physical and emotional pains. Walking out of his office, one could not help but be more committed to being Christlike. He set a standard for us all. He loved the Savior. He was indeed a true Apostle and disciple. We miss him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/bringing-peace-and-healing-to-your-soul.p6\" class=\"\">He gave wonderful insights on how total peace and healing come only through full conversion of the soul. He commented on having learned years earlier from President Marion G. Romney concerning the steps to a complete conversion. He quoted from a 1963 general conference talk in which President Romney quoted the Savior\u2019s words to Peter: \u201cBut I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43716\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43716)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43716)\">Luke 22:32<\/a><\/span>). President Romney commented: \u201cIt would appear that membership in the Church and conversion are not necessarily synonymous. Being converted, as we are here using the term, and having a testimony are not necessarily the same either. A testimony comes when the Holy Ghost gives the earnest seeker a witness of truth. A moving testimony vitalizes faith; that is, it induces repentance and obedience to the commandments. Conversion, on the other hand, is the fruit of, or the reward for, repentance and obedience\u201d (in Conference Report, Oct. 1963, 24).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/bringing-peace-and-healing-to-your-soul.p7\" class=\"\">Conversion does not normally come all at once, even though the scriptures give us dramatic accounts. It comes in stages, until a person becomes at heart a new person. Being \u201cborn again\u201d is the scriptural term. It is a change of both how we think and how we feel (see Conference Report, Oct. 1963, 23\u201324).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/bringing-peace-and-healing-to-your-soul.p8\" class=\"\">In the Book of Mormon we read of Enos, whose soul hungered to know more of his father\u2019s teachings concerning eternal life. After a day and night of continuous prayer, he had a voice come to him that said, \u201cEnos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.\u201d Enos writes, \u201cI, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt was swept away\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43820\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43820)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43820)\">Enos 1:5\u20136<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/bringing-peace-and-healing-to-your-soul.p9\" class=\"\">We have the account of the prophet Alma the Younger recounting his conversion experience to his son Helaman. He told of coming to a dramatic realization of his past sins and mistakes, confessing his rebellion against his God. He then remembered his father, Alma, foretelling of the coming of one Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Jesus would come to atone for the sins of the world. I quote: \u201cNow, as my <span class=\"emphasis\">mind<\/span> caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my <span class=\"emphasis\">heart:<\/span> O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.\u201d Alma experienced eternal pain and guilt but realized that an escape was made possible through the Atonement. Alma continues: \u201cAnd now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more. And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43854\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43854)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43854)\">Alma 36:12\u201320<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/bringing-peace-and-healing-to-your-soul.p10\" class=\"\">Alma found his soul healed through the knowledge that Jesus would come and take away all his sins. As his soul became healed, he found peace within himself. Alma was so captured by the effects of this conversion experience that he repeated the sensations to Helaman: \u201cYea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and <span class=\"emphasis\">again I say unto you, my son,<\/span> that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43855\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43855)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43855)\">Alma 36:21<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added). He was teaching a pattern to his son of lasting peace and joy, just as Enos\u2019s father had done. There is a pattern here of fathers teaching children about the Atonement and eternal life. It is a pattern for all fathers in our day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/bringing-peace-and-healing-to-your-soul.p11\" class=\"\">Several instructive points come to mind about Alma\u2019s conversion:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Like Enos, he had a vivid awareness and remorse for past sins that had offended God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Like Enos, he remembered his father\u2019s teachings\u2014the promise of atonement for sin, through Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Like Enos, he personally pleaded in supplication for his soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">4.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Like Enos, he experienced the miracle of the Atonement to the degree that he could neither remember the pains from his sins nor feel guilt. The healing of his soul was complete. It was a cleansing experience both to the mind and the heart. Joy replaced bitterness. He became a new man, born again of the Spirit. And like Enos, he immediately turned his attention to serving the Lord and his fellow beings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/bringing-peace-and-healing-to-your-soul.p16\" class=\"\">Will the Lord do for us what He did for Enos and Alma?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/bringing-peace-and-healing-to-your-soul.p17\" class=\"\">C. S. Lewis put it this way: \u201c[God] has infinite attention to spare for each one of us. He does not have to deal with us in the mass. You are as much alone with Him as if you were the only being He had ever created.

We have a number of examples. The account of the Saints in King Benjamin\u2019s time will illustrate.

It involves awakening the Spirit of Christ, which is in all men and women (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43982\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43982)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43982)\">D&amp;C 84:45\u201346<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43990\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43990)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43990)\">D&amp;C 88:11<\/a><\/span>).
