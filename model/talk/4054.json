It is called the testimony of Jesus. In our day it includes the revealed knowledge that the earthly kingdom\u2014The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2014will triumph. In this connection may I set before you this illustration:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-caravan-moves-on.p71\" class=\"\">The Church is like a great caravan\u2014organized, prepared, following an appointed course, with its captains of tens and captains of hundreds all in place.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-caravan-moves-on.p72\" class=\"\">What does it matter if a few barking dogs snap at the heels of the weary travelers? Or that predators claim those few who fall by the way? The caravan moves on.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-caravan-moves-on.p73\" class=\"\">Is there a ravine to cross, a miry mud hole to pull through, a steep grade to climb? So be it. The oxen are strong and the teamsters wise. The caravan moves on.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-caravan-moves-on.p74\" class=\"\">Are there storms that rage along the way, floods that wash away the bridges, deserts to cross, and rivers to ford? Such is life in this fallen sphere. The caravan moves on.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-caravan-moves-on.p75\" class=\"\">Ahead is the celestial city, the eternal Zion of our God, where all who maintain their position in the caravan shall find food and drink and rest. Thank God that the caravan moves on!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-caravan-moves-on.p76\" class=\"\">In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
