However, I am aware that by means of modern television technology and the courtesy of a number of television stations, I am privileged also to speak to many who are not members of our church and who may not be familiar with all of its doctrines and beliefs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/the-golden-thread-of-choice.p4\" class=\"\">Today, I would like to address both groups, members of our church as well as others, about one of the most important tenets of our faith and one of the most precious of God\u2019s gifts to mankind. It is our freedom, our agency, our inalienable and divine right to choose what we will believe and what we will not believe, and to choose what we want to be and what we want to do. I wish to speak of our responsibility and our opportunity to choose God, and the good, and eternal life; or to select evil, the destructive, and that which leads to painful misery and despair.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/the-golden-thread-of-choice.p5\" class=\"\">Abraham Lincoln once asked, \u201cWhat constitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and independence?\u201d He then answered, \u201cIt is not our frowning battlements, our bristling sea coasts, our army and our navy. \u2026 Our reliance is in the love of liberty which God has planted in us.\u201d (Speech at Edwardsville, Illinois, 11 Sept. 1858, quoted in John Bartlett, <span class=\"emphasis\">Familiar Quotations,<\/span> Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1968, p. 636.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/the-golden-thread-of-choice.p6\" class=\"\">There are, of course, those who, in bitterness and disbelief, have rejected the idea of an independent spirit in man that is capable of free will and choice and true liberty.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/the-golden-thread-of-choice.p7\" class=\"\">We declare a bright and glorious view of God and man to all who will hear, a view revealed in and illuminated by the restored light of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Well, it happened long before man\u2019s mortal birth. It happened in a great premortal existence where we developed our identities and increased our spiritual capabilities by exercising our agency and making important choices. We developed our intelligence and learned to love the truth, and we prepared to come to earth to continue our progress.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/the-golden-thread-of-choice.p14\" class=\"\">Our Father in Heaven wanted our growth to continue in mortality and to be enhanced by our freedom to choose and learn. He also wanted us to exercise our faith and our will, especially with a new physical body to master and control. But we know from both ancient and modern revelation that Satan wished to deny us our independence and agency in that now-forgotten moment long ago, even as he wishes to deny them this very hour. Indeed, Satan violently opposed the freedom of choice offered by the Father, so violently that John in the Revelation described \u201cwar in heaven\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42566\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42566)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42566)\">Rev. 12:7<\/a><\/span>) over the matter. Satan would have coerced us, and he would have robbed us of that most precious of gifts if he could: our freedom to choose a divine future and the exaltation we all hope to obtain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/the-golden-thread-of-choice.p15\" class=\"\">Through Christ and his valiant defense of our Father\u2019s plan, the course of agency and eternal aspirations prevailed. In that crucial, premortal setting, a major milestone was passed, a monumental victory was won. As a result, we would be allowed to continue to pursue what President David O. McKay once described as the \u201ceternal principle of progress.\u201d Later Christ himself would come to earth, President McKay noted, \u201cto perfect society by perfecting the individual, and only by the exercising of Free Agency can the individual even approach perfection.\u201d (In Conference Report, Apr. 1940, p. 118.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/the-golden-thread-of-choice.p16\" class=\"\">So we came to our mortality, like Jeremiah, known by God as his literal spirit children, having the privilege to choose our personal path on matters of belief and religious conviction. With Christ\u2019s triumph in heaven in overcoming Lucifer, and later his triumph on earth in overcoming the effects of Adam\u2019s fall and the death of all mankind, \u201cthe children of men\u201d continue \u201cfree forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not be acted upon. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/the-golden-thread-of-choice.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, men are free \u2026 to choose liberty and eternal life, through [Christ] the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4335\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4335)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4335)\">2 Ne. 2:26\u201327<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/the-golden-thread-of-choice.p18\" class=\"\">To fully understand this gift of agency and its inestimable worth, it is imperative that we understand that God\u2019s chief way of acting is by persuasion and patience and long-suffering, not by coercion and stark confrontation. He acts by gentle solicitation and by sweet enticement. He always acts with unfailing respect for the freedom and independence that we possess. He wants to help us and pleads for the chance to assist us, but he will not do so in violation of our agency. He loves us too much to do that, and doing so would run counter to his divine character.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/the-golden-thread-of-choice.p19\" class=\"\">Brigham Young once said: \u201cThe volition of [man] is free; this is a law of their existence, and the Lord cannot violate his own law; were he to do that, he would cease to be God. \u2026 This is a law which has always existed from all eternity, and will continue to exist throughout all the eternities to come.

His gentle, peaceful, powerful persuasion to do right and find joy will be with us \u201cso long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38571\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38571)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38571)\">Moro. 7:36<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/the-golden-thread-of-choice.p21\" class=\"\">Given the freedom to choose, we may, in fact, make wrong choices, bad choices, hurtful choices.

He has provided a mediating atonement for the wrong choices we make. He is our advocate with the Father and has paid, in advance, for the faults and foolishness we often see in the exercise of our freedom. We must accept his gift, repent of those mistakes, and follow his commandments in order to take full advantage of this redemption. The offer is always there; the way is always open.
