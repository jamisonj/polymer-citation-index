Let us just consider two examples. The first is from the New Testament. There is a story in the book of John about two disciples who followed John the Baptist.

They were numbered among those who were seeking to destroy the Church, and were using much flattery of speech to lead the people into doing all manner of iniquity. After the pleadings of Alma\u2019s father, the Lord interceded and called Alma to repentance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/go-ye-therefore-and-teach-all-nations.p25\" class=\"\">It is most interesting to see what occurred when the light of the gospel came into his life.

When such a \u201cpearl of great price\u201d comes into our lives, we cannot be content just to admire it by ourselves. It must be shared! And here is the great joy and happiness of the gift!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/go-ye-therefore-and-teach-all-nations.p32\" class=\"\">I have especially been impressed with the older couples who, after fulfilling a life of service in their wards and stakes, have the desire to spend a period of time as missionaries in full service to the Lord.

These quotations are from a composite of letters. They were written to their mission president and his wife after the couples had been serving in the mission field for some time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/go-ye-therefore-and-teach-all-nations.p34\" class=\"\">\u201cWe never asked to be sent on a mission. We didn\u2019t feel qualified. My husband had had only four years of formal education, and was very sensitive about that. He read a lot and was very successful in business. He had a special personality which drew people to him. Several couples we knew had gone on missions, and we were happy for them. When the bishop called us into his office and said that he had been praying for two weeks and that the Lord wanted us to go on a mission, we were overwhelmed. We accepted, as we knew it was from the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/go-ye-therefore-and-teach-all-nations.p35\" class=\"\">\u201cMy husband\u2019s back was in poor condition. He had asked for a little time to see if he could find a doctor who could help him in some way. The doctor\u2019s response was, \u2018Just go home and learn to live with the pain.\u2019 When we were set apart for our mission, my husband was promised that he would be blessed with better health. The promise was literally fulfilled.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/go-ye-therefore-and-teach-all-nations.p36\" class=\"\">\u201cWe entered the Missionary Training Center. Those few weeks we spent were very special to us. It was difficult for us to learn the discussions, but we found a close relationship with the Lord. As we did the very best we could, He blessed us. We knew we would have to rely on the Lord to help us after we had done all we could.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/go-ye-therefore-and-teach-all-nations.p37\" class=\"\">\u201cThere is a feeling of love and closeness at the MTC that cannot be found in any other place. We went to the temple each week. We found that, next to the temple, the MTC was the closest to being near our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, that you could possibly find here on earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/go-ye-therefore-and-teach-all-nations.p38\" class=\"\">\u201cThe privilege of serving a full-time mission together was an outstanding time in our lives. It was a time during which we drew close together as we studied and prayed so much together. We learned more fully to depend upon one another. We found great joy in becoming more aware of one another\u2019s strengths. We anticipated the opportunity of helping each other overcome our weaknesses. In the autumn of our lives, it was a time of ripening and cementing together. This is an experience every couple should have if they are physically able and can financially afford it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/go-ye-therefore-and-teach-all-nations.p39\" class=\"\">\u201cIf they can\u2019t afford it, their families would be greatly blessed if they would assist them. It would be much better than giving them a trip to Hawaii or Europe.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/go-ye-therefore-and-teach-all-nations.p40\" class=\"\">One couple then reported, as they concluded their mission, that in the final testimony meeting these words were spoken of them: \u201cDear elder and sister, you just can\u2019t imagine what our life was like before you came.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/go-ye-therefore-and-teach-all-nations.p41\" class=\"\">Of course, returning home after such an experience is a challenge. I met a good brother coming out of the Mormon Handicraft store just before Christmas. He had been in buying his wife a Christmas present. As I was coming down the street, he ran up to me and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember me?\u201d I had to be prompted a little. When we last met, it was in the mission field. Living conditions were certainly not like home. But there was a radiance about him and his wife as we had opportunity to be with them for a day and witness their work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/go-ye-therefore-and-teach-all-nations.p42\" class=\"\">I said to him, \u201cIt must be great to be back home.\u201d He hesitated a minute, and then said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve had a difficult time adjusting. I feel that we should be back among the Saints in the Philippines. They needed us so much. I don\u2019t find that same need here. Can\u2019t you send us back on another mission?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/go-ye-therefore-and-teach-all-nations.p43\" class=\"\">Mission presidents always respond the same when I ask them the following question: \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d The response invariably is, \u201cSend us more missionary couples.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/go-ye-therefore-and-teach-all-nations.p44\" class=\"\">Now, to all you great couples who are hearing my voice today, I want you to listen especially to these words. Life has been hard. I know that. You have worked diligently for the security you now enjoy. You have struggled, reared a family, and saved something to have and to enjoy during this golden period of your life. But just sitting around will not give you what you really desire.

So also do I feel sorry for those who have never experienced the sweet joy resulting from reaching out their hands and helping those who were needy. Assuredly there is more blessing comes to us from giving than in accumulating; there is no question of this in my mind. There is also more blessing comes to us in going forth to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ, and laboring for the salvation of the souls of men, than can possibly come to us by merely having a knowledge of the truth of our religion, and then remaining at home to mingle and labor in the ordinary affairs of life, and accumulate the wealth of this world that perishes with the using.
