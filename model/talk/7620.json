We have felt the Spirit of the Lord in rich abundance these past two days as our hearts have been touched and our testimonies of this divine work have been strengthened. I am certain I represent the membership of the Church everywhere in expressing appreciation to the brethren and sisters who have addressed us. I am reminded of the words of Moroni found in the Book of Mormon: \u201cAnd their meetings were conducted by the church after the manner of the workings of the Spirit, and by the power of the Holy Ghost; for as the power of the Holy Ghost led them whether to preach, or to exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate, or to sing, even so it was done.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-02211_000_035\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117535\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117535)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117535)\">Moroni 6:9<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/until-we-meet-again.p5\" class=\"\">May we long remember what we have heard during this general conference.

The entire membership of the Church has benefited from your countless contributions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/until-we-meet-again.p7\" class=\"\">I assure you that our Heavenly Father is mindful of the challenges we face in the world today.

Working together, we can alleviate suffering and provide for those in need. In addition to the service you give as you care for one another, your contributions to the funds of the Church enable us to respond almost immediately when disasters occur anywhere in the world. We are nearly always among the first on the scene to provide whatever assistance we can. We thank you for your generosity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/until-we-meet-again.p10\" class=\"\">There are other difficulties in the lives of some. Particularly among the young, there are those who are tragically involved in such things as drugs, immorality, gangs, and all the serious problems that go with them. In addition, there are those who are lonely, including widows and widowers, who long for the company and the concern of others. May we ever be mindful of the needs of those around us and be ready to extend a helping hand and a loving heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/until-we-meet-again.p11\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, how blessed we are that the heavens are indeed open, that the restored Church of Jesus Christ is upon the earth today, and that the Church is founded upon the rock of revelation. We know that continuous revelation is the very lifeblood of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/until-we-meet-again.p12\" class=\"\">May each of us go safely to our homes.
