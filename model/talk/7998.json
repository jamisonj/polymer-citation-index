This particular Sunday she arrived at church having walked two miles (3\u00a0km) in heavy mud. She immediately went into the restroom, removed her muddy clothes, washed, and put on clean Sunday clothes. In the Relief Society meeting she told of her conversion. I was touched by her overwhelming desire to be washed clean and pure through repentance and the atoning sacrifice of the Savior and her willingness to give up her \u201cold life\u201d in order to make sacred covenants with our Father in Heaven. She had separated from her boyfriend, was overcoming addictions in order to live the Word of Wisdom, quit her Sunday job, and lost the friendship of loved ones when she announced her plans to be baptized. She was so anxious to give away all of her sins that she might be washed clean and feel the redeeming love of the Savior. I was inspired that morning by her desire to become both physically and spiritually clean.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/general-relief-society-meeting\/claim-the-blessings-of-your-covenants.p7\" class=\"\">We know that many of you have made similar sacrifices as you have felt the witness of the Holy Ghost and have longed to repent, be baptized, and be made clean. Perhaps at no other time do we feel the divine love of the Savior as abundantly as we do when we repent and feel His loving arms outstretched to embrace us and assure us of His love and acceptance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/general-relief-society-meeting\/claim-the-blessings-of-your-covenants.p8\" class=\"\">A few Sundays ago as I listened to the sacrament prayer, I was moved by the way that the priest pronounced each word with great feeling. Later I called that priest to thank him for helping make the sacrament a deep spiritual experience for me and the congregation. He was not at home, but his mother responded, \u201cOh, he will be so happy that you called! This was his first time giving the sacrament prayer, and we have been preparing together, talking about the importance of the sacrament and worthily renewing our baptismal covenants with the Savior.\u201d How I love this dear mother for teaching her son about the power of baptismal covenants and how he can help the members of the ward feel that power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/general-relief-society-meeting\/claim-the-blessings-of-your-covenants.p9\" class=\"\">Another mother I know of has sat alone at church for a number of years with her four young children. Seldom able to concentrate on the Savior during the sacrament, she formed a plan. Now she tries to spend time each Saturday reviewing her week and thinking about her covenants and what she needs to repent of. \u201cThen,\u201d she says, \u201cno matter what kind of an experience I have with my children on Sunday, I am prepared to partake of the sacrament, renew my covenants, and feel of the cleansing power of the Atonement.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/general-relief-society-meeting\/claim-the-blessings-of-your-covenants.p10\" class=\"\">Why does the Savior put so much importance upon the sacrament, dear sisters?
