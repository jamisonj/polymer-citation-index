He started to recount the things that had happened that they all knew were a part of their heritage. He went back to the coming of the children of Israel out of Egypt. He said: \u201cYou know what happened. There they were right against the Red Sea with the Egyptians coming, and the Lord saved them\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"1870\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1870)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1870)\">1 Ne. 17:26\u201327<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/developing-faith.p20\" class=\"\">Then he goes on and talks about how they received manna in the wilderness, how they received water from a rock, how the Lord led them by a pillar of cloud in the daytime and a light at night, and how when they crossed the Jordan, it stopped when the feet of the priests touched the water (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"1871\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1871)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1871)\">1 Ne. 17:28\u201330, 32<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"22950\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22950)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22950)\">Ex. 13:21<\/a><\/span>, <span class=\"citation\" id=\"30122\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30122)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30122)\">Josh. 3:15\u201317<\/a><\/span>). And then Nephi tells how the Lord scattered the people; and then how, when they came among the flying serpents, Moses fashioned a brazen serpent, raised it, and all they had to do was look at that serpent, and they would be healed. The account says that many perished because they wouldn\u2019t even look (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"30123\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30123)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30123)\">1 Ne. 17:32, 41<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"41133\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41133)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41133)\">Num. 21:8\u20139<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/developing-faith.p21\" class=\"\">He was trying to do what you and I as parents need to do with our families today\u2014to develop faith in the Lord. And the way to do it is to recount the examples of faith that have happened in our history and in our heritage and with our people. That\u2019s the value of history. It contains accounts of faith of our own blood and ancestry and of our own people and our children. As has already been said in this conference, we cannot go one generation without losing faith if we do not do this. And to rear a generation of faith for what we must do in these days, you and I simply must develop and increase faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/developing-faith.p22\" class=\"\">There\u2019s another principle: that is, that faith precedes the miracle. This lesson is found in Ether, chapter 12. You\u2019ll recall that Moroni was abridging the records of the twenty-four plates, and this is what he records:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/developing-faith.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd it came to pass that Ether did prophesy great and marvelous things unto the people, which they did not believe, because they saw them not\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22367\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22367)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22367)\">Ether 12:5<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/developing-faith.p24\" class=\"\">They couldn\u2019t see them; they wouldn\u2019t believe them. They needed to be taught that <span class=\"emphasis\">believing<\/span> is seeing. And then Moroni interpolates here:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/developing-faith.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until <span class=\"emphasis\">after<\/span> the trial of your faith\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22368\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22368)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22368)\">Ether 12:6<\/a><\/span>; italics added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/developing-faith.p26\" class=\"\">We need to learn that. We can\u2019t have just faith. We cannot have the miracle until <span class=\"emphasis\">after<\/span> the exercise of faith. Moroni sets forth on the next page or so instances of those miracles that have occurred after the trial of the faith of the people. We need to learn that principle as well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/developing-faith.p27\" class=\"\">I recall that when I was twenty years old, I went for an interview with the bishop to go on a mission.
