On the day of his birth, as the proud parents looked down upon this tiny baby, they could not have known what a profound impact he would have upon the world. A choice spirit had come to dwell in its earthly tabernacle; he has affected our lives and has taught us\u2014through his own example\u2014essential lessons. Today I should like to share a few of those lessons with you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/the-prophet-joseph-smith-teacher-by-example.p7\" class=\"\">When Joseph was about six or seven years old, he and his brothers and sisters were stricken with typhus fever. Although the others recovered readily, Joseph was left with a painful sore on his leg. The doctors, using the best medicine they had, treated him, and yet the sore persisted. In order to save Joseph\u2019s life, they said, he would have to lose his leg. Thankfully, however, soon after that diagnosis, the doctors returned to the Smith home and reported that there was a new procedure which might save Joseph\u2019s leg. They wanted to operate immediately and had brought some cord with which to tie little Joseph to the bed so that he wouldn\u2019t thrash about, since they had nothing with which to dull the pain. Young Joseph, however, told them, \u201cYou won\u2019t need to tie me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/the-prophet-joseph-smith-teacher-by-example.p8\" class=\"\">The doctors suggested he take some brandy or wine so that the pain might not be so severe. \u201cNo,\u201d young Joseph replied. \u201cIf my father will sit on the bed and hold me in his arms, I will do whatever is necessary.\u201d Joseph Smith Sr. held in his arms his small child, and the doctors removed the diseased piece of bone. Although young Joseph was lame for some time afterward, he was healed.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-25911_000_023\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Lucy Mack Smith, <span class=\"emphasis\">History of Joseph Smith by His Mother,<\/span> ed.

He later described the great religious revival which seemed everywhere present at this time and of prime concern to nearly everyone. Joseph, himself, longed to know which church he should join. He writes in his history:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/the-prophet-joseph-smith-teacher-by-example.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cI often said to myself: \u2026 Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together?

Early one morning he stepped into a grove, now called sacred, and knelt and prayed, having faith that God would give him the enlightenment which he so earnestly sought. Two personages appeared to Joseph\u2014the Father and the Son\u2014and he was told, in answer to his question, that he was to join none of the churches, for none of them was true. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught us the principle of <span class=\"strong\">faith<\/span>\u2014by example. His simple prayer of faith on that spring morning in 1820 brought about this marvelous work which continues today throughout the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/the-prophet-joseph-smith-teacher-by-example.p13\" class=\"\">A few days after his prayer in the Sacred Grove, Joseph Smith gave an account of his vision to a preacher with whom he was acquainted. To his surprise, his communication was treated with \u201ccontempt\u201d and \u201cwas the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase.\u201d Joseph, however, did not waver. He later wrote, \u201cI had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true. \u2026 For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-25911_000_023\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44790\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44790)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44790)\">JS\u2014H 1:21\u201322, 25<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Despite the physical and mental punishment at the hands of his opponents which the Prophet Joseph Smith endured throughout the remainder of his life, he did not falter.

One can but imagine the dedication, the devotion, and the labor required to translate in fewer than 90 days this record of over 500 pages covering a period of 2,600 years. I love the words Oliver Cowdery used to describe the time he spent assisting Joseph with the translation of the Book of Mormon: \u201cThese were days never to be forgotten\u2014to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven, awakened the utmost gratitude of this bosom!\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-25911_000_023\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44796\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44796)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44796)\">JS\u2014H 1:71<\/a><\/span>, footnote.]<\/span><\/sup> The Prophet Joseph Smith taught us <span class=\"strong\">diligence<\/span>\u2014by example.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/the-prophet-joseph-smith-teacher-by-example.p16\" class=\"\">As we know, the Prophet Joseph sent forth missionaries to preach the restored gospel.

He had seen in vision the Saints leaving Nauvoo and going to the Rocky Mountains. He was anxious that his people be led away from their tormentors and into this promised land which the Lord had shown him. He no doubt longed to be with them. However, he had been issued an arrest warrant on trumped up charges. Despite many appeals to Governor Ford, the charges were not dismissed. Joseph left his home, his wife, his family, and his people and gave himself up to the civil authorities, knowing he would probably never return.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/the-prophet-joseph-smith-teacher-by-example.p18\" class=\"\">These are the words he spoke as he journeyed to Carthage: \u201cI am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer\u2019s morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-25911_000_023\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44764\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44764)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44764)\">D&amp;C 135:4<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/the-prophet-joseph-smith-teacher-by-example.p19\" class=\"\">In Carthage Jail he was incarcerated with his brother Hyrum and others.

Hyrum was killed, and John Taylor was wounded. Joseph Smith\u2019s last great act here upon the earth was one of selflessness. He crossed the room, most likely \u201cthinking that it would save the lives of his brethren in the room if he could get out, \u2026 and sprang into the window when two balls pierced him from the door, and one entered his right breast from without.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-25911_000_023\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 6:618.]<\/span><\/sup> He gave his life; Willard Richards and John Taylor were spared. \u201cGreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-25911_000_023\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44542\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44542)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44542)\">John 15:13<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> The Prophet Joseph Smith taught us <span class=\"strong\">love<\/span>\u2014by example.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/the-prophet-joseph-smith-teacher-by-example.p20\" class=\"\">In retrospect, over 160 years later, although the events of June 27, 1844, were tragic, we are provided comfort as we realize that Joseph Smith\u2019s Martyrdom was not the last chapter in this account.
