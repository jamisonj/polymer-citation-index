His confession surprised me. He had been an active member of the Church for years. I wondered how a person with his experience could have committed the sin that he did. After some pondering, it came to me that this brother had never become truly converted. Despite his Church activity, the gospel had not penetrated his heart. It was only an external influence in his life. When he was in wholesome environments, he kept the commandments, but in a different environment, other influences might control his actions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/when-thou-art-converted.p6\" class=\"\">How can you become converted? How can you make the gospel of Jesus Christ not just an influence in your life but the controlling influence and, indeed, the very core of what you are? The ancient prophet Jeremiah spoke of the law of God, the gospel, being written in our hearts. He quotes the Lord speaking about us, His people in the latter days: \u201cI will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-24905_000_006\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43237\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43237)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43237)\">Jer. 31:33<\/a><\/span>.

Without a heartfelt desire, you can participate in sacrament meetings, classes, and Church activities and do the things I will tell you, but it won\u2019t make much difference. But if your heart is open and willing, like the heart of a child,<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-24905_000_006\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43267\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43267)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43267)\">Matt. 18:3\u20134<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> let me tell you what you can do to be converted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/when-thou-art-converted.p8\" class=\"\">As a first step, you must lay aside any feeling of pride that is so common in the world today. By this I mean the attitude that rejects the authority of God to rule in our lives. This attitude was described by the Lord to Joseph Smith when He said, \u201cThey seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-24905_000_006\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43520\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43520)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43520)\">D&amp;C 1:16<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43469\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43469)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43469)\">Hel. 12:6<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> You hear it expressed today in phrases such as \u201cDo your own thing\u201d or \u201cRight and wrong depend on what I feel is right for me.\u201d That attitude is a rebellion against God, just as Lucifer rebelled against God in the premortal world.

Our beloved Creator does not force us to accept His authority, but willingly submitting to that authority is the first step in conversion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/when-thou-art-converted.p9\" class=\"\">Further, for the gospel to be written in your heart, you need to know what it is and grow to understand it more fully. That means you will study it.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-24905_000_006\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[We are exceptionally fortunate to have so much of the recorded word of God at our fingertips. In prior ages of the world\u2019s history, very few people had copies of the scriptures in their possession. They had to try to remember what they could whenever they heard scriptures read in sermons. What an incomparable blessing that you can have your own copy to read whenever you want. You can see how the gospel works in the lives of people who were converted, from Adam\u2019s time down to our own time.]<\/span><\/sup> When I say \u201cstudy,\u201d I mean something more than reading. It is a good thing sometimes to read a book of scripture within a set period of time to get an overall sense of its message, but for conversion, you should care more about the amount of time you spend in the scriptures than about the amount you read in that time. I see you sometimes reading a few verses, stopping to ponder them, carefully reading the verses again, and as you think about what they mean, praying for understanding, asking questions in your mind, waiting for spiritual impressions, and writing down the impressions and insights that come so you can remember and learn more. Studying in this way, you may not read a lot of chapters or verses in a half hour, but you will be giving place in your heart for the word of God, and He will be speaking to you. Remember Alma\u2019s description of what it feels like: \u201cIt beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-24905_000_006\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43449\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43449)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43449)\">Alma 32:28<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> You will know that the gospel is being written in your heart, that your conversion is happening, as the word of the Lord from His prophets, past and present, feels more and more delicious to your soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/when-thou-art-converted.p10\" class=\"\">I mentioned praying as you study to understand the scriptures, but your prayers must not be limited to that. In the Book of Mormon, Amulek tells us we should pray about everything in our lives. He says, \u201cPour out your souls [to God] in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-24905_000_006\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43455\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43455)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43455)\">Alma 34:26<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Your Heavenly Father wants you to pray about your hopes and fears, your friends and family, your school and work, and the needs of those around you.

In your heart you will want to do what these holy beings ask of you. Go often to your closet, your secret place, your wilderness. Thank God for your blessings; ask for His help; ask Him to bestow upon you the pure love of Christ. Sometimes fasting will help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/when-thou-art-converted.p11\" class=\"\">After Amulek talked about prayer, he spoke about something else that is an important element of your conversion\u2014serving others.

Having avoided that problem, they realized they were in a place unknown to either of them. As they turned to look for help, they saw a woman.

On the way they had to pass a bar with patrons sitting along the sidewalk in the gathering darkness. These men also appeared threatening. Nevertheless, the two young women had the distinct impression that the men could not see them. They walked by, apparently invisible to those who might have had a mind to harm them.
