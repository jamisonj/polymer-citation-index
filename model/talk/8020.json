Three days after returning, I attended a Hello Day dance at the University of Utah with a friend of mine. He told me about a beautiful sophomore named Barbara Bowen, whom he thought I ought to meet. He brought her over and introduced us, and we started to dance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/following-up.p6\" class=\"\">Unfortunately, this was what we used to call a \u201ctag dance,\u201d which meant that you got to dance with the girl only until somebody else tagged you out. Barbara was vivacious and popular, so I got to dance with her for less than a minute before another young man tagged me out.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/following-up.p7\" class=\"\">That was just not acceptable to me. Having learned the importance of follow-up on my mission, I got her telephone number and called her the very next day to ask her out, but she was busy with school and social commitments. Thankfully, my mission taught me to be persistent even in the face of discouragement, and I was eventually able to make a date. And that date led to others. Somehow during those dates I was able to convince her that I was the only true and living returned missionary\u2014at least as far as she should be concerned. Now, 64 years later, there are seven children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren who stand as evidence of the significant truth that no matter how good your message is, you may not get a chance to deliver it without consistent, persistent follow-up.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/following-up.p8\" class=\"\">This may be why I have felt the clear impression to follow up today on two of my previous general conference messages.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/following-up.p9\" class=\"\">In the October 2011 conference, I urged that we remember these important words of the Lord: \u201cFor thus shall my church be called in the last days, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10905_000_42ballard\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129649\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129649)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129649)\">Doctrine and Covenants 115:4<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/following-up.p10\" class=\"\">With these words, the Lord makes clear that this is not only a formal title but also the name by which His Church is to be called.

The name of a former college classmate came into his mind. He reached out to her over Facebook, and he learned that she had been praying for purpose and meaning in her life. He followed up just at the time she was searching for the truth, and in December she was baptized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/following-up.p16\" class=\"\">Many similar invitations were reported to me, but only a few people have followed up like this brother did.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/following-up.p17\" class=\"\">I\u2019m a great believer in the principle of follow-up. As it says in the missionary guide <span class=\"emphasis\">Preach My Gospel,<\/span> \u201cextending an invitation without following up is like beginning a journey without finishing it or buying a ticket to a concert without going into the theater.

But notice that there is much more to missionary work for members than simply extending invitations to people to listen to the missionaries.

They are prepared to teach by the Spirit, with sincere and heartfelt inspiration from the Lord.
