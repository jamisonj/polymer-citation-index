As I completed the interview and signed the recommend, tears were streaming down her cheeks. I said, \u201cPlease share with me your feelings.\u201d Then she told me the following story.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/ye-also-shall-bear-witness.p5\" class=\"\">Since her youth she had sought to find truth and direction in her life. She had yearned to find peace and happiness, but no matter where she looked, she could not find it. It had come to a point where she was very distraught, assuming there was really nothing in life that had true meaning or was fulfilling. In this frame of mind, one evening while visiting a dear friend and recounting her concerns and despair she said: \u201cI looked behind the sofa where I was sitting to the bookshelf. My eyes fell upon a particular volume, and a compelling feeling cameover me. I knew I needed to find out what was written on its pages.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/ye-also-shall-bear-witness.p6\" class=\"\">She took the book from the shelf and read the title, the Book of Mormon. She asked her friend where she had received it. Her friend indicated that two young missionaries stopped her on the street and gave her the book but only after a commitment to read it. Due to a lack of time, she had just put it on the shelf.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/ye-also-shall-bear-witness.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cI started to read,\u201d she said. \u201cI could not put it down.\u201d A feeling came over her that she had never felt before. Her friend told her that she could take the book with her. She went home and continued to read through the night. The next morning she went into the streets looking for the two young missionaries. It didn\u2019t take long to find them. They agreed to teach her the gospel, and in a few weeks she was baptized a member of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/ye-also-shall-bear-witness.p8\" class=\"\">Through her tears, she explained that since that day she had found a joy and inner peace that she never dreamed possible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/ye-also-shall-bear-witness.p9\" class=\"\">Living in a small town with few members and even fewer opportunities to marry in the Church, she didn\u2019t dare hope that she might one day marry in the temple. But she felt it was through the guidance of the Holy Spirit that she met a young man while vacationing in another country. He was a member of the Church and honored his priesthood. They had fallen in love, and he had asked her to marry him in the temple. The realization that she could now go to the house of the Lord and be sealed for time and all eternity brought joy to her soul and feelings of thankfulness and gratitude that were overwhelming and impossible to describe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/ye-also-shall-bear-witness.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cI continue to ask myself,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy me? Why me? I am so blessed.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/ye-also-shall-bear-witness.p11\" class=\"\">Her humble, sweet spirit and testimony touched me deeply. As she left, we both shed tears of joy and appreciation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/ye-also-shall-bear-witness.p12\" class=\"\">I have often thought of that experience, and each time I do, it brings a deep feeling of gratitude for our Savior and what He has done for us, for the price that He paid to make it possible for each one of us to find inner peace in a troubled world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/ye-also-shall-bear-witness.p13\" class=\"\">President David O.
