As a result, I crossed Lima\u2019s Plaza de Armas many times. The Government Palace, the official residence and office of Peru\u2019s president, faces the plaza. My companions and I invited people in the plaza to hear the restored gospel. I often wondered then what it would be like to enter the palace, but the thought of ever doing so seemed wildly remote.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-time-shall-come.p6\" class=\"\">Last year, Elder D.\u00a0Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a few others, and I met with Alan Garc\u00eda, then the president of Peru, in the Government Palace. We were shown its beautiful rooms and cordially received by President Garc\u00eda. My young missionary wonderings about the palace were fulfilled in a way that I would never have dreamed possible in 1970.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-time-shall-come.p7\" class=\"\">Things have changed in Peru since I was a missionary, especially for the Church. There were about 11,000 members of the Church there then and just one stake. Today there are more than 500,000 members and almost 100 stakes. In towns where there were just little groups of members, vibrant stakes and attractive meetinghouses now grace the land.

He was given the opportunity to interpret King Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s dream. Daniel asked God to reveal to him the dream and its interpretation, and his prayer was answered.

A stone was cut out of a mountain without hands and rolled forth, gradually growing in size.
