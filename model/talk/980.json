I have\nasked him to help me. I would appreciate an equal prayer from you to the same end.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is Easter time. The celebration of the resurrection has just passed, and sometimes there is\na tendency to think that thereafter the Lord ascended, and we have nothing more to do about\nit. I have had particularly in mind two or three passages that I shall try to recall.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the Passover chamber, the Lord said, \". . . I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man\ncometh unto the Father, but by me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27855\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27855)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27855)\">John 14:6<\/a><\/span>).\nAt various times in his mission, he added\nthe word \"light,\" so that in its complete form it stands, \"I am the way, the truth, the life, and\nthe light.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI remember that at the time of the raising of Lazarus, the Lord said, in response to a\nstatement from Martha:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet\nshall he live:<br \/>\n\"And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?<br \/>\n\"She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which\nshould come into the world\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27850\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27850)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27850)\">John 11:25-27<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nPeter, speaking to the Sanhedrin, in response to their question, \". . . By what power, or by\nwhat name, have ye done this?\" replied, \". . . by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom\nye crucified, . . . for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we\nmust be saved\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7843\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7843)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7843)\">Acts 4:7-10,12<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nAs I have read the record, I have been persuaded that not so fully did the apostles themselves,\nup until after the resurrection, understand who the Savior was or might be, as did the learned\nmen of Israel, who saw, who partially understood, and who feared.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior, the Book tells us in Acts, remained on the earth after his resurrection for forty\ndays (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7833\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7833)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7833)\">Acts 1:3<\/a><\/span>),\nduring which time he worked and preached and, I would assume, assisted in setting in\norder his Church.\n<\/p><p>\nBut I thought that I might run over, so far as my memory serves me, a few of the visual\ndemonstrations that were given in those early days of the Resurrected Christ. You remember\nthat an earthquake came before the break of day and rolled back the stone from the sepulchre.\nWe are not given an account as to how the Savior came from the sepulchre except that we\nread that the burial clothes were left in the sepulchre itself.\n<\/p><p>\nYou remember that Mary Magdalene was the first, even before the dawn broke, to go to the\nsepulchre. Seeing it open, she rushed to tell Peter and John. They not realizing, not\nunderstanding, not knowing what to look for, rushed to the sepulchre and found it empty\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27881\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27881)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27881)\">John 20:1-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nShortly after that the women came with spices because there had been no time on the\nprevious Friday night properly to prepare the Christ for his burial. They did not understand\nthat he was to be resurrected on the morning of the third day, for they came\non that morning properly to dress and prepare the body for burial. Mary Magdalene was with\nthem and Mary the mother (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33114\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33114)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33114)\">Mark 16:1-2<\/a><\/span>).\nYou recall that while he forbade Mary, to whom he had already\nshown himself, to touch him (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27883\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27883)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27883)\">John 20:17<\/a><\/span>),\nhe permitted the women to hold his feet.\n<\/p><p>\nThey saw him. They heard his voice. They knew he was resurrected.\n<\/p><p>\nA little later on that day, two of the disciples were on their way to Emmaus. The Savior\njoined them. He seemed to be uninformed about what had happened in Jerusalem which\nseemed to have been common talk in Jerusalem by that time, and they talked a bit about that.\nThe Savior did not appear apparently to them as he had appeared before his resurrection. So\nhe went along with them and began to tell them all about it, who he was, and began to repeat\nthe scriptures to them. Coming to an inn they invited him in with them. They went in, sat\ndown, preparing to eat. He broke bread and offered it to them. Then they recognized for the\nfirst time who he was, and he vanished (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31513\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31513)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31513)\">Luke 24:13-32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat night the ten&mdash;there were only eleven altogether now because Iscariot had committed\nsuicide; were sitting in a room together and suddenly the Savior stood among them. They\nwere frightened. They thought he was a spirit. He said, \". . . Why are ye troubled? . . .\nBehold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not\nflesh and bones, as ye see me have\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31515\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31515)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31515)\">Luke 24:38-39<\/a><\/span>).\nThey had thought he might be a spirit.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then he asked them&mdash;and this has always been interesting to me&mdash;he asked them for\nfood&mdash;they were at dinner&mdash;and they gave him broiled fish and honeycomb, and he ate&mdash;a\nresurrected being ate of these earthly foods\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31517\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31517)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31517)\">Luke 24:41-42<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThomas was not there, and Thomas said that he would not believe if he could not touch the\nSavior to be sure. Eight days following, the apostles were all together again, this time Thomas\nwith them, and the doors being shut, so the record says, the Savior suddenly appeared in their\nmidst and addressing himself to Thomas, with his unbelief, invited an examination of his\nbody. \"Reach hither thy hand,\" said he, \"and thrust it into my side: . . .\" Whether Thomas did\nas he was bid or not, is not clear, but at the end of it, Thomas said, \"My Lord and my God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27886\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27886)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27886)\">John 20:26-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThereafter, or on that same day, he had shown himself to Peter as was disclosed in the report\nwhich was made by these disciples who had seen him on their way to Emmaus\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31514\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31514)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31514)\">Luke 24:33-34<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"315\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 315)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(315)\">1 Cor. 15:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThereafter, he appeared several times; among others he appeared to five hundred at one time,\nand the writer of Acts declared that some were then living of that five hundred when he\nwrote (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"316\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 316)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(316)\">1 Cor. 15:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHe appeared to the disciples and talked with them thereafter, particularly on the occasion\nwhen Peter and six others of the apostles, apparently, decided that they would go fishing, that\neverything was over. So they went fishing. You will all remember, I am very sure, the\nincidents of that fishing trip. The apostles had fished all night and caught nothing. As they\nneared the shore of the Sea of Galilee they saw a figure on the shore by a fire. The figure\nasked them if they had caught any fish. They answered no. Then said he, \"Cast the net on the\nright side of the ship\" which they did, and it was filled with fish. Then John perceived that\nthis was the Lord and so told the group.\n<\/p><p>\nPeter, the impetuous Peter, who sometimes apparently talked before he thought, cast himself\nover the side of the boat, having first wrapped himself with his coat, for he was naked and\ndid not want to appear before the Christ in that kind of condition&mdash;which carries its lesson, I\nthink, as to chastity and morality and modesty&mdash;and he hurried to the shore. They all went to\nthe shore. They found there the Lord whom they then recognized. He had already prepared\nsomething to eat and invited them to partake of it\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27888\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27888)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27888)\">John 21:1-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is not clear to me whether or not the Lord ate at that time, though the inference might be\nthat he did.\n<\/p><p>\nThat was the time when he questioned Peter a bit, \"Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more\nthan these?\" referring, I assume, to the fish and the food. \"Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I\nlove thee.\"<br \/>\n\"Feed my lambs\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27889\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27889)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27889)\">John 21:15-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe second inquiry came and the same answer, except that at this time the\nLord said, \"Feed my sheep.\" And even a third time did this question come, and the third time\nPeter, with what quite evidently was something of irritation, said, \"Lord, thou knowest all\nthings; thou knowest that I love thee.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Feed my sheep\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27890\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27890)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27890)\">John 21:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA great lesson in three words of the mission and duty of the Church then under organization\nand which has been the obligation and the duty from that day until now of those who possess\nthe priesthood of God, as we do.\n<\/p><p>\nFinally, he called them together again on a mount in Galilee, the disciples, and at that time he\ngave them the great commission, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every\ncreature.<br \/>\n\"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33117\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33117)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33117)\">Mark 16:15-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThose are the words of the Christ. Then he told them of the signs which should follow them\nthat believed.\n<\/p><p>\nWe, brethren and sisters, are the recipients of the great blessings that attach to the work of the\nlast dispensation. We are also the\nobligees of the great responsibilities which have been placed upon those whom God has called\nto lead this last dispensation. I personally try to think more frequently of the obligations I\nhave than of the blessings that I have enjoyed, and yet as I cast my mind back over a long\nlife, I think of no one in my acquaintance who has received greater blessings of health and\nstrength than have I myself, for which I am grateful.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful, as we all are, for the prayers of the Saints in our behalf. We know we have\nthem, we know they are efficacious. We pray that you will overlook our weaknesses and\nfailings, for each and all of us are human; make us humble but never let us forget our\ngratitude for the blessings which we enjoy.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord is good to us. He is giving us direction if we will take it. I urge you to bring your\nthoughts back, as I did last night, from space, about which we know nothing in comparison\nwith what there is to know&mdash;and fix our minds upon the great powers and authorities which\nwe have as members of the priesthood, representing our Heavenly Father, endowed with a\nportion of his authority to work out his purposes, not ours.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear my testimony to the truthfulness of the gospel, that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ,\nthat the Prophet Joseph was a prophet raised up under his direction, who with his authorities\nthrough the revelations of our Heavenly Father, founded the Church. I bear my testimony that\nthe same Spirit and the same power and the same authority with which he, the Prophet\nJoseph, was invested, now exists in the Church and has since its foundation, that President\nDavid O. McKay is the recipient of that power and that authority today.\n<\/p><p>\nI urge upon you with all the fervor that I can express, that we follow the leadership of the\nChurch, know that President McKay is the prophet, seer, and revelator of the Church, that we\nbring our lives into complete harmony with the commandments of the Lord, all to the end\nthat having fulfilled our obligations to the dead and to the living, we may be finally saved and\nexalted in his presence, which I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
