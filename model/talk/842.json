Young, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1956, pp. 115-117<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nSomeone suggested in his opening prayer that this had been  the most outstanding conference\nhe had ever attended.  I think we all feel that way as we come to the end of this very\nimpressive service that has now been held for these three days.  What I say this afternoon, my\nbrethren and sisters, I hope will not in any way detract from the sweetness of spirit that we all\nfeel.\n<\/p><p>\nI desire to make a few comments, and they could be enlarged upon if time would permit,\nprompted by the inspired address of President McKay in the opening session of this\nconference in which he gave us a great ideal, an ideal of what a home and\nour lives ought to be. I do not know how you felt about it, but after President McKay had\nfinished, I felt in my heart that I would from now on like to be just a little kinder and a little\nmore considerate, less impatient, less impulsive.  I would like to be able to offer counsel, and\nI would like to be worthy to offer that counsel to our boys and girls, our youth.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like them to feel as we felt that in a home of a Latter-day Saint may be found the\nfinest concepts of life, a pattern of life, that when our young people take upon themselves the\nresponsibilities of a home, they may lay such a foundation that will ultimately give them the\nsame type of home as President McKay so impressively portrayed to us.\n<\/p><p>\nAs our leader spoke, he spoke authoritatively.  We had that demonstrated Saturday in the\nimpressive address of Brother Thomas E. McKay, my colleague.  I have been in his home; I\nknow the sweetness of spirit there.  And he reflected yesterday in his address those high\nideals and great virtues as he told of the home life from which he came.  We knew again of\nthe power of example that we have had demonstrated to us by these two of our beloved\nbrethren.\n<\/p><p>\nI have a little concern for our young people.  Last night I read some figures in the <i>Deseret News<\/i>.\nI want to call attention to these figures and some of the comments of the writer of the\neditorial.  I quote from the editorial entitled \"Lengthening Debt's Shadow\": \n<\/p><p>\n\"Economists and economizers&mdash;home, business and government&mdash;have reason to raise an\neyebrow over the fact that the nation has posted a record increase of $660 million debt for\ninstallment buying of goods other than autos since a year ago.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For types of goods, Americans are now in debt $6 1\/4 billions.\n<\/p><p>\n\"This is not all they owe, either. Americans have also increased their pay-by-the month\npersonal loans to 5 1\/2 billions.  This is a gain of $733 millions, or 15% in the space of 12\nmonths.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis does not include the purchasing of homes.  This just refers to consumer debts.\n<\/p><p>\nThe danger there, my brethren and sisters, as I see it, lies in our young people undertaking\nobligations they cannot meet.  It has always seemed to me that a young man was justified in\ngoing in debt for a home, provided that obligation did not exceed his ability to pay.  A young\nman should not feel that when just starting out in life he should have as good a home as his\nfather.  His father probably has struggled for many years to get his home.  But a young man\nand woman starting out should take into consideration the fact that his parents had little to\nstart with and that they are starting from the beginning, and theirs should be a humble home. \nThe tendency today, however, is to build and buy extravagantly, frequently beyond the ability\nto pay.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd that is not the only difficulty. In addition to the obligations incident to a home are the\nobligations incident to this consumer buying. We think we must have all of the gadgets, all of the\nconveniences that are advertised.  They are desirable to have.  They are convenient. No one\nwould refuse a mother an electric washer, an electric dryer, a freezer, if we could afford them.\nNo one would refuse his children television or a radio or a good car, if he could afford them. \nBut brethren and sisters, if we are going to maintain the high standard, the spiritual standard\nof our homes, we must safeguard ourselves and our children against obligations that will bring\nsorrow and friction into the home and that will upset the high standards that we want to\npreserve for them.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the reason that I mention these things, and much more could be said about them. I\nhave seen so many cases of sorrow and suffering incident to too much debt.  It has been my\nexperience now for over forty years to be connected with financing.  I have seen young\ncouples start out happily in life and finally bring to themselves distress, not only financially,\nbut also spiritually and emotionally, all because their debts had reached a point where they\ncould not pay them. They became upset, and friction and quarreling ensued, which brought\nabout a condition in the home that is in contravention to the spirit and the ideals taught us in\nthis conference.\n<\/p><p>\nI hope you will not consider it presumptuous on my part if I offer a word of caution to our\nyoung people against these practices.  We should teach our boys and girls to\nhave honor above everything else, honor in paying their debts.\n<\/p><p>\nSomeone in this conference spoke of bonds, not government bonds, but a bond of integrity\nand honor. We need to teach that to our children and to ourselves.  Somewhere I read of an\nold Chinese practice.  If a young man wanted to borrow money (I do not know how it is\nnow) but in the days of the older civilization, if a Chinese boy wished to borrow money, he\nwould go to the banker and tell him, \"I am a son of Lu Sing.  I would like to borrow a\nthousand dollars.\" And the banker, knowing the integrity of Lu Sing, would lend the boy the\nthousand dollars without a scratch of a pen.  There was nothing but a verbal contract because\nthe banker knew of the integrity of the family, the honor of the family, and he knew that the\nfamily would not let him down, even if the boy should fail, and rarely did the boy fail.  It is\na striking example of the value of one's word, and we can well adopt it in our lives&mdash;not\nnecessarily the practice of it, but the intrinsic value of honor and integrity that our word is as\ngood as our bond.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung people, do not go into debt beyond your ability to pay.  Let us as parents help them to\navoid these pitfalls.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, one other thought. As President McKay spoke of the ideal home and the love of home,\nI thought of an ideal home back in 1820, of a boy who came into that home one spring\nmorning to tell his father and mother of a great revelation, and the father and mother believed\nthe boy. His brother Hyrum believed him, and his brother Alvin. Hyrum was twenty, six years\nolder than the Prophet, and Alvin was eight years older, he being over twenty-two.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is significant, my brethren and sister&mdash;a fourteen-year-old boy telling his father and mother\nof the greatest revelation of all time since the birth of the Savior and having parents and\nbrothers and sisters believe him.  From that time on there was loyalty and devotion in that\nhome.  The boy was to instruct his father, not in unkindness but in love, because his father\nbelieved in him, his mother believed in him. If there had been any element of fraud, if the\nboy had been inclined to tell an untruth, the parents would have known it; his brothers would\nhave detected it, and the mother, above all others, would have known it.  She would not have\ntalked about it, but she would have known it, keeping the boy's weakness wrapped up in her\nown soul.  Mothers generally protect their children regardless of their weaknesses.\n<\/p><p>\nI repeat, they believed in their boy, and to me that has always been an example of a perfect\nhome, an ideal home.  Confidence, faith, love and devotion were to be exemplified throughout\nthe life of the boy.  Hyrum was to give his life as a witness of his confidence in his younger\nbrother and the divinity of his calling. His father, too, was to suffer persecution that was to\ncause an early death.\n<\/p><p>\nYou will recall the night the Angel Moroni appeared to Joseph Smith and revealed to him the\nsacred record from which the Book of Mormon was to be translated.  In the morning, Joseph,\nsomewhat weary, having been awake most of the night, went to the field to assist his father.\n\"You look weary, my boy, go back to the house and rest.\" As he reached the edge of the\nfield, the Angel again appeared to Joseph and instructed him to tell his father.  He returned to\nhis father in the field and rehearsed the whole matter to him. His father replied to him, \"It\nwas of God. Do as commanded by the messenger\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30369\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30369)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30369)\">JS&mdash;H 1:48-50<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd there was no failure, and I submit to you, my brethren and sisters, that here we have an\nexample of a perfect trust between father and son, an example of what should be in an ideal\nhome. That home was a humble one, probably with candlelights, certainly no modern\nconveniences, but a home in which abounded love, trust, confidence, and faith, and from that\nfaith and that home was to come the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear you my witness in the name of Jesus.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
