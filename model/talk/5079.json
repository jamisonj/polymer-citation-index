Evans shared this meaningful thought in \u201cThe Spoken Word\u201d: \u201cIt sometimes seems that we live as if we wonder when life is going to begin. It isn\u2019t always clear just what we are waiting for, but some of us sometimes persist in waiting so long that life slips by\u2014finding us still waiting for something that has been going on all the time. \u2026 This is the life in which the work of this life is to be done. Today is as much a part of eternity as any day a thousand years ago or as will be any day a thousand years hence. This is it, whether we are thrilled or disappointed, busy or bored! This is life, and it is passing.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era,<\/span> Jan. 1967, p. 65.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p9\" class=\"\">Today <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> a day of eternity. I hope each day we are thankful for life, for knowing that we are sons and daughters of God and that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ is upon the earth. I hope we will have a desire and a determination to make each day a good day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p10\" class=\"\">How can we do this? Here are some suggestions. I encourage you to add others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p11\" class=\"\">Each day let us nourish our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Let us follow the inspired message from the Lord\u2019s living prophet, Ezra Taft Benson to read daily from the Book of Mormon and make a study of this book a lifetime pursuit. (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1988, p. 51.) We can go to our Father in Heaven in individual prayer. We can kneel each day as a family. How very important it is that we do this. As we attend our meetings on the Sabbath and partake of the sacrament worthily, we can have our Father\u2019s Spirit with us every day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p12\" class=\"\">Let us live daily the great saving principle of repentance. We will become more humble and teachable.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p13\" class=\"\">Each day will be a good day if we will think of the Savior and make Him the center of our lives, for He is \u201cthe light, and the life, and the truth of the world.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22402\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22402)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22402)\">Ether 4:12<\/a><\/span>.) Following the Savior will help us to be honest. I would like to tell you about a twelve-year-old boy in the Philippines who is following the Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p14\" class=\"\">Julius had gone to school without eating any breakfast, and during class his stomach began to make funny sounds. During recess he hurried to a nearby barbecue stand. He took two sticks of meat, ate the food, and went back to class.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p15\" class=\"\">When he returned, he discovered he had not given the pesos for the food. Without hesitation he ran back and paid for his snack. When he arrived back at the classroom, he found a very angry teacher. He had forgotten to ask permission to leave. She wanted to know what he had been doing. He told her everything. Then she put her arm on his shoulder and, facing the class, said, \u201cClass, I want you to be honest like Julius.\u201d She asked him why he returned the money when he could have kept it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p16\" class=\"\">He answered, \u201cBecause I believe in being honest.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cWhat is your religion?\u201d she wanted to know.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p18\" class=\"\">Without hesitation, he said, \u201cI am a Mormon.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cOh,\u201d she responded, \u201cno wonder.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p20\" class=\"\">Julius is making each day a good day by always being honest.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p21\" class=\"\">Following the Savior will help us to be morally clean. We will respect our bodies and not tamper with drugs, alcohol, or pornography or in any way destroy the great miracle of life which the Lord has given to each of us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p22\" class=\"\">Recently I listened to the words of a stalwart young teenager who told about how some young people in his school have not kept the standards of the Church and have used some of the destructive substances we have been warned against. Friends who know he is a Mormon have asked him why he doesn\u2019t partake of these harmful things. He explained: \u201cI am happy to know that I have not disappointed the Lord and dishonored the priesthood he has given me. Remember, you can lie to yourself, and you can lie to others, but you can never lie to the Lord. He knows what you are doing. \u2026 To help us along the way, a good guideline is to imagine that Jesus is right beside you all the time. Ask yourself, \u2018Would Jesus be doing this?\u2019 or \u2018Would He get into this situation?\u2019\u201d (talk given by Brandon Williams, Alamosa Colorado Stake conference, 25 Aug. 1991.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p23\" class=\"\">As the Savior becomes the center of our lives, we will be more loving and giving. He has taught by precept and example that if we would truly find ourselves, we must first lose ourselves in serving and helping others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p24\" class=\"\">I believe one of the best ways to make each day a good one is to help build the kingdom of God. What a blessing it is for each of us to be leaders in righteousness. President Spencer W. Kimball has said, \u201cMembership in the Church is a call to leadership.\u201d Let us be good leaders in our homes (this means both children and parents), leaders in our neighborhoods, our schools, our communities, and the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p25\" class=\"\">Each day can be richer and more meaningful if we can be happy with ourselves. Some of the most undesirable feelings are those of envying, coveting, and wishing that we were someone else. We should be grateful for who we are and what we are, and for the talents we have been given. We should be supportive of and grateful for the talents of others, always looking for those divine qualities which are in every person we meet. It is important that we be ourselves and like ourselves. Someone has said, \u201cA bee may not be an eagle, but it can sure make honey!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/today-a-day-of-eternity.p26\" class=\"\">Here is another suggestion: Don\u2019t worry about those things which you cannot change. If something can be done, do it. If nothing can be done, don\u2019t worry about it. Several years ago, I read an article written about Elder LeGrand Richards. He had just turned age ninety-three. Someone asked him what his secret was for living such a long, happy, and useful life. He said, \u201cI have a verse that has been part of my philosophy throughout my life.
