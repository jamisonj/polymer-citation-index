And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord \u2026 and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25408\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25408)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25408)\">Isa. 2:2\u20133<\/a><\/span>.

In doing so they have set brothers against brothers in the Church and thus weakened the unity of the greatest weapon the Lord has already provided against these evils, through the priesthood organizations of the Church and kingdom of God.
