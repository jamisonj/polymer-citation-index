And so I knelt down on the cold steel floor of that rocking ship and begged the Lord with my tears. I prayed, \u201cDear Father, I have got to know that the Book of Mormon is true.

Why the Book of Mormon? Because this holy scripture is the great testifier and converter. This ancient record is a spiritual compass for us to follow. Joseph Smith said, \u201cThe Book of Mormon was \u2026 the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 4:461.) When you come to know that this testament of Christ is true, you will know that Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration and that Ezra Taft Benson is the Lord\u2019s prophet today. The Book of Mormon was written for our day to convince us \u201cthat Jesus is the Christ.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43186\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43186)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43186)\">Book of Mormon title page<\/a><\/span>.) If your soul is searching for a more profound testimony of Jesus Christ and his restored kingdom, I suggest, in conjunction with studying the Book of Mormon, there are four steps you can take which will lead you to your hour of conversion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/hour-of-conversion.p10\" class=\"\">These four steps are (1) Desire, (2) Works, (3) Prayer, and (4) Trust in the Lord. Let me briefly explain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/hour-of-conversion.p11\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">First, Desire:<\/span> Oliver Cowdery desired a more firm witness of the plates which contained the Book of Mormon record. The Lord said to Oliver: \u201cIf you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things. Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19158\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19158)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19158)\">D&amp;C 6:22\u201323<\/a><\/span>.)

He moved himself from thinking to doing. In my case, while on board that ship, I had more intimately studied and pondered the Book of Mormon. Young Joseph reflected on the Bible, then went into the woods to pray. Moses climbed Mt. Sinai. My Great-grandmother Nelson boarded a ship in Denmark, with a flock of little children, to join the Mormons in Utah. Righteous works yield a divine harvest. The Lord said, \u201cHe who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19233\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19233)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19233)\">D&amp;C 59:23<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/hour-of-conversion.p14\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Third, Prayer:<\/span> \u201cPrayer is the soul\u2019s sincere desire, Uttered or unexpressed.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 145.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/hour-of-conversion.p15\" class=\"\">As we sincerely pray to the Lord and rely upon his divine whisperings, that still, small voice will come to us.
