Certainly not. Because\n  they disregarded the voice of their lawful king; they had no regard for his virtuous laws, for his\n  dignity, nor for the honor of his name; neither for the honor of their country, nor their private virtue.\n  They regarded not his authority enough to obey him, neither did they regard the immediate\n  advantages and blessings arising from these laws if kept, so destitute were they of virtue and\n  goodness; and above all, they regarded so little the joy and satisfaction of a legal seat in the presence\n  of the king&rsquo;s only son, and to be made equal with him all the blessings, honors, comforts, and\n  felicities of his kingdom, that they turned away from a participation in them, and considered that\n  they were beneath their present notice, though they had no doubt as to the real authenticity of the\n  royal edict.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"wideEllipse\">* * *<\/p>\n\n  <p class=\"std\">How could a government be conducted with harmony if its administrators were possessed with\n  such different dispositions and different principles? Could it prosper? Could it flourish? Would\n  harmony prevail?

In it were two classes of men as dissimilar as light and\n  darkness, virtue and vice, justice and injustice, truth and falsehood, holiness and sin. One class were\n  perfectly harmless and virtuous: they knew what virtue was for they had lived in the fullest\n  enjoyment of it, and their fidelity to truth had been fairly tested by a series of years of faithful\n  obedience to all its heavenly precepts. They knew what good order was, for they had been orderly\n  and obedient to the laws imposed on them by their wise sovereign, and had experienced the benefits\n  arising from a life spent in his government till he has now seen proper to make them equal with his\n  son.
