Nearly all the circumstances that have made family life in the past the most natural way for people to live together have changed\u2014and it has all happened in the brief span of the last seventy years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/love-is-the-power-that-will-cure-the-family.p4\" class=\"\">Just a little over a generation ago, members of the average family had to work a long day to provide a humble living, and the dark evenings found them huddled around a fire, enjoying one another\u2019s company in singing and sharing personal experiences. This was the natural way for education and entertainment and was nearly the perfect environment for a harmonious family life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/love-is-the-power-that-will-cure-the-family.p5\" class=\"\">Today influences from literally unlimited sources through the media of radio, television, and print, together with numerous inventions of modern civilization, have drastically changed the historical cultural setting of the family. In this time of special challenge for marriage and the family, the Lord has restored, through his prophets in these latter days, the eternal dimension of that sacred covenant between husband and wife and has charged us with a new awareness of the real purpose of the family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/love-is-the-power-that-will-cure-the-family.p6\" class=\"\">The integrity of this covenant became the center of revealed gospel truths in these latter days, well summarized by the late prophet David O. McKay, who said, \u201cNo other success can compensate for failure in the home.\u201d (In Conference Report, Apr. 1964, p. 5.) It is obvious that in marriage today we cannot rely merely on patterns of the past without developing, perfecting, and putting into action that power that the Lord has given us as the greatest commandment\u2014the commandment to love one another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/love-is-the-power-that-will-cure-the-family.p7\" class=\"\">Still, after nearly two thousand years, the people of the world are refusing to accept the words of the Savior found in Matthew, chapter 5:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/love-is-the-power-that-will-cure-the-family.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cYe have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/love-is-the-power-that-will-cure-the-family.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cBut I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36818\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36818)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36818)\">Matt. 5:43\u201344<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/love-is-the-power-that-will-cure-the-family.p10\" class=\"\">This love that Christ is teaching us is not the same as the world\u2019s love. It does not mean just to love the one who is nice, who behaves well and is respected, powerful, and influential. Our Heavenly Father, through his prophets in these latter days, calls us to develop the love of God as a power from above that cannot be threatened through outward circumstances. This love of God, according to the prophet Nephi of the Book of Mormon, has to be achieved and is \u201cthe most desirable above all things.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1784\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1784)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1784)\">1 Ne. 11:22<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/love-is-the-power-that-will-cure-the-family.p11\" class=\"\">However, as King Benjamin, another great Book of Mormon leader, teaches us, this love of God will not be in us as long as we remain in our natural state. \u201cThe natural man is an enemy to God,\u201d he explains.

We have to overcome this natural man\u2014this \u201cenemy to God\u201d\u2014our natural self. According to King Benjamin, we have to learn to listen to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and literally make a covenant with God, accepting the atonement of the Savior, and becoming as a child\u2014submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, and willing to submit to all things, even as a child submits to his father.

One day when circumstances made it necessary for me to be at home at an unusual time, I witnessed from another room how our eleven-year-old son, just returning from school, was directing ugly words towards his younger sister. They were words that offended me\u2014words that I had never thought our son would use. My first natural reaction in my anger was to get up and go after him. Fortunately, I had to walk across the room and open a door before I could reach him, and I remember in those few seconds I fervently prayed to my Heavenly Father to help me to handle the situation. Peace came over me. I was no longer angry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/love-is-the-power-that-will-cure-the-family.p30\" class=\"\">Our son, being shocked to see me home, was filled with fear when I approached him. To my surprise I heard myself saying, \u201cWelcome home, son!\u201d and I extended my hand as a greeting. And then in a formal style I invited him to sit close to me in the living room for a personal talk. I heard myself expressing my love for him. I talked with him about the battle that every one of us has to fight each day within ourselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/love-is-the-power-that-will-cure-the-family.p31\" class=\"\">As I expressed my confidence in him, he broke into tears, confessing his unworthiness and condemning himself beyond measure. Now it was my role to put his transgression in the proper perspective and to comfort him. A wonderful spirit came over us, and we ended up crying together, hugging each other in love and finally in joy. What could have been a disastrous confrontation between father and son became, through the help from the powers above, one of the most beautiful experiences of our relationship that we both have never forgotten.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/love-is-the-power-that-will-cure-the-family.p32\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, I know that God lives, that this is his church, that these are the days of preparation and warning; and I testify that when we are not fully exercising the love of God as a power as he has commanded us to do, our marriages will not be strong, our families will be weak, and our own salvation will be in jeopardy. I bear you this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
