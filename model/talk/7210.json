The many other things we \u2018give,\u2019 \u2026 are actually the things He has already given or loaned to us.

I had fasted and prayed in preparation, wondering in my heart, \u201cWhat does the Lord want <span class=\"emphasis\">me<\/span> to do?\u201d Full of happy anticipation and with our four young children in tow, my husband and I went to the elderly patriarch\u2019s home. The blessing he gave me emphasized missionary work\u2014over and over again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/knowing-the-lords-will-for-you.p9\" class=\"\">I hate to admit it, but I was disappointed and troubled. At that point in my life, I had barely read the Book of Mormon from cover to cover. Without question, I was unprepared to serve a mission. So I put my patriarchal blessing in a drawer. I did, however, begin a serious regimen of scripture study each day as I focused on rearing my growing family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/knowing-the-lords-will-for-you.p10\" class=\"\">The years passed, and my husband and I concentrated on preparing our children to serve missions. In sending our sons to many lands, I honestly believed I had fulfilled <span class=\"emphasis\">my<\/span> missionary duty.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/knowing-the-lords-will-for-you.p11\" class=\"\">Then my husband was called to be a mission president in an unsettled, chaotic country in the developing world. It was 10,000 miles from home and light-years away from the culture and communication I knew. But, in the instant of my call as a full-time missionary, I felt a little like Alma and the sons of Mosiah\u2014that I was called to be an \u201c[instrument] in the hands of God to bring about this great work.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-25911_000_040\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44649\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44649)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44649)\">Alma 26:3<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> I also felt something I am not sure they did\u2014overwhelming fear!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/knowing-the-lords-will-for-you.p12\" class=\"\">Over subsequent days I pulled out my patriarchal blessing and read it again and again, searching for deeper understanding. Even knowing I was going to live out a promise I had received from a patriarch decades earlier did not alleviate my concerns. Could I leave my married and unmarried children and my aging father and mother-in-law behind? Would I know the right things to do and say? What would my husband and I eat? Would I be <span class=\"emphasis\">safe<\/span> in a country that was politically unstable and dangerous? I felt inadequate on every level.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/knowing-the-lords-will-for-you.p13\" class=\"\">In my quest for peace, I redoubled my efforts to attend the temple. I pondered the meaning of my covenants in a way I had never done before. For me, at this defining crossroads in my life, my temple covenants served as a foundation and catalyst. Yes, I feared, but I realized I had <span class=\"emphasis\">chosen<\/span> to make personal, binding, sacred commitments I meant to keep. When all was said and done, this wasn\u2019t someone else\u2019s service to perform. This was <span class=\"emphasis\">my<\/span> mission call, and I determined to serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/knowing-the-lords-will-for-you.p14\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith\u2019s father pronounced this blessing upon his son\u2019s head: \u201cThe Lord thy God has called thee by name out of the heavens.

This insight was helpful and gave me courage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/knowing-the-lords-will-for-you.p15\" class=\"\">In my constant prayers I continued to ask, \u201cFather, how can I do what Thou hast called me to do?\u201d One morning shortly before leaving for our mission field, two friends brought a gift\u2014a small hymnal to take with me. Later, on that same day, the answer to my months of prayerful pleadings came from that hymnal.

We were quite literally alone much of the time\u2014finding our way within a culture we didn\u2019t understand\u2014expressed in dozens of languages we could not speak. The sentiment of Sarah Cleveland, one of our early Relief Society leaders in Nauvoo, described our feelings: \u201cWe have entered into this work in the name of the Lord. Let us boldly go forward.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-25911_000_040\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Relief Society Minutes, Mar. 30, 1842, Archives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 24.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/knowing-the-lords-will-for-you.p22\" class=\"\">My first lesson in the process of becoming an instrument in God\u2019s hand had been to search the scriptures, fast, pray, attend the temple, and live faithful to the covenants I had made in the house of the Lord. My second lesson was that in order to \u201cboldly go forward,\u201d I needed to rely completely on the Lord and seek earnestly for personal revelation. In order to receive that revelation, I would have to live worthily to have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost with me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/knowing-the-lords-will-for-you.p23\" class=\"\">My last lesson was precisely what Elder Maxwell explained. In even the smallest details of each day, I submitted my will to the Lord\u2019s, for I so needed His help, His guidance, and His protection. As I did, gradually my relationship with my Father in Heaven changed\u2014in profound ways\u2014that continue to bless me and my family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/knowing-the-lords-will-for-you.p24\" class=\"\">My life\u2019s journey is different from yours.
