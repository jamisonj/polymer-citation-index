I have often expressed my views with regard to this. As Elders of Israel, very few of us fully comprehend our position, our calling, or relationship to God, our responsibility, or work the Lord requires at our hands. The Lord has given unto us the Priesthood. This is conferred upon us that we may administer in the ordinances of life and salvation. But to enable us to perform our duties acceptably, there is one thing we need, one and all of us, and that is the Holy Spirit. While in Winter Quarters, President Young had a dream in which the Prophet Joseph Smith appeared to him and said: &#x201C;Brother Young, you exhort this people to obtain the Holy Spirit; with it they can do anything that is necessary; without it they cannot build up the kingdom of God.&#x201D; In one of my dreams while in Arizona, I had the same admonition from President Young. I thought he was attending one of our conferences. I said to him: &#x201C;Can you speak to us?&#x201D; &#x201C;No,&#x201D; he replied, &#x201C;I have done bearing my testimony in the flesh; I have merely come to see the people, to see you, to see what you are doing. But I want you to teach the Latter-day Saints to labor to obtain the Holy Spirit. It is one of the most important gifts that the Saints of the living God can possess. You all need this,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;in order to build up Zion. If you have not this Spirit&#x2014;the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, the testimony of Jesus, the testimony of the Father and Son&#x2014;you cannot get along. But if you are in possession of this Spirit, your minds will be open to comprehend the things of God.&#x201D; This is true. There is not a man in this Church and kingdom today, who, if he is in possession of this <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"329b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD23\/JoD23_0329.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;329b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1198\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> spirit, will set his heart upon the things of this world.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"128767\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 128767)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(128767)\">D&amp;C 121:35<\/a><\/span> Any man that loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"78575\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 78575)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(78575)\">1 Jn. 2:15<\/a><\/span> We have received something better than the love of gold, silver, houses and lands; we have received the promise of eternal life.

We have a mighty warfare on hand. We have to contend against the world, the flesh and the devil. There are temptations that surround every man and woman, that is, if they attempt to keep the commandments of God, and no man or woman can inherit eternal life without passing through this warfare in the flesh. Other generations have had their turn. As a people it is our turn today.

Zion is advancing; the kingdom of God is rolling on. The progress of this kingdom has never stopped from the day of its organization; it never will until it has accomplished all for which it has been organized and established on the earth to accomplish. We have a great work to do. We are commanded to preach the Gospel to the nations of the earth. The Elders of Israel have been doing this for the last fifty years. We are still doing it, in the United States and other parts of the world. We shall continue to labor among the Gentiles just as long as the Lord says we must do so. But at the same time we have now been commanded to turn to a branch of the house of Israel. Here are the Lamanites, thousands and thousands of them surround us. They look to us for the Gospel of Christ. It is our duty to go to them and organize them, and preach to them the words of life and salvation. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n1043\"> Then, again, we have temples to build in our day and time, that we may go into them and do a work both for the living and for the dead.

There have been no Prophets, no Apostles, upon the earth for the last 1,800 years, that we are much acquainted with, except Nephi, who dwelt upon this continent several hundred years after the death of Christ.

Many thousands of millions have passed into the spirit world. We are now at the end of the sixth thousand years. We are bordering upon the millennium. We are living in the great and last dispensation, in the which the God of Israel expects us, his servants, his sons and daughters, to perform the work which has been left to our charge. It is our duty to build these temples. It is our duty to enter into them and redeem our dead.

Joseph Smith and others cannot baptize the spirits in water, it is not the law; but their posterity, their sons and daughters who are living in the last dispensation, are expected to go into these temples and there redeem their dead. This is a good work, and it is a great blessing for men and women to have this privilege. We have one of these temples finished, and we are doing a great work in that temple. A hundred and sixty-two thousand persons have been baptized for the dead, and nearly seventy thousand endowments have been given in that temple. We have only just begun this work. We want the Logan temple finished, as also the temple at Manti, that the people may go forth and redeem their dead. Our forefathers are looking to us to attend to this work. They are watching over us with great anxiety, and are desirous that we should finish these temples and attend to certain ordinances for them, so that in the morning of the resurrection they can come forth and enjoy the same blessings that we enjoy.

The vision of their minds is beginning to be opened, and they are to be taught the things of the kingdom of God. I have thought sometimes that they have more faith than the Latter-day Saints. I traveled among them for one year in Arizona and New Mexico. I visited those that dwell in the walled cities. They have some seven villages on the top of a mountain from 500 to 1,500 feet high. One thing struck me very forcibly while there. Although a good many of these people are superstitious, some of them sunworshippers and so forth, yet they seem to be impressed with the idea that there is going to be a famine. They have enough grain and dried squash laid up to last them for years, and they think the day is not far off when they will need that which they have stored up. Don't we believe that a famine will come? I know some of our sisters are laying up wheat, I hope the Relief Societies will continue to do so, and the brethren should help them.
