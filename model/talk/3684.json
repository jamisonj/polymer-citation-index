(See \u201cTeach Me to Walk in the Light,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Sing with Me,<\/span> p. B-45.) I prayed then, as I pray now, that there is someone close-by who is teaching you to walk in the light.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/an-invitation-to-grow.p8\" class=\"\">Each of us comes into this world separately, one by one. This is not an accident. I think it\u2019s the Lord\u2019s way of reminding us of the infinite worth of each soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/an-invitation-to-grow.p9\" class=\"\">There is something very sacred about the time of birth. I remember so clearly the coming forth of each of my own children. My firstborn came after three years of desperate waiting. He was very small, only five pounds. I felt so responsible. It seemed like such a miracle and there was a great surge of gratitude. Now I had a baby of my very own. With each child came a sharper realization of life\u2019s challenges and possibilities. Rocking my babies to sleep, I sang them the lullabies which came to my lips\u2014soft, private words, carrying my dreams for their future. I have marveled at this miracle of potential that we cradle in our arms: the ultimate of creation, a human child.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/an-invitation-to-grow.p10\" class=\"\">Growth is inevitable. This is the natural phenomenon of life itself. It quickly becomes apparent that the child is engaged in some dynamic process of physical growth over which one has very little control. Shortly the birth weight is doubled. Turn around, as the song says, and they\u2019re three. Turn around, and they\u2019re four. Turn around, and they\u2019re a young man or woman going out of the door.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/an-invitation-to-grow.p11\" class=\"\">As young children start to learn, it\u2019s like opening a floodgate. There\u2019s no stopping, no end to their capacity to grow and to learn. First they imitate, and then they move out on their own. I was always astonished when it seemed like we had to show our children only once some new skill, some new task, and then they were swept away on their own, pursuing their own star.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/an-invitation-to-grow.p12\" class=\"\">As we observe the process of natural growth, we become acutely aware of certain eternal principles upon which all growth is predicated. First, growth is the expected norm. It\u2019s the divine challenge given to each soul as it enters mortality. Our Heavenly Father expects us to use the great gift of life to enjoy and to celebrate this central truth. Because we have life, we can grow and develop and do some things on earth we cannot do anywhere else.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/an-invitation-to-grow.p13\" class=\"\">Very soon we become aware of another great truth. Only God\u2019s children have the capacity to direct their own growth. This means that we can use this time on earth to bring optimum growth and development because we have the power to make choices. It\u2019s not enough just to grow. Even the weeds and the biblical tares can do that. It is expected of us that we will shape our growth so that we will not be like Topsy (in <span class=\"emphasis\">Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin<\/span>) who \u201cjust growed,\u201d but rather we will successfully negotiate the bumps and curves by enlarging upon our talents, by disciplining ourselves, so that our mortal experience brings us toward greater and greater mastery of those characteristics which make us worthy of association with the Divine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/an-invitation-to-grow.p14\" class=\"\">Intelligent observation tells us that growth comes one step at a time. The scriptures say precept upon precept, line upon line. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"17863\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17863)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17863)\">D&amp;C 98:12<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/an-invitation-to-grow.p15\" class=\"\">Just as the baby learns to walk one faltering step at a time and learns to speak one word at a time, we learn to care, to serve, and to love one step at a time. We learn to master everything one concept at a time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/an-invitation-to-grow.p16\" class=\"\">The Lord has carefully explained this great truth to us in 2 Nephi 28:30:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/an-invitation-to-grow.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cI will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, \u2026 and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4065\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4065)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4065)\">2 Ne. 28:30<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/an-invitation-to-grow.p18\" class=\"\">There\u2019s a kind of wonder and awe that comes to us as we observe the natural phenomenon of physical growth. You remember the song that says, \u201cI don\u2019t remember growing older,\u201d or \u201cWhen did he grow to be so tall?\u201d (\u201cSunrise, Sunset,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Fiddler on the Roof<\/span>.) We have a special place in our home where the children record their height on the wall. With the help of a book placed on top of their head, they can tell if they\u2019ve grown since the last mark was made. Cheers are heard if they\u2019ve made progress. That is natural growth. But what greater joy and satisfaction comes when the change that is wrought has come about by constant personal choice and effort!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/an-invitation-to-grow.p19\" class=\"\">I\u2019m reminded of the little child who came to her daddy and said, \u201cGive me something <span class=\"emphasis\">hard<\/span> to do.\u201d So he thought of things she could do, but she would say, \u201cNo, daddy, that isn\u2019t hard enough. I want something hard to do.\u201d He was carrying his briefcase into the house, and he said, \u201cWell, carry this; this will be very hard to carry.\u201d She grabbed hold. Oh, boy, it was heavy! She said, \u201cI think I can.\u201d She struggled and staggered until she finally got it to the house. We all like to feel that we have met the challenge of something hard to do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/an-invitation-to-grow.p20\" class=\"\">Be aware that growth is a process. It is never fully and finally achieved; it\u2019s just a steady picking our way upward along the mountain path. Ultimately the process requires hope and faith. We have potential for development much like the seed Alma so eloquently described which, when tended and nurtured, will burst into full flower.
