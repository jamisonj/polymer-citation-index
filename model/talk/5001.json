It is not unusual for foolish children and some very thoughtless adults to make light of the handicapped. The mimicking or teasing or ridiculing of those with handicaps is cruel.

It is my conviction that such brutality will not, in the eternal scheme of things, go unanswered, and there will come a day of recompense.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/the-moving-of-the-water.p20\" class=\"\">My mother taught us when we were very young that we must never ridicule the unfortunate. Her mother died when she was six. My mother worked in the fields from a very early age. One day some teenagers were picking fruit. One of the girls laughingly mimicked one who suffered from cerebral palsy, saying, \u201cLook who I am,\u201d and she named the handicapped person. They all laughed as she threw herself into a stumbling walk. Suddenly she fell as if struck down. They gathered around her in great fright. Presently she recovered, but there was no more fun at the expense of the handicapped. Mother never forgot what she saw, nor to teach a lesson from it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/the-moving-of-the-water.p21\" class=\"\">Parents, take time in the next home evening to caution your family never to amuse themselves at the expense of the handicapped or of any whose face or form or personality does not fit the supposed ideal or whose skin is too light or too dark to suit their fancy.

In the class was a young man who had great difficulty climbing ordinary steps. As the class marched in, two strong young classmates gracefully lifted him up the steps. We watched during and after the proceedings, and it became apparent that the whole class was afflicted with a marvelous kind of blindness. They could not see that he was different. They saw a classmate, a friend. In <span class=\"emphasis\">them<\/span> the works of God <span class=\"emphasis\">were being<\/span> manifest. While there was no physical transformation in the boy or in his classmates, they were serving like angels, soothing a spirit locked in a deformed body awaiting that time when it would be everlastingly made perfect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>She\u2019s under There Somewhere<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/the-moving-of-the-water.p24\" class=\"\">At a recent stake conference, I noticed on the front row a family including a girl of ten who has palsy and is deaf.

The father turned so that I could see Heidi\u2019s face, which was buried into his shoulder, and he said with a smile, \u201cShe\u2019s under there someplace.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/the-moving-of-the-water.p25\" class=\"\">Indeed she is under there someplace.
