Somewhere between youth and growing up many of us lose that simple faith of a child. Who puts out the light in our eyes and replaces it with the dull film through which most of us see the world and our place in it? Perhaps it is because our lives sometimes hold more frustration than we think we can bear.

We have just about all we can do to cope with each day. Oh, the pressures and frustrations may be small ones sometimes. We may have too much to do, we may feel unappreciated, we may lose a button off our coat, or just not be able to get above the mundane. It sometimes doesn\u2019t have to be a whole lot. But the accumulation of it all, day after day, just wears down our motor\u2014like our neighbor\u2019s dishwasher that recently required a fifty-dollar repair job because a toothpick got into the works.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/because-i-have-a-father.p47\" class=\"\">And for each of us there may be times when we have to cope with real tragedy, real opposition. There are those who lose a loved one who was the very light of their life. Health may deteriorate. There may be some in this very listening audience who cannot make ends meet or get enough food to fill an aching stomach. I remember reading of a man who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam who did not sleep for months because he was in such pain from beriberi. The only rest he got was when the pain became so intense his body could not stand it any longer and he would lose consciousness. How do you cope with that?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/because-i-have-a-father.p48\" class=\"\">Well, whether it\u2019s for small reasons or big ones, there are sometimes questions that enter our hearts: Could I have been more? Could I have done more?

Jesus is the Christ. He has revealed himself in latter days, and he speaks to us through a prophet, such a one as we\u2019ve heard this morning. Through modern prophets we can come to know the truth, the divine principles which help us live and adjust, which give meaning and direction to our lives. When these divine principles are applied, nothing can defeat us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/because-i-have-a-father.p50\" class=\"\">You can\u2019t cover up who you really are before His penetrating gaze.

He has no use of his arms and legs, which have deteriorated without use. The only way he can get around is by lying on a specially designed cart which he steers with his chin. But what is most marvelous to me is that he won\u2019t quit. This young man often wears red socks on his useless feet. They are there like a badge of defiance against his handicap, a mark for everyone who sees him wheeling around which says, \u201cLook at me!

I know a woman who is noted for her smile. Her good cheer is rarely daunted. I asked her how she managed it with all the irritations she has had in life, and she told me this: As a child she had been taking an important letter to her father, who stood just behind a barbed-wire fence. In her eagerness to get there she ran toward him and tripped, and she fell against the fence, cutting her face deeply from the forehead down through the cheek. It left a permanent scar, and the scar was mistaken for a frown and grouchiness. She said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t have the world think I have nothing but a frown to give, so I had to smile that frown away.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/because-i-have-a-father.p56\" class=\"\">You and I cannot give up, no matter what the size of our struggles. We were not meant to be fear-haunted and defeated nobodies. There is something deep in our hearts saying that we belong to something higher. And that something higher is an eternal family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/because-i-have-a-father.p57\" class=\"\">We must remember too that our struggles here are not too trivial to interest the Lord. Those of you who follow the developments of astronomy know that lately there has been a big stir in the scientific community about a galaxy prosaically called NGC 1961. It seems this galaxy has ten times the mass of our own Milky Way and billions of young, hot stars. When we think that our Lord created all that and understands the immensities of space that only boggle our minds, we have difficulty believing that his interest could ever devolve on something as minute as our little pain or concerns.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/because-i-have-a-father.p58\" class=\"\">But the record of Christ\u2019s life on earth certainly shows that he was not above caring for the human-size needs or fears of his earthly companions. Do you remember when Lazarus, the brother of Mary and Martha, died? Both sisters rushed to meet Christ to tell him of their sorrow and find comfort. And as they met him, they said in turn, \u201cLord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28991\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28991)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28991)\">John 11:21, 32<\/a><\/span>). Now, who would know better than Jesus Christ that there was to be a resurrection so that Lazarus would live again? He didn\u2019t just say to them, \u201cChin up, ladies. It\u2019s only a few years before you see your brother again.\u201d Instead the scriptures tell us, \u201cJesus wept\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28993\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28993)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28993)\">John 11:35<\/a><\/span>), wept in pure compassion for the pain and lack of understanding of his two friends. Then he hurried to the tomb and raised Lazarus from the dead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/because-i-have-a-father.p59\" class=\"\">Think, too, when Christ was preaching to the multitude and then performed the miracle of the fish and the loaves to feed the hungry masses. He wasn\u2019t responding then to something earthshaking or lofty. He saw the human need to be fed and he used his divine powers to meet that need.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/because-i-have-a-father.p60\" class=\"\">Well, our frustrations and disappointments may be just pinpricks in the eternal scheme of things, but since they do not seem that way to us, they do not seem that way to the Lord. Quit thinking that tomorrow your problems will go away and life will begin in earnest. The Lord is waiting to help you cope today if you will lay your human-size needs at his divine feet. Pray in specifics about the problems, little or big, that impede your progress and dull your best dreams. Knock, seek, and you shall find the answer to your prayers.
