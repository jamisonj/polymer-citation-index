After being camped for a season in a valley by the river, the Lord told Lehi one night it was time to continue their journey into the wilderness. With much on his mind, he walked out his tent door the next morning and, to his great astonishment, found an object before him on the ground that could only have been placed there by the hand of God. It was a compass, a Liahona in their language, and its pointers were constructed to guide them on their journey, allowing them to steer a course where they could prosper and remain safe in the more fertile parts of their route. But that was not all. Writing appeared on this compass that was plain and easy to read and even changed from time to time, giving the family better understanding concerning the ways of the Lord.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-25911_000_033\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44593\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44593)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44593)\">1 Ne. 16:9\u201316<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/compass-of-the-lord.p9\" class=\"\">During their journey, this Liahona, or compass, proved to be invaluable in helping Lehi\u2019s family prosper and eventually arrive at their destination. But it is important to note Nephi\u2019s observation that it was only through the faith, diligence, and heed they gave to the compass that it worked. Of this marvelous helper that guided them through the wilderness Nephi simply observed, \u201cAnd thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about great things.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-25911_000_033\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44594\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44594)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44594)\">1 Ne. 16:29<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/compass-of-the-lord.p10\" class=\"\">Nephi\u2019s conclusion was not lost on Alma 500 years later when he reminded his own son about the importance of the Liahona. He explained to Helaman that the Lord prepared this compass to show their fathers the course they should travel in the wilderness, but because that miraculous device worked by small means, their fathers were slothful and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence. As a result, this marvelous device ceased to work, and they did not progress in their journey or travel a straight course but tarried in the wilderness and were afflicted because of their negligence.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-25911_000_033\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44656\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44656)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44656)\">Alma 37:38\u201341<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/compass-of-the-lord.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cO my son,\u201d Alma continued, \u201cdo not let us be slothful because of the easiness of the way; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would look they might live; even so it is with us.

This very general conference is a modern Liahona, a time and place to receive inspired guidance and direction that prospers us and helps us follow God\u2019s path through the more fertile parts of mortality. Consider that we are gathered to hear counsel from prophets and apostles who have prayed mightily and prepared carefully to know what the Lord would have them say. We have prayed for them and for ourselves that the Comforter would teach us the mind and will of God. Surely there is no better time or place for the Lord to direct His people than in this conference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/compass-of-the-lord.p13\" class=\"\">The teachings of this conference are the compass of the Lord.

He is not likely to reveal new paths if we have not faithfully followed Him along those He has already marked. Provident prospering along the way comes to those who diligently follow inspired counsel, making it their \u201cwalk and talk\u201d until once again a new writing appears to help them progress in their journey toward the land of promises.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/compass-of-the-lord.p15\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, prophets and apostles through the ages are our compass from the Lord. His direction through them is plain; the charted course from them is sure. His path, like His yoke, is easy.

Hinckley, points the way for those who will look and live forever. That we will exercise our faith and diligently give heed to the directions and pointers of latter-day Liahonas, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-25911_000_033\"><a name=\"-25911_000_033\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-25911_000_033\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44783\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44783)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44783)\">JS\u2014H 1:5<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-25911_000_033\"><a name=\"-25911_000_033\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-25911_000_033\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"44785\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44785)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44785)\">JS\u2014H 1:10<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-25911_000_033\"><a name=\"-25911_000_033\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-25911_000_033\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cHow Great the Wisdom and the Love,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 195.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-25911_000_033\"><a name=\"-25911_000_033\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-25911_000_033\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44593\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44593)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44593)\">1 Ne. 16:9\u201316<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-25911_000_033\"><a name=\"-25911_000_033\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote5-25911_000_033\">5.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"44594\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44594)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44594)\">1 Ne. 16:29<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-25911_000_033\"><a name=\"-25911_000_033\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote6-25911_000_033\">6.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44656\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44656)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44656)\">Alma 37:38\u201341<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-25911_000_033\"><a name=\"-25911_000_033\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote7-25911_000_033\">7.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"44657\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44657)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44657)\">Alma 37:46\u201347<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
