It is a great joy to\nbe with you, to feel your spirit and to enjoy the inspiration which comes from your presence.\nI renew again the thought that I have so often expressed that if we could bring real unity, the\nunity of one man, into the priesthood of this Church, we would wield an influence that would\naffect the course of world affairs. We cannot do it and will not do it until we are so united. It\nis my belief that it is our opportunity, not only, but also our duty and responsibility to come,\nas the old expression went, \"to a unity of the faith\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21618\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21618)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21618)\">Eph. 4:13<\/a><\/span>). I cannot believe that the Lord will hold\nus guiltless if we do not do this. It is the obligation of those who bear the Holy Priesthood of\nGod.\n<\/p><p>\nNEGLIGIBLE PERCENTAGE OF FINANCIAL MISHAPS\n<\/p><p>\nYesterday, in an aside comment I made, as I was reading the financial report, I did you\nbrethren an injustice. I think that I said that our financial mishaps in carrying on all this\ntremendous expenditure and collection of funds would not exceed one tenth of one percent. In\nthe last ten years there has been just a little over in mishap, eight ten-thousandths of one\npercent, and out of all those who handle these great funds there is not one man who is under\nbond. I dislike to boast about ourselves, but I think we may challenge the world on that\nrecord. I am grateful to you brethren for your integrity, your honesty, and your truthfulness\nwhich represents a long step toward the unit to which I have already referred.\n<\/p><p>\nSCRIPTURES REFERRING TO ONE TRUE GOSPEL\n<\/p><p>\nI thought tonight that I might read a little scripture to you and then refer to a matter to which\nI have referred before and which is very near to my heart. I am reading from Second Nephi,\n26th chapter and 20th verse:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have stumbled, because of the\ngreatness of their stumbling block, that they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they\nput down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom\nand their own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3472\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3472)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3472)\">2 Ne. 26:20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPaul, writing to the Galatians, said in verses oft quoted by us:\n<\/p><p>\nBut though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which\nwe have preached unto you, let him be accursed.\n<\/p><p>\nAs we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that\nye have received, let him be accursed.\n<\/p><p>\nFor do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I\nshould not be the servant of Christ\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23225\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23225)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23225)\">Gal. 1:8-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI will now read from Second John:\n<\/p><p>\nFor many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in\nthe flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.\n<\/p><p>\nLook to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive\na full reward.\n<\/p><p>\nWhosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that\nabideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.\n<\/p><p>\nIf there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house,\nneither bid him God speed.\n<\/p><p>\nFor he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3148\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3148)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3148)\">2 Jn. 1:7-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Paul wrote to the Corinthians in his First Epistle, he used these words:\n<\/p><p>\nFor I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. . . .\n<\/p><p>\nAnd my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in\ndemonstration of the Spirit and of power:\n<\/p><p>\nThat your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"135\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 135)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(135)\">1 Cor. 2:2,4-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen going on to the eleventh verse, to which I briefly referred this morning:\n<\/p><p>\nFor what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? Even so\nthe things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God.\n<\/p><p>\nNow we have received, not the Spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we\nmight know the things that are freely given to us of God.\n<\/p><p>\nWhich things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the\nHoly Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.\n<\/p><p>\nBut the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto\nhim; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\n<\/p><p>\nBut he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.\n<\/p><p>\nFor who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind\nof Christ (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"138\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 138)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(138)\">1 Cor. 2:11-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThose scriptures are clear; they need, from me, no explanation.\n<\/p><p>\nDESTRUCTIVE DOCTRINES BEING TAUGHT\n<\/p><p>\nI have said on other occasions, and I repeat now that there are being taught amongst us,\nunfortunately, doctrines which are utterly destructive, not only of Jesus the Christ, but even of\nGod himself, and we must be on our watch that neither we nor our children be influenced,\ndebauched, or polluted by such doctrines.\n<\/p><p>\nRecently a man of education (he holds a high scholastic degree), a worthy member of the\nChurch, sent to me a statement of some of the teachings that now are somewhat mooted\namongst some of our Latter-day Saints&mdash;a few only, I trust. I am going to read this statement\nto you and make some comment upon the points as I proceed. There are some ten points.\n<\/p><p>\nI wish to say to you as earnestly as I may, that, as you will see when I have read them, if\nthey shall attain credence amongst us, particularly amongst our young people, they will\ndestroy our faith.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first of these statements reads:\n<\/p><p>\n\"1. <i>God is not an anthropomorphic being<\/i>,\"&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nthat is, he does not have hands, or eyes, or feet, or ears, or a voice&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\n\"<i>and not a personal God, nor a Living God<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI remember when Dr. Talmage used to say something not dissimilar from what I shall say,\nbut he made an actual quote, as I recollect which I can only summarize after these many\nyears. It went about this way:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Thrust God out of the back door, and he comes in at the front door as the First Great Cause.\nThrust the First Great Cause out of the back door, and God enters the front door as a Great\nForce. Push him out as a Great Force, and he comes back in as a Great Intelligence.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNo sane man who can think at all can deny in his heart the existence of God, the God of the\nBible, and of the New Testament,\n<\/p><p>\nand of modern revelation. The next point:\n<\/p><p>\n\"2. <i>Man is a creature of the Universe and draws intelligence and ideas (inventions) from the<\/i>\n<i>Universe by being in harmony with it<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis statement is not only indefinite, but meaningless. It does, however, seem to postulate a\nUniverse Intelligence, and thus we are back to our great concept of God.\n<\/p><p>\n\"3. <i>There is no such thing as supernatural experience among men at any time in history. No<\/i>\n<i>revelation directly from God<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis denies all scripture. It denies all divine manifestations to man. It denies\nhis goodness and his mercy and his love. It gives the lie to the commonest experience of man,\nrecognized from the savage to the most highly civilized man; indeed, it gives the lie\npractically to our very existence.\n<\/p><p>\n\"4. <i>Jesus Christ was a revolutionary leader<\/i>&mdash;<i>but not divine<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis, of course, denies the divinity of Jesus. It falls squarely within the observation of John\nwho declared, as I have already read:\n<\/p><p>\nFor many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is\ncome in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an anti-christ\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3147\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3147)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3147)\">2 Jn. 1:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"5. <i>Joseph Smith did not see God nor really experience any supernatural phenomena. He<\/i>\n<i>wrote the Book of Mormon without divine assistance. He also gave revelations to suit his<\/i>\n<i>purpose and the situation without divine assistance<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNo man can honestly read the Book of Mormon and then say that this boy Prophet wrote it\nhimself, and the most persistent search has failed to reveal that he stole the book. There is too\nmuch in the book to have been written by a boy whom his hostile critics brand as an\nignoramus. And it should be said here, he had no opportunity for consulting either the\nlittle-known sources, which hostile critics have disinterred in trying to destroy him, or the\nmore widely-known sources of which he probably had no knowledge whatever because they\nwere inaccessible to him. No man of his age could have had in his mind, no matter how much\nhe had studied, merely the allusions contained in the Book of Mormon to the holy scriptures,\nand all that we have of his that came from him when speaking or writing normally, gives not\neven a suggestion of his power to compose or to utter those great gems of majestic literature\nwhich are so plentifully found in the Book of Mormon and the D&amp;C.\n<\/p><p>\n\"6. <i>The value of Mormonism is in its practice and in its system. Its origin need not be basic to<\/i>\n<i>one's belief in or acceptance of Mormonism for its value<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nMany of us have heard this heresy before. No shallower view of Mormonism can be taken\nthan is thus expressed. The achievements of our people, the growth of the Church, the\npeople's endurance of hardship, misery, penury, persecution, and even martyrdom itself,\nwould have been wholly impossible without the spirituality which lay behind and vitalized\ntheir whole lives. This people of ours had the Spirit of God to direct them. Take away from\nus that Spirit, take away the divinity which lies behind the gospel, and there is nothing left.\nHad our work not been divinely fathered, we Would not have outlived our first ten years of\nlife.\n<\/p><p>\n\"7. <i>The three-degrees-of-glory story is a myth<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThat is, Paul was mistaken (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3012\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3012)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3012)\">2 Cor. 12:2<\/a><\/span>),\nthe Prophet Joseph was mistaken (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12317\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12317)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12317)\">D&amp;C 131:1<\/a><\/span>), all who have\nthought and taught that glory might come to those who live righteously and die with a\ntestimony, some of them as martyrs, were all mistaken and all they believed in was a myth.\nSuch a concept destroys the teachings of the restored gospel. The words of Paul and the\nwords of the Prophet Joseph were divinely inspired and are the eternal truth.\n<\/p><p>\nHere is another mean thrust:\n<\/p><p>\n\"8. <i>Temple work may occupy old people in pleasant pastime but it is absurd and foolish in its objectives<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThus these antichrists would not only abandon the living but discard the dead, their ancestors\nand loved ones; nothing would be saved, indeed salvation would for no one be a reality.\nEvery instinct of justice and mercy, every really rational concept of man and his being cries\nout against any concept such as this. Temple work is part of the restored gospel.\n<\/p><p>\n\"9. <i>The belief that man might become as God is equally foolish<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis doctrine would, of course, wipe out the great truth of eternal progression. It would thus\ncut off from man even the hope of advancement hereafter; it violates every concept of the\nfuture brought to us by the restored gospel.\n<\/p><p>\n\"10. <i>Practically every theological idea advanced by Joseph Smith can be found in some<\/i>\n<i>ancient religion or in some current beliefs contemporary with his time<\/i>.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThere is truth in the conception that the restored gospel does contain among its truths beliefs\nheld by ancient religions and by modern ones. However, the Prophet Joseph never had the\nopportunity, never had the books, never had the time to search out from these sources all\nthese various truths from the paganism and the Christianity of the past. It was not humanly\npossible for him to do so at his age and with the meager facilities at his command. But we\nknow how it came to be that these partial truths were found in pagan teachings of\npre-Christian eras: the gospel was on the earth from the time of Adam, and from then on\ndown, there appeared here and there in the world, among this people and that, recollections of\nthe doctrines and principles of the gospel as they were taught to Adam. Some of the truths of\nthe gospel have always been on the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nADMONITION TO TEACH THE TRUTH\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, this whole brood of false propaganda is an insidious approach and attempt to\ndestroy the gospel plan and to overturn the Church. We must be on the lookout for it. We\nmust fight against it wherever we find it. Hunt out those who preach it, seek to win them to a\nknowledge of the truth, seek to bring them really into the Church, because as they now stand\nand as they teach and believe they have no place among our membership;\npretending membership they are worse than wolves in sheep's clothing\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34064\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34064)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34064)\">Matt. 7:15<\/a><\/span>); they are as it were,\nSatan trying to appear as an angel of light\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3009\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3009)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3009)\">2 Cor. 11:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLet us care for our youth. Let us not be parties in any way to the paganism, the atheism that\nis abroad in the world and that is expressed in these statements that I have read, for they will\ndestroy our civilization if they shall come to be the belief of the people and to direct their\nlives.\n<\/p><p>\nGod give us the power and the strength to combat these evils, I humbly pray, in the name of\nJesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
