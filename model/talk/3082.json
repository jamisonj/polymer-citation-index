We cannot be too often reminded that Church welfare assistance is spiritual at heart and that these spiritual roots would wither if we ever permitted anything like the philosophy of the dole to enter into our Welfare Services ministrations.

With the arrival of spring we hope all of you will put in your gardens and prepare to enjoy their produce this summer. We hope you are making this a family affair, with everyone, even the little ones, assigned to something. There is so much to learn and harvest from your garden, far more than just a crop itself. We also hope that you are maintaining your year\u2019s supply of food, clothing, and where possible, some fuel and cash savings. Moreover, we hope that you are conscious of proper diet and health habits, that you may be fit physically and able to respond to the many challenges of life. Would you see to it that in your quorum and Relief Society meetings the principles and practices of personal and family preparedness are taught.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/becoming-the-pure-in-heart.p16\" class=\"\">We wish to remind all the Saints of the blessings that come from observing the regular fast and contributing as generous a fast offering as we can, and as we are in a position to give.

Let us resolve today to overcome any such tendencies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/becoming-the-pure-in-heart.p49\" class=\"\">Second, we must cooperate completely and work in harmony one with the other. There must be unanimity in our decisions and unity in our actions. After pleading with the Saints to \u201clet every man esteem his brother as himself\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17008\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17008)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17008)\">D&amp;C 38:24<\/a><\/span>), the Lord concludes his instructions on cooperation to a conference of the membership in these powerful words:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/becoming-the-pure-in-heart.p50\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, this I have given unto you as a parable, and it is even as I am. I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17009\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17009)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17009)\">D&amp;C 38:27<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/becoming-the-pure-in-heart.p51\" class=\"\">If the Spirit of the Lord is to magnify our labors, then this spirit of oneness and cooperation must be the prevailing spirit in all that we do. Moreover, when we do so, we are told by the Prophet Joseph Smith that \u201cthe greatest temporal and spiritual blessings which always come from faithfulness and concentrated effort, never attended individual exertion or enterprise.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> p. 183.) There are few activities in the Church that require more cooperation and concerted effort than Welfare Services. Whether it is rallying to find employment for a displaced quorum member, toiling on a production project, serving as a lead worker at a Deseret Industries, or accepting foster children in the home, it is cooperation and mutual concern that determines the overall success of the Storehouse Resource System.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/becoming-the-pure-in-heart.p52\" class=\"\">Third, we must lay on the altar and sacrifice whatever is required by the Lord. We begin by offering a \u201cbroken heart and a contrite spirit.\u201d We follow this by giving our best effort in our assigned fields of labor and callings. We learn our duty and execute it fully. Finally we consecrate our time, talents and means as called upon by our file leaders and as prompted by the whisperings of the Spirit. In the Church, as in the Welfare system also, we can give expression to every ability, every righteous desire, every thoughtful impulse. Whether a volunteer, father, home teacher, bishop, or neighbor, whether a visiting teacher, mother, homemaker, or friend\u2014there is ample opportunity to give our all. And as we give, we find that \u201csacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven!\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 147.) And in the end, we learn it was no sacrifice at all.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/becoming-the-pure-in-heart.p53\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, if we can do this, then we will find ourselves clothed in the mantle of charity \u201cwhich is the greatest of all, for all things must fail\u2014<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/becoming-the-pure-in-heart.p54\" class=\"\">\u201cBut charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38424\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38424)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38424)\">Moro. 7:46\u201347<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/becoming-the-pure-in-heart.p55\" class=\"\">Let us unite and pray with all the energy of heart, that we may be sealed by this bond of charity; that we may build up this latter-day Zion, that the kingdom of God may go forth, so that the kingdom of heaven may come.
