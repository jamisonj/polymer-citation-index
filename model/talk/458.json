Young, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1950, pp. 137-141<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nAs we go out to the stakes of Zion and the wards of the Church, we feel the warmth and the\nfriendliness of the good people who always makes us so welcome, and as we come into your\nassemblies, there is a friendliness, and we are made to feel at home. But as we meet here in\nthe Tabernacle with all of you together, it becomes a real challenge, and I sincerely trust that\nwhile I stand here I may have an interest in your faith and prayers.\n<\/p><p>\nCOST OF MISSIONARY SERVICE\n<\/p><p>\nThe other day at the opening session of conference some rather imposing figures were\npresented. Among them was the cost of our missionary service, a cost amounting to over four\nmillion dollars, which comes from the general funds of the Church. To that should be added\nthe contributions of the families that make possible the boys and girls called to the mission\nfield.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have nearly five thousand missionaries. The average cost for each\nmissionary a month is about fifty-three dollars. That alone would amount to three million\ndollars a year. Then add to that the equipment, clothing, and other personal accessories, and\nrailroad fares for the missionaries to reach their fields of labor, which costs are largely borne\nby the families of the Church, and it would probably amount to another million dollars; so\nthat we have something like four million dollars cost in the sending of our five thousand\nmissionaries to the nations of the earth. I doubt that that figure would cover the entire\nexpense. Then, as has been suggested here the money that these boys could earn were they to\nremain at home represents another imposing figure.\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Sonne remarked the other day that the Bishop of York, who spoke from this pulpit a\nyear or more ago, on his return to England had been quite complimentary to the Church.\nAmong other things he had said that the Mormon Church must be a very wealthy institution\nto maintain such an impressive missionary service.\n<\/p><p>\nThe funds for that service come from all the people, rich and poor alike, and if the truth were\nknown, it would be found that most of these funds come from the very humble of the\nChurch&mdash;those of very limited means. So this does represent a great contribution on the part of\nChurch members, and it brings home to us what it costs to be a Latter-day Saint.\n<\/p><p>\nSACRIFICES OF CONVERTS\n<\/p><p>\nBut there is another phase to it that transcends all the material costs. I have reference to those\nwho have made great sacrifices in coming into the Church. Brother Widtsoe touched on it\nbriefly this morning when he mentioned the immigrants who come here many learning a new\nlanguage, making new adjustments, the conditions altogether different from those they left in\nthe Old Country. Many of them have had to sacrifice their own kindred and loved ones, being\ntold in some instances that they had to choose between this new religion and their own\nfamilies, and their new-found religion has been their choice. This has been a common\nexperience in this Church from the beginning.\n<\/p><p>\nCONVERSION OF GRANDMOTHER\n<\/p><p>\nI remember my worthy grandmother, a Quaker, who was converted in Pennsylvania through\nthe coming of some of the missionaries in the days of the Prophet Joseph. My mother at one\ntime had a great decision to make, one that was to try her to the very depths. Grandmother\nsaid to her in her typical Quaker style, \"Thee will find that it is not always easy to live the\ntruth, but thee will also find that there is joy and peace that comes in thus living.\" This\ngrandmother and her people, including her mother and seven daughters, had had the restored\ngospel presented to them by the missionaries, and they accepted it. They found the witness;\nthey believed. The father in that home was to say to them (a witness of the\ntruth had not come to him), \"You can either choose this so-called religion or me.\" The\nwitness had come to them, and with that witness there always comes a responsibility. The\nSavior said: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto\nall nations; and then shall the end come\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34375\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34375)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34375)\">Matt. 24:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhen that witness comes into the human heart, it brings, I repeat, a responsibility&mdash;a\nresponsibility that we cannot escape. And this good Quaker grandmother felt that she could\nnot escape it.\n<\/p><p>\nShe did not believe the Book of Mormon when it was first presented to her. She read it and\nread it again and she could not get away from it. Finally the witness came, and that's when\nshe made her decision. She had no other choice, and finally she said to her husband, \"If that's\nit, then it must be.\" So she, with her seven daughters and some of their families, started for\nNauvoo.\n<\/p><p>\nThere was nothing inviting when they arrived in Nauvoo. Nauvoo had been built up and was\nnow a lovely city, but persecution was rampant. The economic conditions of the people were\nnot good; apostasy prevailed; the Prophet was being undermined on every hand; and into this\ninfluence came this good family. I wonder sometimes what some of us would do under\nsimilar circumstances; and yet they never wavered; they never failed.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Grant's mother had to face the same problem. She was told that it was either her\nnew-found religion or her inheritance and her family. She chose her religion because she, too,\nhad received the witness.\n<\/p><p>\nI have always been thrilled in reading the story of Brother Widtsoe's mother. She may be no\ndifferent from hundreds of Scandinavian mothers who have come here. They had to make\ndecisions. They had to decide whether it was their relatives, their friends, or this unpopular\nreligion. So I repeat, my brethren and sisters, the foundation of this Church has been laid at a\ngreat cost.\n<\/p><p>\nBLESSINGS RECEIVED\n<\/p><p>\nThe cost we pay today is minor&mdash;comparable to the great blessings received, it amounts to\nnothing. The Lord has blessed us abundantly, has given us of his substance that we might use\nit to build up the Church and kingdom, so that we need have no anxiety about any of these\ncosts. I repeat, they are minor.\n<\/p><p>\nBut the greatest cost of all is that cost we pay which gives strength and character to our\npeople, a cost that has built a foundation against which the gates of hell cannot prevail.\n<\/p><p>\nNow today what does it all mean to us? What did it mean to these good people? I could name\nmany more who made great sacrifices, and we have them today. We have our modern\npioneers out in the world who are giving up their all because of the witness\nthey have in their souls. And that will always be. But what does it do? I repeat again what my\nworthy grandmother said to my mother, that it brings peace and joy to the human heart.\n<\/p><p>\nJESUS THE CHRIST\n<\/p><p>\nThat is why Easter means so much to the Latter-day Saints. It isn't the symbolism, the\npageantry, that we are conscious of today. It is the fundamental truth that Jesus is the Christ,\nthat he lives, and what he appeared in this day to the Prophet Joseph.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I say \"in this day,\" have you ever stopped to think how close that is? There are men\nsitting on this stand whose fathers knew the man who communed with Jehovah. The man to\nwhom God the Father, and Jesus Christ, the Son, appeared and bore witness again of the\nreality of the life of Jesus Christ, that the resurrection is true, the literal resurrection as\nPresident Clark explained to us this morning in his impressive address. That is how close it is.\n<\/p><p>\nSTATEMENT OF LOUIS PASTEUR\n<\/p><p>\nA consciousness of this truth brings peace to your soul and mine. I read recently a statement\nby one of the French scientists, Louis Pasteur, who lived about eighty years ago, at a time\nwhen skepticism prevailed throughout France. He was trying to prove before the French\nAcademy that the theory of spontaneous generation was not true. When he was chided by his\nassociates for only accepting that which he could prove, he said: \n<\/p><p>\nThis is not to be taken to mean that, in my beliefs and in the conduct of my life, I\nonly take account of acquired science: if I would, I could not do so, for I should then\nhave to strip myself of a part of myself. There are two men in each one of us: the\nscientist, he who starts with a clear field and desires to rise to the knowledge of Nature\nthrough observation, experimentation, and reasoning, and the man of sentiment, the\nman of belief, the man who mourns his dead children (he had just lost a son in the\nFranco-Prussian War), and who cannot, alas, prove that he will see them again, but\nwho believes that he will and lives in that hope, the man who will not die like a\nvibrio, but who feels that the force that is within him cannot die. The two domains are\ndistinct, and woe to him who tries to let them trespass on each other in the so\nimperfect state of human knowledge.\n<\/p><p>\nHe was deeply religious. He had a spiritual concept. Most men of science have that deep\nconcept and a deep humility in their search for truth. He said: \n<\/p><p>\nI see everywhere the inevitable expression of the Infinite in the world; through it, the\nsupernatural is at the bottom of every heart. The idea of God is a form of the idea of\nthe Infinite.\n<\/p><p>\nIn other words, the spiritual is just as real as is the side of a test tube. The spiritual is just as\nreal as the physical. That was the fundamental doctrine of the Prophet Joseph.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so today, Easter means something to you and me. It is worth while&mdash;this great cost. It\nwas worth while to our forebears, my brethren and sisters, and it is worth\nwhile to us. I join with you and with my associates in expressing the gratitude of my heart for\nthe peace that has come to my soul and comes every day, in the confidence and the\nknowledge that I have of the divinity of this great work.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to be true to it, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
