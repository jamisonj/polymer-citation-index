The glorious gift of repentance allows us to return to the path with a new heart, giving us the strength to endure on the path leading to eternal life. The sacrament thus becomes a key component of our endurance in this life. The sacrament provides a precious weekly opportunity to renew our baptismal covenants and repent and evaluate our progress toward exaltation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/press-on.p51\" class=\"\">We are sons and daughters of the Eternal God, with the potential to be joint-heirs with Christ.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote17-24911_000_034\">17<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43749\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43749)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43749)\">Rom. 8:17<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Knowing who we are, we should never give up the goal of achieving our eternal destiny.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/press-on.p52\" class=\"\">I testify that in the eternities, as we look back upon our little span of existence here on this earth, we will lift our voices and rejoice that, in spite of the difficulties we encountered, we had the wisdom, the faith, and the courage to endure and press on.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/press-on.p53\" class=\"\">That we may do so this day and forever is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24911_000_034\"><a name=\"-24911_000_034\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-24911_000_034\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"43699\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43699)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43699)\">Matt. 24:13<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24911_000_034\"><a name=\"-24911_000_034\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-24911_000_034\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"43723\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43723)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43723)\">John 8:31<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24911_000_034\"><a name=\"-24911_000_034\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-24911_000_034\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"43811\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43811)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43811)\">2 Ne. 31:20<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24911_000_034\"><a name=\"-24911_000_034\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-24911_000_034\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"43821\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43821)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43821)\">Omni 1:26<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24911_000_034\"><a name=\"-24911_000_034\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote5-24911_000_034\">5.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"43708\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43708)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43708)\">Mark 4:14\u201320<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24911_000_034\"><a name=\"-24911_000_034\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote6-24911_000_034\">6.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>See Ezra Taft Benson, in Conference Report, Apr. 1989, 3\u20137;
