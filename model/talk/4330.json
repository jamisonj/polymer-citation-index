An idealistic young professional wrote Church headquarters about the plight of migrant farm workers. He had observed treatment that was probably illegal and certainly unchristian. When I read his letter, I thought of the positive example of Jesse Knight, the great benefactor of Brigham Young Academy. At a time when most mine owners exploited their workers, this Christian employer paid his miners something extra so they could earn their living in six days\u2019 labor and rest on the Sabbath. He did not require them to patronize a company store. He built his workers a building for recreation, worship, and schooling. And Brother Knight would not permit the superintendent to question his workers about their religion or politics (see Jesse William Knight, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Jesse Knight Family,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1940, pp. 43\u201344; and Gary Fuller Reese, \u201cUncle Jesse,\u201d master\u2019s thesis, Brigham Young University, 1961, pp. 26\u201328).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/brothers-keeper.p24\" class=\"\">Of course, we understand that what an employer can pay his employees is limited by what his business can obtain for its products or services in a competitive marketplace.

For example, a friend told me of a young student couple who didn\u2019t have enough money for rent, groceries, and tuition but were persuaded to sign up for an expensive self-improvement course. Can a seller ever justify obtaining personal profit by persuading someone to assume a financial burden he cannot wisely bear in order to acquire something he does not really need?

Modern-day prophets have encouraged us not to shop on Sunday (see, for example, Spencer W. Kimball, <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1974, p. 6). Those of us who shop on the Sabbath cannot escape responsibility for encouraging businesses to remain open on that day. Essential services must be provided, but most Sabbath transactions could be avoided if merchants and customers were determined to avoid doing business on the Lord\u2019s day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/brothers-keeper.p28\" class=\"\">Last year the <span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News<\/span> carried an article about a Salt Lake City pharmacist who stopped selling cigarettes in his drugstore.

Consider the terrible effects of alcohol. Alcohol-related accidents are the leading cause of death of those under twenty-five. The physical, social, and financial effects of alcohol ruin marriages and family life. By dulling inhibitions, alcohol leads to untold numbers of crimes and moral transgressions. Alcohol is the number one addictive drug in our day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/brothers-keeper.p32\" class=\"\">The consumption of alcohol is increasing among youth. Targeting young audiences, advertisers portray beer and wine as joyful, socially desirable, and harmless. Producers are promoting new types of alcoholic beverages as competitors in the huge soft-drink market.

Can Christians who are involved in this commerce be indifferent to the physical and moral effects of the alcohol from which they are making their profits?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/brothers-keeper.p33\" class=\"\">Other examples could be given, but these few are sufficient to illustrate the principle that the Golden Rule applies to our earning activities.

But it is important to recognize our responsibility and begin to work toward it. And we should do so joyfully. The gospel is the good news. Commandments lead to blessings. The Prophet Joseph Smith told our first missionaries that when preaching we should \u201cwarn in compassion.\u201d We \u201chave no right \u2026 to scare mankind to repentance,\u201d he said.

We should not consider employees responsible for policies they regret but cannot control. A decision that is made by the owner of a market should not inflict feelings of guilt on a conscientious but powerless Christian who runs the checkout stand. Similarly, a part-owner does not have freedom to impose his standards on business policies if he has partners who do not share his moral concerns. An incorporated business may be controlled by stockholders who have no concern for the destructive human effects of a profitable product or policy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/brothers-keeper.p36\" class=\"\">We live in a complex society, where even the simplest principle can be exquisitely difficult to apply. I admire investors who are determined not to obtain income or investment profits from transactions that add to the sum total of sin and misery in the world. But they will have difficulty finding investments that meet this high standard. Good things are often packaged with bad, so decisions usually involve balancing. In a world of corporate diversification, we are likely to find that a business dealing in beverages sells milk in one division and alcohol in another. Just when we think that our investments are entirely unspotted from the world, we may find that our life insurance is partially funded by investments we wish to avoid. Or our savings may be deposited in a bank that is lending to ventures we could not approve. Such complexities make it difficult to prescribe firm rules.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/brothers-keeper.p37\" class=\"\">We must rely on teaching correct principles, which each member should personally apply to govern his or her own circumstances.

I testify of Jesus Christ, our Savior, whose blood has atoned for repented sins and whose resurrection has broken the bands of death for all. The fulness of the gospel was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. His successor, President Ezra Taft Benson, holds the keys of the everlasting gospel in our day. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
