In his role as chief high priest, he had been attempting to protect his people from falling into sin by teaching them the gospel. In his role as chief judge, he had been administering the laws of the land. As he found the wickedness of the people increasing, he could not continue to divide his time between these dual roles. Again we read from the book of Alma regarding his decision:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/but-the-labourers-are-few.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he selected a wise man who was among the elders of the church, and gave him power according to the voice of the people, that he might have power to enact laws according to the laws which had been given, and to put them in force according to the wickedness and the crimes of the people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/but-the-labourers-are-few.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cNow this man\u2019s name was Nephihah, and he was appointed chief judge; and he sat in the judgment-seat to judge and to govern the people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/but-the-labourers-are-few.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cNow Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high priest over the church, but he retained the office of high priest unto himself; but he delivered the judgment-seat unto Nephihah.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/but-the-labourers-are-few.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd this he did that he himself might go forth among his people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the word of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty, \u2026 that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9895\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9895)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9895)\">Alma 4:16\u201319<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/but-the-labourers-are-few.p12\" class=\"\">Alma understood a basic fact of life. There is no way of caring for the problems of mankind unless the great majority of them have been taught and subscribed their lives to a code of conduct which will keep them from falling into sin. The Lord, in the very beginning, established for our first earthly parents commandments and covenants which, if observed and obeyed, will keep us from the heartache and waste of unrighteous living. As we consider conditions in the world today, we should be asking the question, \u201cHow can we more effectively prevent the loss resulting from an overwhelming increase in spiritual, emotional, and physical problems now afflicting mankind?\u201d It seems as if we are spending too much of our time and energy in repairing the damage of sin and not enough time in teaching them the Lord\u2019s law as a foundation on which they can govern our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/but-the-labourers-are-few.p13\" class=\"\">From the Old Testament we find Ezekiel telling us that the Lord reproved those who did not help feed His sheep.

The response to the prophet\u2019s voice has been heartwarming. Many thousands of young men have listened to his clarion call and have come forward to fulfill honorable, successful missions, declaring the gospel of our Lord and Savior to ever-increasing numbers. Their harvest has been truly remarkable.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/but-the-labourers-are-few.p24\" class=\"\">As the numbers increase, the call of the prophet was again heard to open the doors of nations to the preaching of the gospel. We have all witnessed a miracle of the power of the united prayers of the Saints. Doors have been opened to the preaching of the gospel in nations never dreamed of or hoped for just a few years ago. Now the demand for increased numbers of full-time missionaries is greater than ever before. And again we issue the call for every worthy young man to heed the voice of the prophet to serve as a full-time missionary. We call on you bishops and branch presidents to see that every worthy and able young man has an opportunity to go forth into the mission field. Many of our young women have also served in the mission field. They have been some of the most productive missionaries we have.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/but-the-labourers-are-few.p25\" class=\"\">President Kimball made the following statement regarding young women serving: \u201cMany young women have a desire to serve a full-time mission, and they are also welcome in the Lord\u2019s service. This responsibility is not on them as it is on the elders, but they will receive rich blessings for their unselfish sacrifice. The Lord is pleased [with] their willingness to bring souls to him.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">President Kimball Speaks Out, <\/span>Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1981, p. 30.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/but-the-labourers-are-few.p26\" class=\"\">These valiant young men and young women go into the mission field bearing a strong witness of the mission of our Lord and Savior, giving true Christian service and teaching with faith and conviction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/but-the-labourers-are-few.p27\" class=\"\">In addition to the need for more young men and women to serve, there is an urgent need for couples. Each time we visit a mission, the universal request is for more couples. The need is great for mature couples who are financially able, possessing strong testimonies and with reasonably good health. Their entry into the mission field adds strength and maturity to our missionary effort.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/but-the-labourers-are-few.p28\" class=\"\">With the opportunities to labor so plentiful, we need experienced couples to work with those newly converted to the gospel, making sure that the seeds which have fallen on good ground will be nourished and cultivated in order that the tares of a previous life-style will not spring up and choke out the good plants. You mature couples have years of experience in studying, teaching, and administering in the wards and branches of the Church. That experience is so desperately needed throughout the world to prevent the tender new plants from being overcome by worldliness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/but-the-labourers-are-few.p29\" class=\"\">You are the ones who can build a firm root structure, which will support the new converts in the truths of the gospel in this life and help them become worthy to receive the blessings in the eternities to come.

They were able to see two couples go to the temple, have eighteen baptisms, increase ward activity from an average of 136 to over 180 during just the year that they labored in the Nevada Ward. When they came into the mission field, they had just purchased a new truck. During their mission, they put 29,000 miles on the vehicle. This couple was truly dedicated to strengthening the Lord\u2019s work in this area. Now they are retired, living in St. George and would like to go on another mission in the near future.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/but-the-labourers-are-few.p31\" class=\"\">The letter continues:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/but-the-labourers-are-few.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cBrother Williams is the branch president in the Lebanon Branch.
