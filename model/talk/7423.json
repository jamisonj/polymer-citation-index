Instead of being like the army of Helaman, who \u201chad been taught by their mothers [that] God would deliver them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50323\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50323)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50323)\">Alma 56:47<\/a><\/span>), you may be like their parents, the people of Ammon, who grew up as nonbelievers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/a-lesson-from-the-book-of-mormon.p8\" class=\"\">It may be helpful to review the story about the people of Ammon. They were Lamanites who had been taught the gospel by Ammon, Aaron, and others (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"50294\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50294)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50294)\">Alma 23:1\u20134<\/a><\/span>). When they accepted the gospel, these Lamanites were called the Anti-Nephi-Lehies and later called the people of Ammon (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"50296\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50296)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50296)\">Alma 23:16\u201317<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"50298\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50298)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50298)\">27:23\u201326<\/a><\/span>). The sons of these people of Ammon were the army of Helaman, who helped fight the nonconverted Lamanites (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"50322\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50322)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50322)\">Alma 56:3\u20136<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/a-lesson-from-the-book-of-mormon.p9\" class=\"\">So the strength of the army of Helaman really began with their parents, who were the people of Ammon. They were the ones who first learned the gospel from the scriptures. They were the ones who learned about the power of prayer. And they were the ones who first made and kept covenants with the Lord. And just as it began with them, it begins with you. As first-generation members, you are the ones who begin the cycle of teaching and strengthening the next generation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Scriptures<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/a-lesson-from-the-book-of-mormon.p11\" class=\"\">Aaron, who was a great missionary, used the scriptures to teach the Lamanite king and the people of Ammon about faith and repentance and about Jesus Christ and the plan of happiness (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"50291\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50291)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50291)\">Alma 22:12\u201314<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"50295\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50295)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50295)\">23:4\u20135<\/a><\/span>). Today, reading and studying the scriptures continues to build our faith, helps us resist temptation, and allows us to grow closer to Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/a-lesson-from-the-book-of-mormon.p12\" class=\"\">However, reading scriptures can present a challenge for everyone. President Boyd K. Packer shares his first attempts as a teenager at reading the Book of Mormon. He says: \u201cI opened it and read, \u2018I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents\u2019 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50242\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50242)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50242)\">1 Nephi 1:1<\/a><\/span>). \u2026 It was interesting, and I could follow it until I got over to the Isaiah chapters. \u2026 So a few months later I decided to try again to read the Book of Mormon. I read, \u2018I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents,\u2019 but every time I\u2019d hit the barrier of those Isaiah chapters. \u2026 Finally I decided I was even going to read them.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-00605_000_029\">3<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cPrinciples of Teaching and Learning,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,<\/span> Feb. 2007; in <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> June 2007, 53; <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> June 2007, 85.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/a-lesson-from-the-book-of-mormon.p13\" class=\"\">And of course President Packer did read them. Persistence is the key. With every reading of the scriptures, unfamiliar words will take on meaning. You can read about heroes and great acts of courage. You can learn of the tender mercies of the Lord. And above all, you can feel the love of God and know that Jesus Christ is our Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Prayer<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/a-lesson-from-the-book-of-mormon.p15\" class=\"\">Prayer is another means to build faith. When the Lamanite king wanted to know what he should do in order to receive the joy of the gospel, he prayed to the Lord (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"50293\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50293)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50293)\">Alma 22:16\u201317<\/a><\/span>).

He was excited about the gospel and wanted to be baptized until his friends criticized the Church. He met with the missionaries. They testified that God cared enough about him to answer his prayer. They invited him to kneel and ask Heavenly Father if the teachings were true. First one companion and then the other offered a short prayer. Then Stanley prayed. When he finished his humble prayer, they asked him, \u201cStanley, how do you feel?\u201d He slowly raised his head and in almost a whisper replied, \u201cBaptism, baptism.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-00605_000_029\">4<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[Personal correspondence.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Covenants<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/a-lesson-from-the-book-of-mormon.p18\" class=\"\">Finally, making and keeping covenants also increases faith.

I remember my nonmember father helping me write the first talk I gave at church.

She taught us about fasting, and, well, I was only seven years old, so I didn\u2019t want to fast. But when she taught us about baptism, I wanted to be baptized.
