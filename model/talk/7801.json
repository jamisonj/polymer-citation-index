The Church has organized its resources to assist members to provide for the physical, spiritual, social, and emotional well-being of themselves, their families, and others. The office of bishop carries with it a special mandate to care for the poor and needy and to administer such resources for the members in his ward. He is assisted in his efforts by priesthood quorums, Relief Society, and in particular, home and visiting teachers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-essence-of-discipleship.p8\" class=\"\">Relief Society has always been at the heart of welfare.

Priesthood holders provide essential support for those needing spiritual guidance and help. Inspired home teachers bless lives and provide the blessings of the gospel to every family unit. In addition, they lend their strength and talents in other ways, such as helping a family in need of home repairs, in helping a family move, or in helping a brother find needed employment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-essence-of-discipleship.p11\" class=\"\">Relief Society presidents visit homes to assess the needs for a bishop. Inspired visiting teachers watch over and care for sisters and families. They are often the first response in times of immediate need.

When members of the Church and their families do everything they can to sustain themselves and still cannot meet basic needs, the Church stands ready to help. Short-term needs are met immediately, and a plan to help the recipient become self-reliant is established. Self-reliance is the ability to provide the spiritual and temporal necessities of life for self and family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-essence-of-discipleship.p15\" class=\"\">As we increase our own level of self-reliance, we increase our ability to help and serve others the way the Savior did. We follow the Savior\u2019s example when we minister to the needy, the sick, and the suffering.

Her husband, Brent, works long hours and commutes an hour each way to work. Soon after the birth of their second little girl, she related the following experience: \u201cThe day after I received the call to serve as a counselor in my ward Relief Society, I began to feel quite overwhelmed. How could I possibly take on the responsibility to help care for the women in my ward when I was struggling just to fulfill my role as a wife and mother of a very active two-year-old and a new baby? Just as I was dwelling on these feelings, the two-year-old became sick. I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do for her and care for the baby at the same time. Just then, Sister Wasden, who is one of my visiting teachers, unexpectedly came to the door. A mother of grown children, she knew just what to do to help. She told me what I needed to do while she went to the drugstore to get some supplies. Later on she arranged for my husband to be picked up at the train station so that he could get home quickly to help me. Her response to what I believe was a prompting from the Holy Ghost along with her willingness to serve me were just the reassurance I needed from the Lord that He was going to help me to fulfill my new calling.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/the-essence-of-discipleship.p23\" class=\"\">Heavenly Father loves us and knows our unique circumstances and abilities.
