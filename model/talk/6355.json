This is the first general conference of this century and millennium, and the first one to be held in this great new Conference Center of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I join with all of you in expressing admiration, respect, and appreciation for the vision of our great prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley. His was the faith and courage to move forward with this great project.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/the-shield-of-faith.p5\" class=\"\">With a tear of sadness, we leave our beloved Tabernacle, the traditional site for general conference. As President Hinckley has said, \u201cWe have outgrown it.\u201d We pause to pay tribute to the faith, vision, and inspiration of Brigham Young and his associates who in faith built the Tabernacle, the construction of which is truly remarkable. I have been in the ceiling area of the Tabernacle, where the original rawhide bindings are still wrapped around the timbers of the roof structure. Although the timbers have since been reinforced with steel, the creative handiwork of the faithful pioneer Saints still stands as a symbol of their great faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/the-shield-of-faith.p6\" class=\"\">I believe the future will be great and marvelous in many respects.

However, great will be the challenges and endless the problems, because with this wave of knowledge, life actually becomes more complicated. Brigham Young said, \u201cIt was revealed to me in the commencement of this Church, that the Church would spread, prosper, grow and extend, and that in proportion to the spread of the Gospel among the nations of the earth, so would the power of Satan rise.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-20905_000_008\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> sel.

Faith will be our strong shield to protect us from the fiery arrows of Satan. Values should not change with time, because faith in Jesus Christ is indispensable to happiness and eternal salvation. The greatest century of advancement in science and technology has just ended. Yet a spirit of darkness prevails in our day as it did many centuries ago when Jesus Christ was about to be crucified. Even so, as the Prophet Joseph Smith said: \u201cGreat blessings await us at this time, and will soon be poured out upon us, if we are faithful in all things, for we are even entitled to greater spiritual blessings than they were, because they had Christ in person with them, to instruct them in the great plan of salvation. His personal presence we have not, therefore we have need of greater faith.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-20905_000_008\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> sel.

Although science and technology open up boundless opportunities, they also present great perils because Satan employs these marvelous discoveries to his great advantage. The communication highway that spans the globe is overloaded with information for which no one bears responsibility for its truth or its source. Crime has become much more sophisticated and life more perilous. In war, killing has become far more efficient. Great challenges lie ahead unless the power of faith, judgment, honesty, decency, self-control, and character increases proportionately to compensate for this expansion of secular knowledge. Without moral progress, stimulated by faith in God, immorality in all its forms will proliferate and strangle goodness and human decency. Mankind will not be able to fully express the potential nobility of the human soul unless faith in God is strengthened.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/the-shield-of-faith.p9\" class=\"\">In our time the belief that science and technology can solve all of mankind\u2019s problems has become a theocracy. I would despair if I thought our eternal salvation depended on scientific, technical, or secular knowledge separate from righteousness and the word of God. The word of God as spoken by His prophets through the centuries justifies no other conclusion. Many believe that the transcendent answers to life\u2019s questions lie in the test tube, in the laboratories, in the equations, and in the telescopes. This theocracy of science leaves out the ultimate answer to the overarching question, \u201cWhy?\u201d Knowing cause and effect is fascinating but does not explain why we are here, where we came from, and where we are going. As Albert Einstein said, \u201cI shall never believe that God plays dice with the world.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-20905_000_008\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[In John Bartlett, comp., <span class=\"emphasis\">Familiar Quotations,<\/span> 14th ed.
