He first publicly mentioned the incident at general conference in October of 1880. Sixteen years later he gave further details in a discourse delivered at the Weber Stake conference, and his remarks were published in <span class=\"emphasis\">The Deseret Weekly.<\/span> In the 1880 conference President Woodruff told of dreams he had after the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith in which he conversed with the Prophet many times. He then related another dream in which he talked with Brigham Young, and this is what he said about it:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/developing-spirituality.p4\" class=\"\">\u201cI saw Brother Brigham and Brother Heber ride in [a] carriage ahead of the carriage in which I rode when I was on my way to attend conference; and they were dressed in the most priestly robes. When we arrived at our destination I asked Prest. Young if he would preach to us. He said, \u2018No, I have finished my testimony in the flesh I shall not talk to this people any more. But (said he) I have come to see you; I have come to watch over you, and to see what the people are doing. Then (said he) I want you to teach the people\u2014and I want you to follow this counsel yourself\u2014that they must labor and so live as to obtain the Holy Spirit, for without this you cannot build up the kingdom; without the spirit of God you are in danger of walking in the dark, and in danger of failing to accomplish your calling as apostles and as elders in the church and kingdom of God. And, said he, Brother Joseph taught me this principle.\u2019\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 21:318.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/developing-spirituality.p5\" class=\"\">President Woodruff then went on to say of that experience, as he spoke at the Weber Stake conference, essentially what I want to say today: \u201cEvery man and woman in this Church should labor to get that Spirit. We are surrounded by these evil spirits that are at war against God and against everything looking to the building up of the kingdom of God; and we need this Holy Spirit to enable us to overcome these influences.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret Weekly,<\/span> 7 Nov. 1896, p. 643.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/developing-spirituality.p6\" class=\"\">Continuing his discourse, President Woodruff told of his missionary experiences. He said: \u201cIn the time of the apostasy in Kirtland \u2026 the Spirit of God said to me, \u2018You choose a partner and go straight to Fox Islands.\u2019 Well, I knew no more what was on Fox Islands than what was on Kolob. But the Lord told me to go, and I went. I chose Jonathan H. Hale, and he went with me. \u2026 Through the blessings of God I brought nearly a hundred from there up to Zion, at the time the Saints were driven out of Missouri into Illinois.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/developing-spirituality.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cSo it has been all through my life. If I have undertaken to do anything, and the Lord has wanted me to do something else, He has had to tell me. When we were sent to England, we were sent by revelation. I went into the Staffordshire potteries with Brother Alfred Cordon. We were doing a splendid work, baptizing almost every night, and I thought it was the finest mission I ever was on. I went into the town of Hanley one night, and attended meeting in a large hall, which was filled to overflowing. The Spirit of the Lord came upon me and said that that was the last meeting I should hold with that people for many days. I told the people that that was the last meeting I should be with them. After the meeting, they asked me where I was going. I told them I did not know. In the morning I asked the Lord what He wanted of me. He merely said, \u2018Go to the south.\u2019 I got into the stage and rode eighty miles. The first man\u2019s house I stopped at was John Benbow\u2019s in Herefordshire. In half an hour after I entered the house I knew exactly why the Lord had sent me. There was a people there who had been praying for the ancient order of things. They were waiting for the Gospel as it was taught by Christ and His Apostles. The consequence was, the first thirty days after I got there I baptized six hundred of those people. In eight month\u2019s labor in that country I brought eighteen hundred into the Church. Why? Because there was a people prepared for the Gospel, and the Lord sent me there to do that work. I have always had to give God the glory for everything good that has happened to me; for I have realized by what power it came.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret Weekly,<\/span> 7 Nov. 1896, p. 643.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/developing-spirituality.p8\" class=\"\">President Woodruff concludes with these words: \u201cI refer to these things because I want you to get the same Spirit. All the Elders of Israel, whether abroad or at home, need that Spirit. \u2026 This is the Spirit that we must have to carry out the purposes of God on the earth. We need that more than any other gift. \u2026 We are in the midst of enemies, in the midst of darkness and temptation, and we need to be guided by the Spirit of God. We should pray to the Lord until we get the Comforter. This is what is promised to us when we are baptized. It is the spirit of light, of truth, and of revelation and can be with all of us at the same time.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret Weekly,<\/span> 7 Nov. 1896, p. 643.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/developing-spirituality.p9\" class=\"\">Developing spirituality and attuning ourselves to the highest influences of godliness is not an easy matter. It takes time and frequently involves a struggle. It will not happen by chance, but is accomplished only through deliberate effort and by calling upon God and keeping his commandments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/developing-spirituality.p10\" class=\"\">The Apostle Paul spent much of his life teaching and encouraging spirituality in the then far-flung missions of the world. He frequently used terminology from the sports, games, and athletic contests. He said that a Saint successfully keeping the commandments is like an athlete winning his contest; that comparable degrees of training, exertion, obedience to the rules, self-discipline, and the will to win are involved. To the Corinthians he wrote words, which paraphrased, are to this effect: \u201cYou know (do you not?) that at the sports all the runners run the race, though only one wins the prize. Like them, run to win! Now every athlete goes into strict training. They do it to win a perishable wreath, but our wreath will last forever. For my part I run with a clear goal before me.

The Prophet Joseph Smith said: \u201cWe consider that God has created man with a mind capable of instruction, and a faculty which may be enlarged in proportion to the heed and diligence given to the light communicated from heaven to the intellect; and that the nearer man approaches perfection, the clearer are his views, and the greater his enjoyments, till he has overcome the evils of his life and lost every desire for sin; and like the ancients, arrives at that point of faith where he is wrapped in the power and glory of his Maker, and is caught up to dwell with Him. But we consider that this is a station to which no man ever arrived in a moment.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 2:8.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/developing-spirituality.p23\" class=\"\">Part of our difficulty as we strive to acquire spirituality is the feeling that there is much to do and that we are falling far short. Perfection is something yet ahead for every one of us; but we can capitalize on our strengths, begin where we are, and seek after the happiness that can be found in pursuing the things of God. We should remember the Lord\u2019s counsel:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/developing-spirituality.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work.

Every person can and must make spiritual progress. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the divine plan for that spiritual growth eternally. It is more than a code of ethics. It is more than an ideal social order. It is more than positive thinking about self-improvement and determination. The gospel is the saving power of the Lord Jesus Christ with his priesthood and sustenance and with the Holy Spirit. With faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and obedience to his gospel, a step at a time improving as we go, pleading for strength, improving our attitudes and our ambitions, we will find ourselves successfully in the fold of the Good Shepherd.
