With careful planning and some sacrifice, the majority of the members of the Church can receive the ordinances of the temple for themselves and for their ancestors and be blessed by the covenants made therein.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/temple-worship-the-source-of-strength-and-power-in-times-of-need.p6\" class=\"\">Because I love you, I am going to speak to you heart to heart, without mincing words. I have seen that many times individuals have made great sacrifices to go to a distant temple. But when a temple is built close by, within a short time, many do not visit it regularly. I have a suggestion: When a temple is conveniently nearby, small things may interrupt your plans to go to the temple. Set specific goals, considering your circumstances, of when you can and will participate in temple ordinances. Then do not allow anything to interfere with that plan. This pattern will guarantee that those who live in the shadow of a temple will be as blessed as are those who plan far ahead and make a long trip to the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/temple-worship-the-source-of-strength-and-power-in-times-of-need.p7\" class=\"\">Fourteen years ago I decided to attend the temple and complete an ordinance at least once a week. When I am traveling I make up the missed visits in order to achieve that objective. I have kept that resolve, and it has changed my life profoundly. I strive to participate in all the different ordinances available in the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/temple-worship-the-source-of-strength-and-power-in-times-of-need.p8\" class=\"\">I encourage you to establish your own goal of how frequently you will avail yourself of the ordinances offered in our operating temples.

I have felt that they represent many spirits waiting for the vicarious work to be done for them in that sanctuary, rejoicing because finally there is a place that can free them from the chains that hold them back in their eternal progress. In order to achieve this end, you will need to do the vicarious work. You will need to identify your ancestors. The new FamilySearch\u2122 program makes the effort easier than before. It is necessary to identify those ancestors, qualify them, and come to the house of the Lord to perform the ordinances they are longing to receive.

To start out on such a journey in the winter as it were and in our state of poverty, it would seem like walking into the jaws of death.
