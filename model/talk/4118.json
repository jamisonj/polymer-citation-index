Twenty-seven miners lost their lives when fire engulfed the long underground slopes and shafts. Many of these were young men with young wives and young children. The hearts of thousands over the world were touched by the suffering of loved ones left behind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-victory-over-death.p5\" class=\"\">I met many of these.

There was an overwhelming feeling of loneliness as widows, with children to feed and clothe and educate, looked into the bleakness of the future. Our tears flowed with theirs. But shining through all of this was a faith transcendent that, as surely as there had been mortal death, there will be immortal life; and as certainly as there had been separation, there will be reunion. This is the faith which comes of Christ, who brought to all the promise of immortality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-victory-over-death.p6\" class=\"\">My beloved brethren and sisters, what a glorious day is Easter!

They say they are men and women of courage and character, but they are defeated and frightened by the terrifying circumstances in which they find themselves. Their lands are dry and naked. There is neither irrigation water nor food. They wander in desperation until they and their children die unless they are fed. A little cracked wheat literally spells the difference between life and death.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-victory-over-death.p64\" class=\"\">Only if rains come and wells are drilled can there be long-term recovery and sustenance. Some of our funds will be used in a joint venture relationship to drill in areas of underground water to bring land under cultivation and make it fruitful, with the hope that there may be long-term as well as short-term help for these destitute people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-victory-over-death.p65\" class=\"\">I, for one, am deeply grateful for the opportunity to assist in blessing those of our Father\u2019s children in that part of the earth who are in such desperate need. I am confident that there springs up in the heart of each of you a feeling of appreciation for what has come to pass and will yet further come to pass as the result of many of our people with one heart doing so small a thing as refraining from two meals and contributing the value thereof to a common effort. Think what might happen if there were such a fast day observed across the world. No one would be hurt, and many would be helped. How grateful we are for the inspiration of the Almighty in establishing so simple, yet so effective a program for relieving want and suffering.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-victory-over-death.p66\" class=\"\">In the administration of African relief we have not used a single dollar for overhead, but every dollar you have contributed has gone or will go to help directly those in such urgent need, not one of whom is a member of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-victory-over-death.p67\" class=\"\">May I read a few lines from two letters. The first is from the chairman of Catholic Relief Services:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-victory-over-death.p68\" class=\"\">\u201cI want to acknowledge the very generous contribution of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u2026 for relief efforts in Ethiopia and the Sudan. You can be sure that these funds will be put to rapid use to help alleviate the suffering that millions face in those countries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-victory-over-death.p69\" class=\"\">\u201cWe are pleased to participate in an interfaith action of this kind. Such ecumenical efforts underline the compassion and concern which we hold in common when faced by such human tragedies as well as our common commitment to positive action.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-victory-over-death.p70\" class=\"\">\u201cThis cooperation between us has a special character since the resources involved come directly from your individual members through a day of fasting. It is thus in a very heartening sense an example of people responding to people at a fundamental level of moral and practical concern. \u2026 Sincerely yours in Christ, [signed] Daniel P. Reilly, Bishop of Norwich, chairman of the board of directors\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-victory-over-death.p71\" class=\"\">And now from the president of the American Red Cross:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-victory-over-death.p72\" class=\"\">\u201cI cannot thank you and your members in the U.S. and Canada enough for the outstanding support you have given the Red Cross relief effort in Africa. Your most recent contribution of $800,000 brings the total donations to $1,400,000. This support \u2026 has permitted us to provide 350,000 victims food for a month based upon the Red Cross estimate that $4 a month is needed to feed a child. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-victory-over-death.p73\" class=\"\">\u201cIn Ethiopia \u2026 on a daily average the Red Cross workers are feeding more than 500,000 people. \u2026 Red Cross assistance is being provided to the most vulnerable groups: children under 5 years of age, pregnant women, nursing mothers and the elderly. In northern Ethiopia where few other organizations are able to work, assistance is being given to the most needy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-victory-over-death.p74\" class=\"\">\u201cIn neighboring Sudan the situation is deteriorating rapidly. 200,000 to 300,000 new refugees from Chad, Uganda and Ethiopia are expected by the end of May. In addition, Sudan itself is being affected by the drought with 280,000 forced to leave their homes in search of food. 15,000 children were recently found to suffer night blindness, the last step to total blindness due to poor nutrition. These children are now being fed by the Red Cross. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/the-victory-over-death.p75\" class=\"\">\u201cYou may be assured the Red Cross is honored by the trust you have placed in our relief work. <span class=\"emphasis\">All<\/span> contributions given through the American Red Cross are used in African Famine Relief. No overhead or fund raising costs are being deducted. I know your members have sacrificed to make this relief possible. The trust of your fellowship will be honored. God bless you all.

Many contributed far more than the value of two meals.

We can similarly respond to a score of other challenges we face as Latter-day Saints to move forward the work of God.
