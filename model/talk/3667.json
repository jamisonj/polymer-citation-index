The delicately hand-carved roses, figures, and designs in the beautiful woods make his furniture as lovely as I have ever seen. Every piece is exquisite. Every creation is a masterpiece. One day my Ruth and I were in the entrance of his factory when a beautiful, newly made piece of furniture was carried in from the factory for showing. The grain of the wood flowed beautifully, and the finish was perfection. But to President Spat the hardware did not seem up to standard. Without hesitation, he took a screwdriver and a pair of pliers and pulled off all the hardware. His only remark was, \u201cThat is not my work.\u201d President Spat seems incapable of making a piece of furniture which is not as near perfect as it can be.

During World War II, I came home on leave early one September. It was time to put peaches in bottles to preserve them for winter. My beloved mother-in-law called an old friend, George B.

The conversation on the telephone was brief: \u201cGeorge, do you have any peaches for sale?\u201d mother asked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/integrity-the-mother-of-many-virtues.p24\" class=\"\">Patriarch Andrus answered, \u201cI have a few, but they are not very good.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/integrity-the-mother-of-many-virtues.p25\" class=\"\">I volunteered to drive Mother Wright to pick up the peaches.

Early in the history of this valley Joseph W. McMurrin was placed in charge of guarding some of the leaders of the Church. At a meeting in Social Hall in Salt Lake City, an intruder under a claim of authority tried to enter the hall; and Joseph W. McMurrin, being true to his trust to guard the servants of the Lord, restrained him from going through the door. President Heber J. Grant relates that the intruder \u201cfinally got his hand loose and took his pistol and, pressing it against Brother McMurrin\u2019s body, fired two bullets \u2026 through his vitals. Those bullets lodged just under the skin in his back. He was attended by Dr. Joseph Benedict who told Joseph W.

We reap that which we sow. Latter-day Saints have long been taught to live by the virtues of independence, industry, thrift, and self-reliance.
