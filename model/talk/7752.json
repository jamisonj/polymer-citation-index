Complete healing and peace can be found at the feet of the Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/come-unto-me-with-full-purpose-of-heart-and-i-shall-heal-you.p6\" class=\"\">As a seven-year-old boy living in the Arabian Peninsula, I was consistently told by my parents to <span class=\"emphasis\">always<\/span> wear my shoes, and I understood why. I knew that shoes would protect my feet against the many threats to be found in the desert, such as snakes, scorpions, and thorns. One morning after a night\u2019s camping in the desert, I wanted to go exploring, but I did not want to bother with putting on my shoes. I rationalized that I was only going for a little wander and I would stay close by the camp. So instead of shoes, I wore flip-flops. I told myself that flip-flops were shoes\u2014of a sort. And anyway, what could possibly happen?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/come-unto-me-with-full-purpose-of-heart-and-i-shall-heal-you.p7\" class=\"\">As I walked along the cool sand\u2014in my flip-flops\u2014I felt something like a thorn going into the arch of my foot. I looked down and saw not a thorn but a scorpion. As my mind registered the scorpion and I realized what had just happened, the pain of the sting began to rise from my foot and up my leg. I grabbed the top of my leg to try and stop the searing pain from moving farther, and I cried out for help. My parents came running from the camp.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/come-unto-me-with-full-purpose-of-heart-and-i-shall-heal-you.p8\" class=\"\">As my father battered the scorpion with a shovel, an adult friend who was camping with us heroically tried to suck the venom from my foot. At this moment I thought that I was going to die. I sobbed while my parents loaded me into a car and set off across the desert at high speed toward the nearest hospital, which was over two hours away. The pain all through my leg was excruciating, and for that entire journey, I assumed that I was dying.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/come-unto-me-with-full-purpose-of-heart-and-i-shall-heal-you.p9\" class=\"\">When we finally reached the hospital, however, the doctor was able to assure us that only small infants and the severely malnourished are threatened by the sting of that type of scorpion. He administered an anesthetic, which numbed my leg and took away any sensation of pain. Within 24 hours I no longer had any effects from the sting of the scorpion. But I had learned a powerful lesson.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/come-unto-me-with-full-purpose-of-heart-and-i-shall-heal-you.p10\" class=\"\">I had known that when my parents told me to wear shoes, they did not mean flip-flops; I was old enough to know that flip-flops did not provide the same protection as a pair of shoes. But that morning in the desert, I disregarded what I knew to be right. I ignored what my parents had repeatedly taught me. I had been both lazy and a little rebellious, and I paid a price for it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/come-unto-me-with-full-purpose-of-heart-and-i-shall-heal-you.p11\" class=\"\">As I address you valiant young men, your fathers, teachers, leaders, and friends, I pay tribute to all who are diligently striving to become what the Lord needs and wants you to be. But I testify from my own experience as a boy and as a man that disregarding what we know to be right, whether through laziness or rebelliousness, always brings undesirable and spiritually damaging consequences. No, the scorpion did not in the end threaten my life, but it caused extreme pain and distress to both me and my parents. When it comes to how we live the gospel, we must not respond with laziness or rebelliousness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/come-unto-me-with-full-purpose-of-heart-and-i-shall-heal-you.p12\" class=\"\">As members of the Church of Jesus Christ and as bearers of the priesthood, we know the commandments and standards we have covenanted to uphold. When we choose another path from the one we know to be right, as taught by our parents and leaders and as confirmed to our own hearts by the Holy Ghost, it is like stepping onto the desert sand in flip-flops instead of shoes. We then seek to justify our lazy or rebellious behavior. We tell ourselves we\u2019re not really doing anything that wrong, that it doesn\u2019t really matter, and that nothing all that bad will result from letting go just a little from the iron rod. Perhaps we console ourselves with the thought that everyone else is doing it\u2014or doing worse\u2014and we won\u2019t be negatively affected anyway. We somehow convince ourselves that we are the exception to the rule and therefore immune to the consequences of breaking it.
