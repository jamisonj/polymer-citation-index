Merrill, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1945, pp. 111-115<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nBrethren, we are alone this evening, the microphone having been switched off from the\npowerful KSL broadcasting station. We, therefore, become a priesthood leadership meeting of\nthe same type as we are now holding as a part of stake quarterly conferences. So it will be in\norder for me, I hope, to talk about matters that primarily concern priesthood officers.\n<\/p><p>\nEFFECTS OF HARSHNESS AND KINDNESS\n<\/p><p>\nIn the bishops' meeting last evening in this hall, Bishop M. O. Ashton told two stories that\ndeeply impressed me. Each story was about a bishop and some boys. In the first one, a group\nof boys engaged in some Halloween pranks of a rather serious, provocative nature. The bishop\nsecured the names of the boys and charged them to come to the sacrament meeting and\npublicly ask forgiveness for engaging in the pranks committed, on pain of excommunication\nfor failure to do so. In consequence there are in that community today a number of families\nthat grew up outside of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the second case a group of boys and a bishop were involved. A wedding party was held at\nthe bishop's home. A big freezer of ice cream waited on the back porch for the refreshment\nhour. When the cream was to be served, it was observed that the freezer was empty.\nPondering over the matter the bishop decided to invite the guilty boys to an ice cream festival\nand provided two freezers of ice cream for the occasion. All the boys accepted the invitation.\nWhen the lads were seated at the feast, it was noticed that tears began to run down one boy's\nface. Soon all the other boys were in tears also. From among that group have come some of\nthe finest leaders in their community.\n<\/p><p>\nThose were the factual stories told by Bishop Ashton. Hearing them I was reminded of\nsection 121:39-41, D&amp;C, which reads as follows:\n<\/p><p>\nWe have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as\nsoon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise\nunrighteous dominion. Hence many are called, but few are chosen. No power or influence can\nor ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering,\nby gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12199\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12199)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12199)\">D&amp;C 121:39-41<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe two bishops of the story were undoubtedly actuated by the best of motives. Not for a\nmoment would I question that. But one bishop was wise and the other unwise. The thought in\nthe mind of one was to use persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, and love, so\nbeautifully stated in the revelation quoted. In the case of the other bishop he seems to have\nacted impulsively, yielding to the influence of the evil power. He forgot the\nscriptural injunction found in the D&amp;C 64:9-10:\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his\nbrother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the\ngreater sin. I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive\nall men\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12122\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12122)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12122)\">D&amp;C 64:9-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI do not find in the teachings of the Master the word \"must\" used in the sense of force. But\nwe do find the message of the foregoing quoted scripture printed in a beautiful hymn, found\nin the L.D.S. <i>Hymn Book<\/i>, 24th edition, 1905, the first two stanzas being as follows:\n<\/p><p>\nKnow this, that ev'ry soul is free<br \/>\nTo choose his life and what he'll be; <br \/>\nFor this eternal truth is given,<br \/>\nThat God will force no man to heaven\n<\/p><p>\nHe'll call, persuade, direct aright,<br \/>\nAnd bless with wisdom, love, and light; <br \/>\nIn nameless ways be good and kind, <br \/>\nBut never force the human mind.\n<\/p><p>\nFREE AGENCY A GOD-GIVEN PRINCIPLE\n<\/p><p>\nWe all remember, according to the scriptures, both ancient and modern, in that great council\nheld in heaven when a plan was being considered to offer the Father's children when they\ncame to earth, that Lucifer, the son of the morning, was there. He wanted to be sent to earth\nto have charge, promising the Father that all his children would be returned to him&mdash;none to\nbe lost&mdash;provided the Lord would give Lucifer his glory (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38922\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38922)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38922)\">Moses 4:1-4<\/a><\/span>). Satan proposed\nto accomplish his purpose by the use of force by denying men their free agency, taking from\nthem their inalienable right that the Father gave to all his children in the spirit world as well\nas in the world of mortality. Free agency and accountability go hand in hand they complement\neach other.\n<\/p><p>\nBut I have digressed; let me return. There is no indication in the stories Bishop Ashton told\nthat either bishop wanted to take free agency from the boys, but they certainly wanted to\nreform the boys. One succeeded, and the other failed, due to the methods employed. And this\nsuggests the need for care, study, and prayer not only in dealing with boys but in dealing with\nall other people as well. Perhaps no two individuals are exactly alike. What is good for one\nmay be bad for another. What succeeds with one may utterly fail with another. I have heard\nphysicians say that this is one reason that makes the practice of medicine interesting&mdash;the fact\nthat the doctor continually faces a challenge; for what is one man's meat may be another\nman's poison.\n<\/p><p>\nBISHOP'S DUTIES\n<\/p><p>\nIn large measure, a bishop deals with individuals rather than with people en masse. If it were\nnot so, there would often be insufficient reasons for dividing a large ward, for large wards\nhave some advantages not usually possessed by smaller ones. But the need of individual\ntreatment requires of the bishop wisdom, discernment, tact, sympathy, love, in order that he\nmay succeed, without giving offense, in best serving his people. Among other duties, he is\nrequired to administer programs designed to help the boys and girls of his ward. As I see it\nthese duties, in general, are second in importance to no others. If we can save the youth of the\nChurch, we will save the Church. I would not have anyone think, however, that the individual\nexists for the Church. The reverse is true&mdash;the Church exists for its members. Because this is\ntrue, the Church is perhaps the finest example of a large democratic organization found in all\nthe world. No individual can grow up in it, taking advantage of the opportunities offered him\ntherein, without experiencing large personal growth and development in personality, attributes,\ntalents, powers, and other leadership qualities.\n<\/p><p>\nETERNAL PROGRESSION\n<\/p><p>\nYes, the Church teaches the fact that each of us is a child of God, both in the spirit and in the\nflesh. Since in the realm of life, like begets like, we normally must possess, even though in\nultra-microscopic quantities, the attributes of God our Father. And a characteristic teaching of\nthe Church is that \"as God now is man may become\"&mdash;a statement in poetic language of our\nmagnificent doctrine of eternal progression. Man is in very deed the acme of creation. In the\nlanguage of the Psalmist we too can ask:\n<\/p><p>\nWhat is man, that thou are mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? For\nthou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and\nhonour (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41730\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41730)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41730)\">Ps. 8:4-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSo in the plan of eternal progression life here on earth is an essential link, and in this link the\nmost important thing is man&mdash;the individual. This is evident from the plan which, if\nsuccessfully followed, will lead the participants back to the Father's presence. The Lord\nrevealed to Moses that:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . This is my work and my glory&mdash;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38916\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38916)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38916)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo accomplish his purposes the Lord has set up his highly organized Church as an agency to\nserve his children. Hence the Church exists for us and for all who will accept its service.\n<\/p><p>\nSERVICE BRINGS OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY\n<\/p><p>\nAnd we who are here this evening, and many thousands of others besides, have been honored\nby being called into the service of the Church and thus given opportunity to serve our fellow\nmen. If we serve well, we will be blessed. I am reminded at this point of the words\nShakespeare put in the mouth of one of his characters:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . it [mercy] is twice blessed; It blesses him that gives and him that takes.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd of the two, the giver is usually the greater blessed&mdash;always so if he blesses with a sincere,\nunselfish motive.\n<\/p><p>\nNow let us, too, remember that to accept a proffered opportunity to serve is to accept a\nresponsibility as well. We then in very fact become to an extent our brother's keeper. And in\na larger or a smaller measure the welfare of a brother, a child of God, is in our keeping. From\nthis point of view how fit for divine condemnation is he who having accepted responsibility\nfails in his duty to his brethren. Should not this thought act as a spur to the discharge of duty?\nShould it not help to send us reverently to our knees to seek earnestly and sincerely for the\nLord's aid, suited to our needs? Without his help, brethren, none of us can fully succeed in\nhis work. But succeeding, how great the joy and satisfaction that fills our breasts&mdash;a delightful\nfeeling that all the money of a millionaire could not buy for us. This type of feeling is a\nreward from our God for service in his cause. It is an evidence of his acceptance of our\nefforts.\n<\/p><p>\nSATAN'S POWER BEING EXERCISED\n<\/p><p>\nAnother point and I am done. Let us not forget that Satan, a spirit brother of ours, is here on\nearth with a myriad of other spirit brothers. They are among us for a purpose&mdash;they are doing\nall in their power to destroy us and handicap the work of the Lord. Satan knows us\n<\/p><p>\n-our desires, our weaknesses, our secrets. He tempts us in a multitude of ways. He attacks us\nwhere we are weak, not where we are strong. He stirs us up to doubt, to question, to criticize,\nto hate, to be slothful, discouraged, sinful, and wicked. He is at the bottom of dissension\namong the Saints. He is ever near at hand to make attempts to overcome and lead us away. I\nhave in mind not only us in this meeting but people generally. Undoubtedly Satan's influence\nand power in the world today is greater than ever before.\n<\/p><p>\nWe here and many others in the Church are called to be watch-men upon the towers of Zion\nwhere duty calls us to be faithful in teaching the Lord's way of life by example as well as by\nprecept. Then we shall be effective missionaries. And upon the Church is divinely placed the\nheavy responsibility of carrying on missionary work, a labor to which all baptized members\nare called, be they living at home or abroad. No one can escape the\nall-seeing eye of God our Father, who keeps us constantly wherever we are under scrutiny.\nLet us remember that finally the books will be opened and we will be judged by the things\ntherein written&mdash;the deeds done in the body\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3004\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3004)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3004)\">2 Cor. 5:10 (JST)<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42173\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42173)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42173)\">Rev. 20:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThrough his wiles Satan is leading some of our people away. Describing conditions in the last\ndays, Jesus, speaking to his disciples, said:\n<\/p><p>\nFor there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders;\ninsomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34013\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34013)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34013)\">Matt. 24:24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, there is but one way of safety&mdash;live honestly, sincerely, and whole-heartedly near to\nthe Lord and be wholly loyal to the leadership of the First Presidency of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that every one of us with the help of the Lord will have the desire, courage, and\nstrength thus to live, and do it in the name of our Redeemer. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
