Now I take it that that marvelous work and a wonder was to correct the precepts of men, because Isaiah indicated that it was for that reason that He would do a marvelous work and a wonder.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p12\" class=\"\">There isn\u2019t time to discuss all of the wonderful corrections that have come through the restoration of the gospel, this marvelous work and a wonder. However, the first and great correction, I think, was the knowledge that came through the vision of the Father and the Son to the Prophet Joseph Smith, that President Marion G. Romney so beautifully described this morning. Instead of being a God which is an essence everywhere present, without body, parts, or passions (and this means he has no eyes, he cannot see; no ears, he cannot hear; no voice, he cannot speak), they were two glorified beings, as we will be following the resurrection. What a marvelous thing to have this commitment and to know that we are his children\u2014the children of God the Eternal Father\u2014and that we will be able to live in his presence and know who he is, and his Son Jesus Christ, who arose from the dead, and who atoned for the sins of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p13\" class=\"\">The next great correction, I think, came in the great organization of the Church. Just think of the priesthood in this Church, and all of the auxiliary organizations, reference to which has been made here in this meeting as we have sustained the directing officers thereof. President Lee pointed out that the priesthood meeting tonight would be broadcast in 850 different buildings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p14\" class=\"\">Where in all the world can you find an organization of priesthood like that, for every man and every man\u2019s son can bear the priesthood of God and help to build his kingdom in the earth? Thus they lay away treasures in heaven, where moth and rust doth not corrupt and where thieves cannot break through and steal (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"36196\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36196)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36196)\">Matt. 6:19<\/a><\/span>), and where they can develop their gifts and talents, because the kingdom is here for that very express purpose.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p15\" class=\"\">Now there is another beautiful tenet of the Church today that I would like to mention a few words about, and that is our belief in the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. It seems incredible that, as plainly as that principle is taught in the holy scriptures, we should be the only church that so believes. Here a few years ago, one of our brethren wrote a book called <span class=\"emphasis\">Do Men Believe What Their Churches Prescribe<\/span>? (Rulon S. Howells, Deseret Book Co., 1932.) In that book he had a chart prepared showing various doctrinal principles. He had inquired and obtained first-hand comments from the major churches (ten of them, including our own church) and there wasn\u2019t one of those other nine churches that believed in the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. They indicated that marriage was \u201cuntil death do you part,\u201d which in substance is a bill of divorcement. If it is to last only until death parts us, then what are we going to do from that time on? Where are the ties that bind us together, particularly in this church where we brethren work in the priesthood all the time, leaving our wives to raise our families for us, and all of that just to be parted when death comes along?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p16\" class=\"\">I spoke in a meeting down in Quitman, Georgia, when I was president of the mission down there, and I quoted the statement that I have referred to from the chart prepared in this book, and at the close of the meeting I stood at the door to greet the people as they left. A man came up and introduced himself to me as a Baptist minister, and I said: \u201cDid I misquote you here tonight?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cNo, Mr. Richards,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is just like you say. We don\u2019t all believe all the things our churches teach.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p18\" class=\"\">I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe them either. Why don\u2019t you go back and teach your people the truth? They will take it from you, and they are not ready to take it from the Mormon elders yet.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p19\" class=\"\">He said, \u201cI will see you again.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p20\" class=\"\">The next time I went there, about four months later, as I walked up to that little church, there stood that Baptist minister. As we shook hands I said, \u201cI would certainly be interested to know what you thought of my last sermon here.\u201d He said, \u201cMr. Richards, I have been thinking about it ever since. I believe every word you said, only I would like to have heard the rest of it.\u201d You know we never get talked out when we start talking about these beautiful principles that the Lord has given us through the restoration of the gospel, through the bringing forth of this marvelous work and a wonder.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p21\" class=\"\">While I was president of the mission in Atlanta, Georgia, I went to the study of Dr. Peter Marshall. He was the pastor of the Presbyterian Church there and we spent an hour or two together. When he died he was the chaplain of the United States Senate. You may have read his book, <span class=\"emphasis\">A Man Called Peter,<\/span> or may have seen the movie depicting his life. Many of the things he stood for he learned from us down in Atlanta. He used to send over to the mission office to get the MIA books and other Church material for his young people because he felt we were stealing them all away from him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p22\" class=\"\">As I sat in his study with him, I asked him what was the attitude of his church with respect to the principle of eternal marriage, and the eternal duration of the marriage covenant. He said, \u201cWell, Mr. Richards, we are not allowed to teach that in our church, but in my mind I have some stubborn objections.\u201d He went on, \u201cWhen you take the kitten away from the cat, in a few days the cat has forgotten all about the kitten; when you take a calf away from the cow, in a few days the cow has forgotten all about the calf; but when you take the child away from its mother\u2019s bosom, though she live to be a hundred years old, she never forgets the child of her bosom.\u201d He added, \u201cI find it difficult to believe that God created love like that to perish in the grave.\u201d Thank God we know that he didn\u2019t create love like that to perish in the grave. Love is eternal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p23\" class=\"\">Now while the other churches don\u2019t teach that principle, there are some people who believe it. For instance, Anderson M. Baten said this in a little verse he wrote to his wife Beulah on the mysteries of life:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I wed thee forever, not for now<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Not for the sham of earth\u2019s brief years.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I wed thee for the life beyond the tears,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Beyond the heartache and clouded brow.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Love knows no grave, and it shall guide us, dear<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">When life\u2019s spent candles flutter and burn low.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p30\" class=\"\">Now that is what we believe.

He said that \u201cit was not good that the man should be alone;\u201d and he made a help meet for him, and he said \u201cthey shall be one flesh,\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39422\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39422)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39422)\">Moses 3:18, 24<\/a><\/span>), not two halves but one flesh, because he couldn\u2019t have peopled this earth without the man and the woman, and it took two to make a complete person in that sense.

If it wasn\u2019t good to be without a wife before the fall, it certainly won\u2019t be good to be without a companion after the resurrection, and anyone who repudiates that actually repudiates the great atonement, because in that event the Savior would only have atoned in part for the loss that came through the fall of Adam and Eve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p33\" class=\"\">These are great eternal truths that the Lord understood, and so the Savior said, \u201cFor this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.
