Not more than a minute later, we met another sister who greeted us with the same salutation: \u201cGood morning, President Hinckley.\u201d Not wishing to cause her the same disappointment I caused the previous sister, I shook her hand and said, \u201cBless you, my dear.

Sometimes this quest for perfection tries our patience and our faith as we continue to wrestle with the weaknesses of the flesh. But a loving Heavenly Father has not left us alone in our battle with the adversary. A recurrent doctrine of the Book of Mormon is that the Holy Ghost is an active participant in our lives, influencing us for good. Both Nephi and Mormon teach us that the Holy Ghost <span class=\"emphasis\">strives<\/span> with us to help us resist evil (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"4541\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4541)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4541)\">2 Ne. 26:11<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"38108\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38108)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38108)\">Morm. 5:16<\/a><\/span>).

But Lucifer, whose mischief always leads to misery, persistently tries to distract us from reaching our eternal goal. The devil uses thousands of different tactical temptations, but I would submit that all of these temptations could be subsumed within two major satanic strategies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Pride and Discouragement<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/a-mighty-change-of-heart.p9\" class=\"\">The first of these is pride, described by our beloved President Ezra Taft Benson as \u201cthe \u2026 stumbling block to Zion\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1989, p. 7). Satan\u2019s second major strategy is discouragement, which leads to a loss of faith and hope and patience. Both of these nefarious strategies of the adversary are resistant to change. To the proud, change is threatening because it will require a broken heart and a contrite spirit, a meek and a lowly heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/a-mighty-change-of-heart.p10\" class=\"\">To those who are discouraged, there is the feeling that \u201cthere is nothing I can do to change myself or my circumstances.\u201d Whether Satan afflicts us with pride or discouragement, the outcome is largely the same\u2014we begin to accept ourselves as we are, declaring, \u201cThat\u2019s just the way I am.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/a-mighty-change-of-heart.p11\" class=\"\">One of the powerful doctrines of the Book of Mormon is that we <span class=\"emphasis\">can,<\/span> indeed we <span class=\"emphasis\">must,<\/span> undergo a mighty change of heart (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"40879\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40879)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40879)\">Mosiah 5:2<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"9967\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9967)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9967)\">Alma 5:14<\/a><\/span>).

Occasionally, to find relief from the stress of his responsibilities, he would partake of substances forbidden by the Word of Wisdom.

He left his office for several hours and drove to a very secluded spot far removed from the city. There he knelt in humble prayer and pled with the Lord with all the energy of his heart for added strength to overcome this addiction, which robbed his spirituality and threatened to destroy his very soul. He remained on his knees for a very long time, and eventually a sweet, purifying spirit began to distill upon his soul, cleansing him from any desire to drink and fortifying him with a firm resolve to keep the commandments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/a-mighty-change-of-heart.p15\" class=\"\">A spiritually sensitive bishop noticed a change in my friend and extended a call for him to work with the young Aaronic Priesthood brethren of the ward.

In his heart of hearts he wanted to be freed from his prison of uncleanness, but feeling unable to change the direction his life had taken, he terminated the missionary discussions. Before leaving his apartment, the two elders left a copy of the Book of Mormon with him, and testified of its truthfulness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/a-mighty-change-of-heart.p19\" class=\"\">My friend placed the book on his bookshelf and forgot about it for several years.
