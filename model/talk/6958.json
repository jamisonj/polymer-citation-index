I realize this is 2004, not 1904, but I wish to invoke the spirit of that earlier practice and reflect on some of the wonderful things Sister Holland and I are experiencing in Latin America. In doing so I hope to make general application to all of you, wherever you may live or serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/abide-in-me.p5\" class=\"\">First of all I would like to thank every missionary who has ever labored in this transcendent latter-day undertaking we have been given. The rolling forth of the restored gospel is a miracle in every sense of the word, and not the least of the miracle is that a significant portion of it rolls forward on the shoulders of 19-year-olds! As we have seen your sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters, (and in some cases your parents and grandparents!) faithfully laboring in Chile, I have pictured the tens of thousands of others like them we have met all over the world. Clean, clear, bright-eyed missionaries, laboring two-by-two, have become a living symbol of this Church everywhere. They themselves are the first gospel message their investigators encounter\u2014and what a message that is. Everyone knows who they are, and those of us who know them the best, love them the most.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/abide-in-me.p6\" class=\"\">I wish you could meet the sister called to serve with us from her native Argentina. Wanting to do everything possible to finance her own mission, she sold her violin, her most prized and nearly sole earthly possession. She said simply, \u201cGod will bless me with another violin after I have blessed His children with the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/abide-in-me.p7\" class=\"\">I wish you could meet the Chilean elder who, living without family in a boarding school, happened upon a Book of Mormon and started reading it that very evening. Reminiscent of Parley P. Pratt\u2019s experience, he read insatiably\u2014nonstop through the night. With the breaking of day, he was overwhelmed with a profound sense of peace and a new spirit of hope. He determined to find out where this book had come from and who had written its marvelous pages. Thirteen months later he was on a mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/abide-in-me.p8\" class=\"\">I wish you could meet the marvelous young man who came to us from Bolivia, arriving with no matching clothing and shoes three sizes too large for him. He was a little older because he was the sole breadwinner in his home and it had taken some time to earn money for his mission. He raised chickens and sold the eggs door-to-door. Then, just as his call finally came, his widowed mother faced an emergency appendectomy. Our young friend gave every cent of the money he had earned for his mission to pay for his mother\u2019s surgery and postoperative care, then quietly rounded up what used clothing he could from friends and arrived at the MTC in Santiago on schedule. I can assure you that his clothes now match, his shoes now fit, and both he and his mother are safe and sound, temporally as well as spiritually.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/abide-in-me.p9\" class=\"\">And so they come, from your homes all over the world. Included in such a long list of dedicated servants of the Lord is an increasing number of senior couples who make an indispensable contribution to the work. How we love and need couples in virtually every mission of this Church! Those of you who can, put away your golf clubs, don\u2019t worry about the stock market, realize that your grandchildren will still be your grandchildren when you return\u2014and go! We promise you the experience of a lifetime.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/abide-in-me.p10\" class=\"\">Let me say something of the marvelous members of the Church themselves. In the reorganization of a rather far-flung stake recently, I felt the Lord\u2019s prompting to call a man to the stake presidency who, I had been told, owned a bicycle but no automobile. Many leaders across the Church don\u2019t have cars, but I was nevertheless worried about what that might mean for this man in this particular stake. In my terminally-ill Spanish I pursued the interview, then said, <span class=\"language\" xml:lang=\"spa\">\u201cHermano, \u00bfno tiene un auto?\u201d<\/span> With a smile and not a second\u2019s hesitation he replied, <span class=\"language\" xml:lang=\"spa\">\u201cNo tengo un auto; pero yo tengo pies, yo tengo fe.\u201d<\/span> (\u201cI do not have a car, but I do have feet and I do have faith.\u201d) He then said he could ride the bus, ride his bicycle, or walk, <span class=\"language\" xml:lang=\"spa\">\u201ccomo los misioneros,\u201d<\/span> he smiled\u2014\u201clike the missionaries.\u201d And so he does.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/abide-in-me.p11\" class=\"\">Just eight weeks ago I was holding a mission district conference on the island of Chiloe, an interior location in the south of Chile that gets few visitors. Imagine the responsibility I felt in addressing these beautiful people when it was pointed out to me that a very elderly man seated near the front of the chapel had set out on foot at five o\u2019clock that morning, walking for four hours to be in his seat by nine o\u2019clock, for a meeting that was not scheduled to begin until eleven o\u2019clock. He said he wanted to get a good seat. I looked into his eyes, thought of times in my life when I had been either too casual or too late, and thought of Jesus\u2019 phrase, \u201cI have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-24905_000_014\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43263\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43263)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43263)\">Matt. 8:10<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/abide-in-me.p12\" class=\"\">The Punta Arenas Chile Stake is the Church\u2019s southernmost stake anywhere on this planet, its outermost borders stretching toward Antarctica. Any stake farther south would have to be staffed by penguins. For the Punta Arenas Saints it is a 4,200-mile round-trip bus ride to the Santiago temple. For a husband and wife it can take up to 20 percent of an annual local income just for the transportation alone. Only 50 people can be accommodated on the bus, but for every excursion 250 others come out to hold a brief service with them the morning of their departure.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/abide-in-me.p13\" class=\"\">Pause for a minute and ask yourself when was the last time you stood on a cold, windswept parking lot adjacent to the Strait of Magellan just to sing with, pray for, and cheer on their way those who were going to the temple, hoping your savings would allow you to go next time? One hundred ten hours, 70 of those on dusty, bumpy, unfinished roads looping out through Argentina\u2019s wild Patagonia. What does 110 hours on a bus feel like? I honestly don\u2019t know, but I do know that some of us get nervous if we live more than 110 miles from a temple or if the services there take more than 110 minutes. While we are teaching the principle of tithing to, praying with, and building ever more temples for just such distant Latter-day Saints, perhaps the rest of us can do more to enjoy the blessings and wonder of the temple regularly when so many temples are increasingly within our reach.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/abide-in-me.p14\" class=\"\">And that leads me to my final point. For the Church at large, we have so many things to associate in our minds with the visionary ministry of President Gordon B. Hinckley, including (perhaps especially) the vast expansion of temples and temple building. But I dare say for those of us on this rostrum, it is likely that we will remember him at least as emphatically for his determination to retain in permanent activity the converts who join this Church. No modern prophet has addressed this issue more directly nor expected more from us in seeing that it happen. With a twinkle in his eye and a hand smacking the table in front of him, he said to the Twelve recently, \u201cBrethren, when my life is finished and the final services are concluding, I am going to rise up as I go by, look each of you in the eye, and say, \u2018How are we doing on retention?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/abide-in-me.p15\" class=\"\">This subject brings us full circle, linking the kind of true, deep conversion the missionaries are striving to bring with the greater commitment and devotion being seen in wonderful members all over the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/abide-in-me.p16\" class=\"\">Christ said, \u201cI am the true vine, and \u2026 ye are the branches.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-24905_000_014\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43310\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43310)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43310)\">John 15:1, 5<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> \u201cAbide in me, and I in you.

In Spanish that familiar phrase is rendered <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cpermaneced en mi.\u201d<\/span> Like the English verb \u201cabide,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">permanecer <\/span>means \u201cto remain, to stay,\u201d but even gringos like me can hear the root cognate there of \u201cpermanence.\u201d The sense of this then is \u201cstay\u2014but stay <span class=\"emphasis\">forever.<\/span>\u201d That is the call of the gospel message to Chileans and everyone else in the world.
