He unlocked the door of a large new automobile, slid under the wheel, and said proudly, \"How do you like my new car?\" We rode in luxurious comfort into the rural areas to a beautiful new landscaped home, and he said with no little pride, \"This is my home.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe drove to a grassy knoll. The sun was retiring behind the distant hills. He surveyed his vast domain. Pointing to the north, he asked, \"Do you see that clump of trees yonder?\" I could plainly discern them in the fading day.\n<\/p><p>\nHe pointed to the east. \"Do you, see the lake shimmering in the sunset?\" It too was visible.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Now, the bluff that's on the south.\" We turned about to scan the distance. He identified barns, silos, the ranch house to the west. With a wide sweeping gesture, he boasted, \"From the clump of trees, to the lake, to the bluff, and to the ranch buildings and all between&mdash;all this is mine. And the dark specks in the, meadow&mdash;those cattle also are mine.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then I asked from whom he obtained it. The chain of title of his abstract went back to land grants from governments. His attorney had assured him he had an unencumbered title.\n<\/p><p>\n\"From whom did the government get it?\" I asked. \"What was paid for it?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThere came into my mind the bold statement of Paul: \"For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"478\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 478)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(478)\">1 Cor. 10:26<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then the psalmist who declared: \"The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41872\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41872)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41872)\">Ps. 12:6<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then I asked, Did title come from God, Creator of the earth and the owner thereof?

I saw him lying in his death among luxurious furnishings in a palatial home. His had been a vast estate. And I folded his arms upon his breast, and drew down the little curtains over his eyes. I spoke at his funeral, and I followed the cortege from the good piece of earth he had claimed to his grave, a tiny, oblong area the length of a tall man, the width of a heavy one.\n<\/p><p>\nYesterday I saw that same estate, yellow in grain, green in lucerne, white in cotton, seemingly unmindful of him who had claimed it.

A tidal wave rushed in to shore. All occupants were saved, but as the great sea hurried to its place, only a concrete floor marked the place where his prized possession had stood.
