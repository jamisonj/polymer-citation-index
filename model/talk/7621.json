When we increase our faith, the result of that effort strengthens our family. When we serve the Lord and His children, our faith and capacity for righteousness increase. The three responsibilities are inseparably connected.

Increase in faith and personal righteousness.<\/span> To do our part under the plan of the Lord, we are to increase our faith and personal righteousness. Membership in the Church requires faith, which we nourish throughout our lives with great \u201cdiligence, and patience, and long-suffering.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote14-02211_000_036\">14<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117468\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117468)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117468)\">Alma 32:43<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> In the common heritage we share, we have remarkable examples of faith in the early women of the Church. Early pioneer women were driven from homes and persecuted because of their faith. Others survived fires and floods. They crossed oceans and walked thousands of miles, tolerating dirt, illness, and near starvation to help build the Lord\u2019s kingdom on the earth. Many of them buried husbands, children, parents, and siblings along the way. Why did they do this? They did it because the fire of their faith burned in their souls. These remarkable women were not seeking fine clothing, greater leisure, large earthly mansions, or more possessions. Like you, they had a conviction and a testimony that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ was true and that the Lord needed them to do their part in establishing His kingdom on the earth. Their pursuit of personal righteousness was a daily effort to become more like the Savior through repentance, scripture study, prayer, obedience to commandments, and through seeking after everything \u201cvirtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote15-02211_000_036\">15<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117755\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117755)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117755)\">Articles of Faith 1:13<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/fulfilling-the-purpose-of-relief-society.p27\" class=\"\"><span class=\"strong\">2. Strengthen families and homes.<\/span> Our second responsibility is to strengthen families and homes. Families worldwide are being assaulted and weakened by corrupt practices and false teachings. Therefore, whether we are married or single, old or young, we have a duty to defend and practice the truths found in \u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/fulfilling-the-purpose-of-relief-society.p28\" class=\"\">The First Presidency has counseled, \u201cHowever worthy and appropriate other demands or activities may be, they must not be permitted to displace the divinely-appointed duties that only parents and families can adequately perform.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote16-02211_000_036\">16<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[First Presidency letter, Feb. 11, 1999.]<\/span><\/sup> Children being born now are growing up in an increasingly sinful world.

I learned this years ago when I was newly married. My parents, who had been my neighbors, announced that they would be moving to another part of the world. I had relied on my mother\u2019s nurturing, wise, and encouraging example. Now she was going to be gone for a long time. This was before e-mail, fax machines, cell phones, and Web cameras, and mail delivery was notoriously slow. One day before she left, I sat weeping with her and asked, \u201cWho will be my mother?\u201d Mother thought carefully, and with the Spirit and power of revelation which comes to women of this kind, she said to me, \u201cIf I never come back, if you never see me again, if I\u2019m never able to teach you another thing, you tie yourself to Relief Society. Relief Society will be your mother.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/fulfilling-the-purpose-of-relief-society.p30\" class=\"\">Mother knew that if I was sick, the sisters would take care of me, and when I had my babies, they would help me. But my mother\u2019s greatest hope was that the sisters in Relief Society would be powerful, spiritual leaders for me.

I was a member of the ward council, working under the direction of the bishopric. President Boyd\u00a0K. Packer taught us that \u201cjust as [the service of many brethren in the Aaronic Priesthood] strengthens the Higher Priesthood, \u2026 to unselfishly render this service [in Young Women and Primary] is to show devotion to Relief Society.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote17-02211_000_036\">17<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1980, 110.]<\/span><\/sup> When we serve in another auxiliary, we are not released from the sisterhood of Relief Society.

Kimball stated a number of years ago that \u201cthere is a power in this organization that has not yet been fully exercised to strengthen the homes of Zion and build the Kingdom of God\u2014nor will it until both the sisters and the priesthood catch the vision of Relief Society.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote21-02211_000_036\">21<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball, \u201cRelief Society\u2014Its Promise and Potential,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Mar. 1976, 4.]<\/span><\/sup> Relief Society was established by the Lord to organize, teach, and inspire His daughters to prepare for the blessings of eternal life. Our aim is to support the women of the Church in their individual responsibilities by ensuring that every meeting, every lesson, and every activity we undertake helps them increase in faith and personal righteousness, strengthen their families and their homes, and serve the Lord and His children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/fulfilling-the-purpose-of-relief-society.p40\" class=\"\">The only way we can accomplish this is by seeking, receiving, and acting on personal revelation. The real power in this great worldwide sisterhood lies within each woman. Though we may see ourselves as weak and simple, we all share a noble heritage and can develop a faith that is equal to that of remarkable, faithful women who have gone before us. We have a vital role to play in helping build the kingdom of God and preparing for the Lord\u2019s coming. In fact, the Lord cannot accomplish His work without the help of His daughters. Because of that, the Lord expects us to increase our offering. He expects us to fulfill the purpose of Relief Society as never before. I am grateful to testify of the truthfulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and of a living prophet today who leads His work. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-02211_000_036\"><a name=\"-02211_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-02211_000_036\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"117552\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117552)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117552)\">D&amp;C 1:17, 21\u201323<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-02211_000_036\"><a name=\"-02211_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-02211_000_036\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"117704\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117704)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117704)\">D&amp;C 133:37<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-02211_000_036\"><a name=\"-02211_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-02211_000_036\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"117292\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117292)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117292)\">Luke 10:38\u201342<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-02211_000_036\"><a name=\"-02211_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-02211_000_036\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Boyd\u00a0K.
