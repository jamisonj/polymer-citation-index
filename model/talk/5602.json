This covenant includes a willingness to have children and to teach them the gospel. Many problems of the world today are brought about when parents do not accept the responsibilities of this covenant. It is contradictory to this covenant to prevent the birth of children if the parents are in good health.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/the-temple-is-a-family-affair.p21\" class=\"\">Thirty-five years ago when I first started practicing medicine, it was a rare thing for a married woman to seek advice about how she could keep from having babies. When I finished practicing medicine, it was a rare thing, except for some faithful Latter-day Saint women, for a married woman to want to have more than one or two children, and some did not want <span class=\"emphasis\">any<\/span> children. We in the Church must not be caught up in the false doctrines of the world that would cause us to break sacred temple covenants.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/the-temple-is-a-family-affair.p22\" class=\"\">We go to the temple to make covenants, but we go home to keep the covenants that we have made.

Little things like a father helping his children say their nightly prayers and telling them a bedtime story instead of watching TV. Little things like making time in the family schedule for reading the scriptures. Little things like a husband being big enough to say, \u201cSweetheart, I\u2019m sorry. I should not have said that. I\u2019m going to do better.\u201d Or a mother saying to a child, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I became angry.

If I were asked that same question, I would say, \u201cI would go home and sit in a big rocking chair and take a couple of grandbabies in my arms and hope that a little of the heavenly dust they still have on them would rub off on me.\u201d I\u2019m grateful for homes where we can go to learn how to love, how to share, how to be Christlike.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/the-temple-is-a-family-affair.p26\" class=\"\">I am grateful for temples where we can go to be sealed together as families for eternity. I am grateful for temples, where we can go to pray and to worship, where we can call down the blessings of heaven upon our families. I am grateful for temples where we can go as families to strengthen the eternal bonds that will make us forever families, where we can go to do the great redemptive work for our forefathers who cannot do it for themselves \u2026 even as Jesus did for us what we cannot do for ourselves. I am grateful that God in his eternal wisdom has made these blessings available to all his children. Some, however, have to wait until the hereafter to enjoy these blessings. But all who live worthily will have every blessing. I testify that Jesus loved to go to the temple. Part of becoming more Christlike is to learn to love to go to the temple.
