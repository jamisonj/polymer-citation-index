As the bishop, I was his quorum president. Robert stuttered and stammered, void of control. Self-conscious, shy, fearful of himself and all others, this impediment was devastating to him. Never did he fulfill an assignment; never would he look another in the eye; always he would gaze downward. Then one day, through a set of unusual circumstances, he accepted an assignment to perform the priestly responsibility to baptize another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/the-call-to-serve.p19\" class=\"\">I sat next to Robert in the baptistry of the Salt Lake Tabernacle.

Amen.\u201d Not once did he stutter! Not once did he falter! A modern miracle had been witnessed.

I was given the liberty to choose my subject. I\u2019ve always liked birds, so I thought of the Seagull Monument. In preparation, I went to Temple Square and looked at the monument. First I was attracted to all the coins in the water surrounding the monument. I wondered how they would be retrieved and who would retrieve them. I shall not confess any thought of taking them. Then I looked upward at the seagulls atop that monument. I tried in my boyish mind to imagine what it would be like to be a pioneer watching the first year\u2019s growth of precious grain being devoured by crickets and then seeing those seagulls, with their lofty wings, descending upon the fields and eating the crickets. I loved the account. I sat down with a pencil in hand and wrote out a two-and-one-half-minute talk. I\u2019ve never forgotten the seagulls. I\u2019ve never forgotten the crickets. I\u2019ve never forgotten my knees knocking together as I gave that talk. I\u2019ve never forgotten the experience of letting some of my innermost feelings be expressed verbally at the pulpit.

All of the men were most eager for this change of pace. As we prepared to board the buses to town, the petty officer commanded, \u201cNow all of you men who know how to swim, you stand over here.

Then he directed, \u201cJump in and swim the length of the pool.\u201d In that group, all of whom could supposedly swim, were about 10 who had thought they could fool somebody. They did not really know how to swim. In the water they went, voluntarily or otherwise. Catastrophe was at the door. The petty officers let them go under once or twice before they extended the bamboo pole to pull them to safety.
