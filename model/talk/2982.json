I have thought through that parable of the talents many times and have read it perhaps a little differently than you have.

He made a very interesting point in an earlier service, a very interesting observation, and I would like to quote it. He said, \u201cPrevention is far better than redemption.\u201d Did you get the difference? <span class=\"emphasis\">Prevention<\/span> is far <span class=\"emphasis\">better<\/span> than <span class=\"emphasis\">redemption.<\/span> Would you young adults, young married couples, young people everywhere, please take note?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/we-have-been-there-all-the-time.p7\" class=\"\">While my daughters were growing up, during the many trips we took in our car, the most often-asked question was, \u201cWhen will we get there, Dad?\u201d And \u201cHow long will it take?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but think that those questions are much like some that we adults ask. We think we will be happy when we arrive at a certain destination, our schooling is finished, we get a better job, we arrive at a certain income, the baby is born, our bills are paid, we recover from our illness, we own a new car, some disagreeable task is finished, we retire, or we are free from all responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/we-have-been-there-all-the-time.p8\" class=\"\">My father used to teach us that life is a journey, not a camp, and he indicated that too many people are camping. I\u2019d like to challenge all of us, particularly the young people and young couples that are married, to see life as a whole and to enjoy the marvelous journey.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/we-have-been-there-all-the-time.p9\" class=\"\">I remember a grandmother who had been widowed early in her life and was moving out of her home. Her granddaughter, about to be married herself, was carefully helping her pack the boxes of dishes and the faded towels. \u201cSee that sewing machine over there in the corner?\u201d the grandmother asked. \u201cYour grandfather always left his hat there when he came home in the evening. I used to scold him all the time about it. \u2018Just put your hat on the hook,\u2019 I\u2019d say. \u2018Why does your hat always have to be on the sewing machine messing everything up?\u2019 Then one day he got pneumonia and died, leaving four little children and me to miss him for a lifetime. How many times through the years I\u2019ve thought, What I\u2019d give to see that hat on the sewing machine, placed there by his own hand!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/we-have-been-there-all-the-time.p10\" class=\"\">Like the grandmother in this story, we too often let trifles cloud our vision. We get caught up in nonessentials or in a multitude of meetings, both in and out of the Church, that have no particular meaning or purpose. We sometimes nag the people we love the best over little inattentions, small faults, mere nothings in the whole scheme of things. Instead of treasuring the all-too-rare moments we share with our dear ones, we pick at faults, imagined or otherwise. How many of us say to our wives, our husbands, our children: \u201cWhy can\u2019t you do this?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do that?\u201d Or \u201cSomeday when I have the time \u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/we-have-been-there-all-the-time.p11\" class=\"\">Our last daughter left for college this past month, and the eighteen years of daily living with her were suddenly over. Where had they gone? What minute, what hour, what day or night had swallowed up all those joyous, giggling, growing-up years? The first night she was away, I slipped into her bedroom, looked at her record player, and thought of all those times I had mechanically said, \u201cWould you turn down the music!\u201d And I thought, too, how often in the days ahead we\u2019d be longing to hear the music. Thank God she and her parents have many wonderful memories to savor in the years ahead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/we-have-been-there-all-the-time.p12\" class=\"\">Our daughter Janet lies in a hospital bed at this very moment, and she and we know what great moments we have to share.

How do we let ourselves get caught up in faultfinding, digging, or scolding at those who are nearest our hearts? Is it ever worth it? As C. S. Lewis once advised, \u201cTake care. It is so easy to break eggs without making omelettes.\u201d (Cited in Richard L.

It recalls to mind an experience\u2014perhaps you know it\u2014of a little inquisitive boy who came to church with his father, and as they walked into the foyer, the boy noticed the usual trophy case over which were placed several large plaques. Curiosity got to the little boy. He pulled on his dad\u2019s coattail and said, \u201cDad, what\u2019s that one?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/we-have-been-there-all-the-time.p15\" class=\"\">The father moved a little closer and read the inscription, patted his boy on the head, and said, \u201cSon, that\u2019s a plaque honoring those who died in the service.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/we-have-been-there-all-the-time.p16\" class=\"\">To which the little boy said, \u201cMorning or evening?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/we-have-been-there-all-the-time.p17\" class=\"\">I appreciate that the Lord has instructed us that there are important meetings, but then there are other <span class=\"emphasis\">meetings<\/span> which are not well planned or properly structured.

I felt as though I could have been a great hero returning from space\u2014and what caused this excitement? I was going back to my family. Does it have to take flights away from home, a child leaving for college, or the death of a husband who will never again leave his hat in an awkward place to remind us how sweet are the moments with our loved ones and friends? How brief they are in the run of time? Does it take these things to stop us in our picking at trifling faults to realize the beauty of every minute together?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/we-have-been-there-all-the-time.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen will we be there?\u201d \u201cHow long will it take?\u201d \u201cHow much longer, Dad, will it take?\u201d are questions often asked by impatient children. \u201cWhen will I arrive?\u201d\u2014a question asked by adults as they face the pressures of life.
