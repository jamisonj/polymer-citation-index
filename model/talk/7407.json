One writer said of Brigham Young: \u201cHe led a ragged and impoverished band, stripped of virtually all their earthly goods, into an unknown territory. His critics and biographers note that the man was unique among the leaders of modern history, for he alone, without any political and financial backing, established from scratch in the desert an ordered and industrious society, having no other authority than the priesthood and the spiritual strength with which he delivered his teachings. By constant exhortations and instructions, he drew his people together and inspired them in carrying out the divine mandate to build up the kingdom of God on earth.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-00605_000_013\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Hugh W.
