Critchlow, Jr., <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1966, pp. 28-32<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI have several storiettes to tell. A storiette is a brief story or tale. Mine are not tales. They are\ntrue stories greatly condensed and I employ them to make a point that I hope you will\ndiscover before I disclose it later on.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Finding of Dead Sea Scrolls<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nStoriette #1: Less than a score of years ago, a 15-year-old Bedouin lad, tending a flock of\ngoats in the desert on the western coast of the Dead Sea, threw a stone at a straying goat. The\nstone missed its target and fell into a cleft in a rocky cliff. He heard something break.\nClimbing up to investigate, he found a cave filled with clay jars, one of which lay shattered\nby his stone. In the shattered jar were seven relatively intact Hebrew scrolls. These old\ndocuments provide scientific and historical information covering a period of approximately\n250 years, dating from about 150 B.C. to about 100 A.D., a period about which very little is\nknown. These scrolls, along with fragments of other scrolls since discovered may, when fully\ntranslated, be worth their weight many, many times in gold. Scholars have predicted that their\nmessage will shake the faith of Christians all over the world.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Reveal faith and ancient rites<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nStoriette #2: These scrolls tell about a community of Hebrew people who lived near the\nshores of the Dead Sea, and who, prior to the birth of the Savior, believed, practiced, and\ntaught doctrines and ordinances that also were a fundamental part of the teachings Christ\ntaught a hundred or so years later. They had set up a religious organization similar to the one\ncreated years later by Jesus and his disciples. Presiding over it were 12 laymen and three\npriests. Functioning in it were bishops, priests, teachers, and deacons.\n<\/p><p>\n\"They practiced baptism by immersion.\n<\/p><p>\n\"They conducted their communal meal in a form similar to the Christian Sacrament.\n<\/p><p>\n\"They taught brotherly love.\n<\/p><p>\n\"They believed in the coming of a prophet or Messiah.\n<\/p><p>\n\"They accepted the possibility of direct revelation.\n<\/p><p>\n\"They had joined in a new covenant.\n<\/p><p>\n\"They believed they belonged to a chosen people and practiced a form of communal living\nmuch as did the first Christians during the lifetime and soon after the crucifixion and\nresurrection of the Savior.\" (O. Preston Robinson, <i>How Old Is Christ's Gospel?<\/i> [Deseret Book\nCompany, 1963], p. 8.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Essenes<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe historian Josephus called these people the Essenes. Another name for them is the Dead\nSea covenantors. They were Hebrew people of the Qumran period who, as you have just\nheard, practiced Christian principles and Christian ordinances years before Jesus came to\nearth. Shocking? Well, to Christian people who generally believe that Jesus initiated and\nintroduced these principles and ordinances at his coming, years later, I suppose it is.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is possible, thinks Dr. Yigael Yadin, a Hebrew scholar, that these people became converts\nwhen Christ appeared. \"Who,\" he asks, \"among all Hebrew people, were better prospects for\nconversion than they, whose teachings and ordinances were so similar to the Christ's?\" Later,\nin the days of the Apostle Paul, when the people were slipping back to some of their original\npre-Christ practices, Dr. Yadin suggests that it was to them that the Apostle Paul addressed\nhis epistle to the Hebrews.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A scroll tells of Abraham<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nStoriette #3: One of the Dead Sea scrolls, still only partially translated, contains a bit of\nhistory purportedly written by Abraham. Unlike the Book of Genesis story, Abraham tells in\nthe first person how he was called by the Lord to go into Egypt and how in a dream he was\ninstructed to tell the Egyptians that Sarah, his wife, was his sister (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7244\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7244)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7244)\">Abr. 2:22-25<\/a><\/span>).\nAbraham also tells how, by\nthe laying on of hands&mdash;a gospel ordinance&mdash;Pharaoh was healed of an affliction that had\ncome upon him when he had taken Sarah away from Abraham. Pharaoh asked for this\nblessing, obviously knowing that his own priests were without priesthood power. He\nundoubtedly knew, too, that an earlier pharaoh had sought the priesthood (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7243\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7243)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7243)\">Abr. 1:26-27<\/a><\/span>),\nand he certainly knew why it was denied him. But more about Abraham later in another storiette.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Lebolo-Chandler scrolls about Abraham<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMy next storiette involves a Frenchman by the name of Antonio Sebolo. About 135 years\nago, while excavating in ancient catacombs in Egypt, he uncovered 11 well-preserved\nmummies which, because of their meticulous and expensive embalming, were thought to be\npersons of royalty. On his way to France with these mummies, he died. His will left them to a\nnephew, Michael H. Chandler, who received them at the port of New York. Bound to the\nchest of one of the mummies was something enclosed in tidy linen wrappings. If Mr.\nChandler expected to find therein gold, silver, diamonds, or other precious stones, he must\nhave been sadly disappointed when he removed the wrappings and found instead two\nwell-preserved papyrus scrolls. He never suspected them to be very valuable; otherwise he\nwould not have sold them, along with four of the mummies, to friends of Joseph Smith, the\nAmerican prophet, for a rather modest but undisclosed sum of money. Before selling them to\nJoseph Smith's friends, he exhibited them throughout the Northeastern States, where\nthousands of people viewed them.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Ancient writings translated as Pearl of Great Price<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith subsequently translated the Egyptian characters on one of these\nscrolls and found them to be a fascinating first person, historical account of Father Abraham's\nactivities, including his visit to Egypt.\n<\/p><p>\nUnlike the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls, which was heralded in newspaper headlines and\nin radio broadcasts throughout the world, this discovery by Joseph Smith received practically\nno publicity. It deserved news headlines. Its message, like the message of the Dead Sea\nscrolls, could also shake the faith of Christians throughout the world. A basic, hardcore\nChristian concept may crumble under the impact of its message if it ever receives the same\nconsideration and acceptance now being accorded the Dead Sea scrolls. But more about that\nconcept when I finish my story about the Egyptian scroll.\n<\/p><p>\nAn account in the Egyptian scroll discovered by Sebolo parallels incidents in Abraham's life,\nas related in the recently discovered Dead Sea scrolls. It thus confirms the Dead Sea scroll\nstory. Conversely, the Dead Sea scroll story confirms the Egyptian scroll story.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Egyptian scroll reveals to the world the eternalness of the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nIt reveals to the world a knowledge of our eternal existence.\n<\/p><p>\nIt tells about the grand council of the gods in heaven before the earth was peopled.\n<\/p><p>\nIt tells about the presentation of the gospel plan to his spirit children before they came to\nearth.\n<\/p><p>\nIt tells about the selection of Jesus to be the administrator of the gospel plan on earth, the\npurveyor of the gospel throughout the world, from Adam on down.\n<\/p><p>\nIt discloses Jesus to be the Savior of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nIt tells how one (Lucifer) rejected the gospel plan in that council of the gods.\n<\/p><p>\nIt discloses the gospel to have had its origin before the foundations of the earth were laid, and\nit thus confirms again the Dead Sea scroll story or expose, i.e., principles of Christ's gospel,\nhis teachings, and some of the ordinances were on the earth before Christ came in the flesh.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have been told that \"in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be\nestablished\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3057\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3057)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3057)\">2 Cor. 13:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTwo witnesses to the fact that the gospel is eternal are: (1) the Egyptian scroll (Pearl of Great\nPrice) and (2) the Dead Sea scrolls.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Related scripture and other writings<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe have additional witnesses which scholars, delving the scrolls, ought to examine: \n<\/p><p>\nThe story on the golden plates (Book of Mormon) is a third and most impressive witness.\n<\/p><p>\nThe writings of Moses contained in the Pearl of Great Price is a fourth and very special\nwitness.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Doctrine and Covenants adds a wealth of persuasive evidence that the gospel is eternal,\nthat Jesus is the Son of God.\n<\/p><p>\nFurthermore, every Bible student knows that prophets foretold the Savior's coming and\ntestified that he was the Son of God and that his gospel was for everyone. The \"Jewish\nTalmud makes it plain that baptism,\" a gospel ordinance, \"was required for admission to the\nChurch.\" (Dr. Alfred Edersheim, <i>The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah<\/i>, Vol. 2, p. 745.)\nOther ancient writings, such as the books of the Apocrypha, excluded from the Bible, provide\nevidence that a messiah would come to bring his gospel, even the same gospel that had been\ntaught to Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and others.\n<\/p><p>\nWhy, then&mdash;in the face of all this historical evidence to the fact that much of what we now\nknow as Christianity was taught and practiced by prophets, religious teachers, and religious\ngroups prior to the advent of Jesus on the earth&mdash;is it that this knowledge was not, and\npresently is not, widespread among the lay members of Christian churches?\n<\/p><p>\nDr. R. H. Charles, an eminent scholar and writer on ancient Hebrew history, believes that\nsome of the books rejected as scripture \"fell under the ban of such authorities as Hilary,\nJerome and Augustine,\" who, he thinks, were concerned about their contents. \"These three\nmen . . . exerted a tremendous influence on what was accepted or rejected as scripture, [and]\nwere probably disturbed about the Christian doctrine that some of these books taught long\nbefore the time of the Savior. Having no knowledge of the eternal nature of the gospel and\nChrist's authorship of it before this world was organized . . . [they] could have feared that\nthe Christian nature of these books would disturb the faith of lay church members\" and they\ntherefore suppressed them. (Robinson, <i>How Old Is Christ's Gospel?<\/i>, p. 36.) The Christian\nconcept today is exactly what it was in their day, namely, the gospel was initiated and first\nintroduced to the world by Jesus at his coming nearly 2,000 years ago.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Parables<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI began this address by promising storiettes that I said would develop a point. Jesus employed\nstoriettes to develop a point, usually a moral. His storiettes are called parables. A parable is a\nfictitious story. My storiettes are true, and the point I promised to make is, I hope, by now\nobvious. Simply, it is this: Jesus came in the flesh not to initiate and introduce his gospel but\nto restore it. The gospel of Jesus Christ is eternal.\n<\/p><p>\nProvoking this talk were the radio remarks of a Protestant minister who said that there were\ntwo basic, hardcore concepts common to and characteristic of all Christian creeds or churches.\nOne, he said, is a \"belief in a God to whom no physical characteristics can be ascribed\"; the\nother, a belief that Jesus came to earth to introduce and \"establish his gospel\" and that the\nChristian churches are agencies to promote it.\n<\/p><p>\nI wish I had time now to discuss his God concept.  I've already said enough about the other\nconcept&mdash;introducing and establishing the gospel&mdash;to make my point.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Effects of Dead Sea Scrolls<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe impact of the message of the Dead Sea scrolls upon the Christian churches could be, as I\nsaid before, faith-shaking. To support that statement, I submit to you comments by eminent\nscholars.\n<\/p><p>\nOne said: \"Christianity, we must now see, instead of being a faith once for all delivered to the\nSaints in the Judea of the First Century, is a development of one branch of Judaism into a\nreligion which presently, when mingled with other religions in the gentile world, developed\nby natural evolution into the religious system . . . that we know today . . . Christianity, Judaism,\nBuddhism, Islam, Taoism&mdash;all high religions, no matter what their claims&mdash;have grown in\nnatural ways.\" (A. Powell Davies, <i>The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls<\/i>, pp. 120, 131.)\n<\/p><p>\nAnother eminent scholar has written: \"Surely with the evidence at hand, any fair-minded\nChristian should admit that Jesus was not a miraculous incarnation of a Son of God,\npreexistent in the heavens and sent to earth as the long awaited Messiah . . . The [Dead Sea]\nscrolls . . . [restore] the man Jesus to the world as a great teacher who learned from Hebrew\nprophets, from the Essene teachers, from the great thinkers of the Greek Alexandrian cultures\nof his time.  He thought it all over and created his own message from the best of all he had\nstudied, and finally dramatized it as the suffering servant, Savior, Son of Man.\" (Dr. Charles\nFrancis Potter, <i>The Lost Years of Jesus Revealed<\/i>, p. 11.)\n<\/p><p>\nAnother scholar declared the scrolls to be \"medieval forgeries.\" (<i>Newsweek<\/i>, June 15, 1966, p.\n67.) Still another scholar suggests that they don't make sense. \"Actually they make very good\nsense, but it is a sense quite contrary to conventional ideas of Judaism and Christianity.\"\n(Hugh Nibley, <i>An Approach to the Book of Mormon<\/i>, [Deseret Book Company, 1964], p. 64.)\n<\/p><p>\nRepudiating the scrolls is one way of preserving that dominant hard-core Christian concept\nthat my radio friend said was common to, and characteristic of, all Christian churches. But\ntruth crushed to earth shall rise again.\n<\/p><p>\nOur own O. Preston Robinson sums up the reaction of these scholars as follows: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Faced with the overwhelming evidence of the Gospel's antiquity and bereft of a knowledge\nof Christ's original authorship of it, these scholars flounder in uncertainty and can only\nconclude that Christ was a great teacher, an imitator, but not in reality the Son of God. If\nJesus was nothing more than a clever teacher utilizing the ideas and principles promulgated by\nothers before him, he would necessarily have been one of the world's most deceptive frauds.\"\n(<i>How Old Is Christ's Gospel?<\/i> p. 5.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Evaluate the whole, not part only<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMy personal reaction is this: If these floundering scroll scholars, if these confused Christian\nleaders would take time out to examine the other witnesses that I have cited, particularly the\nBook of Mormon, the Pearl of Great Price, and the Doctrine and Covenants, they could help a\nfrustrated church membership restore Jesus Christ to the status of a Son of God, the very\nSavior of all mankind. He did come in the flesh, nearly 2,000 years ago, to restore his gospel\nwhich, after his death and the death of his apostles, was lost to the world. But, thanks to a\nmerciful God, it has been restored again in this latter day through the great American Prophet\nJoseph Smith. To this I bear my humble witness, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
