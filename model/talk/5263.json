It deeply reaches into my heart and mind. When two young sister missionaries taught us the true gospel of Jesus Christ, they referred to the Book of Mormon. They taught us at home, along with my four children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-worldwide-sisterhood\/bless-the-individual-woman.p5\" class=\"\">For the first time, I understood that through the gospel, my son who had died years before could be with me\u2014also that my other children would have the opportunity to love God and Jesus Christ. I have been blessed since the moment I made the most important and correct decision in my life, which was to accept the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-worldwide-sisterhood\/bless-the-individual-woman.p6\" class=\"\">After a year and a half, my husband accepted the gospel, leaving aside all those traditions.

I\u2019m the mother of children who have served missions, and I\u2019m the grandmother of seven grandchildren. As if that weren\u2019t enough, my husband is a sealer in the temple and a patriarch in our stake. My children hold callings, and I work in the Relief Society, where I feel love towards my sisters. I\u2019m grateful to my Heavenly Father for having his gospel and for knowing he lives, that Christ is my king and redeemer, and that he lives in my heart. I deeply love him. I know that Joseph Smith restored the gospel. This gives us the opportunity to know and feel that our prophet, Ezra Taft Benson, is a man guided by God. We have a rare possession, which is the Book of Mormon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-worldwide-sisterhood\/bless-the-individual-woman.p8\" class=\"\">I testify all this to be true, in the name of Christ Jesus, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
