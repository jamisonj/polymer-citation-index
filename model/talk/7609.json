Our aim should be to help them understand the truth, not defend our egos or score points in a theological debate. Our heartfelt testimonies are the most powerful answer we can give our accusers. And such testimonies can only be borne in love and meekness. We should be like Edward Partridge, of whom the Lord said, \u201cHis heart is pure before me, for he is like unto Nathanael of old, in whom there is no guile\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117597\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117597)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117597)\">D&amp;C 41:11<\/a><\/span>).

In such instances, we are better off to keep our distance and simply walk away. As we do, some may try to provoke us and engage us in argument. In the Book of Mormon, we read about Lehonti and his men camped upon a mount. The traitorous Amalickiah urged Lehonti to \u201ccome down\u201d and meet him in the valley. But when Lehonti left the high ground, he was poisoned \u201cby degrees\u201d until he died, and his army fell into Amalickiah\u2019s hands (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"117490\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117490)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117490)\">Alma 47<\/a><\/span>). By arguments and accusations, some people bait us to leave the high ground. The high ground is where the light is. It\u2019s where we see the first light of morning and the last light in the evening. It is the safe ground. It is true and where knowledge is. Sometimes others want us to come down off the high ground and join them in a theological scrum in the mud. These few contentious individuals are set on picking religious fights, online or in person. We are always better staying on the higher ground of mutual respect and love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/christian-courage-the-price-of-discipleship.p24\" class=\"\">In doing so, we follow the example of the prophet Nehemiah, who built a wall around Jerusalem. Nehemiah\u2019s enemies entreated him to meet them on the plain, where \u201cthey thought to do [him] mischief.\u201d Unlike Lehonti, however, Nehemiah wisely refused their offer with this message: \u201cI am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117231\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117231)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117231)\">Nehemiah 6:2\u20133<\/a><\/span>).
