We are grateful to the First Presidency for that assignment. Much has been written regarding the success of the choir and of its favorable influence that will yet continue. Members and friends of the Church worldwide join with me in expressing appreciation to the officers, staff, directors, accompanists, and to all vocalists for their wonderful service.

While musical experts of the world focus on what choir members can do, I would like to focus on what choir members can be. This I do because I witnessed in choir members great examples that can inspire and improve the lives of each of you who honestly strives to emulate the Lord who said, \u201cI am the light; I have set an example for you.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6230\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6230)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6230)\">3 Ne. 18:16<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"29515\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29515)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29515)\">John 13:15<\/a><\/span>.)

I pay tribute to the First Presidency and to leaders of the choir who had the foresight to plan as they did and when they did. How bold and inspired they were to conceive this tour many months\u2014even years\u2014before Europe\u2019s unwelcoming walls began to crumble! The Brethren had the faith to believe that the choir could sing in cities such as Warsaw, Budapest, Prague, Leningrad, and Moscow long before such dreams seemed plausible. Then in January 1991, hopeful plans were seriously threatened when war erupted in the Persian Gulf. Even then, our leaders decided against canceling the tour. They knew of its potential for good and had faith that countless obstacles could be overcome. Often they prayed that the choir\u2019s tour might be successfully accomplished.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/these-were-our-examples.p13\" class=\"\">Those prayers were answered!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/these-were-our-examples.p14\" class=\"\">Think of the timing. In one thousand years of Russia\u2019s existence, its first popular national election ever to be held occurred in June 1991. Six days later, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir performed in Moscow! That very night, after the strains of \u201cCome, Come, Ye Saints\u201d (see <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 30) had resounded from the Bolshoi Theater, the vice president of the republic announced that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had been granted recognition in the Republic of Russia. On the eve of a supreme crisis that was yet ahead, Russian people heard songs of faith, courage, hope, and love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/these-were-our-examples.p15\" class=\"\">That faith of our Church leaders filled the hearts of members, families, and friends of the choir as well. Real were the risks of separation of husbands and wives, of parents and children. Hundreds of dependents were temporarily deprived of moms or dads for almost a month. Thanks be to all who cared for those families\u2014in faith. If each of us could muster that same faith in the service we are called to render, we would also be blessed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Virtue<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/these-were-our-examples.p17\" class=\"\">Virtue radiated from the choir. Each member seemed to exemplify President Brigham Young\u2019s counsel: \u201cLearn the will of God, keep His commandments and do His will, and you will be a virtuous person.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> sel. John A.

After one concert, I was greeted by an individual who expressed gratitude in an unusual way. He said, \u201cI am thankful for the choir\u2019s message.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/these-were-our-examples.p19\" class=\"\">I asked, \u201cWhat message did you receive?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/these-were-our-examples.p20\" class=\"\">His answer: \u201cThe choir was trying to teach me a better way to live.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/these-were-our-examples.p21\" class=\"\">That comment seemed profound to me. What inspired him to feel such a force for good? Was it complicated classical music or the excellence of its rendition? I doubt it. I believe it was more likely communication by the Spirit, which allowed both the giver and receiver to be edified.

And very possibly, the spirit of the listener was moved most by melodies soft and simple, sung with sweet sincerity. When the choir sang \u201cThe Lord\u2019s Prayer,\u201d for example, audiences were hushed and attentive. They seemed to understand, without fully knowing either the language or the history of the song.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/these-were-our-examples.p22\" class=\"\">The virtue of choir members brought blessings to their own lives. When the tour was completed and each was safely home, I thought of this promise from the Lord: \u201cIf thou art faithful and walk in the paths of virtue before me, I will preserve thy life.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19408\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19408)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19408)\">D&amp;C 25:2<\/a><\/span>.)

Just five days after the choir had left America, I was asked to inform her that her beautiful 37-year-old daughter had died after a long illness. The leaders of this sorrowing mother offered means for her to return home from Europe. She declined the offer. She and her family had already anticipated this possibility. Their decision had been made. It was not to be interpreted as a pattern for anyone else to follow, but for her alone. Her children and grandchildren had pleaded that she remain on assignment. So she continued in all diligence, never missing a single concert! She nobly fulfilled this scriptural counsel: \u201cTherefore be diligent \u2026 in whatsoever difficult circumstances [you] may be.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19380\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19380)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19380)\">D&amp;C 6:18<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/these-were-our-examples.p50\" class=\"\">Her example can bless each of you, just as it did her family and me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Godliness<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/these-were-our-examples.p52\" class=\"\">Godliness is an attribute that seems as difficult to define as it is to attain.

From their hearts the choir sang one number which bore testimony of love so amazing, so divine.
