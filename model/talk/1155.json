This is the twentieth time that I have appeared in the Tabernacle in\nthis position, and I assure you it does not get any easier. It has been a decade of joy and\npleasure in visiting throughout the Church in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central\nAmerica, and the Islands of the South Pacific&mdash;Tahiti, Tonga, Samoa, Cook Islands, Australia,\nand New Zealand.\n<\/p><p>\nI am so grateful for the rich privileges and blessings which have been mine in association\nwith members of the Church who are striving to effect in their lives the teachings of the\ngospel of Jesus Christ, members coming, I presume, from all the churches that are organized\nin the world. Some not having claim to any church have been willing to listen to the\nmissionaries and in so doing catch the spirit of the great message which they have.\n<\/p><p>\nI think of the words of Brigham Young, the leader of modern-day Israel. What a leader he\nwas in taking the reins after the Prophet Joseph's martyrdom! He made this declaration:\n\"Truth is my text, the Gospel of salvation my subject, and the world my circuit.\"\n(<i>Journal of Discourses<\/i>, 9:137)\n<\/p><p>\nThis Church embodies all truth. Faithful members in this Church know that all truth emanates\nfrom God our Eternal Father. He is the fountain source of truth. There is no half-truth or\nuntruth in this Church. I remember hearing President George Albert Smith, another\nmouthpiece and prophet of the Lord, declare on several occasions, as he was making an\nappeal to others who might not yet have accepted the full truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ\nthat they not give up the truths that they had espoused but further investigate and study and\nsearch for themselves, and they would find that which we proclaim is all truth, and that they\nwould receive a witness of this.\n<\/p><p>\nThat is the appeal that I have felt has emanated from the sessions of this conference thus far.\nI know in every fiber of my being that this Church embodies all truth. My, how the world\nneeds this truth today in order to put down error, in order to do away with the things which\nBrother Stapley has called to our attention.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is truth to believe that God lives. It is truth to believe that Jesus is his Divine Son, the\nSavior of the world. It is truth to believe that they, both of them, appeared to the boy, Joseph\nSmith, in the Sacred Grove. It is truth to believe that after he was proved and tested and tried\nhe had the responsibility of re-establishing the Church of Jesus Christ again in the earth. It is\ntruth to believe that all the powers of the Holy Ghost and the priesthood have been restored.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, I testify that truth is our text in very deed. And I also testify that we have the gospel of\nsalvation, and not only salvation but also exaltation for all our Heavenly Father's children\nwho will accept these truths and live in obedience to them. It is marvelous to see the gospel\nwork in the lives of individuals. About six weeks ago today, I had the\nopportunity of being on the Island of Tahiti, where I witnessed there a few days before, the\nconstruction of a little <i>Fali<\/i> or chapel with a thatched roof, where the members had been\nwilling to go out and cut down the coconut trees for the posts of that chapel and then tie the\npalms together for the roof, and then braiding the palms to make the sides so that if it\nstormed they would have protection from the wind and the rain. Otherwise, the sides would\nbe open.\n<\/p><p>\nThere was a sand floor. Benches had been made at a cost of probably ten or fifteen dollars,\nthe total cost of the little chapel about twenty to twenty-five dollars. As is the case all over\nthe Church, those people were willing to put in their time and their effort, and in ten days the\nchapel was constructed. I had the privilege of dedicating that little building, with 134 people\nassembled&mdash;more than it could hold. Some were on the outside. The Spirit of the Lord was\nthere. They were people willing to learn about salvation and exaltation. They were hungry for\ntruth.\n<\/p><p>\nJust a week ago tonight it was my opportunity and privilege to dedicate the Pesega chapel in\nUpolu, Western Samoa. The prime minister of Western Samoa was in attendance and spoke at\nthe services, commending our people because he saw lives that had been changed into\nsomething worthwhile as they put away the material things of life, put away the pitfalls and\nthe snares of the adversary, and were willing to cling to truth, having a vision which this\nChurch offers to all the world of their possibilities and the development of their potential.\n<\/p><p>\nAbout five weeks ago in New Zealand, in Christchurch, we went into a lovely building that is\nbeing constructed, entirely different from the one I have referred to at Faaoue in Tahiti. That\nis a glorious spot. Here was a young woman&mdash;many working&mdash;but one young woman all\nwrapped up, it seemed, with two or three sweaters because Christchurch can be very cold in\nwinter and early spring, and there is nothing colder than a new building under construction\nwithout any heat, as you workmen know. Upon being introduced to her I learned that she had\ncome all the way from Auckland at her own expense. She had a week's holiday, and she was\nwilling to serve that time in painting inside the Church because she also has a witness of the\ntruth of the gospel of salvation and exaltation. Many all over the world are gaining this\nwitness that this is truth and that it offers something here in mortality to live by and also that\nglorious hope and promise of the Master that we shall have the privilege of dwelling with him\nand his father&mdash;his literal Father and the Father of our spirits eternally.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, this is a gospel of salvation&mdash;salvation from the clutches of Satan, salvation from the\npowers of men, salvation which gives us strength to live by here, and a goal to work toward.\n<\/p><p>\nBrigham Young stated that the world was our circuit. I have not had the privilege of going\naround the world, but half of it at least, and as I say, I have met with hundreds of\nmissionaries who are willing to leave their homes and their loved ones, their families, their\npersonal pursuits, to go out and serve. I am so grateful for this privilege to mingle with the\nyouth, to feel of their spirit, and to give them encouragement of what their possibilities are if\nthey will continue to follow truth.\n<\/p><p>\nI bring many greetings to all friends and loved ones from missionaries I have visited within\nthe last six weeks in New Zealand, in Tahiti, and in Samoa.\n<\/p><p>\nThese missionaries are willing to teach the world that this is the gospel of truth, the gospel of\nsalvation and exaltation, for the world is our circuit, just as Brigham Young said, and it\napplies more than ever today.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world . . . and then shall the end\ncome\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35136\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35136)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35136)\">Matt. 24:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis gospel of the kingdom is truly going forth to all mankind. Some nations today do not\nallow our missionaries to come in, but that is not the fault of the prophet of the Lord,\nPresident David O. McKay, who has the vision and the inspiration to guide and\ndirect this great missionary labor. All who heard President McKay this\nmorning in his stirring appeal for all to accept and follow truth must be impressed with the\nsincerity of his message. However, in many nations the gospel is being preached.\n<\/p><p>\nSo I pray that each one of us may be missionaries in very deed, living and teaching by that\npower of example and then following the exhortations that have been given to us in these\nsessions to read and study the scriptures and be so advised that we will be able to teach others\nby the spirit that they may feel it, receiving the same witness, or a like witness that we have.\nI bear you my testimony that these things are true and pray for his blessings upon us in the\nname of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
