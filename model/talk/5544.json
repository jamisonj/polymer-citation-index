We had not been to Yellowstone National Park for many years. We decided to drive to the conference and on Monday return home by way of Yellowstone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p8\" class=\"\">In 1988, terrible forest fires raged there. Each day the news media brought us graphic reports of the intensity of the fires as they raced over thousands of acres, destroying millions of trees. The flames finally burned out, and people literally mourned over the desolate picture of countless lodgepole pines, their tops burned and the straight, scorched trunks standing like solemn grave markers in a crowded cemetery.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p9\" class=\"\">But when we visited there about a month ago, we saw something of captivating interest. The dead pines still stood, but between the burned trees new seedlings have sprung from the ground, millions of them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p10\" class=\"\">Evidently when fire hit the treetops, the pinecones exploded, scattering seed to the ground. There is a new generation of trees now, young and beautiful and filled with promise. The old trees eventually will fall and the new ones will grow tall to create a forest of great beauty and usefulness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p11\" class=\"\">As we drove through the park, I thought of the wonders of nature, of the rhythm of our lives. We grow old, and I am among those who have done so. Our vitality and our powers slacken. But a new generation is at our feet. These are children. These too are sons and daughters of God whose time has come to take their place on earth. They are like the new growth in the park\u2014young, tender, sensitive, beautiful, and full of promise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p12\" class=\"\">As Tagore, the poet of India, once observed, \u201cEvery child comes with the message that God is not yet discouraged of man\u201d (Charles L. Wallis, ed., <span class=\"emphasis\">The Treasure Chest,<\/span> New York: Harper and Row, 1965, p. 49). Children are the promise of the future. They are the future itself. The tragedy is that so many are born to lives of sorrow, of hunger, of fear and trouble and want. Children become the victims, in so many, many cases, of man\u2019s inhumanity to man. In recent months we have seen them on our television screens\u2014the children of Somalia, their bodies bloated, their eyes staring with the stare of death. More recently we have seen them in Rwanda, the victims of raging cholera and vicious and unrelenting hunger. Uncounted numbers have died.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p13\" class=\"\">These were the promise of a new and better generation in these lands, where disease, malnutrition, bullets, and neglect have mowed them down like tender plants before the sharp blade of the sickle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p14\" class=\"\">Why are men so vicious as to bring about the causes that lead to such terrible fratricidal conflict? Great, I believe, will be their tribulation in the Day of Judgment when they must stand before the Almighty accused of the suffering and destruction of these little ones. I am grateful for kind and generous people of many faiths and persuasions across the world whose hearts reach out in sympathy, many of whom give freely of their substance, their time, even their presence to help those in such terrible distress. I am grateful that we as a church have done much of significance, as President Monson pointed out last night, in sending medicines, food and clothing, and blankets for warmth and shelter to those who suffer so terribly, and particularly to children who otherwise most certainly would die.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p15\" class=\"\">Why should they suffer so much in so many places? Surely God, our Eternal Father, must weep when he sees the abuse that is heaped upon his little ones, for I am satisfied they hold a special place in his grand design. That place was confirmed when his Son, the Savior of the world, walked the dusty roads of Palestine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cBut Jesus \u2026 said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cVerily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32507\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32507)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32507)\">Luke 18:15\u201317<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p19\" class=\"\">How great is our responsibility, how serious the responsibility of Christian people and men and women of goodwill everywhere to reach out to ease the plight of suffering children, to lift them from the rut of despair in which they walk.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p20\" class=\"\">Of course such suffering is not new. Plagues of disease have in centuries past swept across continents. War has caused the deaths of millions who were totally innocent. Children have been bartered and traded; they have been used as tools by vicious masters; they have mined coal for long hours day after day in the dark and cold depths of the earth; they have worked in sweatshops and been exploited like cheap merchandise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p21\" class=\"\">Surely after all of the history we have read, after all of the suffering of which we have been told, after all of the exploitation of which we are aware, we can do more than we are now doing to lift the blight that condemns millions of children to lives that know little of happiness, that are tragically brief, and that are filled with pain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p22\" class=\"\">And we need not travel halfway across the earth to find weeping children. Countless numbers of them cry out in fear and loneliness from the evil consequences of moral transgression, neglect, and abuse. I speak plainly, perhaps indelicately. But I know of no other way to make clear a matter about which I feel so strongly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p23\" class=\"\">One major problem is the now-common phenomenon of children bearing children, of children without fathers. Somehow there seems to be in the minds of many young men, and some not so young, the idea that there is no relationship between the begetting of a child and responsibility for its life thereafter. Every young man should realize that whenever a child is begotten outside the bonds of marriage, it has resulted from violation of a God-given commandment reaching at least as far back as Moses. Further, let it be known clearly and understood without question that responsibility inevitably follows, and that this responsibility will continue throughout life. Though the mores of our contemporary society may have crumbled to a point where sexual transgression is glossed over or is regarded as acceptable, there will someday be accountability before the God of heaven for all that we do in violation of his commandments. I believe further that a sense of accountability must at some time bear upon every man who has fathered a child and then abandoned responsibility for its care. He must sometimes stop and wonder whatever became of the child he fathered, of the boy or girl who is flesh of his flesh and soul of his soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p24\" class=\"\">The burdens that fall upon a young woman who alone must rear her child are unbelievably heavy and consuming. They are likewise heavy upon society through taxes levied to meet the needs of such children and their mothers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p25\" class=\"\">In the United States \u201cin the six years between 1985 and 1990, estimated public outlays related to teenage child-bearing totalled more than $120 billion. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cOf unmarried teens who give birth, 73 percent will be on welfare within four years [that is almost three out of every four].<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cIn 1991 federal and state expenditures for aid to families with dependent children \u2026 totalled $20 billion plus administrative costs of $2.6 billion\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Starting Points: Meeting the Needs of Our Youngest Children,<\/span> New York: Carnegie Corporation, April 1994, p. 21).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p28\" class=\"\">The obstacles facing children born and reared in such circumstances are formidable, to say the least.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p29\" class=\"\">The answer is straightforward.

Wise and experienced professional counselors and prayerful bishops can assist in these circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p35\" class=\"\">Then there is the terrible, inexcusable, and evil phenomenon of physical and sexual abuse.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p36\" class=\"\">It is unnecessary.

I am satisfied that such punishment in most instances does more damage than good. Children don\u2019t need beating. They need love and encouragement. They need fathers to whom they can look with respect rather than fear. Above all, they need example.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/save-the-children.p39\" class=\"\">I recently read a biography of George H.
