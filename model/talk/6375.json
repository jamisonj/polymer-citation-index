In a general conference of the Church in April 1844, the brethren recalled those first gatherings of 1830. One of them said: \u201cWe [talked] about the kingdom of God as if we had the world at our command; we talked with great confidence, and talked big things, although we were not many [in number]; \u2026 we looked [and] if we did not see <span class=\"emphasis\">this<\/span> [congregation], we saw by vision, the church of God, a thousand times larger [than it was then], although [at the time] we were not enough to well man a farm, or meet a woman with a milk pail. \u2026 All the members [of the Church] met in conference, in a room 20 feet square. \u2026 We talked about \u2026 people coming as doves to the windows, that all nations should flock unto [the Church]. \u2026 If we had told the people what our eyes behold this day, we should not [have been] believed.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-20905_000_031\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Times and Seasons,<\/span> 1 May 1844, 522\u201323; see also <span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 6:288\u201389.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/as-doves-to-our-windows.p7\" class=\"\">If this was their feeling in that fateful year of 1844, just prior to Joseph Smith\u2019s martyrdom, what must those same brethren and sisters see from their eternal home on a day like this! So much has happened since then for which they and we need to be grateful. And, of course, this is not the end. We have much work yet to do, in both the quality and quantity of our faithfulness and our service. George A. Smith, counselor in the First Presidency to President Brigham Young, once said by way of caution, \u201cWe may build temples, erect stately domes, magnificent spires [and] grand towers, in honor of our religion, but if we fail to live the principles of that religion \u2026 , and to acknowledge God in all our thoughts, we shall fall short of the blessings which its practical exercise would ensure.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-20905_000_031\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News Weekly,<\/span> 17 July 1872, 348.]<\/span><\/sup> We must be humble and conscientious.

So many of them seem almost nameless to us now. Most went unheralded to their graves\u2014often early graves. Some few have made it into a line or two of Church history, but most have come and gone with neither high office nor history\u2019s regard. These folks, our collective ancestors, slipped into eternity as quietly and anonymously as they lived their religion. These are the silent Saints of whom President J. Reuben Clark once spoke when he thanked them all, \u201cespecially,\u201d he said, \u201cthe meekest and lowliest of them, [largely] unknown [and] unremembered, [except] round the hearthstones of their children and their children\u2019s children who pass down from generation to generation the story of their faith.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-20905_000_031\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[In Conference Report, Oct. 1947, 155; or \u201cTo Them of the Last Wagon,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> July 1997, 35\u201336.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/as-doves-to-our-windows.p9\" class=\"\">Whether longtime member or newest of converts, we are all the beneficiaries of such faithful forebears.

As a young man of Primary and Aaronic Priesthood age, I attended church in the grand old St. George Tabernacle, construction for which had begun in 1863. During very lengthy sermons I would amuse myself by gazing about the building, admiring the marvelous pioneer craftsmanship that had built that striking facility. Did you know, by the way, that there are 184 clusters of grapes carved into the ceiling cornice of that building? (Some of those sermons were really long!) But most of all I enjoyed counting the window panes\u20142,244 of them\u2014because I grew up on the story of Peter Neilson, one of those little-noted and now-forgotten Saints of whom we have been speaking.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/as-doves-to-our-windows.p16\" class=\"\">In the course of constructing that tabernacle, the local brethren ordered the glass for the windows from New York and had it shipped around the cape to California. But a bill of $800 was due and payable before the panes could be picked up and delivered to St. George. Brother David H. Cannon, later to preside over the St. George Temple being built at the same time, was charged with the responsibility of raising the needed funds. After painstaking effort, the entire community, giving virtually everything they had to these two monumental building projects, had been able to come up with only $200 cash. On sheer faith Brother Cannon committed a team of freighters to prepare to leave for California to get the glass. He continued to pray that the enormous balance of $600 would somehow be forthcoming before their departure.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/as-doves-to-our-windows.p17\" class=\"\">Living in nearby Washington, Utah, was Peter Neilson, a Danish immigrant who had been saving for years to add on to his modest two-room adobe home. On the eve of the freighters\u2019 departure for California, Peter spent a sleepless night in that tiny little house. He thought of his conversion in far-off Denmark and his subsequent gathering with the Saints in America. After coming west he had settled and struggled to make a living in Sanpete. And then, just as some prosperity seemed imminent there, he answered the call to uproot and go to the Cotton Mission, bolstering the pathetic and sagging efforts of the alkali-soiled, malaria-plagued, flood-bedeviled settlers of Dixie. As he lay in bed that night contemplating his years in the Church, he weighed the sacrifices asked of him against the wonderful blessings he had received. Somewhere in those private hours he made a decision.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/as-doves-to-our-windows.p18\" class=\"\">Some say it was a dream, others say an impression, still others simply a call to duty. However the direction came, Peter Neilson arose before dawn on the morning the teams were to leave for California. With only a candle and the light of the gospel to aid him, Peter brought out of a secret hiding place $600 in gold coins\u2014half eagles, eagles, and double eagles. His wife, Karen, aroused by the predawn bustling, asked why he was up so early. He said only that he had to walk quickly the seven miles to St. George.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/as-doves-to-our-windows.p19\" class=\"\">As the first light of morning fell on the beautiful red cliffs of southern Utah, a knock came at David H.

John R. Moyle lived in Alpine, Utah, about 22 miles as the crow flies to the Salt Lake Temple, where he was the chief superintendent of masonry during its construction. To make certain he was always at work by 8 o\u2019clock, Brother Moyle would start walking about 2 <span class=\"small\">A.M.<\/span> on Monday mornings. He would finish his work week at 5 <span class=\"small\">P.M.<\/span> on Friday and then start the walk home, arriving there shortly before midnight. Each week he would repeat that schedule for the entire time he served on the construction of the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/as-doves-to-our-windows.p22\" class=\"\">Once when he was home on the weekend, one of his cows bolted during milking and kicked Brother Moyle in the leg, shattering the bone just below the knee. With no better medical help than they had in such rural circumstances, his family and friends took a door off the hinges and strapped him onto that makeshift operating table. They then took the bucksaw they had been using to cut branches from a nearby tree and amputated his leg just a few inches below the knee. When against all medical likelihood the leg finally started to heal, Brother Moyle took a piece of wood and carved an artificial leg. First he walked in the house. Then he walked around the yard. Finally he ventured out about his property. When he felt he could stand the pain, he strapped on his leg, walked the 22 miles to the Salt Lake Temple, climbed the scaffolding, and with a chisel in his hand hammered out the declaration \u201cHoliness to the Lord.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-20905_000_031\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"emphasis\">Biographies and Reminiscences,<\/span> from the <span class=\"emphasis\">James Henry Moyle Collection, The Archives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,<\/span> ed.
