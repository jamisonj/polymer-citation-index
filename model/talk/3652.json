Yet 50 years later some former students recall with lasting appreciation the words one teacher had her class repeat at the beginning of each day. Every school morning this rather unpretentious, plain, wise lady implanted the meaning of honesty into our minds by having us recite \u201cA lie is <span class=\"emphasis\">any<\/span> communication given to another with the intent to deceive.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/this-is-no-harm.p4\" class=\"\">When I compare this definition with that found in the dictionary, which states, \u201cA lie is an untrue statement made with the intent of deceiving,\u201d I greatly appreciate her definition. A lie can be effectively communicated without words ever being spoken. Sometimes a nod of the head or silence can deceive. Recommending a questionable business investment, making a false entry in a ledger, devious use of flattery, or failure to divulge all pertinent facts are a few other ways to communicate the lie.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/this-is-no-harm.p5\" class=\"\">After having us go through this daily ritual, this wonderful lady, who never married but who had such a motherly influence over many of us, would teach with few words the importance of communicating truth under all circumstances.

We have a clue when we read all through the scriptures that Satan is the father of lies. His method of teaching this evil practice is illustrated in the tenth section of the Doctrine and Covenants: \u201cYea, he [Satan] saith unto them: Deceive and lie \u2026 ; behold, this is no harm. And thus he \u2026 telleth them that it is no sin to lie. \u2026 And thus he \u2026 causeth them to catch themselves in their own snare.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17730\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17730)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17730)\">D&amp;C 10:25\u201326<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/this-is-no-harm.p7\" class=\"\">Yet we can\u2019t hide behind the father of lies and say, \u201cSatan made me do it.\u201d All he does is tell us, \u201cThis is no harm,\u201d and then he lets us catch ourselves in our own snare.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/this-is-no-harm.p8\" class=\"\">It is a sin to lie. It is a tragedy to be the victim of lies. Being trapped in the snares of dishonesty and misrepresentation does not happen instantaneously. One little lie or dishonest act leads to another until the perpetrator is caught in the web of deceit. As Samuel Johnson wrote, \u201cThe chains of habit are generally too small to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The International Dictionary of Thoughts,<\/span> comp. John P. Bradley, Leo F. Daniels, Thomas C. Jones, Chicago: J. G. Ferguson Publishing Co., 1969, p. 348.) Those who become victims of this entrapment often struggle through life bearing their heavy burden because they are unwilling to acknowledge their problem and make the effort to change. Many are unwilling to pay the price to be free from the chains of lies. Some individuals may be very aware of the value of honesty and yet be unable to come up with the down payment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/this-is-no-harm.p9\" class=\"\">Perhaps if we analyze some of the reasons people lie, we can avoid or overcome this vicious snare.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/this-is-no-harm.p10\" class=\"\">Sometimes we deceive and lie to avoid personal embarrassment. I recently heard of a young woman who had been released from her employment because of dishonesty.

She probably told her friends and family members the same story to avoid mortification.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/this-is-no-harm.p11\" class=\"\">Financial setbacks may be explained to others with untruths. Or have you ever heard someone say, \u201cI was just too busy to get the job done,\u201d when, in truth, he had forgotten?

All worthwhile investment opportunities can bear deliberation and scrutiny. We must get all the available facts and consider them well, and then make decisions that are in the best interest of all. When marginal cases and situations arise, personal integrity must be an important element in any decision. When right actions are not clearly evident, personal honesty will lead us to discern and reveal relevant points or facts of which others may not be aware. A person of integrity will assist others to be honest. A person of integrity will ask questions and give answers that are accurate. Integrity makes it possible for us to chart a course of righteous personal conduct long before the time for action arrives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/this-is-no-harm.p21\" class=\"\">A wise person will not allow himself to be victimized by the unscrupulous because of false pride.
