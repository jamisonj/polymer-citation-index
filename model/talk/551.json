Penrose, written on the\noccasion of a great threatening danger to the communities of the Latter-day Saints during their\nearly establishment in the valleys of these mountains. The foe was an army, with a mission\ninimical to the liberties, the interests, and the aspirations of the people. This clarion call,\nwhich but echoed the proclamations of the leaders, electrified the people. \"To a man\" they\nresponded to their various assignments. There is no record of any dissension. The defenders\nsaved Zion.\n<\/p><p>\nCHALLENGING CALL\n<\/p><p>\nI believe, my brethren and sisters, in the Restored Church of our Lord, that it is within the\nproprieties and the urgent needs of the hour to issue another such challenging call today. I\nwould not welcome the charge of \"alarmist,\" but I would endure it if I thought such a militant\ncall would arouse our people to a state of alarm over the ominous conditions which threaten\nus.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The foe at the door of our homes\" is not an army of marching men with military equipment,\nas it was nearly a hundred years ago. And the homes to be defended are not the houses in\nwhich we dwell.\n<\/p><p>\nThe foe today is far less tangible and discernible. He is widely diffused and insidious. His\nmethods are multiple, and it is much more difficult to prepare for defense, for the foe of the\npresent-day attacks both within and without the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nIf in the time allotted to me in this great conference, I can add anything, however small, to\nthe admonitions of my brethren, which may serve to alert our people to dangers confronting\nthem, I shall be extremely grateful to my Father in heaven.\n<\/p><p>\nZION AND THE WORLD\n<\/p><p>\nI repeat, the foe of today assumes many forms. I think, however, they may be generally\nclassified under the caption, \"Aping the Ways of the World.\" I know of few more salutary\nthings for a Latter-day Saint than constantly to bear in mind the distinction between Zion and\nthe world. Both terms are somewhat confusing because they are used with varying meanings\nand applications. Both have geographical application, and both have theological and moral\nimport.\n<\/p><p>\nFor my purpose here today, I shall look upon Zion as being a condition and not a place, and\nthe world likewise.\n<\/p><p>\n\" . . . verily, thus saith the Lord, let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion&mdash;the\npure in heart\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12926\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12926)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12926)\">D&amp;C 97:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is no fence around Zion or the world, but to one of discernment, they are separated\nmore completely than if each were surrounded with high unscalable walls. Their underlying\nconcepts, philosophies, and purposes are at complete variance one with the other. The\nphilosophy of the world is self-sufficient, egotistical, materialistic, and skeptical. The\nphilosophy of Zion is humility, not servility, but a willing recognition of the sovereignty of\nGod and dependence on his providence.\n<\/p><p>\nA PRINCIPLE OF STRENGTH\n<\/p><p>\nThe critics of Zion mistake humility for weakness. In their ignorance or shortsightedness they\nhave failed to observe that generally speaking, the humble of the earth have been its greatest\nbenefactors, in science, in statesmanship, and in great movements for the elevation of\nhumanity, foremost among all being the Author of humility, our Lord and Savior. It is\nsometimes difficult to comprehend how humility can be a principle of strength and power,\nand why the great victories of life have gone to the humble.\n<\/p><p>\nI think the explanation is this: The self-sufficient are not in a position to call to their aid the\none greatest and most effective force in the world&mdash;the Spirit of God. The humble depend\nupon this power; it does not fail them. The battles for righteousness and liberty which is a\ndivine endowment can always be won if those who wage the war are worthy of victory. This\nis the explanation and the lesson which, more than any other, the world needs today.\n<\/p><p>\nI feel hesitant to say it, but I am constrained to make the assertion, even though it may seem\nhighly presumptuous to many who hear it, that the Restored Church of our Lord, the Church\nof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is in better position, is more specifically charged with the\nresponsibility, and has greater revealed knowledge than any other institution to teach to the\nworld this one vital lesson it so sorely needs.\n<\/p><p>\nIn making this statement I intend no disparagement of the righteous and pure in heart of the\nworld. I have not time to try to define their relationship to the Zion of the kingdom. They\nwill receive the Lord's compensation for their own goodness, and lasting gratitude for their\ncontribution to the welfare of mankind.\n<\/p><p>\nWe can effectively bring this lesson to the world only as we build up Zion and protect her\nfrom her foes. I propose to enumerate, with your indulgence, and I hope not offensively,\nsome of the attacks which the subtle and insidious foe, coming from the world and its\nphilosophy and practices, is making against Zion.\n<\/p><p>\nATTACKS UPON THE HOME\n<\/p><p>\nI shall begin with the home, the most fundamental institution in our society. The foe is\nattacking our divinely-given concept that marriage is an eternal compact between a priest and\na priestess of the Most High, charged with the sacred mission of bringing children into the\nworld, and then guiding them safely back into the presence of God, whence their spirits came.\nPresident Clark gave us a most illuminating and impressive discourse on that subject\nyesterday. The fulfillment of this mission involves sacrifice. The ever-growing practice of the\nworld would eliminate that sacrifice.\n<\/p><p>\nIt would emancipate women (I think that is what they call it). It wouldn't have them stay\nhome as much as they have in the past. It would have them better educated in general culture\nand in civic responsibilities, which sounds very good and seems highly desirable, except for\none serious flaw in the program.\n<\/p><p>\nThis worldly practice in many instances takes a woman out of her home so much of the time,\nand absorbs her attention to such an extent, that she cannot and does not give to her family\nthe loving, patient, intelligent care which they so much deserve and need. There are mothers\nwhose club work has ostensibly been devoted to social improvement, whose very offspring\nhave been the problems of the society they seek to serve.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are other more frivolous distractions drawing mothers away from their homes. These\nare justified by the allegation that mothers need more relaxation and more freedom from the\nresponsibilities of home. We grant that such allegations must be true with women who have\nnever discovered the art of happy, contented living in their homes and with their families. In\nZion we say to mothers, it's true, you need some diversion. Even though you love your home\nlife, a respite from your work and cares is desirable.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church presents many opportunities for your service in social, educational, charitable,\nmissionary, and recreational fields. You will find more lasting happiness and satisfaction in a\nRelief Society meeting than in a bridge club; and generally speaking, your social diversions\nhad better be had in company with your husband. The world is making butterflies out of\nwomen and a prison out of home.\n<\/p><p>\nCURTAILMENT OF FAMILIES\n<\/p><p>\nPerhaps the most serious aspect of this attack of the foe being made on our homes is in the\narbitrary curtailment of the size of families. The proponents of this worldly doctrine grow\nbolder and bolder every year. They claim support from mathematical prognostications as to\nthe increasing demands of populations, and the limited supply of the earth's sustenance. They\nclaim improvement of the race by its limitation. They have been making these claims for\nmany years, and they have won many adherents to their cause, especially among the so-called\nintelligentsia of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nFor the most part the world has been under the leadership of this birth-restricting intelligentsia\nfor many years. And where are we? We have more physical comfort, more education perhaps.\nDo we have better government? Are we making more progress in developing the Christian\nvirtues among men? Do we have more brotherhood, peace, and unselfishness?\n<\/p><p>\nI doubt if there exists in all the world any place or institution comparable to a big family for\nthe inculcation of the principle of unselfishness and mutual consideration, the high qualities of\ncharacter so indispensable in the solution of the world's problems. I know there are bad big\nfamilies and bad small families; but take it by and large, I would assume that there is a\nthousand percent better chance of a great leader in a good cause coming from a family of ten\nthan from a family of one.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, if I am not careful, I will be debating this issue. I don't want to do this, first, because I\nam sure I am not fortified with all the arguments, and I might get bested, depending on who\nthe judges are; and second, because we of Zion do not have to debate this issue. We know of\nthe doctrine that emanates from the revelations of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nWe know that he has commanded the replenishment of the earth from the homes of his\npeople, as President Clark said yesterday. The Lord pity those who subject themselves to his\nrebuke for denying entrance to the spirit children whom he would send into mortality, and the\nLord pity those sophisticated couples who would pervert the sacred institution of marriage\ninto an arrangement for social convenience and selfish personal gratification.\n<\/p><p>\nSYMPATHY FOR PARENTS\n<\/p><p>\nNow, fathers and mothers of the Church, some will conclude after hearing these comments\nthat I am without sympathy for the sacrifice mothers make, and for the hardships put upon\nfathers in rearing a family in these oppressive economic times. Those who so conclude are\npartly right and partly wrong. I don't have too much sympathy for a father, a Latter-day Saint\nfather, who decides that a baby cannot come into the home until a ten or fifteen thousand\ndollar house has been built and furnished, and the money is in the bank to pay expenses, and\nwho will let his wife go to work to bring about this so-called economic security. I don't have\ntoo much sympathy for Latter-day Saint couples who do not have faith that if they do God's\nwill, he will bless them.\n<\/p><p>\nI do have sympathy, however, for all parents in these days in the Herculean effort required to\nkeep children in the paths of virtue and truth. I have sympathy for the endurance, the sleepless\nnights of excruciating anxiety of parents who don't know where their children are and what\nthey are doing; and my heart bleeds for the innocent ones who are the victims of disgrace\nbrought upon their families by the sins of the wayward,\n<\/p><p>\nI am persuaded, my brethren and sisters, that there is no remedial measure which offers more\npromise in the alleviation of domestic distress as affecting husband and wife, and parents and\nchildren than the firm establishment of the sacred and religious character of family life,\nmarriage in the Church and in the temple; and, as a necessary adjunct thereto, the\nreestablishment of the God-given principle of sacrifice in discharging parental and filial\nobligations.\n<\/p><p>\nWe want to relieve mother of drudgery. If I could, I would put a dishwasher in every home,\nbut good mothers and good fathers, with the vision of home vouchsafed to them in the\nrestored gospel, don't want to be relieved of the obligation to expend their strength and\nenergies, and to give their lives for God's children entrusted to their care.\n<\/p><p>\nATTACK ON MORAL PURITY\n<\/p><p>\nThere is another threat to Zion perhaps transcending all others in serious import. It is the\nattack of the foe on our traditional concept and standard of personal moral purity. This attack\nis so evil and so repugnant to our sense of decency and virtue that I will not discuss it in this\nreverential presence.\n<\/p><p>\nI must content myself with the prayer that God, who sees our need, will come to our rescue,\nand that he will arouse the mighty power of Zion against this devastating enemy, that every\nman, woman, and child among us may be fortified with the armor of righteousness and virtue,\nthat the offenders may be rebuked, and repent in sackcloth and ashes; and that the watchmen\non the towers, the officers and the priesthood of the Church, may be alerted to the enemy,\ndischarge their solemn duties, and protect us.\n<\/p><p>\nI have taken so much time in the endeavor to point out what we have to fear in the\nencroachment of worldly concepts and practices on home life and virtue that there is little\ntime remaining for me to mention other aspects of great dangers confronting us. I trust,\nhowever, that the serious nature of these items will warrant a brief consideration of them.\n<\/p><p>\nCRITICISM OF UNITY\n<\/p><p>\nThe foe is attacking our unity. We in Zion have enjoyed a most uncommon reputation for\nunity of purpose and achievement. This has come about because it has ever been our\ndisposition to follow and yield obedience to our leaders. Our critics, who have not understood\nour concepts, who have observed our unanimous voting in sustaining officers, and other\nevidences of our concerted action, have called it blind obedience, induced by some sort of\nfear or other compulsion.\n<\/p><p>\nI haven't time to analyze and point out the false premise of this criticism, but I flatly deny its\nvalidity. The obedience we render is voluntary and not blind, but intelligent; and the unity we\nmanifest arises out of a common understanding of our purposes and a common devotion to\ntheir achievement. We seek for and enjoy the influence of the Holy Spirit, which, in the\nlarger aspects of life, motivates us all alike. Our unanimity is in response to that Spirit.\n<\/p><p>\nThat condition is not generally prevalent in the world. Division, divided views, and debate\nthereon are commended. Perhaps when people don't know where they are going and have no\ndefined objectives, criticism and debate are commendable. Men and women within and\nwithout the Church fail to observe this distinction. They want to debate our objectives. They\nhave forgotten that they are divinely set for us and beyond debate. They seem to think our\nunity belittles us. This is a worldly doctrine. It has no place in Zion.\n<\/p><p>\nA threat to our unity derives from unseemly personal antagonisms developed in partisan\npolitical controversy. The Church, while reserving the right to advocate principles of good\ngovernment underlying equity, justice, and liberty, the political integrity of officials, and the\nactive participation of its members, and the fulfillment of their obligations in civic affairs,\nexercises no constraint on the freedom of individuals to make their own choices and\naffiliations. I am authorized by President McKay to say that any man who makes\nrepresentation to the contrary does so without authority and justification in fact.\n<\/p><p>\nFAIRNESS IN POLITICAL VIEWS\n<\/p><p>\nIt is reasonable to assume that men may entertain honest differences of opinions with\nreference to governmental policy. In America, and in many other countries, an orderly system\nhas been devised for the determination of issues arising out of such differences. With such\nmethods available, why should any men, particularly those in the brotherhood of Zion, permit\nthemselves to entertain personal animosities against their opponents. There is surely nothing\nChristian in impugning motives merely because of a difference of opinion.\n<\/p><p>\nI hope with all my heart that men of the priesthood, of the same quorum perhaps, and women\nof the sisterhood of the Church will not permit themselves to be estranged in any degree by\nthese considerations, and that they will always subordinate such differences and their own\npersonal ambitions to the achievement of the lofty and exalted goal to which they have\npledged their eternal allegiance&mdash;the building of the kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been going about this Church for nearly thirty-five years, filling assignments to install\nofficers in stakes and wards and missions, and I have never yet asked a single person about\nhis politics, and in very few instances have I ever had any knowledge on the subject. I think\nmy own experience has been comparable to that of my brethren. We have been fair with you,\nmy fellow members of the Church. Now we ask you to be fair with each other.\n<\/p><p>\nTHREAT OF INDIFFERENCE\n<\/p><p>\nPerhaps the greatest threat to both our unity and our progress in Zion is that of indifference\nand neglect. These deficiencies are not new. They have existed in some degree throughout our\nhistory. I am forced to believe that they have increased as a deterrent force in recent years. I\nbelieve also that this regrettable indifference to duty and opportunity is in large measure\nascribable to \"aping the ways of the world.\"\n<\/p><p>\nA man of the priesthood, we will say, is associated in business, in club life, and in other\ncapacities, with a man of the world. This man may be his neighbor. He sees his neighbor on a\nSunday morning out on the porch smoking his pipe and reading the newspaper, or he sees\nhim go off to a golf game, or on a fishing trip. It all looks relaxing and pleasant to him, and\nthen he forgets who he is and where he is. He forgets that he has been commissioned as a\nservant of God, and he forgets that he is in Zion; and forgetting, he steps out of Zion into the\nworld, not all in one step, sometimes so gradually that the change is almost imperceptible to\nhim, and he is loath to acknowledge his new status. He persuades himself that this\ncomfortable, easy life is very enjoyable.\n<\/p><p>\nThen he goes farther&mdash;farther than he intended. He succumbs to many practices he once\nabhorred. He stops paying tithing, and the twinges of conscience he once had about forsaking\nduty gradually subside. He is comfortably out of Zion. After awhile he comes to the\nrealization that his growing sons are disposed to ape his own practices, as he does those of the\nworld.\n<\/p><p>\nHe also begins to realize that his dear, devoted wife is suffering great disappointment. She\nsets great store by the promises made at their marriage and realizes that the eternal blessings\nare obtainable only through the faithfulness of herself and her man. She sees him losing his\npriesthood through neglect. It saddens her, and if his conscience is not too deadened, he\nperceives her sorrow. He has the power to change, to gladden the hearts of his wife and\nchildren, but he lacks courage and resolution.\n<\/p><p>\nThe worldly habits have fastened themselves with a hundred tentacles into his very soul. He\ncannot throw them off, He despairs; and then one day something touches him&mdash;a death, a\ntragedy, a friend, his bishop perhaps, or quorum president, or a missionary. Finally the light\nthat he had lost is re-kindled in him. The Spirit again comes to dwell within him. In penitence\nand humility he cries out, \"O God, forgive me for my neglect.\" Thank the Lord there is\nforgiveness and mercy for those who repent, and surpassing joy in the reclamation of those\nwho have strayed. Let no man among us be ashamed of his priesthood. Nothing greater will\never come into his life.\n<\/p><p>\nDISPARAGEMENT OF ORTHODOXY\n<\/p><p>\nOne more item and I shall conclude. There is a worldly threat to our theological teaching and\nto the faith of youth. Sporadically it has always been so, but in recent years it is more\npronounced. This is not a frontal attack by the foe. We have never had too much difficulty in\nmeeting open charges or criticisms. The foe is striking from ambush, with snipers and fifth\ncolumnists, with traps for the unwary.\n<\/p><p>\nA part of the propaganda is that there is no warrant for official interpretation of the doctrines\nand standards of the Church, that everyone may read and interpret for himself, and adopt only\nso much of the doctrine as he chooses, and that he may classify the revelations as essential or\nnon-essential. These propagandists are either ignorant of or ignore the Lord's declaration that\n\"no prophecy  of the scripture is of any private interpretation\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4819\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4819)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4819)\">2 Pet. 1:20<\/a><\/span>). They disparage\northodoxy as such and pride themselves on liberal thinking. Many of them maintain their\nloyalty to the Church, and some may honestly believe they are doing the Church a favor and\na service in advocating their so-called broad-minded concepts.\n<\/p><p>\nUnfortunately, some people within the Church subscribing to these views do not realize that\nthey are falling into a trap themselves. They are giving aid and comfort to the foe; they are\nundermining their own testimonies and those of others, I warn the Church against them, and I\nwarn them against themselves; and I plead with them to desist, to abandon their agnostic\ndiscussions, and to join with the faithful in promoting the cause which in their hearts they\nonce loved, and I think they still love.\n<\/p><p>\nATTACKS ON JOSEPH SMITH\n<\/p><p>\nNot a few of these snipers delight to take a shot at Joseph Smith. In some surprising way it\nhas become somewhat popular, stimulated, I presume, by books which have been written for\nstudents and scholars, to undertake exhaustive research into the life of this great man. In some\ninstances, perhaps, the purpose of the research projects may be laudable, to exploit the great\nand noble things in the life and works of the Prophet, but in all too many instances I fear the\npurpose of the research is merely exploratory, with the hope of discovering something that\nwould make for sensational reading and perhaps a profit for the writer. I have never been able\nto discover any very substantial reason for these researches other than that I have just\nmentioned.\n<\/p><p>\nHere is a life recently lived. Many of us here in this assembly today have known and talked\nwith persons who knew the Prophet, and yet you would think from the way the researchers go\nafter him that he was a person of great antiquity, and that something in the nature of\nexcavation for prehistoric materials had to be undertaken to discover the facts of his life. I\ndoubt if there is a person who has lived in the last two centuries whose life is more fully\ndocumented than that of this man, unless perchance it be among royalty or those in high\npublic office.\n<\/p><p>\nAlmost every important event in his life has been recorded by himself, by his mother, and by\nthose who immediately knew him. His life is not a mystery; it is an open book, at least to\nmembers of the Church who have access to the knowledge which he brought to the world.\n<\/p><p>\nI rebuke the members of the Church who cast aspersion upon the honored name of the\nProphet Joseph Smith, and who in any manner disparage his noble work. By so doing they\ndestroy faith, their own and that of others, and the Lord will hold them accountable.\n<\/p><p>\nTESTIMONY OF DIVINE MISSION\n<\/p><p>\nI repeat what I have said in this pulpit before: My grandfather was the close friend and\ncompanion of this man. He knew him as intimately as one man may know another. He had\nabundant opportunity to detect any flaws in his character and discover any deceit in his work.\nHe found none, and he has left his testimony to his family and to all the world that this man\nwas true, that he was divinely commissioned for the work he had to do, and that he gave his\nlife to the fulfillment of his mission. I have complete assurance that Willard Richards did not\nlie about his friend, and on my own account, independent of my grandfather's testimony,\nborne out of the spirit within me, I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the Living God,\nand the work he was instrumental in setting up in the earth is the veritable kingdom of our\nFather in heaven.\n<\/p><p>\nHaving that knowledge and a deep reverence for his illustrious name, I deplore and resent the\nmiserable attempts made to discredit him; and I predict that they will all come to nought, that\nhe will survive every attack, that he will yet win the esteem and respect of all good men, and\nthat the Father has already glorified him.\n<\/p><p>\nPRESERVATION OF ZION\n<\/p><p>\nIf I have been able in any degree to clarify our understanding about Zion and her relationship\nto the world, if the Spirit of the Lord has entered into your hearts, my brethren and sisters, to\ngive you a greater love for Zion and awake within you a keener apprehension of the dangers\nwhich the foe has brought to our very doors, and if resolution shall now grip your hearts to\narise and defend Zion, I will be profoundly grateful. And some day the righteous of the world\nwill be grateful, for \"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour,\nwherewith shall it be salted?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34412\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34412)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34412)\">Matt. 5:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nO God, help us, thy favored children, to preserve Zion, I humbly pray in the name of the\nLord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
