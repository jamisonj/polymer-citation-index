I was never very expert in these things, but this did not diminish my interest nor the satisfaction that came from my participation. I was particularly interested in track and field events. In my school years I competed in the hurdle races as well as in the shot put and the discus throw. These last two events required that the participant launch his effort from within a ring that was marked out on the playing field. So long as the competitor remained within the ring while making his throw of the discus or the put of the shot, his effort was qualified to be measured in the competition. If he stepped outside the circle, his effort was disqualified as a foul. Generally, three preliminary attempts were permitted in each of these events, and then three more for those whose tosses were long enough to qualify them for the finals. If a competitor fouled in each of his attempts, he was out of the competition.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/looking-beyond-the-mark.p4\" class=\"\">Those of us who participated in these sports learned the importance of staying within the mark.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/looking-beyond-the-mark.p5\" class=\"\">I found myself reflecting on these early experiences recently as I read from the fourth chapter of Jacob in the Book of Mormon. In this part of his record, Jacob reminds us of the Israelites in ancient times who got themselves into great difficulty: \u201cThey despised the words of plainness, and killed the prophets, and sought for things that they could not understand. Wherefore, because of their blindness, which blindness came by <span class=\"emphasis\">looking beyond the mark,<\/span> they must needs fall\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25925\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25925)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25925)\">Jacob 4:14<\/a><\/span>; italics added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/looking-beyond-the-mark.p6\" class=\"\">Generally, a figurative expression such as the one Jacob uses in this text\u2014\u201clooking beyond the mark\u201d\u2014comes from something that is common and familiar to the experience of those with whom it is used. Each language and each culture has similar idiomatic expressions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/looking-beyond-the-mark.p7\" class=\"\">I have wondered what was actually in Jacob\u2019s mind as he wrote of \u201clooking beyond the mark\u201d in describing a failing that was common to ancient Israel. As I have already indicated, Jacob\u2019s idiom brings to my mind the experiences of my early activities in certain sports events when it was so important to stay within the mark. All of the strength and skill and effort a competitor could muster in the field events I have just described were of little value if he did not stay within the circle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/looking-beyond-the-mark.p8\" class=\"\">Jacob speaks of people who placed themselves in serious jeopardy in spiritual things because they were unwilling to accept simple, basic principles of truth. They entertained and intrigued themselves with \u201cthings that they could not understand\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125228\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125228)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125228)\">Jacob 4:14<\/a><\/span>). They were apparently afflicted with a pseudosophistication and a snobbishness that gave them a false sense of superiority over those who came among them with the Lord\u2019s words of plainness. They went beyond the mark of wisdom and prudence, and obviously failed to stay within the circle of fundamental gospel truths, which provide a basis for faith. They must have reveled in speculative and theoretical matters that obscured for them the fundamental spiritual truths. As they became infatuated by these \u201cthings that they could not understand,\u201d their comprehension of and faith in the redeeming role of a true Messiah was lost, and the purpose of life became confused. A study of Israel\u2019s history will confirm Jacob\u2019s allegations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/looking-beyond-the-mark.p9\" class=\"\">It seems to me that every generation faces its challenges with \u201clooking beyond the mark.\u201d The Apostle Paul worried about those whom he had helped to develop a testimony of Jesus Christ.
