This is a national organization with councils in cities all across the country, manned by local officers and committees. In Salt Lake City, a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jew, and a Mormon all work together as co-chairmen in the interest of promoting fellowship and brotherhood. And I have thought what a wonderful thing it would be to extend this kind of fellowship to all religions and people throughout the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p4\" class=\"\">The president of this organization, Dr. David Hyatt, has stated:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cBrotherhood\u2014the respect for the dignity and worth of another human being\u2014must become a part of our conscious activities, not just philosophical rhetoric or afterthought. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cBrotherhood is democracy at work!

And I thought of other groups working for brotherhood or sisterhood, or to promote other causes or projects, and my mind always came back to the organization of the priesthood of God, which is the greatest and most important brotherhood association in all the world. How fortunate we are to be members of it!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p8\" class=\"\">But, as I seem to be always reminding us, with that membership comes great responsibility and great opportunity. It is not enough for us to be members, and to be satisfied with the numbers we have in our respective quorums. We want to reach out and embrace all the world in our brotherhood, which is the only organization designed to bring them the greatest gift they could receive\u2014eternal life!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p9\" class=\"\">The members of the Church are in a very unique position because they know and understand that all human beings are literally the spirit children of God, and that the family unit is eternal and can enjoy eternal progression, which should be the goal of all. Because we know that God is our Father, we refer to one another as brothers and sisters, just as children in families do, and we enjoy a true feeling of brotherhood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p10\" class=\"\">Some people ask the reason for an organized church. They feel they can work out their salvation alone, and that there is no need to attend church meetings or fill other requirements as long as they are honest and honorable and do good to their fellowmen. But the Lord has given us instructions that we should belong to a church; and this, his church, has the same organization that Jesus Christ himself established while he was on the earth. We have many explicit declarations from the Lord that make this clear, and also that we need to encourage and help one another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p11\" class=\"\">He said: \u201cAnd that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16859\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16859)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16859)\">D&amp;C 59:9<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p12\" class=\"\">Another: \u201cIt is expedient that the church meet together often to partake of bread and wine in the remembrance of the Lord Jesus.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16822\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16822)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16822)\">D&amp;C 20:75<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p13\" class=\"\">Further, he said: \u201cAnd I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16910\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16910)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16910)\">D&amp;C 88:77<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p14\" class=\"\">And he admonished: \u201cWhen thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31997\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31997)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31997)\">Luke 22:32<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p15\" class=\"\">All of these instructions are to help us enjoy life here and prepare ourselves to go back into the presence of our Heavenly Father.

There was a gigantic tree which he observed standing all alone on the top of a small hill. The boy, full of awe, called out excitedly, \u2018Uncle George, look at that big tree! It will make a lot of good lumber, won\u2019t it?\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cUncle George slowly shook his head, then replied, \u2018No, son, that tree will not make a lot of good lumber. It might make <span class=\"emphasis\">a lot<\/span> of lumber but not a lot of <span class=\"emphasis\">good<\/span> lumber. When a tree grows off by itself, too many branches grow on it. Those branches produce knots when the tree is cut into lumber. The best lumber comes from trees that grow together in groves. The trees also grow taller and straighter when they grow together.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p22\" class=\"\">Then Brother Taylor made this observation: \u201cIt is so with people. We become better individuals, more useful timber when we grow together rather than alone.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Conference Report,<\/span> April 1965, pp. 54\u201355.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p23\" class=\"\">Elder Sterling W.

Men and women spend countless hours working together in welfare projects, which will be stocked against the time of need therefore by persons other than themselves. What a great feeling it is to realize that all throughout the Church we have facilities for producing and dispensing commodities which have been placed in storehouses ready to be distributed to the needy among us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p27\" class=\"\">This is true brotherhood in action\u2014to labor or support financially programs which are for persons one may never see or hear about. It is easy to do things for our own families and loved ones, but to give of our substance for the stranger who is in need is the real test of our charity and love for our fellowmen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p28\" class=\"\">Another area where we work for the benefit and blessing of some we do not know is in the field of our temple and genealogical work.

These projects strengthen personal relations between those who are working together and build testimonies of the truthfulness of a gospel which teaches that we are our brother\u2019s keepers and that \u201cinasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36558\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36558)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36558)\">Matt. 25:40<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p30\" class=\"\">Sometimes we can get our inactive brethren to assist in such projects; and when they catch the spirit of the work, they will want to continue their association with their brethren in quorum meetings.

But, not one of those indifferent elders will refuse an invitation, for example, to come to a funeral of one of the townsfolk, or one of their members, or of one of their members\u2019 wives, and if you will come as a quorum and sit together as a quorum, there is one means of fellowship. Our High Priests are doing it more than Seventies or Elders.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cI have attended a number of funerals where I have seen reserved seats for High Priests, in paying respect to a departed brother.

Such acts as these are what the Savior had in mind when he said, \u2018Inasmuch as ye do it unto the least of these my brethren, ye do it unto me.\u2019 (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"36559\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36559)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36559)\">Matt. 25:40<\/a><\/span>.)\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Conference Report,<\/span> October 1955, p. 129.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p37\" class=\"\">In order to extend this brotherhood to all the world, we send out thousands of missionaries in keeping with the Savior\u2019s injunction to \u201cgo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p38\" class=\"\">\u201cTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36566\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36566)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36566)\">Matt. 28:19\u201320<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p39\" class=\"\">It is always interesting to hear the returned missionaries, no matter where they have labored, say they served in the greatest mission in the world. This is because they have caught the spirit of missionary work and become persuaded that all men are brothers and children of God. As they teach the gospel, they learn to replace with love any prejudice they might have felt for the people among whom they labor. It is remarkable what the Spirit of the Lord can do for us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p40\" class=\"\">We pray every day that governments of countries which are now closed to our missionaries will open their gates to make it possible for us to teach them the gospel, which alone will bring full understanding of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.

We express this feeling of brotherhood through the principles we teach and the work we do. We have mentioned temple work for the dead, our welfare services, and the great missionary program. We also express our concern and interest in our fellows through the home teachers of the priesthood organizations and the visiting teachers of the Relief Society. Where these visits are made as they should be, members of the Church should feel that they are fellowshipped into a great brotherhood or sisterhood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p42\" class=\"\">I relate two experiences to demonstrate what I mean. A man in one of our organizations was transferred to New York City to direct the work of one of our radio stations. He had never been to New York before, but he located one of our chapels and attended church the first Sunday he was there. He was welcomed into the priesthood quorum as a brother, and his wife and children were similarly welcomed and were soon right at home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p43\" class=\"\">In contrast, at the same time another young man whom he knew was sent by his company to operate another station. Though he was a member of a church with many times the membership of the LDS church, he found it most difficult to feel at home and soon asked for a transfer back to his original station. It might have been his fault, or it might have been the fault of his church. However, in our Church if the individual and the quorum are functioning as they should, all Church members should feel happy, wanted, and accepted wherever they go.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p44\" class=\"\">Another experience was related to me recently by one of our priesthood holders.

He was the first man on the scene, and as he examined me he found that I was wearing temple garments. He was a Mormon. After seeing me safely in the ambulance and on the way to the next town, he alerted the bishopric; and as I arrived at the hospital the brethren were there to administer to me. The attending physician at the hospital was a stake president.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/the-greatest-brotherhood.p47\" class=\"\">\u201cFor the next week I was on the critical list, and a member of the bishopric insisted that my wife and family stay at his home, taking meals and shelter there. After three or four days my wife and family returned home to Phoenix, and the members of the ward rallied around my family to help wherever they could. One good brother offered the use of his private plane or motor home to bring me back home.
