The list of challenges these sisters face is lengthy and sobering. There are family troubles, economic tests, calamities, accidents, and illnesses. There is much distraction and not enough peace and joy. Despite popular media messages to the contrary, no one is rich enough, beautiful enough, or clever enough to avoid a mortal experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/and-upon-the-handmaids-in-those-days-will-i-pour-out-my-spirit.p6\" class=\"\">The questions sisters ask are serious and insightful. They articulate uneasiness about the future, sorrow for unrealized expectations, some indecision, and diminished feelings of self-worth. They also reflect a deep desire to do what is right.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/and-upon-the-handmaids-in-those-days-will-i-pour-out-my-spirit.p7\" class=\"\">There has grown in me an overwhelming testimony of the value of daughters of God. So much depends on them. In my visits with the sisters, I have felt that there has never been a greater need for increased faith and personal righteousness. There has never been a greater need for strong families and homes. There has never been more that could be done to help others who are in need. How does one increase faith, strengthen families, and provide relief?<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-09205_000_006\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120348\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120348)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120348)\">Jacob 2:17<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120356\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120356)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120356)\">Mosiah 4:26<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120490\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120490)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120490)\">Doctrine and Covenants 38:35<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120495\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120495)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120495)\">44:6<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> How does a woman in our day find answers to her own questions and stand strong and immovable against incredible opposition and difficulty?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Personal Revelation<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/and-upon-the-handmaids-in-those-days-will-i-pour-out-my-spirit.p9\" class=\"\">A good woman knows that she does not have enough time, energy, or opportunity to take care of all of the people or do all of the worthy things her heart yearns to do. Life is not calm for most women, and each day seems to require the accomplishment of a million things, most of which are important. A good woman must constantly resist alluring and deceptive messages from many sources telling her that she is entitled to more time away from her responsibilities and that she deserves a life of greater ease and independence. But with personal revelation, she can prioritize correctly and navigate this life confidently.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/and-upon-the-handmaids-in-those-days-will-i-pour-out-my-spirit.p10\" class=\"\">The ability to qualify for, receive, and act on personal revelation is the single most important skill that can be acquired in this life.

When women nurture as Christ nurtured, a power and peace can descend to guide when help is needed. For instance, mothers can feel help from the Spirit even when tired, noisy children are clamoring for attention, but they can be distanced from the Spirit if they lose their temper with children. Being in the right places allows us to receive guidance. It requires a conscious effort to diminish distractions, but having the Spirit of revelation makes it possible to prevail over opposition and persist in faith through difficult days and essential routine tasks. Personal revelation gives us the understanding of what to do every day to increase faith and personal righteousness, strengthen families and homes, and seek those who need our help. Because personal revelation is a constantly renewable source of strength, it is possible to feel bathed in help even during turbulent times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/and-upon-the-handmaids-in-those-days-will-i-pour-out-my-spirit.p12\" class=\"\">We are told to put our trust in that Spirit which leads us \u201cto do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-09205_000_006\">5<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120456\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120456)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120456)\">Doctrine and Covenants 11:12<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> We are also told that this Spirit will enlighten our minds, fill our souls with joy, and help us know all things we should do.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-09205_000_006\">6<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120457\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120457)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120457)\">Doctrine and Covenants 11:13\u201314<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Promised personal revelation comes when we ask for it, prepare for it, and go forward in faith, trusting that it will be poured out upon us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Relief Society\u2014Teaching, Inspiring, and Strengthening<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/and-upon-the-handmaids-in-those-days-will-i-pour-out-my-spirit.p14\" class=\"\">Additionally, the Lord in His wisdom has provided a Relief Society to help His daughters in these latter days.
