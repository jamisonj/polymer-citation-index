But when the authorities returned,\n  the spirit was made manifest,<span class=\"footRef\">2<\/span> those members that were exercised with it were tried for their\n  fellowship, and those that would not repent and forsake it were cut off.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">At a subsequent period a Shaker spirit was on the point of being introduced, and at another time\n  the Methodist and Presbyterian falling down power, but the spirit was rebuked<span class=\"footRef\">3<\/span> and put down, and\n  those who would not submit to rule and good order were disfellowshiped. We have also had brethren\n  and sisters who have had the gift of tongues falsely; they would speak in a muttering, unnatural\n  voice, and their bodies be distorted like the Irvingites before alluded to; whereas, there is nothing\n  unnatural in the Spirit of God. A circumstance of this kind took place in Upper Canada, but was\n  rebuked by the presiding Elder; another, a woman near the same place, professed to have the\n  discerning of spirits, and began to accuse another sister of things that she was not guilty of, which\n  she said she knew was so by the spirit, but was afterwards proven to be false; she placed herself in\n  the capacity of the &ldquo;accuser of the brethren,&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">4<\/span> and no person through the discerning of spirits can\n  bring a charge against another, they must be proven guilty by positive evidence, or they stand clear.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">There have also been ministering angels in the Church which were of Satan appearing as an\n  angel of light.<span class=\"footRef\">5<\/span> A sister in the state of New York had a vision, who said it was told her that if she\n  would go to a certain place in the woods, an angel would appear to her. She went at the appointed\n  time, and saw a glorious personage descending, arrayed in white,<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> with sandy colored hair; he\n  commenced and told her to fear God,<span class=\"footRef\">7<\/span> and said that her husband was called to do great things, but\n  that he must not go more than one hundred miles from home, or he would not return; whereas God\n  had called him to go to the ends of the earth,<span class=\"footRef\">8<\/span> and he has since been more than one thousand miles\n  from home, and is yet alive. Many true things were spoken by this personage, and many things that\n  were false. How, it may be asked, was this known to be a bad angel?
