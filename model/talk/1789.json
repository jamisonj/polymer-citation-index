Romney, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1970, pp. 27-30<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\nBrethren and sisters: I have taken for my theme this afternoon, \"The Keystone of Our Religion.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith wrote in his diary for November 28, 1841:\n<\/p><p>\n\"I spent the day in the council with the Twelve Apostles at the house of President Young, conversing with them upon a variety of subjects . . . I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and <i>the keystone of our religion<\/i>, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than by any other book.\" (<i>Documentary History of the Church<\/i>, vol. 4, p. 461. Italics added.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Reality of modern revelation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe authenticity of the Book of Mormon and the restoration of the gospel rest upon the same two fundamentals: first, the reality of modern revelation, and second, the fact that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. These two verities are inseparably connected in their relationship to the Book of Mormon and the restored gospel. To accept one of them is to accept the other.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Joseph Smith retired to bed on the night of September 21, 1823, he had no thought (and he had never had a thought) about the Book of Mormon. The matter that concerned him at that moment was his standing with the Lord. This, in prayer and supplication, he sought to determine. While praying, he was visited by Moroni, a personage sent from the presence of God, who told him that \"there was a book deposited [in nearby Cumorah], written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the sources from whence they sprang (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30540\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30540)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30540)\">JS&mdash;H 1:34-35<\/a><\/span>). He also said that the fullness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants; also that there were two stones in silver bows . . . deposited with the plates . . . and that God had prepared them for the purpose of translating the book.\" (<i>DHC<\/i>, vol. 1, p. 12.)\n<\/p><p>\nIn this interview, the Prophet received his first concept of the Book of Mormon. From that night until the book was published, Joseph was constantly guided from heaven in obtaining, caring for, and translating the sacred record. One of the most remarkable things concerning the Book of Mormon is the frequency and the finality with which the Lord himself testified to its truth and divinity.\n<\/p><p>\nConfirming his own participation in bringing forth the Book of Mormon, the Lord, in August 1830, said to the Prophet: \"I . . . sent [Moroni] unto you to reveal the Book of Mormon, containing the fulness of my everlasting gospel.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15521\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15521)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15521)\">D&amp;C 27:5<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Translation of Book of Mormon<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn the preface to the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord said that he called upon \"Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments\" that he might \"have power to translate through the mercy of God, by the power of God, the Book of Mormon.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15479\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15479)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15479)\">D&amp;C 1:17,29<\/a><\/span>) The Lord also told the Three Witnesses that the Prophet had \"translated the book,\" and then he added, \"as your Lord and your God liveth it is true.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15503\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15503)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15503)\">D&amp;C 17:6<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nAs the Prophet proceeded with the translation, he learned many great and marvelous truths. He learned that the concept of the Book of Mormon originated in the mind of the Lord Jesus himself&mdash;that both the source material for the record and the engravings that he was translating were prepared by righteous men directed by God.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Jaredite record<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHe learned that, under the guidance of the Lord, the gathering of source material for the book began as early as 2200 B.C., when the Lord commanded the brother of Jared \"to go down out of the mount from the presence of the Lord, and write the things which he had seen.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22280\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22280)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22280)\">Ether 4:1<\/a><\/span>) He learned that the record thus begun was continued by commandment of the Lord until the end of the Jaredite era; that the complete Jaredite record miraculously came into the hands of Moroni, who, about A.D. 400, abridged it into the short record we know as the book of Ether. He learned that the things in this short abridgment were written by Moroni upon the plates he, Joseph, was translating, because, according to Moroni's own words, \"the Lord hath commanded me to write them\"; and Moroni continues: \". . . I have written upon these plates the very things which the brother of Jared saw\" and the Lord \"commanded me that I should seal them up; and he also hath commanded that I should seal up the interpretation thereof; wherefore I have sealed up the interpreters, according to the commandment of the Lord.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22281\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22281)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22281)\">Ether 4:4-5<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Nephite records<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSimilar direction was given concerning the Nephite records:\n<\/p><p>\n\"The Lord commanded me [said Nephi], wherefore I did make plates of ore that I might engraven upon them the record of my people . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And this have I done, and commanded my people what they should do after I was gone.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1664\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1664)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1664)\">1 Ne. 19:1,4<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nThus, pursuant to divine command and direction, the comprehensive record on the large plates of Nephi, from which Mormon made his abridgment, was kept for nearly a thousand years.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus himself edited part of that record. During his post-resurrection ministry among the Nephites, he instructed them to write the things which he had taught them. He also reminded them that they had not made record of the prophecy of his servant Samuel the Lamanite, to the effect that at the time of his resurrection \"many saints\" should arise from the dead.

(Jesus commanded that it should be written; therefore it was written according as he commanded.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Purposes of Book of Mormon<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFrom the title page of the Book of Mormon, the Prophet learned that one of the two purposes of the book was \"the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43149\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43149)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43149)\">BM Title Page<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFor the accomplishment of this purpose, the book is from beginning to end a witness for Christ. Its first chapter contains an account of a vision in which Lehi beheld Jesus \"descending out of the midst of heaven\" in luster above the noonday sun.
