That which I have in mind concerns the home front also, very closely. I have had\nin my files of broadcast prospect material for the past two years or more, a text from First\nCorinthians out of which I have been trying to evolve a broadcast comment. Part of it was\npresented last Sunday, and part of it hasn't evolved as yet. The text is from Paul:\n<\/p><p>\nI speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall\nbe able to judge between his brethren?\n<\/p><p>\nBut brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. \n<\/p><p>\nNow therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another.\nWhy do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?\n<\/p><p>\nNay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"96\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 96)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(96)\">1 Cor. 6:5-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis seemed to tie in with another statement which, among others, was more recently invited\nto my attention by Dr. G. Homer Durham from the utterances of President John Taylor:\n<\/p><p>\nIf people could live without going to law, society would be greatly benefitted, and individual\npockets suffer less.\n<\/p><p>\nThat comes from the <i>Nauvoo Neighbor<\/i>, July 2, 1845. Somehow or other the two seem to tie\nin together with another statement from Corinthians:\n<\/p><p>\nIn journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own\ncountrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils\nin the sea, in perils among false brethren\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3000\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3000)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3000)\">2 Cor. 11:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd another one from Proverbs:\n<\/p><p>\nDebate thy cause with thy neighbor himself; and discover not a secret to another\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41382\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41382)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41382)\">Prov. 25:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nINSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SETTLE DIFFICULTIES\n<\/p><p>\nThese are all by way of preface, brethren, to a plea that if we have differences that we settle\nthem among ourselves through the various agencies and organizations and procedures which\nthe Lord has given us. I quote again from John Taylor:\n<\/p><p>\nThen the teachers, who are helps to the priests, whose duty it is to go among the people and\ntalk to them on their duties&mdash;not like so many parrots, but full of the spirit of God&mdash;and where\nthere may be difficulties to settle, and it is not within the power of the teachers to\nsatisfactorily adjust them, report them to the bishop, who sits as a common judge in Israel and\nto adjudicate all such matters. If thy brother offend thee, go and say to him, \"Brother, you\nhave done so and so, and if he will not listen to you nor ask forgiveness for the offense he\nhas given you, take another man with you&mdash;one whom you think has influence with him, and\none whom you think he will listen to&mdash;and let him talk. And if the offending person will not\nlisten to him, report him, to be dealt with according to the order of the Church. And if he\ncontinues obdurate and stubborn, then he does not belong to us. Let us\nalways feel like operating together for the good of each other and for the kingdom we are\nidentified with (<i>Journal of Discourses<\/i>, 19:142).\n<\/p><p>\nIf men have differences, they should try to settle them amicably among themselves. But if\nthey cannot do this, let them take the first steps as directed in the Church covenants; let them\ncome together as brethren having a claim upon the Spirit and power of God which would\nattend them if they lived their religion, and then, provided the priests and teachers did their\nduty and were filled with wisdom and the spirit of their office and calling, so ninety-nine\ncases out of every hundred might be satisfactorily settled without either troubling the bishop's\ncourt or the high council (<i>Journal of Discourses<\/i>, 19:53-54).\n<\/p><p>\nThe organization of the Church is after the plan that exists in heaven and according to the\nprinciples that God has revealed in the interest of His Church upon the earth and for the\nadvancement and rolling forth of His kingdom. We start in with the teacher and with the\npriest, whose duty it is to know the position of all the members in their several districts. If\nthey do their duty they will know really and truly the position of all those who come under\ntheir charge. Their duty is very simple. What is it? They are to see that there is no hard\nfeeling existing in the breasts of the Saints one towards another; that there are no dishonest or\nfraudulent acts, no lasciviousness or corruption, no lying, false accusations, profanity, or\ndrunkenness; and that the people call upon God in prayer in their various households father\nand mother and children, and that all perform their various duties and do right. . . .\n<\/p><p>\nAnd while God has organized His Church upon the earth after the plan that exists in the\nheavens, it is for the various officers in the Church to fulfill the duties devolving upon them,\nacting in all kindness, long-suffering, and mercy before the Lord, yet with justice and\njudgment that the law of God may be honored, that the principles of righteousness may be\nexalted, that the workers of iniquity may be ashamed, that the meek may increase their joy in\nthe Lord, and the poor among men may rejoice in the Holy One of Israel\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24999\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24999)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24999)\">Isa. 29:19<\/a><\/span>); that righteousness\nand truth may prevail among the people of God; and we may act not in name only, but in\nreality as the Saints of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation\n(<i>Journal of Discourses<\/i>, 23:216-218).\n<\/p><p>\nIf I violate any law of the Church, bring me up for it. If anyone else does, bring him up for\nit. But don't go sneaking around backbiting and misrepresenting. Let us act as men, at least, if\nwe won't be Saints. But we should be true to our calling and profession and honor our God\n(<i>Journal of Discourses<\/i>, 24:233-235).\n<\/p><p>\nThe further a difficulty spreads, brethren, the more bitterly entrenched does it become, and the\ngreater is the cost in time and in money and in feelings&mdash;sometimes even in the disaffection of\nour families, which is an experience that has been repeated altogether too many times. In the\nwords of Paul&mdash;in the words of John Taylor&mdash;settle your difficulties among\nyourselves, if you have them. Don't worry about the lawyers. They have plenty to do without\nbecoming embroiled in differences among brethren, and the court dockets are crowded. Settle\nyour differences among yourselves. I hope we haven't any Zeezroms in the Church, of whose\nkind it was said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . because they received their wages according to their employ, therefore, they did stir up\nthe people. . . that they might have more employ, that they might get money according to the\nsuits which were brought before them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8816\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8816)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8816)\">Alma 11:20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf we have any such I hope they are not making a living at their profession.\n<\/p><p>\nINCIDENTS REGARDING PRESIDENT JOHN TAYLOR\n<\/p><p>\nSpeaking of John Taylor, I would like to digress a moment to give you one or two other\nstatements of his, one particularly to show the uses to which he put humor.\n<\/p><p>\nA smart young man had just returned from college, and at the table he wished to show his\nparents what extraordinary advancement he had made. \"Why, father,\" says he, \"You can\nhardly conceive of the advance I have made.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well, my son,\" says the father, \"I am sure I am glad to hear you say so, and I trust you will\nmake a great man.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThere happened to be two ducks on the table for dinner, and this young man proposed to give\nhis father a specimen of his smartness.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Now,\" he says, \"You see there are only two ducks, don't you?\" \"Yes.\" answered the father.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well, I can prove to you that there are three ducks.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Can you,\" says the father, \"that's quite extraordinary, really. How can you do it?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well,\" says the son, \"I will show you. That's one?\" \"Yes.\" \"That's two?\" \"Yes.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well, two and one make three, don't they?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Quite so,\" says the father. \"It is very extraordinary, and to show you how much I appreciate\nit, I will eat one of these ducks, and your mother will eat the other, and we will leave the\nthird for you.\" (Laughter.)\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then, says John Taylor, speaking out of the nineteenth century:\n<\/p><p>\nSome of our \"financiers\" have made this kind of discovery, but when it comes to the practical\nthing, they, like the boy, have got to fall back on father's duck or mother's duck!\n(<i>Journal of Discourses<\/i>, 20:164-165).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Do I talk plainly?\" says John Taylor. \"God expects me to talk plainly. I have not come here\nto daub you with untempered mortar, but I tell you the truth.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI have spent many hours the last year and a half with the lofty thought and strong language of\nJohn Taylor. I am sure that you are going to enjoy studying him in the priesthood quorums of\nthis Church in the year to come.\n<\/p><p>\nIn conclusion a thought of great comfort from the same source: There may be circumstances\narise in this world to prevent for a season the order of God, to change the designs of the Most\nHigh, apparently, for the time being. Yet they will ultimately roll back into their proper place\njustice will have its place and so will mercy, and every man and woman will yet stand in\ntheir true position before God (<i>Journal of Discourses<\/i>, 1:222-223).\n<\/p><p>\nPRESIDENT GRANT'S LENGTHENED SERVICE\n<\/p><p>\nWe have had great leaders, brethren. We have the President of the Church with us today. I\nwas reminded last night that he has served longer among the General Authorities than any\nother man who has served since the restoration. On the sixteenth of October of this year, as I\nrecall, President Grant will have served as one of the General Authorities for sixty-one years.\nThe longest term of service prior to this, I believe, was that of Wilford\nWoodruff, fifty-nine years. From Joseph Smith to Heber J. Grant, such wisdom and counsel\nas has been read here, and as is found in each of the utterances of these brethren, are a safe\nguide to the current conduct of our lives.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God be with President Grant, and help us to appreciate the privilege of a living\nleadership with divine authority and inspiration to direct us through all the difficulties of our\nday, and help us to be wise enough to live in accordance with those counsels, I ask in the\nname of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
