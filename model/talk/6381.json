What were you thinking about while you were saying the Young Women theme? What is the meaning for you of what you just said?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p6\" class=\"\">Remember the story of three young men who had made such a commitment? They lived in Babylon, where people were not following the Lord. These young men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, stood as witnesses of God at the peril of their lives. Living under the rule of King Nebuchadnezzar, they were required by decree that on a certain day when the music started, all the people in the kingdom were to kneel and worship a solid gold 90-foot form of a man who represented the king. Anyone refusing would be thrown into a fiery furnace. There must have been thousands of people in Babylon that day for the festivities and to witness the dedication of this spectacular golden idol.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p7\" class=\"\">When the music began and the herald announced that all must kneel, everyone obeyed\u2014everyone, that is, but those brave Hebrews. They refused to insult their God. Can you imagine the courage of these young men? No threats from the king could dissuade them. With faith in their God, they stood together and prayed as they were bound and carried to be burned. The furnace was so hot the men who threw them in died. King Nebuchadnezzar stood by to watch the death of these three infidels. Looking into the inferno, he asked his advisers, \u201cDidn\u2019t we throw three people into the fire?\u201d They assured him indeed they had. Not quite believing what he saw, the puzzled king said: \u201cBut I see four men loose and walking in the middle of the fire, and [most puzzling of all] they have no hurt. The form of the fourth man is like that of the Son of God\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"10564\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10564)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10564)\">Dan. 3:24\u201325<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p8\" class=\"\">Nebuchadnezzar then called to the Hebrews to come out of the furnace and declared them to be servants of the Most High God.

It means we will not bow down or give in or be persuaded to do anything contrary to God\u2019s will. It means we will risk speaking up when our knees are shaking. It means we will listen and follow the still, small voice of the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p10\" class=\"\">Let\u2019s look at an up-to-date version of another heroic Bible message:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p11\" class=\"\">A certain girl went down from her locker toward the lunchroom and fell among thieves, who stripped her of her confidence and self-esteem when she overheard them making fun of her and of the way she dressed, and they walked off leaving her alone and friendless. And by chance there came down a certain girl that way dressed in fine clothes, and when she saw her, she passed by on the other side of the hall.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p12\" class=\"\">And likewise, a girl from the \u201cin\u201d crowd of popular girls, when she was at the place, came and looked on her and passed by on the other side without speaking.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p13\" class=\"\">But a certain young woman came down the hall where she was, and when she saw her, she had compassion and went to her and bound up her wounds when she said, \u201cWould you eat lunch with me?\u201d (author\u2019s adaptation of the parable of the good Samaritan; see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"30990\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30990)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30990)\">Luke 10:30\u201337<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p14\" class=\"\">Looking more closely at this familiar parable, why didn\u2019t the other girls stop to help? Are we so intent on our own problems that we do not notice or think anyone else has any? Do we judge the girl in need to be socially beneath us and worry what the popular kids would think if we stopped to help? Maybe the \u201cdream guy\u201d of the school is waiting to walk you to class and you couldn\u2019t possibly keep him waiting!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p15\" class=\"\">Each one who passed the girl in need had one question in her mind: <span class=\"emphasis\">If I stop, what will happen to me?<\/span> The girl who did stop to help also had one question: <span class=\"emphasis\">If I don\u2019t stop, what will happen to her?<\/span> When we are confident of our Father in Heaven\u2019s infinite love, we can reach out to others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p16\" class=\"\">We can be a witness for God when we know Him, when we trust Him, and when we feel secure in His loving care. There are no new or easy ways we earn a relationship. It is the old ways, the tried-and-true-always-works ways: scripture study, prayer, and living those things you learn through your study and prayers. As you read the scriptures, you become acquainted with what your Father in Heaven wants for His children and how He continually reaches out to sustain and bless and forgive us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p17\" class=\"\">When you pray for personal guidance, your Father in Heaven knows what is in your heart, but He wants you to tell Him of your hopes and dreams and needs. Only when you speak with certainty that, indeed, you do want to be a witness will you know what you are going to do about it. Let God speak to you and let the sacrament take on deeper meaning. Hear these familiar words: \u201cAnd witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10858\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10858)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10858)\">D&amp;C 20:77<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p18\" class=\"\">We have received many letters from young women who are seriously trying to stand as a witness and say what He would say and do what He would do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p19\" class=\"\">Cathy wrote a letter telling about a \u201cgood Samaritan\u201d named Michelle. Cathy had been hospitalized much longer than she had expected to be. Some friends dwindled away, busy in their own lives; but Michelle came often and brought fun and cheer. She decorated the dreary hospital room with Mormonad posters, balloons, and other paraphernalia. One day when Cathy was particularly low, Michelle thought to bring her scriptures. Cathy said: \u201cBringing her scriptures and reading them to me made me want what she had. I wanted to love the scriptures like Michelle does. Without that act of kindness and caring from Michelle, my testimony wouldn\u2019t be what it is today.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p20\" class=\"\">Standing as a witness means you know with certainty that you want to do what is right and let the consequence follow.

You have to be strong!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/standing-with-god.p21\" class=\"\">In your mind, how will you be a witness? What is your plan?
