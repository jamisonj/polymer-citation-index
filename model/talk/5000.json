With all his noble heart, President Benson would desire to stand at this pulpit and bear to you his witness concerning the truth of this work, the gratitude he feels for your prayers, and his fervent hope that all may so live as to merit and receive the abundant blessings a loving Heavenly Father desires to bestow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/the-power-of-prayer.p5\" class=\"\">Tears come easily to the eyes of our prophet when he receives letters written by children in which they express their greetings and send to him their love.

He is pleased that the president of the United States has proclaimed that yesterday, today, and tomorrow be designated as days of national prayer and that sincere expressions of gratitude ascend to heaven for the end of the war in the Middle East. The First Presidency has commented: \u201cWe are thankful for the resolution of the war, and it is our fervent hope and prayer that all nations involved will work in concert for a lasting peace. The collective prayers of the nation and the world should focus not only on a lasting peace but also on the needs of the many on both sides who lost loved ones and endured suffering in the conflict.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/the-power-of-prayer.p7\" class=\"\">President Benson has stated: \u201cThe price of peace is righteousness. Men and nations may loudly proclaim, \u2018Peace, peace,\u2019 but there shall be no peace until individuals nurture in their souls those principles of personal purity, integrity, and character which foster the development of peace. Peace cannot be imposed. It must come from the lives and hearts of men. There is no other way.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson<\/span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988, p. 703.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/the-power-of-prayer.p8\" class=\"\">President Benson has urged: \u201cIf we would advance in holiness\u2014increase in favor with God\u2014nothing can take the place of prayer. \u2026 Give prayer\u2014daily prayer, secret prayer\u2014a foremost place in your lives.
