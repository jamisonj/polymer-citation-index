Lee, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1967, pp. 98-108<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI suppose that I would speak the mind of all of us when we would say to President McKay\nthat the greeting that he gave us at the commencement of the conference yesterday was\nprobably one of the most uplifting things that will be said during the entire conference. Where\nthe President is, there is strength, and to know that he is with us and is presiding is a strength\nto the entire Church.\n<\/p><p>\nI wonder if I might be pardoned for a little personal reference tonight. I am mindful of the\nfact that it has been a whole year since I stood before a general conference in this pulpit.\nDuring the last six-month period I have gone through some painful experiences that kept me\nfrom being in the conference, and I was aware that my life could have been terminated at that\ntime. I became conscious then, through the ministrations of wonderful doctors, skilled nurses,\nand most of all the love and prayers and faith of my family and the members of the Church,\nthat my ministry had been continued for a longer period here. And so with joy and\nthanksgiving in my heart tonight, I return to my ministry with a pledge that my life and my\nenergies will be devoted to this glorious service that has been and will be my whole life.\n<\/p><p>\nI am aware that I have had to submit to some tests, some severe tests, before the Lord, I\nsuppose to prove me to see if I would be willing to submit to all things whatsoever the Lord\nsees fit to inflict upon me, even as a little child does submit to its father\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40356\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40356)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40356)\">Mosiah 3:19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe were touched by Brother Hinckley's impressive talk this afternoon in which he told about\nthe couple who had been sealed just prior to the husband's leaving for battle in Vietnam, and\nthey said to each other, \"I am yours, and you are mine forever.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOn two sacred occasions I too had to stand by and bear my witness, \"You are mine, and I am\nyours forever.\" God grant that I will not fail my Heavenly Father nor you, my beloved\nbrethren of the priesthood of God.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Priesthood correlation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay has asked me to talk to the priesthood of the Church tonight on correlation.\nMy prayer is, President McKay, that I may discharge this assignment as you would have\ndesired me to do; and so with that assignment, and if I might have interest in your faith and\nprayers tonight, I will attempt to say what I should say of the great movement known as the\nCorrelation Program, which was launched by the First Presidency in a letter seven years ago\nto the general priesthood committee.  I shall read from that letter: \n<\/p><p>\n\"We of the First Presidency have over the years felt the need of a correlation between and\namong the courses of study put out by the General Priesthood Committee and by the\nresponsible heads of other Committees of the General Authorities for the instruction of the\nPriesthood of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Correlation of studies<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"We have also felt the very urgent need of a correlation of studies among the Auxiliaries of\nthe Church. We have noted what seemed to be a tendency toward a fundamental, guiding\nconcept, particularly among certain of the Auxiliary Organizations, that there must be every\nyear a new course of study for each of the Auxiliary organizations so moving. We questioned\nwhether the composite of all of them might not tend away from the development of a given\nline of study or activity having the ultimate and desired objective of building up a knowledge\nof the gospel, a power to promulgate the same, a promotion of the growth, faith, and stronger\ntestimony of the principles of the Gospel among the members of the Church . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"We think that the contemplated study by the Committee now set up should have the\nforegoing matters in mind.  We feel assured that if the whole Church curricula were viewed\nfrom the vantage point of what we might term the total purpose of each and\nall of these organizations, it would bring about such a collation and limitation of subjects and\nsubject matters elaborated in the various Auxiliary courses as would tend to the building of\nefficiency in the Auxiliaries themselves in the matter of carrying out the purposes lying\nbehind their creation and function.\n<\/p><p>\n\"We would therefore commend to you Brethren of the General Priesthood Committee the\nbeginning of an exhaustive, prayerful study and consideration of this entire subject, with the\ncooperative assistance of the Auxiliaries themselves so that the Church might reap the\nmaximum harvest from the devotion of the faith, intelligence, skill, and knowledge of our\nvarious Auxiliary Organizations and Priesthood Committees.\n<\/p><p>\n\"This is your authority to employ such necessary technical help as you might need to bring\nthis about. We shall await your report.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Faithfully your brethren,<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      David O. McKay<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      J. Reuben Clark, Jr.<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Henry D. Moyle<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      The First Presidency\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Children, youth, adults<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn that same letter they called attention to the fact that the membership of the Church might\nbe divided into three groups: the children's group, under 12 years of age; the youth group,\nfrom 12 to the 20's; and the adults, from the youth group on through life.\n<\/p><p>\nThat is what set us to a study of this whole plan that we now speak of as correlation. In our\nstudy we came across another prophetic statement that has been read before, but I read it now\nas a part of this presentation in order to tie the matter all together.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Priesthood to assume responsibility<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAt the April conference in 1906, President Joseph F. Smith made this statement: \n<\/p><p>\n\"We expect to see the day, if we live long enough (and if some of us do not live long enough\nto see it, there are others who will), when every council of the Priesthood in the Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will understand its duty; will assume its own responsibility,\nwill magnify its calling, and fill its place in the Church, to the uttermost, according to the\nintelligence and ability possessed by it. When that day shall come, there will not be so much\nnecessity for work that is now being done by the auxiliary organizations, because it will be\ndone by the regular quorums of the Priesthood. The Lord designed and comprehended it from\nthe beginning, and he has made provision in the Church whereby every need may be met and\nsatisfied through the regular organizations of the Priesthood. It has truly been said that the\nChurch is perfectly organized.  The only trouble is that these organizations are not fully alive\nto the obligations that rest upon them. When they become thoroughly awakened to the\nrequirements made of them. They will fulfil their duties more faithfully, and the work of the\nLord will be all the stronger and more powerful and influential in the world.\"\n(<i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1906, p. 3.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Organization<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAn organization was set up under the direction of the First Presidency following that\nassignment seven years ago, and seven members of the Twelve and the Presiding Bishop were\nnamed as the Correlation Executive Committee. It should be understood when we say\nexecutive committee that the Correlation Committee in total includes the First Presidency and\nthe Council of the Twelve Apostles. We then considered ourselves a task committee to bring\nall our work to that body whom we represented for final approval.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Correlation committees for children, youth, adults<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThree correlation committees were set up: the children's correlation committee; the youth\ncorrelation committee; and the adult correlation committee, with aides or editorial boards for\ncurriculum study and lessons for family home teaching. Also appointed were managing\ndirectors for four phases of priesthood activity: home teaching, missionary,\nwelfare, and genealogy. These directors were three Assistants to the Twelve and one of the\npresidents of the First Council of the Seventy, with one of the members of the executive\ncommittee as the chairman of the group working with these managing directors.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Professionally trained general secretaries<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe then called to our aid professionally trained men to be our general secretaries. These men,\ntrained in educational work, preferred not to be paid employees. They asked to make this\ncontribution to the Church on their own time and without cost, and to continue their teaching\nroles at the universities where they were employed. There are also others of our secretarial\nstaff whose work relates to correlation.\n<\/p><p>\nWe therefore have set ourselves, under the direction of and with the help of these aides, to the\nmonumental task of correlating all the curricula in all Church organizations, and to a\ncontinuing study of correlation problems for action of the First Presidency and the Twelve.\nThis organization has been in effect for these seven years.\n<\/p><p>\nSome developments have been outwardly observed by the membership of the Church. I call\nthese to your attention so that you will have them in mind.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Priesthood given responsibility<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe first step that was made was to place the priesthood in the place where the Lord had\nplaced it: to watch over the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 20, the Lord said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"The teacher's duty is to watch over the church always, and be with and strengthen them; \n<\/p><p>\n\"And see that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness with each other, neither\nlying, backbiting, nor evil speaking; \n<\/p><p>\n\"And see that the church meet together often, and also see that all the members do their\nduty\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14919\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14919)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14919)\">D&amp;C 20:53-55<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis, you will note by careful reading of this great revelation in its entirety, was to apply to\nthe whole priesthood of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Home teaching assigned<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe name of home teaching was given to this movement, to distinguish it from ward teaching.\nWhen this was discussed with President McKay, some suggested we should call them\nwatchmen&mdash;\"priesthood watchmen\"&mdash;but the President wisely counseled that we had better\nnot let the membership of the Church think of the priesthood as detectives, that it would be\nbetter to call them the priesthood home teachers.\n<\/p><p>\nThe genealogical representatives called our attention to the fact that home teachers was the\ntitle they gave to their genealogical workers in the wards. The President then advised that\nthese genealogical workers be called family teachers, a name that is more descriptive of the\nwork of genealogical visitors to the homes in each ward.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Purpose for home teaching<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHome teaching, in essence, means that we consider separately each individual member of the\nfamily who constitutes the entire home personnel. Home teaching, as distinguished from ward\nteaching, is to help the parents with home problems in their efforts to teach their families the\nfundamentals of parental responsibility, as contrasted with merely bringing a message, a\ngospel message, to the entire family. Quorum leaders were given the responsibility of\nselecting, training, and supervising quorum members in visiting with and teaching assigned\nfamilies of their own quorum members.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Organization and functioning<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nPresidents or group leaders of each Melchizedek Priesthood quorum and general secretaries of\nAaronic Priesthood&mdash;Adult and Youth were then brought together in what were called\n\"priesthood executive committees.\" Once a week this committee, bringing together\nrepresentatives of every priesthood group, has been meeting with the bishopric, and there have\nbeen correlated and discussed all problems pertaining to the priesthood.\nHere is a teaching opportunity for the bishop to train the leaders of each priesthood group in\nhis ward.\n<\/p><p>\nGreater emphasis on the teaching of the children in the home by the parents was brought forth\nin what we call the family home evening program. This was not new. Fifty years ago it was\ngiven emphasis; and as we went back into history, we found that in the last epistle written to\nthe Church by President Brigham Young and his counselors, it was urged that parents bring\ntheir children together and teach them the gospel in the home frequently. So family home\nevening has been urged ever since the Church was established in this dispensation. Six\nhundred and fifty thousand family home evening manuals with lessons for each week have\nbeen prepared and placed in the hands of every parent throughout the Church. Each year's\ntheme of the home evening lessons has been correlated with the Melchizedek Priesthood and\nthe Relief Society lessons, and this year the Sunday School general board has instituted a\nspecial class each week for parents to aid in their weekly family home evening and to help\nprepare the parents to be better teachers of their children.\n<\/p><p>\nPlans were laid early in this dispensation to meet the challenge of anticipated growth as\nindicated by the scriptures and by prophetic utterances of presidents of the Church. President\nMcKay gave us the key to our search for what we should do in these matters. In discussing a\nmatter pertaining to the missions, he said this:  \"Now in changing our policy here, let us keep\nas near as we can to the revelations of the Lord, and we will never be wrong if we do that.\"\nThat sounds like good logic, doesn't it?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The place of the priesthood in the kingdom<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThat injunction from the President took us into a study of all that the Lord has said about the\nplace of the priesthood and how it should operate in the kingdom.  We found what the Lord\nsaid about the work of the Twelve: \n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Twelve<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"The Twelve are a Traveling Presiding High Council, to officiate in the name of the Lord,\nunder the direction of the Presidency of the Church, agreeable to the institution of heaven; to\nbuild up the church, and regulate all the affairs of the same in all nations, first unto the\nGentiles and secondly unto the Jews\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15031\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15031)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15031)\">D&amp;C 107:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Seventy<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAbout the Seventy the Lord said: \"It is the duty of the traveling high council to call upon the\nSeventy, when they need assistance, to fill the several calls for preaching and administering\nthe gospel, instead of any others\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15033\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15033)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15033)\">D&amp;C 107:38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI think you will see in what has gone forward in the last few years that now as never before\nin our recollection, the seventies have been given a major role in the missionary work of the\nChurch. Perhaps the door has opened as widely as it has ever been for the work of the\nseventies, and we thank the Lord for the work of our leaders in the seventies quorums.\n<\/p><p>\nNow to support what the First Presidency's message has already said about others who would\nbe called as leaders: \"Whereas other officers of the church, who belong not unto the Twelve,\nneither to the Seventy, are not under the responsibility to travel among all nations, but are to\ntravel as their circumstances shall allow, notwithstanding they may hold as high and\nresponsible offices in the church\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15039\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15039)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15039)\">D&amp;C 107:98<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat would allow, besides those mentioned, a place for the Assistants to the Twelve.\n<\/p><p>\nThen we found another scripture that had significance. It has always been there, but we had\nnever read this scripture as we saw it now. The Lord said in the 84th section of the Doctrine\nand Covenants (this is to the Twelve): \n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore, go ye into all the world; and unto whatsoever place ye cannot go ye shall send,\nthat the testimony may go from you into all the world unto every creature.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And as I said unto mine apostles, even so I say unto you, for you are mine apostles, even\nGod's high priests; ye are they whom my Father hath given me; ye are my friends\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14991\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14991)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14991)\">D&amp;C 84:62-63<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhere we couldn't go, then, the Lord has said, \"<i>Send<\/i>,\" that the testimony, your testimony,\nmight by those you send be brought to every creature throughout the world.\n<\/p><p>\nSoon after the death of President Young, President John Taylor and the Twelve took over the\npresiding authority of the Church for approximately three years before President Taylor was\nsustained as the President of the Church. In a message to the Church at that time, two or three\nthings were said to which I would like to call your attention: \n<\/p><p>\n<b>Keys of the Holy Priesthood and the Apostleship<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"The keys of the kingdom are still right here with the Church . . . the holy Priesthood and\nApostleship, which He restored to the earth, still remain to guide and govern, and to\nadminister ordinances to the Church which He has established. Our beloved brother Brigham\nYoung has gone from us to join the Prophet Joseph and the host of the holy and the pure who\nare behind the veil; but we do not therefore lose the benefit of his labors. He is now in a\nposition to do more for that work which he loved so well, and for which he labored so\nardently, than he could possibly do in the flesh; and that work will roll onward with increased\npower and accelerated speed.\" (<i>Messages of the First Presidency<\/i>, Vol. 2, p. 299.)\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then they quoted from the Prophet Joseph Smith's instructions the following: \n<\/p><p>\n\"The Twelve are not subject to any other than the First Presidency, viz: myself, Sidney\nRigdon, and Frederick G. Williams, who are now my counselors (and where I am not there is\nno First Presidency over the Twelve).\"\n<\/p><p>\nAfter the death of the Prophet Joseph, President Young, in speaking to the Saints, said:  \". . .\nHere are the Twelve, appointed by the finger of God, who hold the keys of the Priesthood,\nand the authority to set in order and regulate the Church in all the world (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15032\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15032)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15032)\">D&amp;C 107:33<\/a><\/span>).\" (<i>Ibid.<\/i>)\n<\/p><p>\nThen there followed a statement which indicated that there was some tendency to look back to\nthe previous administration and think what the Prophet Joseph might have done had he been\nthere.  President Brigham Young and his counselors wrote this in their closing epistle to the\nChurch: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Here is Elder Amasa Lyman and elder Sidney Rigdon; they were councilors in the first\npresidency, and they are councilors to the Twelve still; if they keep their places; but if either\nwishes to act as 'spokesman' for the prophet Joseph, he must go behind the veil where Joseph\nis.\" (<i>Times and Seasons<\/i>, Vol. 5, p. 638.)\n<\/p><p>\nNow that was a rather interesting observation.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I now say this: Those keys of the kingdom are still here with the Church today. As\nPresident Taylor declared, \". . . the holy Priesthood and Apostleship, which He restored to the\nearth, still remain to guide and govern, and to administer ordinances to the Church which He\nhas established.\" President David O. McKay is the one man today who holds those keys, as\ndid the Prophet Joseph Smith, as did President Brigham Young, as did President John Taylor,\nand so on down to President McKay, who presides today.\n<\/p><p>\nThen President John Taylor added this final statement, which indicates something in which\nyou will be interested: \n<\/p><p>\n<b>Stake conferences<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"That there may be a correct understanding among all the Stakes of Zion respecting the time\nfor holding the quarterly Conferences in the different Stakes, and the Presidents be enabled to\nmake preparations therefore, we have deemed it best to make the following appointments for\nthe conferences during the next half year. [This was in 1877.] It will be seen that in most\ninstances they will be held in two stakes upon the same days. This is unavoidable, in\nconsequence of the great number of stakes.\" (<i>Messages of the First Presidency<\/i>, Vol. 2, p.\n301.)\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then I counted the \"great\" number of stakes: Salt Lake, Davis and Utah, Weber and Juab,\nTooele and Box Elder, Wasatch and Cache, Summit and Bear Lake, Morgan and Sanpete,\nSevier and Millard, Panguitch and Beaver, Kanab and Iron [Parowan], and St. George&mdash;20\nstakes, a great number of stakes. There were nine missions&mdash;nine organized missions&mdash;at\nthat time. Well, as we think about that now, and as they closed that epistle after making that\nprofound statement about the great number of stakes, the Twelve then added: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And now, brethren and sisters, we exhort you to arouse yourselves and seek unto the Lord in\nfervent faith and prayer. We know that our Father in heaven is a God of Revelation. He is\nready and willing to pour out his blessings and gifts upon those who seek unto Him for them.\nWe need them as individuals and as a people to qualify us for the duties which devolve upon\nus. We should remember and carry into practical effect the counsels and instructions we have\nso liberally received from our departed President. He has gone from us; but the flock is not\nleft without a shepherd. Latter-day Saints should so live that they will know the voice of the\nTrue Shepherd, and not be deceived by pretenders . . . The Latter-day Saint who does not live so\nas to have the revelations of Jest's constantly with him, stands in great danger of being\ndeceived and falling away . . . All the signs which the Lord promised to send in the last days\nare making their appearance. They show that the day of the Lord is near. A great work has to\nbe done, and there is but little time in which to accomplish it; great diligence is, therefore,\nrequired . . . Let us not slacken our diligence, or give way to doubt, unbelief or hardness of\nheart; but be strong in the Lord, and cry unto Him unceasingly to give us the power to build\nup His Zion on the earth, and to help establish a reign of righteousness, peace, and truth.\"\n(<i>Messages of the First Presidency<\/i>, Vol. 2, pp. 302-303.)\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so ended that remarkable epistle to the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nNow to point up our challenge of the present growth and to prepare for the fulfillment of the\nhastening of the Lord's work, which he promised he would do in his own time: If one were\nto paint a picture in broad strokes of just a few features of the future, here are some things\nthat will challenge the Church in the years that lie ahead: \n<\/p><p>\n<b>Organization for the growth of the Church<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I came into the Council of the Twelve we had 35 missions. I helped to organize, along\nwith President Joseph Fielding Smith, the 138th stake. We now have 443 stakes.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the 70 years from 1830 to 1900, the Church grew by 258,000 members. Today, a\nquarter of a million expansion in membership takes not 70 years, but in only two or three\nyears, we expand by a quarter of a million.\n<\/p><p>\nOur Church membership is increasing at about three times the growth rate of the population\nof the United States. But, just as significantly, the regional distribution of Church membership\nis also following some clear trends that we trust recognize, not only intellectually, but also\nadministratively.\n<\/p><p>\nIn 1910, Utah and Idaho contained approximately 75 percent of all Church membership.\nToday, only 40 percent of the Church's members live in these two states. Utah once held\ntwo-thirds of all members. Today, even though the number of members in Utah has now risen\nfrom 224,000 in 1910 to 714,000, only one-third of all members now live in Utah.  Brazil\nnow has 23,000 Latter-day Saints; Australia, 21,000; and Mexico, 50,000.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the last ten years, membership in the southern states has risen from 72,000 to 170,000;\nin South America from 6,000 to 67,000; and in Asia from 1,500 to 21,000.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have no choice but to think regionally.\n<\/p><p>\nResearch has been done by the department of statistics at the Brigham Young University by\nDr. Howard Nielsen, and he estimates the Church membership by 1985, just 17 years from\nnow, will total from 5,700,000 to 7,700,000, depending on the rate of conversions.\n<\/p><p>\nBy the year 2000 A. D., which means that our children now eight years of age will then be\n41 years old, we could have a total membership of over ten million people.  Though this may\nsound very distant to some of us, it is the year, I repeat, when these eight-year-olds will\nbecome 41, if you get that clearly.\n<\/p><p>\nIn 1985 there will be more than one million members in Utah, but they will represent only 21\npercent of all Church membership.  California will have almost a million members by then,\nand the southern states one-half million.  Canada will host 160,000 members, with more than\n200,000 in the British Isles, and over one-quarter million in Central and South America.\n<\/p><p>\nToday, there are approximately 443 stakes and nearly 4,000 wards and branches.  By 1985,\ndepending on our effectiveness and external events, we should have 1,000 stakes and nearly\n10,000 wards.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the calendar year 1985, about 200 new stake presidents will be appointed to new or\nexisting stakes, and General Authorities will need to direct five stake reorganizations each\nweek.  The brethren will then need to clear between 50 and 60 names for the office of bishop\neach week.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, you begin to see something about the growth, and so we could go on with auxiliary\norganizations.\n<\/p><p>\nNow just a word about the missions: It is estimated that in the missions within that 17-year\nperiod, in contrast to 77 or 78 missions we have today, we could have as many as 185\nmissions by then, with probably as many as 30,000 missionaries instead of our 13,000 as of\ntoday.\n<\/p><p>\nPerhaps this is enough, then, to indicate the great challenge that demands an extended\nauthoritative supervisory ministry.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Assistants to the Twelve<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the first five Assistants to the Twelve were called in 1941, the Presidency said: \"The\nrapid growth of the Church in recent times, the constantly increasing establishment of wards\nand stakes . . . all have built up an apostolic service of the greatest magnitude. The First\nPresidency and Twelve feel that to meet adequately their great responsibilities and to carry on\nefficiently this service for the Lord, they should have some help.\" (<i>The Improvement Era<\/i>,\nMay 1941, p. 269.) That was said when we had 137 stakes. Now, when we have 443 stakes\nand twice as many missions, you begin to see what we are talking about.  All of this is\nsobering to think about, even superficially.  It is awesome to contemplate, at any length. How\ncan we best provide the necessary leadership with enough worthy, able leaders in the right\nplaces at the right time? How can we best finance a kingdom of this scope and dimension? \nHow can we best absorb, fellowship, and teach this many souls?\n<\/p><p>\nWhile sacrament meeting attendance rose from 21 percent in 1921 to 36 percent in 1965, we\nappear to have hit a plateau.  We are not advancing from that 36 percent.  Effective preaching\nof the gospel and showing how it relates directly to the lives of people today are partial but\nneeded answers to this challenge.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Regional Representatives assist the Twelve<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow the plan that has been announced is for the appointment of Regional Representatives of\nthe Twelve.  Many of you heard the announcement by the First Presidency yesterday.  This\nwas the official announcement: \n<\/p><p>\n\"As many of you will remember, in 1941, it became necessary for the First Presidency and\nthe Twelve to provide for additional brethren to help with the work of overseeing and setting\nin order an ever-growing, world-wide Church. Thus in the General Conference of April, 1941,\nAssistants to the Twelve were named and sustained, 'to be increased or\notherwise from time to time as the necessity or carrying on the Lord's work seems to dictate.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"Since then the world-wide demands of the Church have increased in ever greater degree, and\nit is felt by the First Presidency and the Twelve that a further provision for guidance and\ndirection is now needed.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Their duties<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"What, therefore, is now proposed is the calling of as many brethren as may be necessary, to\nbe known as Regional Representatives of the Twelve, each, as assigned, to be responsible in\nsome aspects of the work to carry counsel to and to conduct instructional meetings in groups\nof stakes or regions as may be designated from time to time.\n<\/p><p>\n\"These Regional Representatives of the Twelve will not be 'General' Authorities, as such, but\nwill serve somewhat as do stake presidents, giving full Church service for greater or lesser\nperiods of service as circumstances may suggest.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Fuller details will be in evidence as this plan proceeds under the guidance of the First\nPresidency and the Twelve.\"\n<\/p><p>\nDuring these last few years, we have had in preparation for this regional expansion 114\npriesthood committee members representing the four phases of priesthood work previously\nreferred to.  They have rendered a great and monumental service and will do so to the end of\n1967, after which they will be released by the First Presidency. When their present service is\nconcluded, we hope to show our appreciation to them in some more appropriate manner. And,\nparenthetically, I might say, I would think that presidents in stakes where these well-trained\ncommittee members reside would be something less than alert if they did not move after\nJanuary 1 to bring these brethren into some of their local priesthood structures, in order to\ntake advantage of the great experience these brethren have had throughout the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nMost all of these who are called now to be Regional Representatives of the Twelve have\nserved in stake presidencies or as mission presidents or both. Fifteen of them are now serving\nas stake presidents and will be released before the end of this year.\n<\/p><p>\nAreas of the Church, where clusters of stakes will be brought together, will be assigned to the\n69 Regional Representatives of the Twelve; and so far as possible, these men are being\nassigned to areas as near to their homes as possible. Forty-four Regional Representatives will\nlive within their assigned areas.  Twenty-five will be assigned outside their own areas, but\nabout 12 of them convenient to their homes. Eleven will be in distant areas and nine outside\nof continental United States, particularly those countries that need men with special language\naptitudes to teach effectively the leaders in these foreign language stakes.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the reasons we have released a number of priesthood committee members is because\nwe are trying to find men within the regions, so far as it is practicable so to do, to regionalize\nas far as is possible close to their homes.\n<\/p><p>\nWith this in mind, perhaps we should say just a word about the role of Regional\nRepresentatives.  For two days this past week, we have had eight hours each day with our\nRegional Representatives of the Twelve together with the General Authorities and the heads\nof our auxiliary organizations, in an intensive instructional period, highlighted by a devotional\nin the temple under the direction of the First Presidency.\n<\/p><p>\nThis, then, will be the program that will go into effect.\n<\/p><p>\nLast night after two hours of meeting with all the stake presidents of the Church and these\nRegional Representatives, each representative received his assignment to a given area and\nwent thereafter to an office in the Church Office Building where he met, for the first time, the\nstake presidents who will work under his supervision, and to become acquainted and there to\nestablish a relationship that, we hope, will grow strong and very precious\nthroughout the years.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the Church has grown, we have felt somewhat guilty.  I called attention last night to the\nfact that last Sunday I was in Dallas, Texas, where we organized a new stake, the Fort Worth\nStake.  We took all the time between the two sessions to set new officers apart. We then went\ninto the second session, after which, as we rushed to catch a plane to come home, I said to\nthe stake president, \"The Lord bless you, President Kelly.  I will see you at general\nconference.\" I had a guilty feeling that I didn't take the time, didn't have the time, to sit\ndown and do an adequate job of teaching and training those new officers.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Plans for representation at stake conference<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSo, in the stake quarterly conferences hereafter, or beginning in 1968, the General Authorities\nwill be the only official visitors to attend stake conferences except in those single stakes that\nare not aligned with regions. In those stakes the Regional Representative of the Twelve will\ngo on the conference dates when no General Authority is to be in attendance; and with the\nauxiliary representatives, they will hold a regional meeting similar to that which will be held\nin all the regions semiannually throughout the Church and remain over for the stake\nconference.\n<\/p><p>\nThe General Authorities will go to stake quarterly conferences on Saturday afternoon, and\nthere we will have a leadership training session in the afternoon with the stake presidency, the\nhigh council, and the bishoprics; with all the priesthood leaders in the evening; and on Sunday\nmorning, with the stake presidency.  And then we are endeavoring to get all the families to\ncome to conference.  In order to provide a place for the small children, we are suggesting that\nin every stake the stake superintendency of Sunday School arrange for a Junior Sunday\nSchool, perhaps in a separate building, if one can be found nearby, or in another area of the\nstake conference center; and there, with a suggested program that we will give, the children\nwill be taken care of during that two-hour period, which will perhaps be broken down into\nshort periods, with some diversion for the children.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>One general session of stake conference<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow, beginning in 1968, there will be only one general session of conference in each stake;\nin the afternoon, when the General Authority is in attendance, we will take time to give\ninstruction that we haven't had time to give, as I have illustrated in the case of the Fort Worth\nStake leaders at Dallas this past week.\n<\/p><p>\nAs we read the revelations we found something significant about stake conferences, as the\nLord designed them. Let me read what the Lord said, as recorded in Section 20 of the\nDoctrine and Covenants, about stake conferences: \n<\/p><p>\n\"The several elders composing this church of Christ are to meet in conference once in three\nmonths, or from time to time as said conferences shall direct or appoint . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"It shall be the duty of the several churches, composing the church of Christ, to send one or\nmore of their teachers to attend the several conferences held by the elders of the church\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14920\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14920)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14920)\">D&amp;C 20:61,81<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Leaders to be instructed at stake conference<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThat was a stake conference. If we understand that instruction correctly, we should understand\nthat the prime purpose of a stake conference was to instruct the leaders of the stakes; and that\nis what we are now intending to do, more than we have done in the past.\n<\/p><p>\nIt will be expected that every ward in the stake will return home and have a sacrament\nmeeting in the evening, where the greater number of the membership of the Church will be\nbrought into some worshiping assembly on the day of a stake quarterly conference.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, we have had excellent conferences in the stakes, but we find we have\nhad good attendance in the morning, while many have stayed away from the afternoon\nsession.  That is happening not in one stake but in many stakes. Now, in order to see that\nthere is a place in every stake for every member to attend, we are asking that there be a\nsacrament meeting in every ward in every stake on the day of stake conference.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Stake conferences under direction of General Authorities, stake presidents with assistance<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAt the conferences where no General Authority is in attendance, we are asking our stake\npresidents not to have an imported speaker to take the place of a General Authority, or to\nexpect their Regional Representative to come. He will only go there as he may indicate he\nwould desire for some special purpose or may be assigned by the First Presidency or the\nTwelve.  This will be the opportunity for the stake president with his staff, meaning his\nauxiliary and priesthood leaders, to instruct his people as the leaders have been instructed in\ntheir previous regional meetings. And so our quarterly conferences will be more intensive\ntraining in leadership by General Authorities, and we are now trying to gear ourselves to do a\nbetter job than we have been doing in the past.\n<\/p><p>\nWe will have in addition some specialists or, as we will now call them, priesthood aides, in\ngenealogy, welfare, missionary and home teaching, who may be brought into service as\nnecessary to meet the needs of our Regional Representatives or individual stakes needing\nspecialized attention.\n<\/p><p>\nNow then, I conclude with just one or two observations.  Again and again has been repeated\nthe statement that the home is the basis of a righteous life.  With new and badly needed\nemphasis on the \"how,\" we must not lose sight of the \"why\" we are so engaged.  The\npriesthood programs operate in support of the home; the auxiliary programs render valuable\nassistance.  Wise regional leadership can help us to do our share in attaining God's\noverarching purpose, \"to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39281\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39281)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39281)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>).\nBoth the revelations of God and the learning of men tell us how crucial the home is in\nshaping the individual's total life experience.  You must have been impressed that running\nthrough all that has been said in this conference has been the urgency of impressing the\nimportance of better teaching and greater parental responsibility in the home. Much of what\nwe do organizationally, then, is scaffolding, as we seek to build the individual, and we must\nnot mistake the scaffolding for the soul.\n<\/p><p>\nNow may I just say this: I was with one of the brethren who formerly presided over the\nSwedish Mission. He told me about being on a ship that was going out among the various\nislands into the open sea. As the ship was being steered near one particularly unimpressive\nisland, he wondered why it wasn't steered past another island. Finally he noticed ahead what\nappeared to be broomsticks sticking up; these sticks were attached to buoys, to guide the ship\nthrough safe channels. Engineers had discovered the safe places.\n<\/p><p>\nGod's engineers have charted the course ahead of us.  Now our critics (and we expect we will\nhave some; usually they are those without knowledge or with little or no vision) will wonder\nwhy we didn't take some other course to meet the problem.  This reminds me of the saying:\n\"A man is usually down on what he ain't up on.\" We suppose we will have more and more of\nthat.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord's chosen leaders have signaled us now to move forward. When Moses went to lead\nthe children of Israel out into the desert, it was not the Moses who had fled for his life; it was\nnot the Moses who had climbed the mount with fear; but it was the Moses endowed by the\npower of Almighty God.  When he lifted his staff and signaled, the whole company moved\nforward.  We must not lose ourselves in the mechanics of leadership and neglect the spiritual.\n\". . . if your eye be single to my glory,\" the Lord said, \"your whole body\nshall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14997\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14997)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14997)\">D&amp;C 88:67<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nEvidence of improved leadership will bring more consistent study of the scriptures, greater\nconcern of the holders of the priesthood in watching over the Church, more devotion to\nfamily duties, more of our young people married worthily in the temple, greater faith and\nrighteous exercise of the priesthood, and so on.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith said as he wrote from Liberty Jail: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Let no man count them as small things; for there is much which lieth in futurity, pertaining\nto the saints, which depends upon these things.\n<\/p><p>\n\"You know, brethren, that a very large ship is benefited very much by a very small helm in\nthe time of a storm, by being kept workways with the wind and the waves.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and\nthen may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his\narm to be revealed\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15054\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15054)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15054)\">D&amp;C 123:15-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo which I bear humble testimony, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
