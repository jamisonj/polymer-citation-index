This principle is basic to our belief. President Wilford Woodruff declared: \u201cWhenever the Lord had a people on the earth that He acknowledged as such, that people were led by revelation\u201d (In <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 24:240.) I affirm at the beginning that the inspiration of God is available to all who worthily seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This is particularly true of those who have received the gift of the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/continuous-revelation.p4\" class=\"\">I wish to speak today, however, of God\u2019s communications to all of his children through prophets, as distinguished from personal revelation received by individual members of the Church and others. The prophets, seers, and revelators have had and still have the responsibility and privilege of receiving and declaring the word of God for the world. Individual members, parents, and leaders have the right to receive revelation for their own responsibility but have no duty nor right to declare the word of God beyond the limits of their own responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/continuous-revelation.p5\" class=\"\">I use as my text the ninth article of faith: \u201cWe believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7007\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7007)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7007)\">A of F 1:9<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Past Revelation<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/continuous-revelation.p7\" class=\"\">The first part states: \u201cWe believe all that God has revealed.\u201d Through the ages, God\u2019s messages to his children generally have been revealed through prophets. Amos tells us, \u201cSurely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10482\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10482)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10482)\">Amos 3:7<\/a><\/span>.) These are the prophetic oracles who have tuned in over the centuries to the \u201ccelestial transmitting station,\u201d with a responsibility to relay the Lord\u2019s word to others. The principal qualifications of a prophet in any age are not wealth, title, position, physical stature, scholarship, or intellectual attainment. The two qualifications are that a prophet must be called as such by God, by open prophecy, and ordained by one known to have legal and spiritual authority, and he must receive and declare revelation from God. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18997\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18997)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18997)\">D&amp;C 42:11<\/a><\/span>.)

The greatest revelator in our time has been Joseph Smith. In the difficult period between 1823 and 1843, just twenty years, 134 revelations were received, printed, and made public.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/continuous-revelation.p12\" class=\"\">Each of the eighty-nine Apostles called since then has been sustained as a prophet, seer, and revelator. But <span class=\"emphasis\">the<\/span> prophets, seers, and revelators succeeding Joseph as Presidents of the Church have been those Apostles in whom all of the keys of Christ\u2019s earthly kingdom have been active and functioning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/continuous-revelation.p13\" class=\"\">We now move forward nobly and boldly, with courage and conviction, led by our venerable prophet, Ezra Taft Benson. He is in every respect entitled to our sustaining action. For forty-six years he has been sustained as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is now the senior Apostle on the earth. He has been ordained and set apart as the prophet, seer, and revelator to the world. He has been sustained as the President of the Church. He has been given two inspired Counselors to help him. He is the presiding high priest over all the priesthood on the earth. He alone holds and exercises all of the keys of the kingdom under the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the head of this church and is the chief cornerstone. In his presidency, assisted by his two great Counselors and sustained by the Quorum of the Twelve, he is leading this work forward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/continuous-revelation.p14\" class=\"\">I do not believe members of this church can be in full harmony with the Savior without sustaining his living prophet on the earth, the President of the Church. If we do not sustain the living prophet, whoever he may be, we die spiritually. Ironically, some have died spiritually by exclusively following prophets who have long been dead. Others equivocate in their support of living prophets, trying to lift themselves up by putting down the living prophets, however subtly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/continuous-revelation.p15\" class=\"\">In our lifetime we have been favored with ongoing communication from the heavens, which have been open to the prophets of our time. Major divine pronouncements have included what we now know as section 138 of the Doctrine and Covenants, given in 1918. [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19143\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19143)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19143)\">D&amp;C 138<\/a><\/span>] Surely one of the greatest divine disclosures came in 1978 when the blessings of the priesthood and temple became available to all worthy male members [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"41175\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41175)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41175)\">O.D. 2<\/a><\/span>]. Line upon line and precept upon precept, new knowledge and direction have been given to the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/continuous-revelation.p16\" class=\"\">Thus, by revelation in our day the Seventies have been given an expanded role as members of Area Presidencies and in general Church administration, helping the First Presidency and the Twelve \u201cin building up the church and regulating all the affairs of the same in all nations.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19093\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19093)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19093)\">D&amp;C 107:34<\/a><\/span>.) Many other divine instructions have also been received. Much revelation received, in this time as well as anciently, has been doctrinal. Some of it has been operational and tactical. Much of it is not spectacular. President John Taylor reminds us: \u201cAdam\u2019s revelation did not instruct Noah to build his ark; nor did Noah\u2019s revelation tell Lot to forsake Sodom; nor did either of these speak of the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt. These all had revelations for themselves.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Millennial Star,<\/span> 1 Nov. 1847, p. 323.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/continuous-revelation.p17\" class=\"\">In our time God has revealed how to administer the Church with a membership of over six million differently than when there were just six members of the Church. These differences include the use of modern technology, such as films, computers, and satellite broadcasts, to teach and communicate new ways to conduct missionary work in various nations; the location and building of temples; and many others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/continuous-revelation.p18\" class=\"\">This process of continuous revelation comes to the Church very frequently. President Wilford Woodruff stated, \u201cThis power is in the bosom of Almighty God, and he imparts it to his servants the prophets as they stand in need of it day by day to build up Zion.\u201d (in <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 14:33.)

As light and knowledge are given, as prophecies are fulfilled and more intelligence is received, another step forward can be taken.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Holy Temple,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1980, p. 137.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/continuous-revelation.p21\" class=\"\">This Church constantly needs the guidance of its head, the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. This was well taught by President George Q. Cannon: \u201cWe have the Bible, the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants; but all these books, without the living oracles and a constant stream of revelation from the Lord, would not lead any people into the Celestial Kingdom. \u2026 This may seem a strange declaration to make, but strange as it may sound, it is nevertheless true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/continuous-revelation.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cOf course, these records are all of infinite value. They cannot be too highly prized, nor can they be too closely studied. But in and of themselves, with all the light that they give, they are insufficient to guide the children of men and to lead them into the presence of God. To be thus led requires a living Priesthood and constant revelation from God to the people according to the circumstances in which they may be placed.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Truth,<\/span> Classics in Mormon Literature Series, 2 vols. in one, sel.

This continuous revelation will not and cannot be forced by outside pressure from people and events. It is not the so-called \u201crevelation of social progress.\u201d It does not originate with the prophets; it comes from God. The Church is governed by the prophet under the guidance and direction of God. Parley P. Pratt disclosed:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/continuous-revelation.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cThe legislative, judicial, and executive power is vested in Him [the Lord].

When, therefore, a judgment is reached and proclaimed by these officers it becomes binding upon all members of the Church, individual views to the contrary notwithstanding. God\u2019s Kingdom is a kingdom of law and order.\u201d (In Conference Report, Oct. 1938, pp. 115\u201316.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/continuous-revelation.p29\" class=\"\">How can we be so sure that, as promised, the prophets, seers, and revelators will never lead this people astray? (See Joseph Fielding Smith, <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> July 1972, p. 88.)

This requirement of unanimity provides a check on bias and personal idiosyncrasies. It ensures that God rules through the Spirit, not man through majority or compromise.
