Morris, <i>Conference Report<\/i> April 1957,  pp. 100-102<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brethren and sisters, I sincerely pray that the Lord will direct me to say that which I\nshould say to you this morning. He has blessed us through this great conference from the\ninspired and powerful address of President McKay through all the sessions. I sincerely pray\nthat his blessings may be with me, that that Spirit shall be continued.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is fast day in the Church, the regular monthly fast day, and I should like to dwell with\nyou for a few moments upon its importance and our relation to it.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the early days of the Church, there were urgent needs to be met, and so the Prophet Joseph\nSmith, who had a plea made him from Kirtland for help for the poor and the needy, told the\nSaints to establish a fast day. Each month it was to be observed, and they were to fast for the\nday and bring to the one in charge the food that they would have consumed so that it might\nbe dispensed to the poor.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a beautiful, simple, direct, and inspired provision the Lord made through the Prophet\nJoseph Smith! People were to endure hunger and not partake of food they had but bring that\nfood that others might not endure hunger.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord revealed to Isaiah the true observance of the fast day; after rejecting the methods\nused by Israel at that time, he then points out the right way that the day should be observed.\n<\/p><p>\nIs not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy\nburdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?<br \/>\nIs it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor that are cast out to thy\nhouse? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from\nthine own flesh?<br \/>\nThen shall the light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily:\nand thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward.<br \/>\nAnd if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light\nrise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day:<br \/>\nAnd the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy\nbones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail\nnot (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25186\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25186)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25186)\">Isa. 58:6-8,10-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a beautiful description of a day that we should follow once a month for the alleviation\nof suffering, for our own spiritual growth and development, and to carry out the purposes of\nthe Lord that there shall be no want, no suffering, but every attention given to those who are\nafflicted and in distress.\n<\/p><p>\nI was told the other day (I did not learn any more of the details) that a bishop invited some of\nthe members of his ward to a banquet, and as one man had his plate presented to him there\nwas on it a small piece of meat and a small piece of carrot. I do  not know what the man's\nimpressions were or what questions arose in his mind, but it was\nexplained to him that that represented the fast offering that he had been giving to the needy.\n[Laughter.] Now that was surely a very realistic way of pointing out his relation to the fast\noffering and his obligations. And it reminded me of a sobering statement that the Prophet\nJoseph Smith made at the funeral of James Adams in 1843, and refers back to the powerful\nstatement and announcement made by President McKay, that it is by doing the will of God\nthat we will attain salvation and accomplish his purpose, and in no other way.\n<\/p><p>\nIncidentally, as we build up false hopes on something else, there will be a time of terrible\nawakening. So the Prophet Joseph Smith declared:\n<\/p><p>\nIf men will acquire salvation they have got to be subject before they leave this\nworld to certain rules and principles which were fixed by an unalterable decree\nbefore the world was.\n<\/p><p>\nThe disappointment of hopes and of expectations at the resurrection will be\nindescribably dreadful (<i>DHC<\/i>, 6:50-51).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is for us to avoid that dreadful experience that he refers to and keep the commandments of\nGod and bring to pass the purposes of the Lord. It is not only that we do not obey the Lord\nas far as we personally are concerned, but it is a serious sin as well that we frustrate the\npurposes of God, at least for the moment; and a condition that he wishes to bring to pass\namong his people for the alleviation of suffering, for the comforting of the afflicted, and for\nthe strengthening of his Church, fails because we do not keep his commandments. That is a\nmost serious thing. It seems to me that we must take it into account. The first is, in a way,\npersonal, but the second is rejecting God and blocking his plans and his purposes, by which\nhe means to bless his people.\n<\/p><p>\nI think we may not and must not be casual or indifferent regarding this fast day which is so\ncommon among us. I am sure we are not giving it the thought that it deserves. Many people\nseem indifferent. But what a wonderful thing it would be if the stake presidencies and\nbishoprics of wards and presidents of branches, through the help of the Lord, could instruct\nthe people and inspire them all so that they would give in full to the Lord their free-will fast\noffering. What a strength and power it would be towards the bringing to pass of the purposes\nof God among his people and in the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the way to do that is simple, if the people would understand and accept this principle and\nobey it. I believe it hinges on the one fact, so far as I am concerned, that it is just as\nnecessary to pay an honest fast offering as it is to pay an honest tithing.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has told us how we shall pay our tithing and we are able to pay it properly and we\ncall it a full tithing. The Lord has told us what the fast offering shall be, that it shall be the\nequivalent of the food of which we did not partake.\n<\/p><p>\nGreat strength and power would come to us, so far as having means in the Church (and the\nLord says he wishes to \"have meat in his house\") to accomplish his purposes. Yesterday we\nwere advised that we are approaching a million and a half people. Let us consider a million\npeople and realize that if we paid a full and honest fast offering, joyfully and gladly before\nthe Lord, there would come into the hands of the servants of God each year, paid by a million\npeople, the value of twenty-four million meals. What a strength that would be to the great\nwelfare movement, what a spiritual blessing would come to all of the Church, for God\npromises great blessings, and what means would be in hand to bring about the alleviation of\nthe suffering and the needs of the people!\n<\/p><p>\nThis thing goes right to the heart of the gospel. The Lord found it necessary to charge ancient\nIsrael with robbery, that they had robbed him in their tithes and their offerings, and they were\nunder a curse, but he said,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the\nwindows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room\nenough to receive it (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32755\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32755)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32755)\">Mal. 3:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI wish to read some of his words, just a few short selections, to emphasize the need of\nobeying the law of the fast and giving offerings for the poor and afflicted. They affect our\nsalvation; they affect the forgiveness of our sins; they affect our souls\nbeing saved. We will not be saved, our prayers will not be answered, and the Lord will reject\nus as his disciples if we do not remember the poor and the afflicted.\n<\/p><p>\nThese are his words directly through his prophets:\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart\nnot his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy,\nhe shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13585\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13585)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13585)\">D&amp;C 104:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you&mdash;that is, for\nthe sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may walk\nguiltless before God&mdash;I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor,\nevery man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing\nthe naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and\ntemporally, according to their wants\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40280\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40280)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40280)\">Mosiah 4:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out\nin prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those\nwho are around you.<br \/>\nAnd now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this\nis all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the\nnaked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye\nhave, to those who stand in need&mdash;I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things,\nbehold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites\nwho do deny the faith (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8981\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8981)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8981)\">Alma 34:27-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, for your\nriches will canker your souls; and this shall be your lamentation in the day of\nvisitation, and of judgment, and of indignation: The harvest is past, the summer\nis ended, and my soul is not saved!
