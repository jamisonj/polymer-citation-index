The scriptures report: \u201cAnd he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind \u2026 , that he may know \u2026 how to succor his people according to their infirmities\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10280\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10280)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10280)\">Alma 7:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>). We want to come unto Christ because it is only in Him and through Him that we can return to the Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/come-unto-christ.p11\" class=\"\">A simple thing happened many years ago that I have always remembered because it caused me to think about the Savior\u2019s mission. Although it was just a childish incident, it has some meaning. It happened when our twins were only about five years old. They were just learning to ride their bicycles. As I glanced out the window, I saw them speeding down the street on their bikes going very fast! Perhaps they were going a little too fast for their level of ability, because all of a sudden Adam had a terrible crash! He was tangled up in the wreck, and all I could see was a twist of handlebars and tires and arms and legs. His little twin brother, Aaron, saw the whole thing happen, and immediately he skidded to a stop and jumped off his bike. He threw it down and ran to the aid of his brother, whom he loved very much. These little twins truly were of one heart. If one hurt, so did the other. If one got tickled, they both laughed. If one started a sentence, the other could complete it. What one felt, the other did also. So it was painful for Aaron to see Adam crash! Adam was a mess. He had skinned knees, he was bleeding from a head wound, his pride was damaged, and he was crying. In a fairly gentle, five-year-old way, Aaron helped his brother get untangled from the crash, he checked out the wounds, and then he did the dearest thing. He picked his brother up and carried him home. Or tried to. This wasn\u2019t very easy because they were the same size, but he tried. And as he struggled and lifted and half-dragged, half-carried his brother along, they finally reached the front porch. By this time, Adam, the injured one, was no longer crying, but Aaron, the rescuer, was. When asked, \u201cWhy are you crying, Aaron?\u201d he said simply, \u201cBecause Adam hurts.\u201d And so he had brought him home to help, home to someone who knew what to do, to someone who could cleanse the wounds, bind them up, and make it better\u2014home to love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/come-unto-christ.p12\" class=\"\">Just as one twin helped his brother in need, so might we all be lifted, helped, even carried at times by our beloved Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He feels what we feel; He knows our heart. It was His mission to wipe away our tears, cleanse our wounds, and bless us with His healing power. He can carry us home to our Heavenly Father with the strength of His matchless love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/come-unto-christ.p13\" class=\"\">Surely it pleases the Lord when we, His children, reach out to one another, to give help along the way, and to bring another closer to Christ.

They pray in the face of temptation. They read the scriptures.

He writes:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/come-unto-christ.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cThe young women [of my ward] very literally saved my life. I was a young bishop, just 29, the father of four beautiful little girls, including a small baby, when Heavenly Father called my wife home to Him. As I met with each of our little girls and asked them what impact this change would mean to them, the concerns of six-year-old Emily, the oldest of the four, were many, including, \u2018Who is going to comb and curl my hair for church and put ribbons and clips in it?\u2019 That was a good question to me as well. Who? I was consumed with the idea that life would be as \u2018normal\u2019 as possible for all of us\u2014which meant that I would have to learn a whole new way of life. I was their father, and I was going to be <span class=\"emphasis\">the<\/span> only parent. I realized that I was not equipped with the motherly skills that I needed. I called upon the young women of the ward to train me to be able to satisfy at least the needs of hair care. They came to my home, numerous times, to begin my training. They even showed me how to care for my six-month-old Natalie as far as washing her hair without so much trauma. By the time I \u2018graduated,\u2019 I could whip up a mean (but simple) hairdo. Much more than the skill\u2014those young women gave me confidence as a father of daughters\u2014that I could love them, care for them, be there for them, no matter how the rest of my life continued.\u201d Thank you, Brother Michael Marston, for your tender letter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/come-unto-christ.p32\" class=\"\">I pray that parents of precious young women all over the world will be ever thankful for the stewardship they have to guide their daughters with love.
