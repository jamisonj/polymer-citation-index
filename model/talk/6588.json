You are preparing yourselves to be future fathers and priesthood leaders of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/fulfilling-our-duty-to-god.p53\" class=\"\">It is so important that all of us understand that we live in the last dispensation of the fulness of time\u2014that we are preparing for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ and that the adversary in these last days will be able to loose more evils upon the world. Our prayers are that all the youth of the Church will have the strength to withstand the fiery darts of the adversary and that we as parents and priesthood leaders\u2014yes, we as the shepherds\u2014can help our children remain true and faithful to the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/fulfilling-our-duty-to-god.p54\" class=\"\">I testify to the truthfulness of this work and the restoration of the priesthood in these latter days. I promise you that you will be blessed for your faithfulness and declare with the prophet Alma, \u201cI have said these things unto you that I might awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that ye may walk blameless before him, that ye may walk after the holy order of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8610\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8610)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8610)\">Alma 7:22<\/a><\/span>). That each Aaronic Priesthood holder will fulfill his duty to God and return with honor to his Heavenly Father is my prayer.
