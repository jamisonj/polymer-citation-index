Their words have been inspiring.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/rise-to-the-stature-of-the-divine-within-you.p5\" class=\"\">I speak by assignment from President Benson.

Without any official assignment, I attended a stake conference in a rural area of southeastern Utah. The stake president and his wife had invited Sister Hinckley and me to stay at their home. While he conducted his Saturday afternoon meeting, we rode about the stake, visiting a half-dozen little towns, in each of which there is a Church meetinghouse. We noted that the lawns were green and the buildings nicely kept, although they are small and some of them are old. We drove about and looked at the homes, modest in their appearance, but in almost every case there was neatness and beauty with flowers in bloom. Having a free Saturday and Sunday, I had wanted to make this trip simply to thank the people for their faith and faithfulness and to express my love to them. Most of them are farm folk who work hard for a small return. But they know a great truth. They know the law of the harvest\u2014\u201cWhatsoever ye sow, that shall ye also reap.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18933\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18933)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18933)\">D&amp;C 6:33<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/rise-to-the-stature-of-the-divine-within-you.p7\" class=\"\">They know that you do not reap wheat after sowing oats. They know that you do not get a racehorse from a scrub mare. They know that if you are to build another great generation, you must work with vision and faith. You must dream and plan, serve and sacrifice, pray and labor. After being with these wonderful people for two days, Sister Hinckley observed, \u201cThese are the kind who constitute the glue that holds the Church together.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/rise-to-the-stature-of-the-divine-within-you.p8\" class=\"\">The home where we stayed was not pretentious, but it was comfortable and clean and delightful. The husband, I believe, did not have a large income, but he knew how to spend it wisely, first paying his tithes and offerings and setting aside some in savings. His wife is a beautiful woman, the mother of six sons and one daughter. You need not look far to know that in that home there is love and respect one for another. There is appreciation and gratitude. Through the years they have known adversity\u2014lean times and death-threatening sickness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/rise-to-the-stature-of-the-divine-within-you.p9\" class=\"\">I repeat\u2014I went among these people to express my gratitude and love. I felt a great overwhelming measure of love in return. Here in this stake of small rural wards, among people who made no pretense of sophistication, I found strength and faith and virtue. I found men whose hands were gnarled and whose skin was wrinkled with the sun\u2019s heat of many summers\u2014men in whose hearts there was a great capacity for love\u2014love for the land and the sky above it, love for their wives and children, love for the Church and its eternal purposes, love for God and the Savior of all mankind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/rise-to-the-stature-of-the-divine-within-you.p10\" class=\"\">I looked into the eyes of beautiful women\u2014women of virtue and strength and capacity, older women who knew much of struggle and disappointment and pain, young women who knew much of purpose and goodness and art and learning. I looked into the eyes of children\u2014beautiful and innocent and wonderful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/rise-to-the-stature-of-the-divine-within-you.p11\" class=\"\">I do not wish to imply that I could not find such in cities and towns all over the world. Such people are to be found everywhere, but somehow there seemed so much larger a percentage of them among the folks whom we visited. Their feet were planted on the solid earth. They knew the meaning of work without respect to hours or season.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/rise-to-the-stature-of-the-divine-within-you.p12\" class=\"\">I also wanted to visit among them because I have met their sons and daughters in the mission field in many lands. These have been effective missionaries because they have learned to get up in the morning and get their chores done. They have been dedicated missionaries because when they were very young they learned to pray at their mothers\u2019 knees and heard their fathers bear testimony of the truth of this great latter-day work. Not only have these sons and daughters gone on missions, but by dint of great sacrifice they have gone away to school and won places of honor across the nation as they serve in business and the professions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/rise-to-the-stature-of-the-divine-within-you.p13\" class=\"\">I had taken a briefcase filled with papers to read on the long ride to and from. Among those papers were three letters sent to the headquarters of the Church from women in other areas. They spoke of things different from what I had noticed on my visit\u2014they spoke of heartache and heartbreak; of abusive, egotistical, demanding husbands; of unthankful children whose earlier lives had been marred by abuse; of a hunger for love and attention and opportunity to express their talents.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/rise-to-the-stature-of-the-divine-within-you.p14\" class=\"\">My heart reaches out to the writers of these letters, and to many others who by the circumstances in which they find themselves feel oppressed and smothered\u2014all but destroyed. I regret that there are some men who are egotistical and evil, who are insensitive and even brutal. They are to be both condemned and pitied. I believe that any man who offends a daughter of God will someday be held accountable, and the time will come when he will stand before the bar of judgment with sorrow and remorse. But this is material for another talk, and that to the men of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/rise-to-the-stature-of-the-divine-within-you.p15\" class=\"\">To you women, I wish to issue a challenge tonight.

There is much of worth on television. I am the first to recognize this. But I am also mindful of the tremendous waste of time indulged in by many, and particularly by those who spend hours watching titillating trash. How marvelous a thing is a good book! How stimulating to read and share with a great writer thoughts that build and strengthen and broaden one\u2019s horizon! You may think you are too busy. Ten or fifteen minutes a day with the scriptures, and particularly with the Book of Mormon, can give you marvelous understanding of the great eternal truths which have been preserved by the power of the Almighty for the blessing of His children.

A happy marriage is the aim of every young woman. I know that some will be denied this opportunity. I urge you not to spend your time in self-pity. Rather, keep yourselves alive and vivacious in those activities which will bring satisfaction into your lives while associating with others who are vigorously pursuing lofty objectives. Remember always that you are not alone. There are thousands like you. And you are not helpless, a victim of fate. You can in large measure master your fate and strengthen your self-worth in reaching out to those who need and will appreciate your talents, your contributions, your help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/rise-to-the-stature-of-the-divine-within-you.p31\" class=\"\">To those of you who are married, make of your marriage a partnership.

But who can doubt that we and the generations who follow will be the better protected because of the efforts of this woman, trained in her field and bold in her declaration, whose book changed the attitude of millions upon millions in all parts of the globe?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/rise-to-the-stature-of-the-divine-within-you.p46\" class=\"\">In the pioneering days of this church when men grubbed the sagebrush and broke the sod so that crops might be planted to sustain life, many a wife and mother planted a few flowers and a few fruit trees to add beauty and taste to the drabness of pioneer life. There are so many things that you can do. Beauty is a thing divine. The cultivation of it becomes an expression of the divine nature within you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/rise-to-the-stature-of-the-divine-within-you.p47\" class=\"\">Yes, there are adversities to be overcome, not a few of them. There are trials to be endured. There is much of evil in the world and too much of harshness, even in the home. Do what you can to rise above all of this. Stand up. Speak out against evil and brutality. Safeguard against abuse. Keep out of your homes the filthiness of the world, which can lead to such abuse. Rise up in the stature of your divine inheritance. God bless you, you wonderful girls, you strong and able young women, you older women of faith and integrity, you mothers in Zion, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
