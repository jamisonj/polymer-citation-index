The Book of Mormon is the scriptural record of the sojourn of these people on the ancient American continent. It contains the prophetic writings and revelations given to these people. Included in these divine communications are many prophecies of the Savior\u2019s birth, His ministry, and His great atoning sacrifice. They describe His ultimate Crucifixion and Resurrection and foretell of His coming to that ancient American civilization. We read in the Book of Mormon that after His Resurrection and soon after His Ascension into heaven, Jesus Christ did truly manifest Himself unto them.
