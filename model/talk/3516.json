Anticipating Sunday dinner was one of them.

He would present to me the clean plate from the previous Sunday and offer me a dime as pay for my services. My answer was always the same: \u201cI can\u2019t accept the money. My mother would tan my hide.\u201d He would then run his wrinkled hand through my blond hair and say, \u201cMy boy, you have a wonderful mother.

He was a widower in his eighties when the house in which he was living was to be demolished. I heard him tell my grandfather his plight as the three of us sat on the old front porch swing. With a plaintive voice, he said to grandfather, \u201cMr. Condie, I don\u2019t know what to do. I have no family. I have no place to go. I have no money.\u201d I wondered how grandfather would answer. Slowly grandfather reached into his pocket and took from it that old leather purse from which, in response to my hounding, he had produced many a penny or nickel for a special treat. This time he removed a key and handed it to Old Bob. Tenderly he said, \u201cBob, here is the key to that house I own next door. Take it. Move in your things. Stay as long as you like. There will be no rent to pay and nobody will ever put you out again.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/the-long-line-of-the-lonely.p25\" class=\"\">Tears welled up in the eyes of Old Bob, coursed down his cheeks, then disappeared in his long, white beard.

Then came the blow that the house she rented was to be sold. What was she to do? Where would she go?
