Elder Ballard has pulled together some figures concerning those 12 years. I quote from his statement:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<ul class=\"bullet\"><li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>387,750 missionaries have entered the mission field, which represents almost 40 percent of the missionaries who have ever served in this dispensation\u2014that is, 40 percent in the 12 most recent years of the 177 years since the Church was organized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>3,400,000 converts have been baptized, which is the equivalent of over one-fourth of the total current membership of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The total number of missions in the Church has increased from 303 to 344, with three more to be added soon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Retention as measured by sacrament meeting attendance, priesthood ordinations, and tithing faithfulness has increased significantly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ul><p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/i-am-clean.p11\" class=\"\">Now, while all of this has been tremendously significant, I am convinced that with a little more dedication this wonderful recent past can be but prologue to a greater future.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/i-am-clean.p12\" class=\"\">Let us all put our shoulders to the wheel and push along, do our duty with a heart full of song.

I spoke of this same thing many years ago. I repeat it because those who heard it then have long since forgotten, and those who did not hear it need to hear it. It concerns President Joseph F. Smith, who served as President of the Church from 1901 to 1918, altogether 17 years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/i-am-clean.p14\" class=\"\">Joseph F. Smith was the son of Hyrum Smith, who was the brother of the Prophet Joseph and was martyred with him in Carthage. Joseph F. was born at Far West, Missouri, on November 13, 1838. He came out of Missouri as an infant. As a lad not yet six years of age, he heard a knock on the window of his mother\u2019s home in Nauvoo. It was a man who had hurriedly ridden from Carthage and who told Sister Smith that her husband had been killed that afternoon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/i-am-clean.p15\" class=\"\">When he was 9, he drove an ox team with his mother across the plains to this valley. At the age of 15 he was called on a mission to Hawaii. He made his way to San Francisco and there worked in a shingle mill to earn enough money to buy passage to the islands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/i-am-clean.p16\" class=\"\">Hawaii was not a tourist center then. It was populated by the native Hawaiians, who were, for the most part, poor but generous with what they had. He learned to speak their language and to love them. While serving there he experienced a remarkable dream. I quote from his narrative concerning this. Said he:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/i-am-clean.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cI was very much oppressed [when I was] on a mission. I was almost naked and entirely friendless, except [for] the friendship of a poor, benighted \u2026 people. I felt as if I was so debased in my condition of poverty, lack of intelligence and knowledge, just a boy, that I hardly dared look a \u2026 man in the face.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/i-am-clean.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cWhile in that condition I dreamed [one night] that I was on a journey, and I was impressed that I ought to hurry\u2014hurry with all my might, for fear I might be too late. I rushed on my way as fast as I possibly could, and I was only conscious of having just a little bundle, a handkerchief with a small bundle wrapped in it. I did not realize \u2026 what it was, when I was hurrying as fast as I could; but finally I came to a wonderful mansion. \u2026 I thought I knew that was my destination. As I passed towards it, as fast as I could, I saw a notice [which read <span class=\"emphasis\">B-A-T-H<\/span>], \u2018Bath.\u2019 I turned aside quickly and went into the bath and washed myself clean. I opened up this little bundle that I had, and there was [some] white, clean [clothing], a thing I had not seen for a long time, because the people I was with did not think very much of making things exceedingly clean. But my [clothing was] clean, and I put [it] on. Then I rushed to what appeared to be a great opening, or door. I knocked and the door opened, and the man who stood there was the Prophet Joseph Smith. He looked at me a little reprovingly, and the first words he said: \u2018Joseph, you are late.\u2019 Yet I took confidence and [replied]:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/i-am-clean.p19\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018Yes, but I am clean\u2014I am clean!\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/i-am-clean.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cHe clasped my hand and drew me in, then closed the great door. I felt his hand just as tangible as I ever felt the hand of man. I knew him, and when I entered I saw my father, and Brigham [Young] and Heber [C. Kimball], and Willard [Richards], and other good men that I had known, standing in a row. I looked as if it were across this valley, and it seemed to be filled with a vast multitude of people, but on the stage were all the people that I had known. My mother was there, and she sat with a child in her lap; and I could name over as many as I remember of their names, who sat there, who seemed to be among the chosen, among the exalted. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/i-am-clean.p21\" class=\"\">\u201c[When I had this dream,] I was alone on a mat, away up in the mountains of Hawaii\u2014no one was with me. But in this vision I pressed my hand up against the Prophet, and I saw a smile cross his countenance. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/i-am-clean.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen I awoke that morning I was a man, although only [still] a boy. There was not anything in the world that I feared [after that]. I could meet any man or woman or child and look them in the face, feeling in my soul that I was a man every whit. That vision, that manifestation and witness that I enjoyed at that time has made me what I am, if I am anything that is good, or clean, or upright before the Lord, if there is anything good in me. That has helped me out in every trial and through every difficulty\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Doctrine,<\/span> 5th ed. [1939], 542\u201343).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/i-am-clean.p23\" class=\"\">The core of that meaningful dream is found in the reproof given by Joseph Smith to young Joseph F.

His declaration \u201cI am clean\u201d gave him self-assurance and courage in facing anyone or any situation. He received the strength that comes from a clear conscience fortified by the approbation of the Prophet Joseph.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/i-am-clean.p26\" class=\"\">This prophetic dream holds something for every man and boy assembled in this vast congregation tonight.

Suffice it to say it is totally unbecoming you as one who holds the priesthood of God. You are His chosen servant; you have been ordained to something holy and wonderful.
