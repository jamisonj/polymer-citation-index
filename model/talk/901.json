It is complete.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>General Priesthood Conference, April 6, 1957<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nSalt Lake Tabernacle                           7,291<br \/>\nAssembly Hall, Barratt Hall, and Grounds       3,294<br \/>\n94 Groups reporting in                        26,595<br \/>\nTotal tonight                                 37,180<br \/>\n<\/p><p>\nThat is the largest attendance in the history of the Church!\n<\/p><p>\nWe do not favor taking photographs in our meetings, but I do wish that we could get a\npicture of this assembly tonight. All who can see it as we from the rostrum will never forget\nit. If anybody have his flashlight camera, he may take a picture, so we may have it enlarged.\n<\/p><p>\nI think this is wonderful, it is glorious! What a power assembled tonight in 97 groups, men of\nthe Priesthood&mdash;men of God! We just feel in our hearts to say, \"O Father,\" as Christ pleaded\nwith Him, \"keep us one as thou, Father, and thy Son are one\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27743\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27743)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27743)\">John 17:22<\/a><\/span>).\nNothing can stay the progress\nof the kingdom of God as long as this mighty army of Priesthood will keep united.\n<\/p><p>\nWe heard tonight from two released missionaries&mdash;presidents from missions. They represented\nall mission presidents tonight, first, in their ready response to the call that came to them&mdash;one\na prominent businessman, another a professional man, and their wives with them. So have all\nother mission presidents. I happen to know some of the sacrifices that their sweet wives have\nmade in the missions represented. So the other mission presidents' wives make these\nsacrifices. Do they complain? No. They rejoice in the opportunity. Other mission presidents\ncould tell us of interesting items just as Brother Romney and Brother Coombs gave us\ntonight.\n<\/p><p>\nThe world does not realize what this missionary work in the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints entails, and what a mighty contribution the members of the Priesthood are\nmaking to make it a success. I, too, wish that all had heard that program last evening. One\nthing they realized was that one of the influential factors in missionary work is personal\ncontact, that is one of the most potent, most effective.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so it is in the field of activity to which I wish to refer in a few words&mdash;our ward\nteaching.\n<\/p><p>\nEspecially during the last year, I have been impressed with the realization that we are not\nreaching those whom the Lord would like us to reach. Now, the ward teachers are doing an\nexcellent work. They visit homes regularly. They have their lessons prepared. And they make\ntheir report.\n<\/p><p>\nStatistics show that the ward teaching is in good shape. So what I say is not reflecting upon\nthe effort that is made by this group of Priesthood. But tell me, fellow workers, are we doing\nall that is implied by the Lord's statement that it is the ward teacher's duty to watch over the\nChurch always?\n<\/p><p>\nA man who knows about the ills that befall our Government because of criminals wrote\nrecently&mdash;I refer to F.B.I. Director J. Edgar Hoover&mdash;about the responsibility of parents. He\nsaid:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Criminals are not born with a stamp of criminality affixed to them. They are created by the\nforces and influences surrounding them. Certainly parental influence is a vital element in\ndetermining the direction in which a child will go. The parent who fails his duty by\nneglecting to provide moral training and essential consistent discipline in the home should be\naccountable for the delinquencies which emanate from that neglect. I firmly believe that the\ntide of juvenile crime could be stemmed if neglectful parents were made to face legal and\nfinancial responsibility for the criminal acts of their children.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I am convinced that parental incompetency, parental indifference are at the root of the vast\nmajority of youthful behavior problems.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Back of the majority of cases of juvenile delinquency lies, in some form\nor another, the abdication of parental responsibility; broken homes; lack of parental\nsupervision; over-protective parents, drunken parents; over-indulgent mother; overly strict\nfather; parent works nights; poor home conditions; parental neglect; lack of religious training;\nno discipline; depraved home environment. Nothing is sadder, in my opinion, than those cases\nin which children lack nothing in material things, and yet parental irresponsibility destroys\ntheir potential development as good citizens.\" (Published in \"The Rotarian,\" October, 1956.)\n<\/p><p>\nOne cause of delinquency he names is broken homes. I appreciate the statistics sent me every\nmonth by the Salt Lake County Sheriff and his associates. I brought two here tonight\nregarding broken homes.\n<\/p><p>\nIn November, 1956, 96 criminals were fingerprinted; 4 women among them; 23 repeaters. In\nDecember, 1956, there were 95 fingerprinted; 6 women; 22 repeaters. In November, among\nthose 96, 60 were from broken homes; 24, in which the father was dead; 12, the mother was\ndead; 22, both dead; and 2 were divorced. Among the 95 in December, 1956, 56 broken\nhomes. Note, it is over half of the people, half of the criminals. Father was dead in 16 of the\nhomes; mother was dead in 10; and in 25, both were dead.\n<\/p><p>\nWell there are other statistics, but I do not have time to refer to them.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, it is the duty of the ward teacher to watch over the Church always, to be with and to\nstrengthen (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13545\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13545)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13545)\">D&amp;C 20:53<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI wish we could see tonight how many of those 60 who came from broken homes were on the\nlist of the ward teacher; how many of those 56 offenders last December from broken homes\nwere listed by the ward teacher. Do not go away with the idea that they are not members of\nthe Church. The Sheriff's report gives the number of deacons, the number of teachers, the\nnumber of priests, and the number of elders among those who were fingerprinted. As it is the\nduty of the teacher to \"watch over the Church always\" every one of the children from these\nbroken homes (members of the Church) should be on the ward teachers' list.\n<\/p><p>\nI have a case in mind that will illustrate:\n<\/p><p>\nA mother died and left a large family, none of whom were married, and a little baby boy. The\nfather was quite indifferent. He had been born in the Church. We all felt sorry when his wife\ndied and left him with a large family. The oldest girl took care of that family wonderfully\nwell. They are all in the Church. But the young boy grew up and did not attend his school\nuntil winter came, and then he left it as soon as spring opened up. He liked to ride horses and\nhe could ride the bucking horse. He learned to shoot. Early in his teens he went out to herd\nsheep, and he made money. But when he came back, he did not go to Sunday School, he did\nnot go to M.I.A. His interest was in activity&mdash;a life of activity.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, I will not go through the whole story. He was skillful in herding, riding, shooting, and\nthe outdoor life.\n<\/p><p>\nI have referred several times to that rhyme given by the Presiding Bishopric to the Aaronic\nQuorums about the boy who stood alone . . .\n<\/p><p>\nThe boy stood at the crossroads all alone,<br \/>\nThe sunlight in his face.<br \/>\nHe had no thought for the world unknown,<br \/>\nHe was set for a manly race.<br \/>\nBut the roads stretched east and the roads stretched west,<br \/>\nAnd the lad knew not which road was best.<br \/>\nSo he chose the road that led him down,<br \/>\nAnd he lost the race and the victor's crown.<br \/>\nHe was caught at last in an angry snare,<br \/>\nBecause no one stood at the crossroads there<br \/>\nTo show him the better road.\n<\/p><p>\nThat is just what this boy did. While still in his teens, he entered a grocery store, bought\nsomething, paid with a bill, $10 or $20, and a dispute arose about the change. The\nmerchantman attempted to throw him out. The young boy had his sixshooter and was caught\n\"at last in an angry snare.\"\n<\/p><p>\nPersonally, I made inquiry, when that boy went to the penitentiary, as to\nwhether the Sunday School teacher had ever visited him. No. Nor had the Mutual\nworker nor the ward teacher. I do not know that they could have won him. I think they could\nhave. Personal contact would have won that boy.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is the teacher's duty to watch over the Church always\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13546\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13546)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13546)\">D&amp;C 20:53<\/a><\/span>).\nThat boy's name should have been on some teacher's list.\n<\/p><p>\nSo it is with these 60 people&mdash;let us say there are only 30&mdash;half of these who were\nfingerprinted belong to us&mdash;thirty last November, were from broken homes.\n<\/p><p>\nWard teachers, when you go home tonight, make a complete list of all those in your district,\nevery boy, every girl. You may not go to a broken home, you may not find them there. Find\nout where they are and reach them. God bless you, and bless us all as we watch over the\nChurch always.\n<\/p><p>\nFor first, Priesthood means service; it is not given just as an honor. I congratulate you and\ncommend you that you are worthy to receive it, but it is given to you for service, and you act\nas an authorized representative of our Lord Jesus Christ in whatever position you may be\nassigned.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you that you may serve worthily, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
