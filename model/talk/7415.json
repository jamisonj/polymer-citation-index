I am reminded of the words of the hymn: \u201cBehold! A royal army, with banner, sword, and shield, is marching forth to conquer on life\u2019s great battlefield.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-00605_000_021\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cBehold! A Royal Army,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns, <\/span>no. 251.]<\/span><\/sup> Indeed, you are the royal army of God, faithful and true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision.p6\" class=\"\">Tonight I wish to speak to the youngest members of this royal army\u2014the Aaronic Priesthood: deacons, teachers, and priests venturing forth upon the battlefield of life. Although you do not remember it, you enlisted in this cause with a single decision, made long ago in our premortal existence. There, in the Grand Council in Heaven, you decided to obey the will of your Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. Remember this: you are a son of God who decided to follow the Savior when it mattered most, and that makes you a great man indeed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision.p7\" class=\"\">Because of that divine decision which determined your eternal progression, you received a physical body, gained the agency to choose good over evil, and are now growing and preparing to take upon yourselves the attributes of our Savior. You have been baptized and have received the Holy Ghost. You are learning who you are, why you are here, and where you are going. And now you have received the Aaronic Priesthood!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision.p8\" class=\"\">The Aaronic Priesthood is the preparatory priesthood, given for this preparatory time in your life. <span class=\"emphasis\">How<\/span> you bear that priesthood now will <span class=\"emphasis\">prepare<\/span> you to make the most important decisions in the future. These decisions include receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood, going to the temple, serving a mission, getting an education, selecting an occupation, and choosing a companion and being sealed for time and for all eternity in the holy temple. There is a time and season for all of our decisions. Make sure you make decisions in the proper time and season. All of these life-altering decisions will be made in a very busy, relatively short period during your 20s\u2014during what I call the \u201cDecade of Decision.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision.p9\" class=\"\">While training to be a jet fighter pilot, I prepared to make such vital decisions in a flight simulator. For example, I practiced deciding when to bail out of an airplane if the fire warning light came on and I began to spin out of control. I remember one dear friend who didn\u2019t make these preparations. He would find a way out of simulator training and then go to play golf or swim. He never learned his emergency procedures! A few months later, fire erupted in his plane, and it spun toward the ground in flames. Noting the fire warning light, his younger companion, having developed a preconditioned response, knew when to bail out of the plane and parachuted to safety. But my friend who had not prepared to make that decision stayed with the plane and died in the crash.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision.p10\" class=\"\">In the decade ahead, your time for preparation will be limited. As you are Aaronic Priesthood bearers, it is important that you prepare now. You must develop your own preconditioned responses for the important decisions you will make in the next decade of your life. You must know what to do and when to do it when each decision presents itself. Remember that making no decision at all could be just as deadly as making the wrong decision. Many of the decisions you make or don\u2019t make will have eternal consequences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision.p11\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Now is the time<\/span> to become a disciple of Jesus Christ, which means accepting His invitation to \u201ccome, follow me.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-00605_000_021\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50169\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50169)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50169)\">Luke 18:22<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> This is the decision we made in our premortal lives. Now we must make it again here in mortality, every day, in every situation by taking the Savior\u2019s name upon us, remembering His atoning sacrifice, and keeping His commandments. This we covenanted to do when we were baptized, and we have the opportunity to renew those covenants each week as we partake of the sacrament.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision.p12\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Now is the time<\/span> to organize and prepare ourselves to have the Holy Ghost as our constant companion. This means doing what your parents and leaders have taught you to do\u2014study the scriptures; pray morning and night; keep a neat, well-groomed appearance; follow a schedule; set and achieve goals; be honest in your dealings; keep commitments; and be worthy of the priesthood you bear. Always, always live the standards, revealed by prophets, in the booklet <span class=\"emphasis\">For the Strength of Youth.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision.p13\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Now is the time<\/span> to decide who your friends are and to become worthy of a righteous eternal companion. It is very simple, brethren. As my mother taught me, \u201cBirds of a feather flock together.\u201d Your peer group can inspire you to do great things or tempt you into strange and miserable paths. True friends make it easier to live the gospel. They never make us choose between their ways and the Lord\u2019s ways. They help us be the kind of person that attracts other true friends. And they help us <span class=\"emphasis\">become<\/span> the kind of person a righteous companion can choose to be with forever. If you want those kinds of friends, ask yourself: \u201cAm I that kind of friend to others? Am I the kind of person I want my eternal companion to be?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision.p14\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Now is the time<\/span> to prepare for your mission. Depending upon your individual circumstance, you may be able to serve a full-time proselyting mission. While this is important, remember that even more important is going to the temple <span class=\"emphasis\">on the way<\/span> to your mission. A mission is a priceless opportunity to keep temple covenants by living the law of consecration\u2014giving all of your time, gifts, and talents to the Lord and serving Him with all your heart, might, mind, and strength. I have always felt that the two years you serve will be a tithing of time on the first 20 years of your life. But even if you are not able to serve a full-time mission, you can prepare for one day in the future, when the time is right, to go to the temple to make sacred covenants so that you can receive your eternal blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision.p15\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Now is the time<\/span> to prepare for training, education, and an occupation.

In the premortal existence, ours was not a selective obedience. We did not pick and choose which parts of the eternal plan to follow. I learned that lesson on our first night flying solo in pilot training when all of us were given the instruction: \u201cDon\u2019t fly acrobatic patterns at night. You are beginning pilots without instrument flight training.\u201d Some time later, an otherwise good pilot and a great friend chose to disobey that command. As he flew loops and barrel rolls through the night sky over Texas, he looked through the cockpit canopy and thought he saw stars above him, but he was really seeing the lights of oil rigs below. He was experiencing vertigo: the g-forces on his plane made it seem he was right side up, yet he was upside down. As he pulled up on the stick to climb higher into the night sky, he dove toward the earth and crashed into the twinkling lights of the oil field below.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision.p17\" class=\"\">When you are flying an airplane, if you change your position by just one degree at a time, your inner ear cannot detect the change. Brethren young and old, when we practice selective obedience, we change our position relative to the Lord\u2014and usually by only one degree at a time. As the deceptive forces of the adversary work on us, we cannot detect them, and we experience spiritual vertigo. While it may <span class=\"emphasis\">seem<\/span> like we are going in a safe direction, we are in fact headed for disaster. In the preexistence, our decision to follow the Lord was all-or-nothing. Following that pattern through our mortal probation will get each of us back to our Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision.p18\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Now is the time<\/span> to use our time properly. \u201cThis life is the time for men to prepare to meet God.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-00605_000_021\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50302\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50302)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50302)\">Alma 34:32<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> I testify that your time on earth will be sufficient if you learn to use it wisely in your youth. \u201cO, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-00605_000_021\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50309\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50309)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50309)\">Alma 37:35<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision.p19\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Now is the time<\/span> to safeguard your birthright.

But in his blessing to Reuben, his father said, \u201cThou art \u2026 unstable as water, thou shalt not excel.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-00605_000_021\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50105\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50105)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50105)\">Genesis 49:3\u20134<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Think for a moment about what the phrase <span class=\"emphasis\">unstable as water<\/span> means.
