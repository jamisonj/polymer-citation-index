There is built upon Him a strong foundation of apostles and prophets and above this \u201call the building fitly framed together\u201d to constitute The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21556\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21556)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21556)\">Eph. 2:21<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p7\" class=\"\">As I reminded the group at the cornerstone this morning, let this symbol be recognized as representing the Redeemer of the world, the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, whose name this Church carries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p8\" class=\"\">I am so grateful that this building is now complete.

It is now declared complete with a permanent occupancy permit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p9\" class=\"\">This millennial year of 2000 has been a remarkable year for the Church. We have expanded on every front across the world. We have passed the 11 million membership mark. What a significant thing that is.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p10\" class=\"\">I was around in 1947 when the Church celebrated the centennial of the arrival of the pioneers. At that time, the This Is the Place Monument was dedicated. A great celebration was held with a pageant in the Tabernacle representing the worldwide mission of the Church. The grand theme running through all of this was that the Church had reached a million members in its growth. Approximately one-half of them lived in Utah. Now only about 15 percent live here, and yet we have more members here than we have ever had. To think that today we have a membership of 11 million is a tremendous and wonderful thing that brings with it the promise of the future.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p11\" class=\"\">We have reached out across the world, wherever we are permitted to go. We have taught the gospel as revealed in this dispensation of the fulness of times. We are now going into areas whose names were seldom heard back in 1947. Our missionary work has expanded in a miraculous manner.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p12\" class=\"\">I think I have been in most of the places where the Church is organized. I have found wonderful people everywhere. They are Latter-day Saints in the truest sense of the word. They are seeking to live the commandments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p13\" class=\"\">As I have met with them and talked with them, I have learned the real meaning of the words of Paul:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd [God] hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cThat they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cFor in him we live, and move, and have our being; \u2026 For we are also his offspring\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7471\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7471)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7471)\">Acts 17:26\u201328<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p17\" class=\"\">We have become a great cosmopolitan society, a vast family of brothers and sisters in the Lord.

It is touching for good the lives of students across the world. In the institutes young college-aged students find happy association, they find learning, social experience, and even husbands and wives within the faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p25\" class=\"\">In the past few months we have announced that Ricks College, a great pioneer educational institution, hitherto providing a two-year degree, will be expanded to provide four years of education and will carry the name BYU\u2014Idaho. This in no way disparages the name of the great man for whom the school was named. This will enlarge the educational opportunities for many young men and women. It will make of what has been a great school an even greater one. It is an effort on the part of the Church to extend the opportunity of secular education within the framework of a Church school, where is taught faith in the Living God and in His divine Son, our Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p26\" class=\"\">Another item of remarkable consequence, emphasized in this millennial year, is the building of temples. It has been a miracle. Last Sunday we dedicated in Boston, Massachusetts, the 100th working temple of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p27\" class=\"\">I came into the First Presidency in July of 1981 as a counselor to President Kimball. Since that time, 81 of these 100 temples have been dedicated. Only 19 were operating before then.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p28\" class=\"\">Fifty-three new temples, more than half of the 100 now in operation, have been dedicated since I was ordained President of the Church five years ago. I mention this only to remind you of the acceleration of this dramatic expansion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p29\" class=\"\">When I announced in conference that I hoped we would see the dedication of the 100th operating temple before the end of the year 2000, I wondered if it were possible. I cannot say enough of thanks to the many men and women who have worked so long and so hard to bring this miracle to pass. Some of these new temples are smaller. But every ordinance that can be performed in the Salt Lake Temple, the largest in the Church, can be performed in these smaller temples. They are devoted exclusively to ordinance work. They are beautiful structures, well built in every respect. And they have made possible a much easier journey to the house of the Lord for thousands upon thousands of our people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p30\" class=\"\">We shall go on building them. We will dedicate three more before the end of the year. We will continue to build in the future, perhaps not at the scale we have worked on during the past year, but there will be a steady construction of these sacred houses to accommodate the needs of the people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p31\" class=\"\">How deeply grateful are our people. I hope and believe that the Lord is pleased.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p32\" class=\"\">And now today, as another significant accomplishment of this millennial year, we dedicate this great Conference Center. It is a unique and remarkable building. When it was first envisioned and planned, we were not concerned with building the largest house of worship to be found anywhere. We were concerned with a plan to accommodate the needs of our people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p33\" class=\"\">The Tabernacle, which has served us so well for more than a century, simply became inadequate for our needs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p34\" class=\"\">It was a great and serious thing to undertake the building of this structure. We were, of course, aware of all of the electronic means for carrying far and wide the message spoken from the pulpit. However, we were also aware of the desire of so very many to sit in the same hall with the speaker, as evidenced this morning. As I said when announcing the decision to move forward: \u201cThe building of this structure has been a bold undertaking. We worried about it. \u2026 We listened for the whisperings of the Spirit [as we prayed about] it. And only when we felt the confirming voice of the Lord did we determine to go forward\u201d (\u201cTo All the World in Testimony,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign, <\/span>May 2000, 4\u20135).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p35\" class=\"\">Announcement of our decision was made in the April 1996 general conference. I said on that occasion:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p36\" class=\"\">\u201cI regret that many who wish to meet with us in the Tabernacle this morning are unable to get in. There are very many out on the grounds. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p37\" class=\"\">\u201cMy heart reaches out to those who wish[ed] to get in and could not be accommodated. About a year ago I suggested to the Brethren that perhaps the time has come when we should study the feasibility of constructing another dedicated house of worship on a much larger scale that would accommodate three or four times the number who can be seated in this building\u201d (\u201cThis Glorious Easter Morn,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign, <\/span>May 1996, 65).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p38\" class=\"\">It was a little more than a year later when ground was broken. This occurred on the 24th of July, 1997, the 150th anniversary of the arrival of our forebears in this valley.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p39\" class=\"\">At the conclusion of the groundbreaking services, President Packer offered the benediction. In that prayer, he asked the Lord that He might preserve my life to be present for the dedication of the new building. I am grateful for the evident answer to that request.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p40\" class=\"\">Today we shall dedicate it as a house in which to worship God the Eternal Father and His Only Begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. We hope and we pray that there will continue to go forth to the world from this pulpit declarations of testimony and doctrine, of faith in the Living God, and of gratitude for the great atoning sacrifice of our Redeemer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p41\" class=\"\">We will also dedicate it as a house in which artistic performances of a dignified nature will be presented.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p42\" class=\"\">Here this glorious Tabernacle Choir will sing anthems of praise. Here other musical groups will perform for the entertaining of large numbers of people. Here will be presented pageants depicting in a beautiful and artistic way the history of this movement as well as many other things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p43\" class=\"\">This structure has been built of the finest materials by the ablest of craftsmen. We are indebted to all who have contributed to make of this a magnificent center for conferences of the Church and other purposes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p44\" class=\"\">We anticipate that there will be requests from other groups to use this hall. We will make it available under regulations that will ensure that its use will be in harmony with the purposes for which it will be dedicated today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p45\" class=\"\">It is not a museum piece, although the architecture is superb. It is a place to be used in honor to the Almighty and for the accomplishment of His eternal purposes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p46\" class=\"\">I am so grateful that we have it. I am so grateful that it is completed. There is a little work of tuning up the organ, which will go on for some time. I commend to your attention the excellent articles appearing in the October <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> dealing with this subject.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p47\" class=\"\">As I contemplate this marvelous structure, adjacent to the temple, there comes to mind the great prophetic utterance of Isaiah:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p48\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord\u2019s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p49\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p50\" class=\"\">\u201cO house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24922\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24922)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24922)\">Isa. 2:2\u20133, 5<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p51\" class=\"\">I believe that prophecy applies to the historic and wonderful Salt Lake Temple.

Immediately at the close of the dedicatory prayer, we invite each one of you who may wish to participate to stand and join with us in the Hosanna Shout. This sacred salute to the Father and the Son is given at the dedication of each of the temples. It has also been given on a few occasions of historic importance, such as the laying of the capstone on the Salt Lake Temple and the celebration of the centennial of the Church in the 1930 general conference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p55\" class=\"\">We feel it is appropriate to give the shout here, as we dedicate this great building, the likes of which we may never undertake again. Any mention of this by the media should recognize that for us this is a very sacred and personal thing. We request that it be treated with deference and respect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p56\" class=\"\">I will now demonstrate the shout. Each one takes a clean white handkerchief, holding it by one corner, and waves it while saying in unison, \u201cHosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna to God and the Lamb,\u201d repeated three times, followed by \u201cAmen, Amen, and Amen.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p57\" class=\"\">Again, those wishing to participate are invited to stand and give the Hosanna Shout immediately following the dedicatory prayer. Those desiring to remain seated are at liberty to do so. If you do not have a white handkerchief you may simply wave your hand. Those in other areas may join in giving the shout if their circumstances are appropriate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p58\" class=\"\">At the conclusion of the shout, the Tabernacle Choir, without announcement, will sing the \u201cHosannah Anthem,\u201d which was written by Evan Stephens for the dedication of the Salt Lake Temple in 1893. On a signal from the conductor the congregation will join in singing \u201cThe Spirit of God like a Fire Is Burning,\u201d which was written by W. W. Phelps and sung at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple in 1836.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/this-great-millennial-year.p59\" class=\"\">The benediction will then be offered by Elder W.
