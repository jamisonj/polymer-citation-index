Ugly reports and conversations are always available to those who would promote the sordid and sensational. None of us are yet perfect.

Home evening needs to be reemphasized and used as a tool or foundation for wholesome communication and teaching, but never as an opportunity to bash other family members, neighbors, teachers, or Church leaders.

It makes the thought of being a basher repulsive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/the-tongue-can-be-a-sharp-sword.p20\" class=\"\">Perhaps the greatest charity comes when we are kind to each other, when we don\u2019t judge or categorize someone else, when we simply give each other the benefit of the doubt or remain quiet. Charity is accepting someone\u2019s differences, weaknesses, and shortcomings; having patience with someone who has let us down; or resisting the impulse to become offended when someone doesn\u2019t handle something the way we might have hoped. Charity is refusing to take advantage of another\u2019s weakness and being willing to forgive someone who has hurt us. Charity is expecting the best of each other.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/the-tongue-can-be-a-sharp-sword.p21\" class=\"\">None of us need one more person bashing or pointing out where we have failed or fallen short. Most of us are already well aware of the areas in which we are weak. What each of us does need is family, friends, employers, and brothers and sisters who support us, who have the patience to teach us, who believe in us, and who believe we\u2019re trying to do the best we can, in spite of our weaknesses. What ever happened to giving each other the benefit of the doubt? What ever happened to hoping that another person would succeed or achieve? What ever happened to rooting for each other?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/the-tongue-can-be-a-sharp-sword.p22\" class=\"\">It should come as no surprise that one of the adversary\u2019s tactics in the latter days is stirring up hatred among the children of men. He loves to see us criticize each other, make fun or take advantage of our neighbor\u2019s known flaws, and generally pick on each other. The Book of Mormon is clear from where all anger, malice, greed, and hate come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/the-tongue-can-be-a-sharp-sword.p23\" class=\"\">Nephi prophesied that in the last days the devil would \u201crage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4474\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4474)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4474)\">2 Ne. 28:20<\/a><\/span>.)

Let\u2019s consider first the Sermon on the Mount, which to our knowledge was the first sermon Jesus Christ taught his newly called disciples. The overriding theme of the Savior\u2019s sermon, which in many ways is the ultimate handbook on coming unto Him, seems to center around the virtues of love, compassion, forgiveness, and long-suffering\u2014in other words, those qualities that enable us to deal with our fellowmen more compassionately.

All of the comments were thoughtful and appropriate. But after a time, this great teacher erased everything he had written. Then, acknowledging that all of the comments had been worthwhile and appreciated, he taught a vital principle: \u201cThe best and most clear indicator that we are progressing spiritually and coming unto Christ is the way we treat other people.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/the-tongue-can-be-a-sharp-sword.p27\" class=\"\">Would you consider this idea for a moment\u2014that the way we treat the members of our families, our friends, those with whom we work each day is as important as are some of the more noticeable gospel principles we sometimes emphasize.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/the-tongue-can-be-a-sharp-sword.p28\" class=\"\">Last month the Relief Society celebrated its 150th anniversary.

The cause of her unhappiness had little to do with the question at hand and was related more to the fact that at the time she was laboring under intense home pressure on a major task and was feeling frustrated and frazzled. Afterward, she was embarrassed at her behavior and immediately called to apologize for her outburst. Her friends in the presidency were generous and told her not to think another thing about it. Still she wondered if they might think less of her, now that they\u2019d seen her at less than her best. But that evening the doorbell rang around dinnertime, and there stood the other members of the presidency with dinner in hand. \u201cWe knew when you lost your cool this morning that you must just be worn out. We thought a little supper might help. We want you to know we love you.\u201d The young woman was amazed. In spite of her outburst that morning, her friends were there to offer support rather than criticism.
