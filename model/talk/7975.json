There we had the privilege of meeting with many of our missionaries, perhaps some of your sons and your daughters. Since President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson\u2019s announcement of the lowering of the age for our young men and our young women to serve, I have had the privilege of meeting with over 3,000 of them. The Light of Christ radiates in their faces, and they are eager to move the work forward\u2014to find and teach, to baptize, to activate, and to strengthen and to build the kingdom of God. Meeting with them, one quickly comes to know, however, that they cannot do this work alone. Today I want to speak to all members of the Church, because there is an urgency for each one of us to be engaged in sharing the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/put-your-trust-in-the-lord.p6\" class=\"\">As has been quoted many times, the Prophet Joseph Smith declared that \u201cafter all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith<\/span> [2007], 330).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/put-your-trust-in-the-lord.p7\" class=\"\">In 1974 President Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball said this: \u201cPerhaps the greatest reason for missionary work is to give the world its chance to hear and accept the gospel. The scriptures are replete with commands and promises and calls and rewards for teaching the gospel. I use the word <span class=\"emphasis\">command<\/span> deliberately for it seems to be an insistent directive from which we, singly and collectively, cannot escape\u201d (\u201cWhen the World Will Be Converted,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Oct. 1974, 4).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/put-your-trust-in-the-lord.p8\" class=\"\">In July of that same year, Sister Ballard and I left with our children to preside over the Canada Toronto Mission. The words of President Kimball were ringing in my ears, especially when he said: \u201cMy brethren, I wonder if we are doing all we can. Are we complacent in our approach to teaching all the world? We have been proselyting now 144 years. Are we prepared to lengthen our stride? To enlarge our vision?\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Oct. 1974, 5).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/put-your-trust-in-the-lord.p9\" class=\"\">He also asked us to quicken our pace, working together to build up the Church and kingdom of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/put-your-trust-in-the-lord.p10\" class=\"\">This past June President Thomas\u00a0S.

The President said: \u201cNow is the time for members and missionaries to come together \u2026 [and] labor in the Lord\u2019s vineyard to bring souls unto Him. He has prepared the means for us to share the gospel in a multitude of ways, and He will assist us in our labors if we will act in faith to fulfill His work\u201d (\u201cFaith in the Work of Salvation\u201d [address given at a special broadcast, June\u00a023, 2013]; lds.org\/broadcasts).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/put-your-trust-in-the-lord.p11\" class=\"\">It is good, brothers and sisters, to reflect on the teachings of the prophets from the time of Joseph Smith to today.

In our day this can be done only when every member of the Church reaches out with love to share the truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. We need to work together in partnership with our 80,000 missionaries now serving. Information about this great work, especially the assignments for the stake and ward council leaders, is clearly outlined on the LDS.org website entitled \u201cHastening the Work of Salvation.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/put-your-trust-in-the-lord.p13\" class=\"\">We know from our research that most active members of the Church want the blessings of the gospel to be part of the lives of others whom they love, even those whom they have never met.

Then, we must demonstrate our faith and watch for opportunities to introduce the gospel of Jesus Christ to our Heavenly Father\u2019s children, and surely those opportunities will come. These opportunities will never require a forced or a contrived response. They will flow as a natural result of our love for our brothers and sisters. Just be positive, and those whom you speak with will feel your love. They will never forget that feeling, though the timing may not be right for them to embrace the gospel. That too may change in the future when their circumstances change.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/put-your-trust-in-the-lord.p25\" class=\"\">It is impossible for us to fail when we do our best when we are on the Lord\u2019s errand.
