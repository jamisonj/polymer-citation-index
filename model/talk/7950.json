One way or another, that should include just about all of us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/lord-i-believe.p13\" class=\"\">Observation number one regarding this account is that when facing the challenge of faith, the father asserts his strength first and only then acknowledges his limitation. His initial declaration is affirmative and without hesitation: \u201cLord, I believe.\u201d I would say to all who wish for more faith, remember this man! In moments of fear or doubt or troubling times, hold the ground you have already won, even if that ground is limited. In the growth we all have to experience in mortality, the spiritual equivalent of this boy\u2019s affliction or this parent\u2019s desperation is going to come to all of us. When those moments come and issues surface, the resolution of which is not immediately forthcoming, <span class=\"emphasis\">hold fast to what you already know and stand strong until additional knowledge comes.<\/span> It was of this very incident, this specific miracle, that Jesus said, \u201cIf ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-10705_000_036\">6<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124214\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124214)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124214)\">Matthew 17:20<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> The size of your faith or the degree of your knowledge is not the issue\u2014it is the integrity you demonstrate toward the faith you do have and the truth you already know.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/lord-i-believe.p14\" class=\"\">The second observation is a variation of the first. When problems come and questions arise, do not start your quest for faith by saying how much you do <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> have, leading as it were with your \u201cunbelief.\u201d That is like trying to stuff a turkey through the beak! Let me be clear on this point: I am not asking you to pretend to faith you do not have. I <span class=\"emphasis\">am<\/span> asking you to be true to the faith you <span class=\"emphasis\">do<\/span> have. Sometimes we act as if an honest declaration of doubt is a higher manifestation of moral courage than is an honest declaration of faith. It is not! So let us all remember the clear message of this scriptural account: Be as candid about your questions as you need to be; life is full of them on one subject or another. But if you and your family want to be healed, don\u2019t let those questions stand in the way of faith working its miracle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/lord-i-believe.p15\" class=\"\">Furthermore, you have more faith than you think you do because of what the Book of Mormon calls \u201cthe greatness of the evidences.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-10705_000_036\">7<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124215\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124215)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124215)\">Helaman 5:50<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> \u201cYe shall know them by their fruits,\u201d Jesus said,<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-10705_000_036\">8<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124216\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124216)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124216)\">Matthew 7:16<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> and the fruit of living the gospel is evident in the lives of Latter-day Saints everywhere.

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10705_000_036\"><a name=\"-10705_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote1-10705_000_036\">1.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"124208\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124208)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124208)\">Mark 9:22\u201324<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"124209\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124209)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124209)\">verses 14\u201321<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10705_000_036\"><a name=\"-10705_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote2-10705_000_036\">2.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"124210\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124210)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124210)\">Alma 32:27<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10705_000_036\"><a name=\"-10705_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote3-10705_000_036\">3.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"124211\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124211)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124211)\">Mark 9:22<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10705_000_036\"><a name=\"-10705_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote4-10705_000_036\">4.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"124212\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124212)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124212)\">Mark 9:22, 23<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10705_000_036\"><a name=\"-10705_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote5-10705_000_036\">5.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"124213\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124213)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124213)\">Mark 9:24\u201327<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10705_000_036\"><a name=\"-10705_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote6-10705_000_036\">6.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"124214\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124214)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124214)\">Matthew 17:20<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10705_000_036\"><a name=\"-10705_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote7-10705_000_036\">7.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"124215\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124215)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124215)\">Helaman 5:50<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10705_000_036\"><a name=\"-10705_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote8-10705_000_036\">8.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"124216\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124216)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124216)\">Matthew 7:16<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10705_000_036\"><a name=\"-10705_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote9-10705_000_036\">9.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"124217\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124217)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124217)\">Acts 4:16, 20<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10705_000_036\"><a name=\"-10705_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote10-10705_000_036\">10.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Adapted from Alfred Edersheim, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah,<\/span> 2 vols.
