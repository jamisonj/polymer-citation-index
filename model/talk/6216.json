I have prayed for guidance in what I should say because I wish to raise a warning voice. In today\u2019s society, the difference between right and wrong is being obscured by loud, seductive voices calling for no restraints in human conduct. They advocate absolute freedom without regard to consequences. I state unequivocally that such behavior is the high road to personal destruction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p5\" class=\"\">Tonight I speak to the priesthood of this Church, and particularly to the young men of the Aaronic Priesthood, about how to become really free. Obedience leads to true freedom. The more we obey revealed truth, the more we become liberated. President David O. McKay spoke about his horse Dandy, who wanted complete freedom and no restraints. President McKay said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cUnder the saddle he was as willing, responsive, and cooperative as a horse could be. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cBut Dandy resented restraint. He was ill-contented when tied and would nibble at the tie-rope until he was free. He would not run away, he just wanted to be free. Thinking other horses felt the same, he would proceed to untie their ropes. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p8\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 His curiosity and desire to explore the neighborhood led him and me into trouble. Once on the highway he was hit by an automobile. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cRecovering from that, and still impelled with a feeling of wanderlust, he inspected the fence throughout the entire boundary. He even found the gates wired. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cOne day, however, somebody left the gate unwired. Detecting this, Dandy unlatched it and took another horse \u2026 with him, and together they \u2026 went to an old house used for storage. Dandy\u2019s curiosity prompted him to push open the door. \u2026 There was a sack of grain. What a find! Yes, and what a tragedy. The grain was bait for rodents! In a few minutes Dandy and the other horse were in spasmodic pain, and shortly afterwards both were dead.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p11\" class=\"\">President McKay continued: \u201cHow like Dandy are many of our youth! \u2026 They are impulsive, full of life, full of curiosity. \u2026 They, too, are restive under restraint, but if they are kept busy, guided carefully and rightly, they prove to be responsive and capable; but if left to wander unguided, they all too frequently violate principles of right which often lead to snares of evil, disaster, and even death.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-99905_000_022\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Quoted in Rick Walton and Fern Oviatt, comps., <span class=\"emphasis\">Stories for Mormons<\/span> (1983), 86\u201387.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p12\" class=\"\">Being bridled, or yielding obediently to restraint, is necessary for our personal growth and progression. Recently a nationally broadcast program talked about wild horses that are being tamed by prisoners. As the prisoners formed friendships with the horses, they learned about patience, controlling tempers, respect for others, and the value of working within a system. As they watched the horses learn to be obedient to their commands, they realized how they could have avoided the terrible mistakes that had put them in prison. I add that obedience to righteous principles would have offered them freedom from social diseases, shame, degradation, and feelings of guilt. Like the horses, they could still learn, progress, and achieve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p13\" class=\"\">We hear many persuasive voices demanding freedom from restrictions, particularly from moral restraints. However, we learn from the history of the earth that any successful society has had boundaries. Consider the earth itself. It was formed out of matter and in the beginning was empty, desolate, and dark. Then came order as God commanded that the light should be divided from the darkness. God\u2019s command was obeyed, and the earth had its first day, followed by its first night. Then God ordered the creation of the atmosphere. He organized the sun, the moon, and the stars to shine in their appropriate times and seasons. After a series of commands and obedience to commands, the earth not only became habitable but beautiful.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-99905_000_022\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"7448\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7448)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7448)\">Abr. 4<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p14\" class=\"\">Brother Jake Garn, former U.S. senator, traveled into space with a team of American astronauts a few years ago.

But it is also part of our solar system, an orderly system with eight other planets, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies that orbit the sun. Just as the earth is a planet in its own right, so each of us is an individual in our own sphere of habitation. We are individuals, but we live in families and communities where order provides a system of harmony that hinges on obedience to principles. Just as order gave life and beauty to the earth when it was dark and void, so it does to us. Obedience helps us develop the full potential our Heavenly Father desires for us in becoming celestial beings worthy someday to live in His presence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p16\" class=\"\">Now, brethren, another element of freedom is trust. Almost 60 years ago, when I was going on my first mission, President McKay taught us missionaries a great truth. Without a word, he walked over to the blackboard, picked up a piece of chalk, and wrote, \u201cIt is better to be trusted than to be loved.\u201d I have pondered that statement and have seen some fine examples of it. I will relate one example from the scriptures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p17\" class=\"\">Joseph, the son of Jacob and Rachel, was sold into slavery in Egypt. Because of treachery in the house of Potiphar, Joseph went to prison. Pharaoh had two troubling dreams. Hearing of Joseph\u2019s discernment from the captain of the prison guard, he sent for him to interpret the dreams. Joseph told him, through inspiration, that seven years of plenty would be followed by seven years of famine. Pharaoh not only recognized this true interpretation, but he trusted Joseph and appointed him to be second only to Pharaoh in power. The years passed and the famine came. In time Joseph rescued all of his brothers and his father from starvation.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-99905_000_022\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24153\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24153)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24153)\">Gen. 37<\/a><\/span>;\n                <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24154\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24154)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24154)\">Gen. 39<\/a><\/span>;\n                <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24155\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24155)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24155)\">Gen. 40<\/a><\/span>;\n                <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24156\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24156)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24156)\">Gen. 41<\/a><\/span>;\n                <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24158\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24158)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24158)\">Gen. 42<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Because he earned the implicit trust of those who were over him, Joseph enjoyed a great amount of freedom.

It lasted three days, and the snow was so deep that it was impossible to move the wagons through it. So Eph decided he would go on horseback. He took two horses, one to ride and one to pack, and picked his way carefully through the snow to the mountains. Dusk came as he made his lonely camp at South Pass. As he was about to lie down he thought about the hungry Saints and instinctively asked the Lord to send him a buffalo. As he opened his eyes at the end of his prayer, he was startled at the sight of a buffalo standing barely 50 yards away. He took aim, and one shot sent the animal rolling down into the hollow where he was encamped.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p26\" class=\"\">Early next morning, he took the two horses and the buffalo meat and reached Ice Springs Bench. There he shot another buffalo, even though it was rare to find buffalo in this area this late in the season. After he had cut the meat into long strips, he loaded up his horses and resumed his journey. And now I quote from Eph\u2019s own narrative:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cI think the sun was about an hour high in the west when I spied something in the distance that looked like a black streak in the snow.

Flocking around me, one would say, \u2018Oh, please, give me a small piece of meat;\u2019 another would exclaim, \u2018My poor children are starving, do give me a little;\u2019 and children with tears in their eyes would call out, \u2018Give me some, give me some.\u2019 \u2026 Five minutes later both my horses had been released of their extra burden\u2014the meat was all gone, and the next few hours found the people in camp busily engaged in cooking and eating it, with thankful hearts.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote10-99905_000_022\">10<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Sidney Alvarus Hanks and Ephraim K.
