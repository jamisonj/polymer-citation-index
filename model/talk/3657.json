A wealthy friend of his father came to him and said: \u201cTo get you started right, I am going to have you build a ranch house for me. Here are the plans. Don\u2019t skimp on anything. I want the very finest materials used, and I want flawless workmanship. Forget the cost. Just send me the bills.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/pondering-strengthens-the-spiritual-life.p12\" class=\"\">The young builder became obsessed with the desire to enrich himself through this generous and unrestricted offer. Instead of employing top-grade labor and buying the finest materials, he shortchanged his benefactor in every way possible. Finally, the last secondhand nail was driven into the last flimsy wall, and the builder handed over the keys and bills, totaling over a hundred thousand dollars, to his father\u2019s old friend. That gentleman wrote a check in full for the structure and then handed the keys back to the builder. \u201cThe home you have just built, my boy,\u201d he said with a pleasant smile, \u201cis my present to you. May you live in it in great happiness!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/pondering-strengthens-the-spiritual-life.p13\" class=\"\">In this story the young builder did not ponder the consequences of his dishonest thoughts and acts. If he had pondered, perhaps he would have come to a clear understanding of what Jesus so long ago described:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/pondering-strengthens-the-spiritual-life.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cTherefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/pondering-strengthens-the-spiritual-life.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/pondering-strengthens-the-spiritual-life.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/pondering-strengthens-the-spiritual-life.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36839\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36839)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36839)\">Matt. 7:24\u201327<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/pondering-strengthens-the-spiritual-life.p18\" class=\"\">Had he pondered his actions, this unwise builder might have learned that to consent verbally to do the right thing and then to live and to act without effort to achieve what is right, is ruinous.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/pondering-strengthens-the-spiritual-life.p19\" class=\"\">The story of the unwise builder could have application in the lives of all of us. We must ponder the consequences of our mistakes. Our Father in Heaven has generously given to all of us life, which includes our free agency. With free agency comes the challenge to make the right decisions and choices, including the achievement of joy and happiness. This is an art in itself and must be earned. It is not possible to have a free ride on the road to joy, and there is no real joy that does not involve self-denial and self-discipline; we must ponder our actions and their results.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/pondering-strengthens-the-spiritual-life.p20\" class=\"\">We all know that there is much evil abounding in the world today. Many people are addicted to drugs that cause mental, emotional, and physical problems of great magnitude and of long-lasting duration. Marriage partners are unfaithful and cause the breakup of homes and families. Satan is working harder and is having greater success than perhaps ever before in history.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/pondering-strengthens-the-spiritual-life.p21\" class=\"\">All evils to which so many become addicted begin in the mind and in the way one thinks. Experience teaches that when the will and imagination are in conflict, the imagination usually wins. What we imagine may defeat our reason and make us slaves to what we taste, see, hear, smell, and feel in the mind\u2019s eye. The body is indeed the servant of the mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/pondering-strengthens-the-spiritual-life.p22\" class=\"\">In his widely acclaimed essay <span class=\"emphasis\">As a Man Thinketh,<\/span> James Allen reinforced what Jesus so beautifully proclaimed.

By the right choice and true application of thought, man ascends to the Divine Perfection; by the abuse and wrong application of thought, he descends below the level of the beast. Between these two extremes are all the grades of character, and man is their maker and master. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/pondering-strengthens-the-spiritual-life.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cAll that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts.\u201d (New York: Thomas Y.
