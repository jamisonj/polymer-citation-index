Dilworth Young<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Of the First Council of the Seventy<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">S. Dilworth Young, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1952, pp. 28-30<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMany years ago I walked into Richards Ward of this city to hear President Charles W.\nPenrose deliver an address. I have not the least idea about what he intended to speak but I\nsaw before us the text upon which he did speak. Someone had placed upon the rostrum for\nthe benefit of those who, I suppose, needed it&mdash;the youngsters of Sunday School age&mdash;a\nsign which read, \"Order is the First Law of Heaven.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI suspect that Brother Penrose was impatient for the preliminary exercises to be finished\nbecause immediately afterwards he took the floor and spent the whole evening explaining why\norder is not, but that obedience is, the first law of heaven. I cannot remember what he said. I\ndo remember that this was the first time in my life that I had heard this principle explained\nthoroughly.\n<\/p><p>\nI recognize the fact that this Church is a Church of revealed principle. From the Lord come\nthe revelations which establish the principles. I should like to bear my witness that there must\nbe an interpreter for the Church of those principles.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we had no revelator to do it for us, each man and each woman would interpret, explain,\nand take into his own life only that portion of each principle which he would wish for\nhimself, and this people would be disunited and divergent in its views. I do thank my Lord\nthat there sits on this stand a Prophet of the Lord, who, with his Counselors and the Twelve,\nare empowered to tell us how as a united body we are to explain and entertain the principles.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, the matter of having a principle explained is one thing, teaching its application is\nanother thing, but getting obedience to it is a third thing. As I have gone through my life, I\nconfess to you folk that I have never been coerced. The obedience I have chosen to render to\nthe principles has been entirely my own, and completely voluntary. I have always been able to\nchoose whether I would accept the interpretation of the Presidents of the Church or whether I\nwould figure out my own interpretation. I have found that the interpretation of the Church has\nhad safety for me. I have found myself wandering far astray when left to my own devices on\nthings about which the prophet of the Lord has spoken.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe that all of the crises through which the Church has passed have been safely\nweathered by the application of the principle of obedience, voluntarily expressed. Even in the\nsharp days at Nauvoo when men did not know whither to turn or what to do, President Young\ndid not tell the people they had to leave. If I remember history correctly, he is reported to\nhave said to his people: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I am going to cross the river and start west with my family and my teams. All those who\nwish to follow me, do so.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWell, the majority wished to follow him, and the majority did so. We have never heard what\nhappened to those who did not come, except for a very few about whom the Church was\nvitally concerned. Those who came, who were obedient, did not live to see it, but their\nchildren's children are the faithful of today. And those who did not come, where are their\nchildren, may I ask? One never hears of them.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Church moved south at the coming of Johnston's Army, President Young again\nsaid: \"I am going south. Those who want to come may come.\" Nearly all of them went with\nhim, and at Provo when the crisis was over, he stood up on a wagon tongue and said to the\npeople: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I am going back to Salt Lake City. Those of you who care to follow may do so.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI have observed that never do the prophetic leaders tell the people what they must do but\nrather advise them what it is wise and expedient to do.\n<\/p><p>\nMore recently, in our day, when the welfare program was announced, and the brethren from\nthis pulpit explained to those assembled how they wanted to work it, from my position among\nthe rank and file I heard a great deal from certain people who wanted to do it differently.\nThey did not want to interpret it the way the brethren wanted to interpret it.\n<\/p><p>\nWhere are they today? I do not know. They are not in positions of responsibility, certainly.\nThose who were willing to follow the lead voluntarily, with faith, believing that their leaders\nspoke with inspiration from Almighty God, are those in whom the responsibility is rested.\n<\/p><p>\nSo I suppose it must always be. As we come to crisis after crisis, as the events of the world\nmake changes necessary in policy, the leaders will speak, and those who are wise will give\nunquestioning obedience. I did not say unintelligent obedience. I said unquestioning\nobedience.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to make an application of what I have been saying today. We have now come to\na time, I see by the newspapers, when we are to have announced this evening, a missionary\npolicy.\n<\/p><p>\nNow I confess to you people here that I do not know personally much more about that than\nyou do. Suppose that the policy is not in harmony with what you had thought to be the\ndirection in which it ought to go, suppose it to embody detail which I should like to see done\nsome other way. Applying the principle of obedience to myself, I stand here now and say to\nyou here assembled that it is my intention to follow, as nearly as the Lord will give me light,\nthose plans and policies regarding missionary work that are to be announced by my file\nleaders.\n<\/p><p>\nI shall not want to improve on their ideas, but I shall give all my strength, and all my\ncourage, and any talents with which the Lord may have blessed me, to doing what will be\nannounced.\n<\/p><p>\nI think that we have come to a time now when we are going to see some changes. Times are\nripe for changes. The world is changing. The Prophet Joseph Smith changed the missionary\nsystem two or three times in his own life. At one time he told the missionaries to go out two\nby two. Shortly after he told them they might now go one at a time and alone. Other changes\nhave been made. I am for the changes.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I close by reading you a verse of scripture which I think applies to me personally.\nMaybe you can apply it to yourselves. It was said by Samuel on an occasion which I think\njustified the saying.\n<\/p><p>\n. . . Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of\nthe Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2501\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2501)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2501)\">1 Sam. 15:22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere I stand. May we all do likewise, I humbly pray, in the name of Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
