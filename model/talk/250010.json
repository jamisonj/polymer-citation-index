The safety and protection of the Latter-day Saints lie in their preparing for peace. In other words, it is to make peace with their God, and with one another, and to proclaim peace unto all mankind, and so live and deport themselves, that they will encourage, extend and maintain peace to the utmost of their ability. But, and if the wicked continue to oppress, to war against and annoy the people of God, and to deprive them of social, religious and political privileges, and other rights that belong to them as the children of God, as human beings, as citizens of the commonwealth, those unalienable rights of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness; if, I say, the wicked combine to abridge these immunities, privileges and rights, and trample them under foot, and to wage war against the Saints for the purpose of destroying them, what may we do to avert it? It has been well answered: Do the will of the Lord; keep His commandments; do good to one another; forgive one another, and ask to be forgiven of each other and of our God; walk humbly before Him day and night; trust in Him, believe in Him, and go forward in the discharge of every duty, fearing only God. &#x201C;Fear not them,&#x201D; says the Savior, &#x201C;which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"64187\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 64187)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(64187)\">Matt. 10:28<\/a><\/span> Let our fear center upon Him; let our trust and our faith center upon Him; let us maintain our confidence in Him, that He rules in the heavens and among the armies of men, and that He turns the hearts of the children of men as the rivers of water are turned;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129038\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129038)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129038)\">Prov. 21:1<\/a><\/span> and if at one time their hearts are softened, as was Pharaoh's of old,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"90012\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 90012)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(90012)\">D&amp;C 105:27<\/a><\/span> and then, again, their hearts are hardened, as was Pharaoh's,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"53923\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 53923)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(53923)\">Ex. 8:15<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"53930\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 53930)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(53930)\">Ex. 8:32<\/a><\/span> we  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"73a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD25\/JoD25_0073.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;73a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9071\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>may bear in mind that all these things are necessary in the accomplishment of the divine purposes of our Father and Creator.
