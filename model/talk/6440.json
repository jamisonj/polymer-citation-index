To these who would need to complete ancient Israel\u2019s most formidable task\u2014recapturing and repossessing their promised land of old\u2014Joshua said, \u201cSanctify yourselves: for to morrow the Lord will do wonders among you.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-20911_000_019\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30014\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30014)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30014)\">Josh. 3:5<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sanctify-yourselves.p7\" class=\"\">Let me share a story with you suggesting how soon and how unexpectedly those tomorrows can come and in some cases how little time you may have to make hasty, belated preparation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sanctify-yourselves.p8\" class=\"\">On the afternoon of Wednesday, September 30, 1998, just two years ago last week, a Little League football team in Inkom, Idaho, was out on the field for its midweek practice. They had completed their warm-ups and were starting to run a few plays from scrimmage. Dark clouds were gathering, as they sometimes do in the fall, and it began to rain lightly, but that was of no concern to a group of boys who loved playing football.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sanctify-yourselves.p9\" class=\"\">Suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, an absolutely deafening crack of thunder split the air, inseparable from the flash of lightning that illuminated, literally electrified, the entire scene.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sanctify-yourselves.p10\" class=\"\">At that very moment a young friend of mine, A. J. Edwards, then a deacon in the Portneuf Ward of the McCammon Idaho Stake, was ready for the ball on a handoff that was sure to be a touchdown in this little intersquad bit of horseplay. But the lightning that had illuminated earth and sky struck A. J. Edwards from the crown of his football helmet to the soles of his shoes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sanctify-yourselves.p11\" class=\"\">The impact of the strike stunned all the players, knocking a few to the ground, leaving one player temporarily without his sight and virtually all the rest of the players dazed and shaken. Instinctively they started running for the concrete pavilion adjacent to the park. Some of the boys began to cry. Many of them fell to their knees and began to pray. Through it all, A. J. Edwards lay motionless on the field.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sanctify-yourselves.p12\" class=\"\">Brother David Johnson of the Rapid Creek Ward, McCammon Idaho Stake, rushed to the player\u2019s side. He shouted to coach and fellow ward member Rex Shaffer, \u201cI can\u2019t get a pulse. He\u2019s in cardiac arrest.\u201d These two men, rather miraculously both trained emergency medical technicians, started a life-against-death effort in CPR.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sanctify-yourselves.p13\" class=\"\">Cradling A. J.\u2019s head as the men worked was the young defensive coach of the team, 18-year-old Bryce Reynolds, a member of the Mountain View Ward, McCammon Idaho Stake. As he watched Brother Johnson and Brother Shaffer urgently applying CPR, he had an impression. I am confident it was a revelation from heaven in every sense of the word. He remembered vividly a priesthood blessing that the bishop had once given his grandfather following an equally tragic and equally life-threatening accident years earlier. Now, as he held this young deacon in his arms, he realized that for the first time in his life he needed to use his newly conferred Melchizedek Priesthood in a similar way. In anticipation of his 19th birthday and forthcoming call to serve a mission, young Bryce Reynolds had been ordained an elder just 39 days earlier.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sanctify-yourselves.p14\" class=\"\">Whether he audibly spoke the words or only uttered them under his breath, Elder Reynolds said: \u201cA. J. Edwards, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the power and authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood which I hold, I bless you that you will be OK. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\u201d As Bryce Reynolds closed that brief but fervent blessing offered in the language of an 18-year-old, A. J. Edwards drew his first renewed breath.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sanctify-yourselves.p15\" class=\"\">The ongoing prayers, miracles, and additional priesthood blessings of that entire experience\u2014including a high-speed ambulance drive to Pocatello and a near-hopeless LifeFlight to the burn center at the University of Utah\u2014all of that the Edwards family can share with us at a later time. It is sufficient to say that a very healthy and very robust A. J. Edwards is in the audience tonight with his father as my special guests. I also recently talked on the telephone with Elder Bryce Reynolds, who has been serving faithfully in the Texas Dallas Mission for the past 17 months. I love these two wonderful young men.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sanctify-yourselves.p16\" class=\"\">Now, my young friends of both the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood, not every prayer is answered so immediately, and not every priesthood declaration can command the renewal or the sustaining of life. Sometimes the will of God is otherwise. But young men, you will learn, if you have not already, that in frightening, even perilous moments, your faith and your priesthood will demand the very best of you and the best you can call down from heaven. You Aaronic Priesthood boys will not use your priesthood in exactly the same way an ordained elder uses the Melchizedek, but all priesthood bearers must be instruments in the hand of God, and to be so, you must, as Joshua said, \u201csanctify yourselves.\u201d You must be ready and worthy to act.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sanctify-yourselves.p17\" class=\"\">That is why the Lord repeatedly says in the scriptures, \u201cBe ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-20911_000_019\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24931\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24931)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24931)\">Isa. 52:11<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"5357\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5357)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5357)\">3 Ne. 20:41<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"10880\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10880)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10880)\">D&amp;C 38:42<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"11030\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11030)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11030)\">D&amp;C 133:5<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Let me tell you what that phrase \u201cbear the vessels of the Lord\u201d means. Anciently it had at least two meanings, both related to the work of the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sanctify-yourselves.p18\" class=\"\">The first refers to the recovery and return to Jerusalem of various temple implements that had been carried into Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar. In physically handling the return of these items, the Lord reminded those early brethren of the sanctity of anything related to the temple. Therefore as they carried back to their homeland these various bowls, basins, cups, and other vessels, they themselves were to be as clean as the ceremonial instruments they bore.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-20911_000_019\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"3154\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3154)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3154)\">2 Kgs. 25:14\u201315<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"23196\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23196)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23196)\">Ezra 1:5\u201311<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/sanctify-yourselves.p19\" class=\"\">The second meaning is related to the first. Similar bowls and implements were used for ritual purification in the home. The Apostle Paul, writing to his young friend Timothy, said of these, \u201cIn a great house there are \u2026 vessels of gold and \u2026 silver, \u2026 of wood and of earth\u201d\u2014these means of washing and cleansing common in the time of the Savior.
