I have never understood\nthat it was my privilege as a member of this Church, holding the priesthood, to say no. I have\nnever had a desire in my heart to do anything other than that which the brethren direct. While\nI may feel as if some of the things that they have most recently asked me to do are beyond\nmy power, nevertheless so far as my Heavenly Father will give me the power to act I shall do\nso, and all that I have and am belongs to my Heavenly Father. I had a grandfather who met\nwith a very great disaster. All that he had was swept away by fire. His thoughts and his\nactions at the moment he was told of his loss have been on my mind for the past several\nminutes, and I must say I feel rather as he then felt:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26647\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26647)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26647)\">Job 1:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI know that the Lord can take that away which he giveth, if we give him cause so to do; that\nwe may be the recipients of his blessings today but to continue to be such recipients, we must\nbe obedient to his laws and his commandments.\n<\/p><p>\nOBEDIENCE TO PRESENT-DAY LEADERS REQUIRED\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren and sisters, my faith in this gospel is such that I do not confine my obedience alone\nto that which I find in the scriptures, but I believe that our obedience should be pledged, that\nof every one of us, to every word that comes from the mouths of the prophets\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34122\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34122)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34122)\">Matt. 4:4<\/a><\/span>) and the\nrepresentatives of our Heavenly Father here upon this earth. To me that which the Presidency\nof this Church have said and say now, is as much the law and the gospel as anything that has\never been said or written before for our guidance.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is not the wisdom of the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"145\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 145)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(145)\">1 Cor. 1:20<\/a><\/span>)\nas Paul says that is important to us; it is the power and the\nstrength of the gospel: That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the\npower of God (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"146\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 146)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(146)\">1 Cor. 2:5<\/a><\/span>).\nIf there is anything else in life that we can better\nafford to dedicate that which we have and are than to the work of the Lord, I do not know\nwhat that would be. Certainly it is not to be found in the world. I have had an exceptional\nopportunity, as I have told many of you in your quarterly conferences in our welfare work, to\nexamine the minds and understand the reasoning and the philosophy and the weaknesses of\nthe world in its counsels, and by comparison to see the strength and the certainty and the\nwisdom and the knowledge that come to the leaders and the councils of our Church from our\nHeavenly Father on high.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, with my heart full of gratitude and humility for this further opportunity to serve the\npeople, I hope and pray that I may be blessed in my ministry with the\nwisdom that comes from above, and never be tempted to rely upon that which comes from the\nworld.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE WISDOM OF THE WORLD INSUFFICIENT\n<\/p><p>\nI know that after eleven long years in this welfare work that if we had depended upon the\nwisdom of the world, and had let our people go as the world goes, the time is rapidly\napproaching when they would have no security. They would have no welfare, because the\nphilosophies of men by which many of our people have been led astray will fail, whereas that\nwhich comes from the Lord will remain with us eternally.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to bear you my testimony that I know that this Church and this people are capable of\ntaking care of their own; that there is no need for any of us to go beyond the confines of our\nown combined resources, to garner into the bishops' storehouses of this Church all that we\nneed for ourselves, all that we need for our brethren and sisters in Europe, and I will go one\nstep farther and say, all that we need for our neighbors, if we will but keep in close\ncommunion with the spirit of obedience and act under the direction of the leaders of Israel,\nhere upon this earth and here upon this stand today.\n<\/p><p>\nA FERVENT TESTIMONY\n<\/p><p>\nI know that this is the gospel of Jesus Christ. I know that this group of men, before me in this\naudience, are in reality the representatives of the only group of men in the world made up, as\nthey are, of all professions and coming from all walks of life, that is to say the priesthood of\nthis Church, who can bear this same testimony&mdash;that they know that God lives and that Jesus\nis the Christ. You cannot go anywhere else in the world and find such a group of men able,\nready, and willing so to testify. I have never in my life met a doctor or a lawyer or a business\nman of any other church or of any other denomination that had a testimony to bear\nconcerning this most important knowledge of all, our knowledge as Latter-day Saints of the\nfulness of our gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nThere has never been a question of a doubt in my mind that our Heavenly Father and his Son\nJesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30254\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30254)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30254)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>). I have stood on that spot. I have\nheard the testimonies of the leaders of this Church borne there. I have felt with all the feeling\nthere was within my being, that that was the Sacred Grove, and that that was where the\ngospel of Jesus Christ was again restored to mankind in this day and age. It shall be my hope\nand my desire that I shall ever be worthy in the sight of my Heavenly Father to retain the\ngood will and the confidence and the love of these my brethren who have called me into their\nquorum and that I may be an honor and a credit to my family and my people and be able to\nspread the gospel of Jesus Christ and to bear this testimony\nthroughout the world. I pray for this further blessing with the assistance of my Heavenly\nFather, in the name of Jesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
