We would then lose that which enables us to generate success in our lives. Proper use of our spiritual power line allows us to learn, to labor, to be obedient to law, and to love. While these capabilities lead to fulfillment, at the same time they also carry risk.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Power to Learn<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p8\" class=\"\">Consider the power to learn.

A sharp mind, misdirected, can cut into that line of spiritual power. Some \u201clearned\u201d souls delight in leading others astray, all in the so-called name of learning. Years later their victims may realize that they have climbed their ladder of learning, only to find it leaning against the wrong wall. A prophet of the Lord has counseled us on this point:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cO that cunning plan of the evil one!

Labor well spent increases our capacity to do. President Heber J.

So, in reality, competition forces us to improve. It deserves our praise and our gratitude. Without it we could not reach the heights that are otherwise ours to achieve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p17\" class=\"\">But our labor can be misdirected. One can be anxiously engaged in a meaningless cause. Or one can do something wrong a hundred times and call it experience! Some would avoid labor while pursuing the goals of wealth without working for it, or an honored position without preparing for it. The converted Lamanites taught this lesson: \u201cRather than shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives; and rather than take away from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than spend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with their hands.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125223\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125223)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125223)\">Alma 24:18<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Power of Obedience to Law<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p19\" class=\"\">Next, consider the power of obedience to law. One of the great applications of spiritual power is obeying the laws of both God and man. Freedom to act and mastery of our actions both emanate from law. \u201cWhen we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18207\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18207)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18207)\">D&amp;C 130:21<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p20\" class=\"\">I relearned that so well from President Kimball.

I remember a mother I met once as I made a professional house call. This woman was confined in an iron lung. The ravages of polio had effectively destroyed all the breathing muscles so that her life was completely dependent upon this large metal tank and the electrical motor that powered its noisy bellows.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p24\" class=\"\">While there, I watched her three children as they related to their mother. The oldest interrupted our work to ask permission to go to a friend\u2019s house for an hour. Later the second child asked her mother for help with arithmetic. Finally the youngest child, so small that she couldn\u2019t see her mother\u2019s face directly, looked up at her image in a mirror that had been placed over the mother\u2019s head and asked, \u201cMommy, may I have a cookie?\u201d I\u2019ve never forgotten that lesson on the power of love. This woman, virtually disabled and certainly incapable of any degree of physical enforcement of parental authority, sweetly influenced that home solely with the power to love!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p25\" class=\"\">The power of love between a man and a woman is special. The love shared with my beloved companion, Dantzel, has increased the power of love for both of us. That love brought us to the altar in the temple of the Lord. Her love for me motivated her to teach school during the early years of our marriage. When things were tight, she held a second job at night. Once when things were exceptionally tight, she even sold her blood in between her two jobs to keep us solvent. (Her dear parents may have wondered what kind of a son-in-law they had on that occasion!) I thought of that many years later when she needed a transfusion urgently and her blood couldn\u2019t be matched readily with donor blood from the blood bank. What a privilege it was for me to donate mine directly to her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p26\" class=\"\">Can the power to love be misused? Sadly, yes. The illegitimate union of the sexes has, in my observation, been one of the greatest causes of grief. In some instances, the improper use of this sacred physical endowment has even destroyed its use in later years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p27\" class=\"\">Misused, the power of love can cut off spiritual power. The abuse of the power to love can result in no love at all. Only its cheap facsimiles of lewdness and lust remain in the wake of pleasure without conscience. Instead of feasting at the banquet table of bounteous love with his own posterity, one is left with scraps from the table\u2014only the refuse from what might have been.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p28\" class=\"\">The ashes of burned \u201clove\u201d smolder with the smoke of sadness.
