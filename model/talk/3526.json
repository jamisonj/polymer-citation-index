I am sure the Lord is much concerned about the families of the earth today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/turning-the-hearts.p4\" class=\"\">The family is the basic unit of society, and more importantly it is the basic unit of exaltation. It seems that nothing is more important to the Lord than a family. He has designed the greatest blessings for His children to be received through families, and the temple, of course, is the means of creating these eternal, exalted families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/turning-the-hearts.p5\" class=\"\">I believe that families are under a more serious attack today than at any time since the beginning of the world, with the possible exception of the days of Noah. It must have been bad then too. Maybe we today are not quite as bad as they were. Moses recorded in the Book of Genesis: \u201cAnd God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23952\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23952)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23952)\">Gen. 6:5<\/a><\/span>.) I don\u2019t believe I have ever known anyone quite that bad, whose \u201cevery thought was evil continually.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/turning-the-hearts.p6\" class=\"\">The Lord further indicated that all flesh was corrupt in those days, and so he brought forth the flood and destroyed all flesh except Noah and his family. Therefore, we are all descendants of righteous Noah. But the family concept is under very serious attack today all over the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/turning-the-hearts.p7\" class=\"\">The Lord said from Mt.

This earth was created so God the Father would have a place to send His children to receive bodies of flesh and bones and prove themselves. If we will no longer permit the Lord to send his children to this earth, then the earth is wasted, and as in the days of the flood He will surely destroy it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">So what must we do?

I am sure you will never turn your own children\u2019s hearts more to you than you will by keeping a journal and writing your personal history. They will ultimately love to find out about your successes and your failures and your peculiarities. It will tell them a lot about themselves, too. They will get a great desire to raise a family of their own when they see what a great blessing they were to you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/turning-the-hearts.p20\" class=\"\">Also, I seriously doubt that you will ever turn your own heart more to your own fathers than by writing your family history. You must know a lot about them before you can write it. This will lead you to much in-depth research. I promise you will love them when you become acquainted with them. They were noble people, and they sacrificed much to give you the heritage you have today. They deserve the best you can give them, which of course is membership in the Church and the kingdom of God and the sealing of their loved ones to them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/turning-the-hearts.p21\" class=\"\">I am convinced that these records we are commanded to write are absolutely vital, not only to the salvation of our ancestors but also to ours, for are we not to be judged out of the books which John saw were to be opened, as recorded in <span class=\"citation\" id=\"42525\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42525)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42525)\">Revelation 20:12<\/a><\/span>?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/turning-the-hearts.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/turning-the-hearts.p23\" class=\"\">After quoting this verse from Revelation, the Prophet Joseph Smith said, as recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 128:7\u20138 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17697\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17697)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17697)\">D&amp;C 128:7\u20138<\/a><\/span>]:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/turning-the-hearts.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cYou will discover in this quotation that the <span class=\"emphasis\">books<\/span> were opened; and another book was opened, which was the book of life; but the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the <span class=\"emphasis\">books,<\/span> according to their works; consequently, the <span class=\"emphasis\">books<\/span> spoken of must be the books which contained the record of their works, and refer to the records which are kept on the earth. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/turning-the-hearts.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cNow, the nature of this ordinance consists in the power of the priesthood, by the revelation of Jesus Christ, wherein it is granted that whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

How glorious to live upon the earth at this time and have part in the grand work of rearing the Lord\u2019s house in nations around the world so the saving ordinances of the gospel and the ties that bind eternal families may be made available to all the children of the earth! Surely we are the most blessed people who have ever lived, to which I bear witness in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
