Likewise, a Levite, who in that day assisted the priests, passed him by. To the Jews in Jesus\u2019 day this unconcern for the victim in the parable was considered appropriate religious behavior. Their rabbinical teaching declared, \u201cWe are not to contrive the death of the Gentiles, but if they are in any danger of death we are not bound to deliver them, \u2026 for such a one is not thy neighbour\u201d (in <span class=\"emphasis\">A Commentary on the Holy Bible,<\/span> ed.

Many priesthood holders were called into the mission field on short notice. Some heard their names announced as missionaries in general conference without any forewarning. Thousands responded to the call to serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/my-neighbor-my-brother.p13\" class=\"\">We have heard President Benson tell of the call from \u201cBox B\u201d that came to his father. A letter from \u201cBox B\u201d in those days was a call from the First Presidency to serve a mission. President Benson\u2019s father answered that call\u2014leaving his wife and children\u2014which resulted in a powerful missionary spirit that came into that home that has blessed countless lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/my-neighbor-my-brother.p14\" class=\"\">Today, that call\u2014in the spirit of \u201cBox B\u201d\u2014has been extended to all young men. They are prepared from an early age to serve the Lord. Thousands upon thousands have responded. The spirit of \u201cBox B\u201d\u2014the call to serve\u2014rests not only on all young men and dedicated young women who desire to serve, but now it has also been extended\u2014and has been for some time\u2014to mature couples.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/my-neighbor-my-brother.p15\" class=\"\">Eleven years ago, President Spencer W.

We could use hundreds of couples. You just go and talk to your bishop,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat is all you need to do. Tell him, \u2018We are ready to go, if you can use us.\u2019 I think you will probably get a call\u201d (Talk given at dedication of Fair Oaks California Stake Center, 9 October 1976, quoted in Edward L.

But missionaries and a neighbor family touched their lives, and they were baptized. On their fortieth wedding anniversary they were sealed in the Atlanta Temple.

We should never minimize or underestimate our ability to deal with challenges placed before us. The size or complexity of challenges need not be a cause for alarm or despair. Human potentiality is perhaps the most squandered resource on earth, and possibly the least tapped.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/my-neighbor-my-brother.p26\" class=\"\">Perhaps second only in importance to acquiring a personal knowledge of God our Eternal Father and Jesus Christ, is our freedom and ability to learn, to meet problems with a capacity to comprehend and do!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/my-neighbor-my-brother.p27\" class=\"\">Many of you may not appreciate what you can do.
