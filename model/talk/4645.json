We all have moments when we are overwhelmed by circumstances or confused by the counsel we get from others, and we feel a great need to receive spiritual guidance, a great need to find the right path and do the right thing. In the scriptural preface to this latter-day dispensation, the Lord promised that if we would be humble in such times of need and turn to him for aid, we would \u201cbe made strong, and [be] blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from time to time.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18728\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18728)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18728)\">D&amp;C 1:28<\/a><\/span>.)

As every Latter-day Saint knows, the area near Palmyra, New York, had become a place of \u201cunusual excitement on the subject of religion\u201d during young Joseph\u2019s boyhood years there. Indeed, the entire district appeared to him to be affected by it, with \u201cgreat multitudes,\u201d he wrote, uniting themselves to the different religious parties and causing \u201cno small stir and division\u201d among the people. (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30693\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30693)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30693)\">JS\u2014H 1:5<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/blessed-from-on-high.p7\" class=\"\">For a boy who had barely turned fourteen, his search for the truth was made even more difficult and confusing because members of the Smith family differed in their religious preferences at the time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/blessed-from-on-high.p8\" class=\"\">Now, with that familiar background and setting, I invite you to consider these rather remarkable thoughts and feelings from a boy of such a tender age. He wrote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/blessed-from-on-high.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cDuring this time of great excitement my mind was called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness; but though my feelings were deep and often poignant, still I kept myself aloof from all these [factions] \u2026 ; so great were the confusion and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/blessed-from-on-high.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cMy mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and incessant. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/blessed-from-on-high.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cIn the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/blessed-from-on-high.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cWhile I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: <span class=\"emphasis\">If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/blessed-from-on-high.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cNever did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30694\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30694)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30694)\">JS\u2014H 1:8\u201312<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/blessed-from-on-high.p14\" class=\"\">Of course, what happened next changed the course of human history. Determining to \u201cask of God,\u201d young Joseph retired to a grove near his rural home. There, in answer to his fervent prayer, God, the Eternal Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ, visited Joseph and counseled him. That great manifestation, of which I humbly testify, answered many more questions for our dispensation than simply which church young Joseph should or should not join.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/blessed-from-on-high.p15\" class=\"\">But my purpose this morning is not to outline the first moments of the Restoration, though it is one of the most sacred stories in the scriptures. I wish, rather, simply to emphasize the impressive degree of spiritual sensitivity demonstrated by this very young and untutored boy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/blessed-from-on-high.p16\" class=\"\">How many of us, at fourteen or any age, could keep our heads steady and our wits calm with so many forces tugging and pulling on us, especially on such an important subject as our eternal salvation? How many of us could withstand the emotional conflict that might come when parents differ in their religious persuasions? How many of us, at fourteen or fifty, would search within our souls and search within holy writ to find answers to what the Apostle Paul called \u201cthe deep things of God\u201d? (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"793\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 793)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(793)\">1 Cor. 2:10<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/blessed-from-on-high.p17\" class=\"\">How remarkable\u2014at least it may seem remarkable to us in our day\u2014that this lad would turn profoundly to the scriptures and then to private prayer, perhaps the two greatest sources of spiritual insight and spiritual impression that are available universally to mankind. Certainly he was torn by differing opinions, but he was determined to do the right thing and determined to find the right way. He believed, as you and I must believe, that he could be taught and blessed from on high, as he was.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/blessed-from-on-high.p18\" class=\"\">But, we may say, Joseph Smith was a very special spirit, and his was a special case. What about the rest of us who may now be older\u2014at least older than fourteen\u2014and have not been destined to open a dispensation of the gospel? We also must make decisions and sort out confusion and cut through a war of words in a whole host of subjects that affect our lives. The world is full of such difficult decisions, and sometimes as we face them, we may feel our age or our infirmities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/blessed-from-on-high.p19\" class=\"\">Sometimes we may feel that our spiritual edge has grown dull. On some very trying days, we may even feel that God has forgotten us, has left us alone in our confusion and concern. But that feeling is no more justified for the older ones among us than it is for the younger and less experienced. God knows and loves us all. We are, every one of us, his daughters and his sons, and whatever life\u2019s lessons may have brought us, the promise is still true: \u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26348\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26348)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26348)\">James 1:5<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/blessed-from-on-high.p20\" class=\"\">For my second example, may I refer to one not nearly as young as Joseph Smith.
