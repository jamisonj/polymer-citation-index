A life filled with trials is no respecter of position in the Church or social standing in the community. Challenges come to the young and to the aged\u2014to the rich and to the poor\u2014to the struggling student or the genius scientist\u2014to the farmer, carpenter, lawyer, or doctor.

The father had been active in the Church as a boy, but during his teenage years had veered somewhat from his childhood pattern. After returning from the military service he married a lovely girl and presently children blessed their home. Without warning an undisclosed illness overcame their little four-year-old daughter. Within a very short time she was on the critical list in the hospital. In desperation and for the first time in many years the father went to his knees in prayer\u2014asking that her life be spared. As her condition worsened and he sensed that she would not live, the tone of the father\u2019s prayers changed\u2014he no longer asked that her life be spared\u2014but rather for a blessing of understanding\u2014\u201cLet thy will he done,\u201d he said. Soon the child was in a coma, indicating her hours on earth were few. Now, fortified with understanding and trust, the young parents asked for one more favor of the Lord. Would he allow her to awaken once more that they might hold her closely. The little one\u2019s eyes opened, her flail arms outstretched to her mother and then to her daddy for a final embrace. When the father laid her on the pillow to sleep till another morning, he knew their prayers had been answered\u2014a kind, understanding Father in heaven had filled their needs as he knew them to be. His will had been done\u2014they had gained understanding\u2014they were determined now to live that they might live again with her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/adversity-and-prayer.p12\" class=\"\">Do you remember the words of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith when he was having that great test of his faith in the Liberty Jail?

How do we overcome them? How are we magnified by them? There seems to be a reason why we lose our composure in adversity\u2014why we think we can no longer cope with what we\u2019re faced with here in this life. There is a reason why we give up, why we \u201cfall apart at the seams\u201d so to speak.

No man can stand alone in his struggle through life. Sometimes in discouragement our prayers, at best, become occasional or maybe not at all. Sometimes we forget or just don\u2019t care. Brigham Young once said, \u201cPrayer keeps man from sin, and sin keeps man from prayer.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/adversity-and-prayer.p23\" class=\"\">Some may be thinking that because they have a Word of Wisdom problem or because they have been dishonest or immoral\u2014because they have not prayed for years\u2014because of any reasons they now feel unworthy\u2014they may say, \u201cIt\u2019s too late, I\u2019ve made so many mistakes\u2014so why even try?\u201d To these we say, \u201cFor your own sake, give yourself another chance.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/adversity-and-prayer.p24\" class=\"\">Sincere prayer is the heart of a happy and productive life. Prayer strengthens faith. Prayer is the preparation for miracles. Prayer opens the door to eternal happiness. The Father of us all is personal, ever waiting to hear from us, as any loving father would his children. To learn to communicate with him, to learn to pray effectively, requires diligence and dedication and desire on our part. I wonder sometimes if we are willing to pay the price for an answer from the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/adversity-and-prayer.p25\" class=\"\">As we learn to develop this two-way communication, the standard of our life will improve. We will see things more clearly, we will try harder to do better, we will see the real joy that can come through trials and testing. Although problems will still be with us, peace, contentment, and true happiness will be ours in abundance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/adversity-and-prayer.p26\" class=\"\">As you feel the need to confide in the Lord or to improve the quality of your visits with him\u2014to pray, if you please\u2014may I suggest a process to follow: go where you can be alone, go where you can think, go where you can kneel, go where you can speak out loud to him. The bedroom, the bathroom, or the closet will do. Now, picture him in your mind\u2019s eye. Think to whom you are speaking, control your thoughts\u2014don\u2019t let them wander, address him as your Father and your friend. Now tell him things you really feel to tell him\u2014not trite phrases that have little meaning, but have a sincere, heartfelt conversation with him. Confide in him, ask him for forgiveness, plead with him, enjoy him, thank him, express your love to him, and then listen for his answers. Listening is an essential part of praying. Answers from the Lord come quietly\u2014ever so quietly. In fact, few hear his answers audibly with their ears. We must be listening so carefully or we will never recognize them. Most answers from the Lord are felt in our heart as a warm comfortable expression, or they may come as thoughts to our mind. They come to those who are prepared and who are patient.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/adversity-and-prayer.p27\" class=\"\">Yes, the trials will still be there; but with the companionship of the Spirit, our approach to trials will change frustrations and heartaches to blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/adversity-and-prayer.p28\" class=\"\">Just for a moment, think with me.
