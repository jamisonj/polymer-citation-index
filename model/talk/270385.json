If you have not got some of my communications, it has not been my fault.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">Agreeably to your orders, I assembled the Nauvoo Legion for the protection of Nauvoo and\n  the surrounding country against an armed band of marauders, and ever since they have been\n  mustered I have almost daily communicated with you in regard to all the leading events that have\n  transpired; and whether in the capacity of mayor of the city, or lieutenant-general of the Nauvoo\n  Legion, I have striven to preserve the peace and administer even-handed justice to all; but my\n  motives are impugned, my acts are misconstrued, and I am grossly and wickedly misrepresented.\n  I suppose I am indebted for my incarceration here to the oath of a worthless man that was\n  arraigned before me and fined for abusing and maltreating his lame, helpless brother.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">That I should be charged by you, sir, who know better, of acting contrary to law, is to me a\n  matter of surprise. Was it the Mormons or our enemies who first commenced these difficulties?\n  You know well it was not us; and when this turbulent, outrageous people commenced their\n  insurrectionary movements, I made you acquainted with them, officially, asked your advice, and\n  have followed strictly your counsel in every particular.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">Who ordered out the Nauvoo Legion? I did, under your direction. For what purpose? To\n  suppress these insurrectionary movements. It was at your instance, sir, that I issued a\n  proclamation calling upon the Nauvoo Legion to be in readiness, at a moment&rsquo;s warning, to\n  guard against the incursions of mobs, and gave an order to Jonathan Dunham, acting\n  major-general, to that effect. Am I then to be charged for the acts of others; and because\n  lawlessness and mobocracy abound, am I when carrying out your instructions, to be charged\n  with not abiding the law? Why is it that I must be held accountable for other men&rsquo;s acts?<span class=\"footRef\">1<\/span> If there\n  is trouble in the country, neither I nor my people made it, and all that we have ever done, after<\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"114910\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 114910)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(114910)\">D&amp;C 88:108<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"116509\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 116509)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(116509)\">D&amp;C 134:1<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"117182\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117182)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117182)\">A of F 1:2<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
