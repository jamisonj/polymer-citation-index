I would like to talk about the art of making your marriage successful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p4\" class=\"\">Our Heavenly Father loves all of us and wants us to be happy. The scriptures record, \u201cMen are, that they might have joy.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3987\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3987)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3987)\">2 Ne. 2:25<\/a><\/span>.) President Kimball has told us that the price of happiness is to keep the commandments. (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Faith Precedes the Miracle,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1972, p. 126.) Nowhere else are happiness and success more important than in your marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p5\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">The foundation for a happy and successful marriage<\/span> is a marriage solemnized in the temple. To you who were married for time only, let me urge you to thoroughly investigate the blessings available to you by going to the temple and having your family sealed to you for time and all eternity. Participating in these sacred ordinances should be your most important objective for achieving a successful marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p6\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">When our Heavenly Father permitted us to come to this earth,<\/span> He gave us our free agency, allowing us to make our own decisions. He also furnished us with guidelines to help us live righteously.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p7\" class=\"\">In His wisdom He gives us many problems, for He knows that by meeting them and finding solutions we will gain knowledge and skills, develop character, and learn to overcome evil, all of which will help us while we are here on earth, as well as in the life hereafter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p8\" class=\"\">We should, therefore, look at problems in marriage as opportunities for growth and development. As we meet the challenges successfully, we will enjoy peace, love, and tranquility in our marriage and in our home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p9\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">One of the first things a couple must do<\/span> is establish and maintain good relations with each other. If you want to be sweethearts, you must work at it. I admonish every one of you to do everything possible to make your companion happy. Be kind and considerate of each other. When problems arise, talk things over calmly and resolve differences promptly. On one occasion Elder Gordon B. Hinckley said that quiet speech in the home is the language of peace. (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Conference Report,<\/span> Apr. 1971, p. 82.) President McKay used to say that we should never yell at each other in the home. And then, facetiously, he would add that maybe on one occasion it would be all right and that would be if the house were on fire. (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Stepping Stones to an Abundant Life,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1971, p. 294.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p10\" class=\"\">Sometimes it is difficult for us to understand why our mates don\u2019t see things the same and arrive at the same conclusions as we do. People are different in their thinking and their understanding, and opinions often vary. Differences must be reconciled promptly if husbands and wives are to be happy and work as a team together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p11\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">To achieve a successful marriage<\/span> it is important to reach an understanding on what is expected of each of the marriage partners. Ordinarily the husband is the breadwinner, and he should be willing to work hard and to do all in his power to properly take care of the financial needs of his family. Such needs should be discussed and priorities set for the welfare of the entire family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p12\" class=\"\">The wife is the homemaker. It is her responsibility to see that a clean, orderly home is maintained. Some divorces have occurred where the wife becomes indifferent about her personal appearance, or becomes a careless housekeeper, or both. I cannot stress too strongly to the sisters the importance of personal cleanliness, good appearance, and maintaining a clean, orderly home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p13\" class=\"\">In the beginning, if the wife\u2019s health permits, she is often temporarily employed outside the home. When this is the case, the husband should help with the housekeeping chores. If a man truly loves his wife, he will not want or allow her to work more than her health and strength permit. He will want to help her in every possible way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p14\" class=\"\">When I was a young man, my wife would ask me to come and help her with the dishes, with making the beds, or with other household chores. Now, at this time in our lives, I ask her to come and help me wash the dishes, make the beds, and perform other household chores. The important thing is to work together and help each other.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p15\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">By your actions let everyone know you love each other.<\/span> Demonstrate consideration at all times. Brethren, open the door of the car for your wife or companion. When you enter or leave a building together, open the door and have her go in first. Help her to be seated before you are seated.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p16\" class=\"\">Sometimes our ladies don\u2019t allow us time to perform such courtesies. My advice to you sisters is to take the extra time. If you jump out of the car a few times without his help, he will probably expect you to come and open the door for him. Sisters would do well to remember that a husband generally treats his wife the way she expects to be treated.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p17\" class=\"\">Money management is very important. I\u2019d like to give you four guides that I think would be helpful in this respect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p18\" class=\"\">1. <span class=\"emphasis\">First, always pay your tithing.<\/span> Keep yourself eligible for the great blessings the Lord has promised to those who obey this commandment. He made this statement in the scriptures:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32850\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32850)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32850)\">Mal. 3:10<\/a><\/span>.) I testify to you that this is true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p20\" class=\"\">2. <span class=\"emphasis\">Next, pay yourself something off the top.<\/span> Save something out of every dollar you earn. I suggest your goal be no less than ten percent of your income after you have paid the Lord His share.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p21\" class=\"\">Brigham Young once said: \u201cIf you wish to get rich, save what you get. A fool can earn money; but it takes a wise man to save and dispose of it to his own advantage.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> sel. John A. Widtsoe, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1941, p. 292.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p22\" class=\"\">3. <span class=\"emphasis\">Next, avoid using credit cards and charge accounts<\/span> for installment purchases. We are all being urged to \u201cbuy now pay later.\u201d This makes it sound easy and even glamorous to surround ourselves with luxuries before they are earned. My advice to all is to <span class=\"emphasis\">save<\/span> now and <span class=\"emphasis\">buy<\/span> later. This will not only save a high interest charge, but it will also keep couples out of financial bondage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p23\" class=\"\">Our late President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., advised us: \u201cLet us avoid debt as we would avoid a plague; where we are now in debt let us get out of debt; if not today, then tomorrow. Let us straitly and strictly live within our incomes, and save a little.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Conference Report,<\/span> Apr. 1937, p. 26.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p24\" class=\"\">4. <span class=\"emphasis\">Budget your income and outgo and do not live beyond your means.<\/span> To consistently spend more than you earn makes it impossible to keep solvent and difficult to control your \u201cwants.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p25\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Young couples especially should establish priorities.<\/span> In establishing priorities, remember that the family always comes first and foremost in your life.

Learn to walk in the company of good people; shun evil by staying out of the devil\u2019s territory.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/making-your-marriage-successful.p31\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Next, be honest in all matters.<\/span> Be honest with your spouse, with your family, with yourself, and with your neighbor.
