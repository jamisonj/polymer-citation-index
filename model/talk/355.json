I love to meet with the Latter-day Saints. I have a great\nappreciation in my heart for you fine people and for your kindness to me as I am privileged\nto visit in the various stakes of Zion.\n<\/p><p>\nFINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS\n<\/p><p>\nIn trying to think what I might say today that could be an encouragement or help to you, I\nthought I might say a few words on our financial and temporal obligations to the Church\nbecause they are many, and there are some among us who feel that they are heavy. One stake\npresident said: \"It costs a lot to be a member of this Church,\" and I have thought a great deal\nof it. I have thought of the payment of our tithing, our fast offerings, our welfare\ncontributions, our ward budget, our great missionary work, the building of our chapels and\ntemples and places of worship, the temple work we are doing, and genealogical work, and I\nfeel as many of you do that when we consecrate all that we have to the building up of the\nkingdom of God it really is a substantial thing as far as our temporal obligations and\nresponsibilities are concerned.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith that he had never given a temporal\ncommandment unto his children, that all of his commandments were spiritual\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12440\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12440)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12440)\">D&amp;C 29:34<\/a><\/span>), for they all\nhave a spiritual meaning and a spiritual development and a spiritual purpose, because behind\nall that the Lord is attempting to do in the earth, he has indicated that\n<\/p><p>\n. . . this is my work and my glory&mdash;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38953\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38953)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38953)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd hence, all of his commandments have been given for the achievement and the\naccomplishment of that great objective.\n<\/p><p>\n\"NO MAN CAN SERVE TWO MASTERS\"\n<\/p><p>\nHowever, the Lord has made some definite statements with respect to temporal things and our\nresponsibility therein. That is, I suppose, what Jesus meant when he said:\n<\/p><p>\nNo man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he\nwill hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34194\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34194)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34194)\">Matt. 6:24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI take it he understood that in the lives of most men the time would come when they might\nhave to make a choice as to whether or not they should choose God or mammon, and it is my\nconviction and my testimony that when we make the choice, if we choose to serve the Lord,\nit is just like forming a partnership with him. He will be on our side, he will see us through;\nand I wonder sometimes if we really sacrifice when we choose to serve the Lord, rather than\nto serve mammon, and make the necessary effort and contributions required to show our faith\nin him.\n<\/p><p>\nYou will recall that before the Lord needed any financial help to promote the interests of his\nkingdom in the earth he gave unto Cain and Abel the law of sacrifice. The Lord did not need\nthe fruits of the field from Cain nor the first of the flocks from Abel, but they needed to give\nit; they needed to put their faith to the test. They needed to be able to show to God whether\nthey served and chose God or mammon, for you cannot serve two masters.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd you will recall that Cain brought of the fruit of the field, and his offering was not\nacceptable to the Lord, and Abel brought the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. We\nare told that Abel's offering was accepted. We do not know just why Cain's was not;\nprobably he did not bring the best of his field, but at any rate, he was very much perturbed\nand put out when his offering was not accepted, and hardness entered into his heart. The light\nof the Lord left him, and he turned to that terrible sin of murdering his own brother\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23533\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23533)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23533)\">Gen. 4:2-8<\/a><\/span>). And the\nLord indicated to Cain when he expressed his displeasure:\n<\/p><p>\n\"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23534\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23534)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23534)\">Gen. 4:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe often see in our midst brethren who turn away from the Lord, who cease to pay their\ntithes and their offerings, who neglect to prove to God that they love him better than they\nlove mammon, and darkness comes into their lives, and they do things that are not pleasing to\nthe Lord. They walk in the ways of darkness and cease to help to build the kingdom of God\nin the earth\n<\/p><p>\nEXPERIENCE OF JOB\n<\/p><p>\nYou will recall the experience of Job when the devil came to the Lord and the Lord said:\n\"Hast thou considered my servant Job?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26649\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26649)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26649)\">Job 1:8<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd the devil rather laughingly said, in substance:\n<\/p><p>\nOh, that is easy. You have surrounded him with so much. You have given him everything. No\nwonder he is your friend, but just let me take it away from him.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord gave him the privilege; told him he might take everything away if he would just\nspare his life (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26650\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26650)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26650)\">Job 1:9-12<\/a><\/span>).\nSo he took everything away, his lands and his herds, and his buildings were\nburned, and his family died, and when his body was afflicted and sore, he lay there\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26651\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26651)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26651)\">Job 1:13-19<\/a><\/span>), and his\nwife said unto him: \"Dost thou still retain thine integrity?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26652\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26652)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26652)\">Job 2:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren and sisters, I would like to read the testimony that came from Job. I think it is\none of the most beautiful things that we have in holy writ, for this is what Job said:\n<\/p><p>\nOh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!\n<\/p><p>\nThat they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! For I know that my\nredeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd though after my skin worms destroy this body; yet in my flesh shall I see God:\n<\/p><p>\nWhom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26653\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26653)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26653)\">Job 19:23-27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIs there any amount of wealth in this world that could take the place of that positive assurance\nthat Job had in his heart, as a friend of God, through the testimony of the Holy Ghost, that\nthough his body should be destroyed yet in his flesh should he see God&mdash;whom he should see\nfor himself?\n<\/p><p>\nMALACHI'S ADMONITION\n<\/p><p>\nMalachi gives us this call back to service of the Lord in the matter of the payment of our\ntithes and our offerings. I think the third chapter of Malachi was directed entirely to the\npeople of this generation, for he begins that he would send his angel to prepare the way for\nhis coming, and then he should come swiftly to his temple&mdash;that did not occur in the meridian\nof time&mdash;and that he should come cleansing and purifying as refiner's fire and as fuller's soap\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32711\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32711)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32711)\">Mal. 3:1-2<\/a><\/span>),\nand then he invites all Israel to return unto him, and they say: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . Wherein shall we return?\n<\/p><p>\nWill a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In\ntithes and offerings.\n<\/p><p>\nYe are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32714\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32714)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32714)\">Mal. 3:7-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I presume there is not one here today who realizes what the truth of that statement was,\nfor I think there was no church or people in all the world paying tithes at the time the Church\nwas restored in these latter days, when the Lord sent his angel to call them back to serve him.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then the Lord said:\n<\/p><p>\nBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove\nme now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and\npour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke\nthe devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall\nyour vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of\nhosts (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32715\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32715)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32715)\">Mal. 3:10-13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA DELIGHTSOME LAND\n<\/p><p>\nBrothers and sisters, when we think of the condition of this land when our pioneer fathers\ncame here, has not the Lord fulfilled his promise; has he not made it a delightsome land\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32716\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32716)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32716)\">Mal. 3:12<\/a><\/span>); has\nhe not proved that he would keep his promise? The Lord has indicated that he is bound when\nwe do what he says, but when we do not what he says, then have we no promise\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12483\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12483)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12483)\">D&amp;C 82:10<\/a><\/span>). The Lord\nhas made this a delightsome land, and all nations who know us and know of our prosperity\ncall us blessed, and out of this land we are able to send forth the gospel message, as David of\nold saw, unto the inhabitants of the earth, for David said:\n<\/p><p>\nOut of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41749\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41749)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41749)\">Ps. 50:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is one part of that third chapter of Malachi that we do not usually hear much about, and\nI would like to read it to you today.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter the Lord said that all nations should call us blessed, he adds:\n<\/p><p>\nYour words have been stout against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so\nmuch against thee?\n<\/p><p>\nYe have said, It is vain to serve God: [and we hear that occasionally in our midst] and what\nprofit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the\nLord of hosts?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that\ntempt God are even delivered (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32717\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32717)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32717)\">Mal. 3:13-15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE\n<\/p><p>\nIn other words, as the scriptures say, the rain falls upon the just and the unjust\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34191\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34191)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34191)\">Matt. 5:45<\/a><\/span>), and when we\nsee the unjust in our midst enjoying blessings of the Lord, sometimes, in our own estimation,\nbeyond even the blessings of him who walks in His ways and keeps his commandments, we\nbegin to argue whether or not it pays to serve the Lord. That is what Malachi saw, and the\nLord heard them, and said:\n<\/p><p>\nThen they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard\nit, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that\nthought upon his name.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I\nwill spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.\n<\/p><p>\nThen shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that\nserveth God and him that serveth him not (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32718\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32718)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32718)\">Mal. 3:16-18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to see every friend of mine in this Church have his name recorded in that book\nof remembrance, and I am sure that when he comes to claim his jewels, he will realize that no\nsacrifice that has ever been required at his hands could compensate for the lack of that very\nthing, for they will be numbered among his jewels. That is what I think being partners with\nhim means.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a promise! What a promise that he will bless the land! I wonder as we go about our\ndaily duties from day to day if we are able to realize how much of the joy and the happiness\nand the success that is ours in life is really ours by virtue of our own doings and how much\nof it is the result of the blessings of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nREDEMPTION OF ZION\n<\/p><p>\nDo you remember the statement of Daniel Webster about this western part of America, when\nhe said that he would not vote one cent from the public treasury to place the Pacific coast one\ninch nearer Boston than it was then? And Jim Bridger, when Brigham Young met him, said\nthat he would give one thousand dollars if he only knew we could raise an ear of corn in\nthese valleys, but Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the prophets of old, had seen the prosperity of Zion in\nthese valleys of the mountains. The Prophet Joseph had declared that the Saints would\ncontinue to suffer persecution and be driven, and many would apostatize, and some would be\nput to death, and that they should ultimately be driven to the Rocky Mountains, and here they\nshould become a mighty people in the Rocky Mountains.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to read to you two brief statements from Isaiah with respect to what the Lord promised\nto do in the redemption of this wilderness, to make it blossom as the rose\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25072\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25072)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25072)\">Isa. 35:1<\/a><\/span>), and I want to say\nto you it is a miracle in my mind the part \"water\" was to play in the redemption of latter-day\nZion.\n<\/p><p>\nIsaiah said: \"Behold, I will do a new thing,\" and as far as my understanding of this scripture\nis concerned, that new thing was the great principle of irrigation. It is true the Saints had to\nmake the canals, they had to make the ditches, they had to put in the dams, but the land\nmight have remained arid had not the Lord put into their minds the inspiration to do this very\nthing, and that is what Isaiah saw that the Lord would do. He said:\n<\/p><p>\nBehold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even\nmake a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.\n<\/p><p>\nThe beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the\nwilderness, and rivers in the desert . . .\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25075\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25075)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25075)\">Isa. 43:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf you want to see the rivers in the desert, just go up through Idaho and see the great canals\nthat come out of the Snake River. They are greater than many of the rivers of the land.\n<\/p><p>\n[The Lord has done this] . . . to give drink to my people, my chosen. This people have I\nformed for myself; they shall show forth my praise\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25076\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25076)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25076)\">Isa. 43:20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Isaiah states:\n<\/p><p>\nI will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make\nthe wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.\n<\/p><p>\nThat they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the\nLord hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25074\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25074)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25074)\">Isa. 41:18,20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSo as you brethren gather in your crops by day in the harvest time, remember that it was the\nLord God of Israel who did this new thing in this great wilderness to make it to prosper as a\nrose and to be a land that would attract the attention of all the world.\n<\/p><p>\nPRESIDENT GRANT'S EXPERIENCE\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I would like to remind you of a little statement that President Grant used to make often.\nHe said:\n<\/p><p>\nI believe that to those who are liberal, the Lord gives ideas, and they grow in capacity and\nability more rapidly than those who are stingy. I have that faith and I have had it from the\ntime I was a boy.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe the Lord gives ideas to men who are liberal and men who have desires to serve God,\nand those who choose to serve the God of Israel rather than the God of mammon, and I\nremind you of President Grant's story. It impressed me when I was a boy. When he heard\nBishop Woolley, President Clark's grandfather, in a fast meeting ask the Saints to be liberal\nin their contributions, he promised them that, if they would be liberal, the Lord would bless\nthem four-fold.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Grant was then only a boy. He had fifty dollars in his pocket. He was working at\nthe Zion's Savings Bank and intended to deposit it, but he handed it to the bishop, and the\nbishop wrote him a receipt for five dollars and gave him forty-five dollars change, but\nPresident Grant indicated that he wanted to pay it all. He wanted to put the Lord in his debt,\nbecause his mother needed two hundred dollars, and, if he paid fifty and he got four-fold, he\nwould have his two hundred dollars. And Bishop Woolley said: \"Do you believe, Heber, that\nyou will get your two hundred dollars sooner if you give this fifty dollars to the Lord?''\n<\/p><p>\nHe said: \"I do.\" And the bishop wrote him a receipt for the other forty-five dollars, and on\nthe way back to the bank he got an idea. Where did he get it from? He might never have\nreceived it had he not paid the fifty dollars. God Almighty sends ideas and he has regard for\neach one of his children individually. President Grant wired a man in the East, and in a few\ndays he sold him enough bonds to make $218.50 profit, so when he paid the tithing on it the\nLord had given him his two hundred dollars and almost enough to pay the tithing.\n<\/p><p>\nTESTIMONY OF LAW OF TITHING\n<\/p><p>\nI met a man in the East when I was there on a short-term mission. I noticed that he paid a\nlarge tithing and that he was very regular in the payment of his tithing, and I said,\n<\/p><p>\nBrother so-and-so, you must have a wonderful testimony of the law of tithing, and he said, \"I\nhave.\" \n<\/p><p>\nI said: \"Would you tell me?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well,\" he said, \"my wife and children joined the Church a few years ago in England but I\ndidn't join because I did not have enough faith to pay my tithing, and I did not want to be a\nhypocrite. And so,\" he said, \"one day when one of the young missionaries was being released,\nhe came to me and said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Brother so-and-so, I want to baptize you before I go home.\" \n<\/p><p>\nAnd I said, \"You cannot.\" \n<\/p><p>\n\"Why not?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I have not the faith to pay my tithing, and I am not going to join the Church\nuntil I have.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then that young elder spoke up, under the influence of the Spirit of the Lord, and the\nLord heeded his words and his promise when he said: \"Brother so-and-so, if you will let me\nbaptize you before I go home, I promise you that within a year from now you will be in\nAmerica earning three times as much as you are earning today.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI said: \"All right, where shall we go? That is good enough for me. If you are a servant of the\nLord, I will take your promise.\" \"Now,\" he said, \"I did not see how in the world it could be\nfulfilled, because I was under contract to work for my company for three years, and I knew I\nwould not break my contract.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis was during the first world war when we had great difficulty here in America to get dyes\nthat would hold their color, and we sent representatives from America to England to get dye\nworkers. They went to this man's father, and his father said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"I am not interested, but I have a son who may be.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThey went to the son. The son said: \"I cannot go. I am under contract with my company.\" \n<\/p><p>\n\"Well, if we will buy you off, will you go?\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he said, \"Yes.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Now,\" he said, \"to make the story short, the Lord just threw in a little for good measure.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Within a year I was in America with my family, and I was earning four times as much as I\nwas when that young elder made me that promise.\"\n<\/p><p>\nTHE LORD FULFILLS HIS PROMISES\n<\/p><p>\nI told the elders, where it has been my privilege to preside in the mission field, if they wanted\nto see what the Lord did in the way of fulfilling his promises just to keep their eyes open as\nthey went around among the Saints&mdash;those who kept the commandments, paid their tithes and\ntheir offerings&mdash;and compare them with those who failed, and they would know that the Lord\nis true to his promises.\n<\/p><p>\nI say to you brothers and you sisters, may God bless you, and when you give, remember you\nare only giving to show your loyalty to him whom you have chosen to serve, for \"No man\ncan serve two masters\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34195\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34195)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34195)\">Matt. 6:24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you all, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
