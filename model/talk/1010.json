I desire this morning to\nrecount one of them. I had the opportunity to go to the Holy Land last July, a privilege which\nI had desired for many years. My son was released from the Swiss-Austrian Mission, having\ncompleted two and one-half years' service. I joined him and three other outstanding elders,\nand the five of us went to the places made famous and sacred through the life of the Master.\n<\/p><p>\nWe were met at the airport at Tel Aviv by a very outstanding man named Joseph, a Jew who\nhad fled from Germany at the time that Hitler killed four or five million of those unfortunate\npeople. Joseph spoke several languages fluently. He was a very cultured person, a historian by\nprofession before he left Germany. He was familiar with the history of Palestine, both the\necclesiastical and the profane, and of course he told us about numerous historical events in a\nvery pleasing and faith-promoting way.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we entered the Holy City, we were psychologically and spiritually prepared for the\nwonderful experiences that we were to have that day and the following few days while in\nIsrael. I said to my traveling companions, \"I have a feeling of peace and contentment such as\nI have experienced only a few times in my life. It is a feeling similar to one that I had the\nfirst time I entered the Sacred Grove or when I go into the house of the Lord.\"\n<\/p><p>\nEach of these young men said, \"We are experiencing a similar feeling.\"\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph, our guide, took us from place to place in Jerusalem and described many of the\nimportant events that had taken place in ancient times, especially those that pertained to the\nlife of Jesus. My traveling companions hummed the tune, \"I walked today where Jesus\nwalked.\" We were thrilled when we were shown the traditional place where\nChrist was born in Bethlehem, the place in Jerusalem where he was crucified, the spot where\nhe was buried and where he later rose from the grave. We were reminded that he met Mary\nMagdalene near the tomb before he ascended to heaven. All of these events as well as\nnumerous other important events which had occurred in the Holy City were explained to us in\na masterful way.\n<\/p><p>\nWe went northward to Galilee. There we saw many marvelous things which recalled to our\nmemories important events connected with the life of Christ. One outstanding experience that\ncomes to my mind vividly at this moment occurred in Nazareth. We were standing in front of\nwhat is known as \"Mary's Well,\" the place, according to our guide, where Mary, when a girl\nwent to get water just as the girls do in that part of the world today. During the past few days\nwe had eagerly listened to Joseph's accounts of the events that had occurred during the life of\nJesus of Nazareth. He had told these stories with great faith.\n<\/p><p>\nI said to him, \"Joseph, I would like to ask you a question.\" As I think about it, it appears, I\nrealize, that I perhaps was a little unfair in taking advantage of him as I did.\n<\/p><p>\nHe replied, \"If I can answer your question, I will be very happy to do so.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI then said, \"You have told us about the miraculous things that took place at the birth of John\nthe Baptist and explained these things with much faith. You have told about the Angel\nGabriel's appearance to Mary, announcing the birth of Christ and declaring that he would be\nthe Son of God. You have told about the birth of Jesus, and have showed us the place where\nthe shepherds were feeding their flocks, as well as the place where Christ was born in a\nmanger. You have told us about the new star that appeared at his birth and about the wise\nmen who came to see him soon thereafter. You have told us about Christ's various visits to\nthe temple from the time he was twelve years old until his last visit there shortly before his\ncrucifixion. You have taken us to the room which is claimed to be the one in which Jesus and\nhis apostles ate the Last Supper. You maintained that that was the place where Christ had\nappeared to the apostles the day of his resurrection. You reminded us that the doors and\nwindows were shut and locked, and yet he suddenly stood in their midst. Jesus observed that\nthe apostles thought that he was a spirit. Perceiving their thoughts, he said, '. . . handle me,\nand see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have'\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31516\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31516)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31516)\">Luke 24:39<\/a><\/span>). You showed\nus Golgotha, the Place of the Skulls, and said, 'There is where Christ was crucified.' And\nthen you told us that Jesus had been taken down from the cross and buried in Joseph of\nArimathea's tomb. You pointed out a spot in a swale to the south of Golgotha where it is\nclaimed that Christ was buried. Then you said that an angel came to the tomb and rolled the\nstone away from the door and that Christ was resurrected from the dead and appeared first to\nMary Magdalene. You have repeated to us many passages of scripture related to the\nimportance of Christ's ministry. For example, 'Jesus saith unto her [Mary], Touch me not for\nI am not yet ascended to my Father: but go tell my brethren and say unto them, I ascend to\nmy Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God'\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27885\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27885)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27885)\">John 20:17<\/a><\/span>). This famous\nstatement declares the universal brotherhood of man and the Fatherhood of God.\n<\/p><p>\n\"You said that Jesus did ascend into heaven, and then you declared that later he descended to\nearth to visit his apostles. You pointed out that he appeared to several groups of people\nfollowing his resurrection. And you have shown us the place of his final ascension.\n<\/p><p>\n\"You have said that Christ healed the sick and raised the dead, and you have shown us\nvarious places where he did those miraculous things. You have claimed that Christ cast out\ndevils, restored sight to the blind, and performed all sorts of miracles. You showed us where\nhe stilled the waves on the Sea of Galilee, and where he walked on the waters of that same\nsea.\"\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph replied, \"Yes, I have explained these things to you.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI then remarked, \"This is my question: Do you actually believe that Jesus is\nthe Christ, the Savior of the world, the universal Messiah, your Savior, my Savior, and the\nSavior of the entire human family?\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe looked very perplexed, a little dumbfounded. When he regained his composure he replied,\n\"I suppose that since I am an orthodox Jew that in giving an answer to that question I am\nforced to say that I do not accept Jesus to be the Christ, the Savior of the world, your Savior\nand my Savior. The Jews regard Christ as a great prophet, one of the greatest that has ever\nlived, but they do not accept him as the real Messiah. We are looking for the Messiah to\ncome.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen I said, \"Joseph, I want to bear witness to you that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the\nworld, the only true and living Messiah. All the things you have told us are true&mdash;those\nthings recorded in the New Testament which you have accounted with much faith. Jesus\nChrist broke the bands of death; he not only rose from the grave, being the first fruits of the\nresurrection, but he also made it possible for all human beings, regardless of how righteously\nor how wickedly they live, to rise from the grave. And furthermore, he gave us the gospel of\nJesus Christ, a plan of salvation, promising that if we render obedience to it and remain\nfaithful to the end, we shall come back into his presence and dwell with the Father and the\nSon forever. Jesus did ascend into heaven. He now sits on the right hand of the Father, where\nhe reigns as our Lord, our God, our Judge, and our Savior.\"\n<\/p><p>\nCuriously he asked: \"How do you know that all of these things are true?\"\n<\/p><p>\nI replied, \"First, I know these things are true through the power of the Holy Ghost. The Holy\nGhost has borne witness to my heart that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world; and so I\nam as certain that he is as I am sure that I am alive. It is only through the power of the Holy\nGhost that any person can declare Jesus to be the Christ, and that we can know that he is the\nOnly Begotten of the Father.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Second, following Christ's death and resurrection, he appeared to another branch of Israel\nover in America. These people were called the Nephites. Their ancestors had come from\nJerusalem.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then I described the great storm, the earthquakes, the intense darkness, and terrific\ndestruction that took place on the western hemisphere at the time of Christ's crucifixion. I\nthen told him about the Resurrected Lord's appearance to the inhabitants of ancient America,\nexplaining that he taught them the gospel and established his Church among the Nephites. I\nalso explained that for nearly two hundred years they were a righteous people, developing one\nof the most perfect societies that the world has ever known. Finally, those people dropped\ninto wickedness, and then the Nephites as a nation were destroyed by the Lamanites.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I further explained: \"My third reason for my positive conviction that Jesus is the Christ,\nthe Messiah, and Savior, lies in the fact that in the spring of 1820 he appeared to the Prophet\nJoseph Smith, a boy in the state of New York, at a place known today as the Sacred Grove.\nHe was accompanied on this glorious visitation by the Eternal Father\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30394\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30394)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30394)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17-20<\/a><\/span>). There he told the boy\nnot to join any existing church, but that he would be the instrument in the hands of God\nthrough which the true Church would be established in due time. During the following several\nyears, Joseph Smith was taught the true gospel of Jesus Christ through the ministration of\nangels and through visitations from Jesus Christ. Acting in accordance with divine command,\nthis prophet organized the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on the 6th day of April,\n1830. The Church was declared by the Lord to be 'the only true and living church in the\nworld with which he was well pleased'\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13706\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13706)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13706)\">D&amp;C 1:30<\/a><\/span>).\nThat Church was endowed with all the powers,\npriesthood, authority, doctrines, and ordinances that have been held by any and all\ndispensations from Adam's day down to the present time. It possesses all that is necessary and\nrequisite for the salvation and eternal exaltation of the human family.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Furthermore,\" I said, \"some day members of the Church of Jesus Christ will bring the gospel\nto your people, and then God's covenants with your ancient prophets will all be fulfilled.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAlso, I told him that when the Jews repent and accept the gospel of Jesus\nChrist, which, according to the ancient prophets, will take place at the time of the fulness of\nthe Gentiles, and when they look not for another Messiah to come but accept him who has\ncome as their Messiah, then God will remember the covenants made with their ancestors. At\nthat time missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, having the true\ngospel, will take that gospel to the Jews. Many of them will believe and accept Jesus as the\nChrist, the Messiah, the Savior of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nIn all sincerity, Joseph remarked: \"These are the most marvelous things I have ever listened to\nin my life. I would like to learn more.\" He asked for a copy of Orson Hyde's prayer when he\ndedicated the Holy Land for the return of the Jews, and also for a copy of the Book of\nMormon.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless us.\n<\/p><p>\nI know that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, that he is our Redeemer, our Lord\nand our God. May we keep his commandments and remain faithful unto the end, that we may\ncome back into his holy presence I pray in Jesus' name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
