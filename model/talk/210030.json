It was very late to put in any corn, but we wished to try the soil to see whether there was any virtue in it. We found it, however, like an ash heap. It seemed as though there had been no rain upon the land for years. We could dig down a great depth in many places, where this city now stands, without finding scarcely any moisture, but we succeeded by taking the water from the creek&#x2014;City Creek we call it&#x2014;in flooding a small portion of ground, and put in our potatoes, and planted corn, a few beans, garden seeds, etc., to see if there was any virtue in the soil. What were the results of our first crop? We found that there was fruitfulness in the soil; but of course it was too late for anything to be matured. The same fall, or autumn of 1847, several thousand of the Latter-day Saints followed up our track. They came upon the land in the fall of the year, bringing with them a little breadstuffs to sustain them during the winter, and also our farm utensils, and everything in the shape of wearing apparel that could be brought. We had not much to bring, for we had already been driven four or five times in the United States, from our houses and from our lands;  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"276a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD21\/JoD21_0276.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;276a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7633\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>much of our bedding was burnt; our stores torn down, and the goods carried into the streets and destroyed.

Very pleasant song to those who did not understand it, but much more pleasant to those who do understand and are fulfilling it. We made great calculations in laying off this city. We did not lay it off merely one square mile, as if we were doubtful as to whether there would be any inhabitants to occupy it, nor two miles square, but we laid it off, covering an area of about five square miles. We expected that there would be a great emigration. Upon what did we found our expectation? Was it upon our own natural judgment? No; we founded our expectation upon that which God had spoken in the modern revelations which he had given to us as a people. He told us, by revelation, before our prophet was martyred, that we would have to leave the United States: go beyond the Rocky Mountains, and seek our home in the wilderness, and that we would have a great people gather with us. We believed his words; we laid out this city accordingly; and now all that remains for us or strangers to do, in regard to the fulfillment of these expectations, is to ride from one end of this city to the other, and see if there is much spare ground: see if the lots are not pretty generally occupied, and the city pretty well filled with inhabitants. &#x201C;And he will make her wilderness like Eden, and <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"276b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD21\/JoD21_0276.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;276b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7633\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> her desert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"59513\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 59513)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(59513)\">Isa. 51:3<\/a><\/span> At first, before the joy and gladness came, this other prophecy was fulfilled: &#x201C;Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them,&#x201D; then they cried unto the Lord in their afflictions, and the Lord heard them, and delivered them out of their distress.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"57144\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 57144)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(57144)\">Ps. 107:5-6<\/a><\/span> It is not necessary for me to enumerate all our privations, such as the shortness of provisions, and how many had to live on the roots that sprang out of the ground; how many had to boil up the hides of their cattle that had transported them across the plains; it is not necessary to enter into all these particulars. I do not know that it is necessary for us even to speak of a great trial of our faith, that we had after we had been here many months. We planted our crops in the spring, and they came up, and were looking nicely, and we were cheered with the hopes of having a very abundant harvest. But alas! It very soon appeared as if our crops were going to be swallowed up by a vast horde of crickets, that came down from these mountains&#x2014;crickets very different to what I used to be acquainted with in the State of New York. They were crickets nearly as large as a man's thumb. They came in immense droves, so that men and women with brush could make no headway against them; but we cried unto the Lord in our afflictions, and the Lord heard us, and sent thousands and tens of thousands of a small white bird. I have not seen any of them lately. Many called them gulls, although they were different from the seagulls that live on the Atlantic coast. And what did they do for us? They went to work, and by thousands and tens of thousands, began to devour them up, and still we thought that  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"277a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD21\/JoD21_0277.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;277a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7632\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>even they could not prevail against so large and mighty an army. But we noticed, that when they had apparently filled themselves with these crickets, they would go and vomit them up, and again go to work and fill themselves, and so they continued to do, until the land was cleared of crickets, and our crops were saved. There are those who will say that this was one of the natural courses of events, that there was no miracle in it. Let that be as it may, we esteemed it as a blessing from the hand of God; miracle or no miracle, we believe that God had a hand in it, and it does not matter particularly whether strangers believe or not. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n765\"> We found no city here to dwell in.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"57138\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 57138)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(57138)\">Ps. 107:4<\/a><\/span> What did we do?
