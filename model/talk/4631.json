Finding \u201ca more excellent way\u201d means being totally converted to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and doing all that we can to fulfill those covenants we make in becoming His disciples.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/a-more-excellent-way.p5\" class=\"\">The great prophet Alma, speaking of his own life and his conversion, said: \u201cI have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/a-more-excellent-way.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/a-more-excellent-way.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40715\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40715)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40715)\">Mosiah 27:24\u201326<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/a-more-excellent-way.p8\" class=\"\">Being converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ means to walk in a newness of life. It means learning to yield to the Spirit and responding to the things that the Lord expects us to respond to. It means caring for and serving others with deep, considerate feelings rather than pursuing the natural desires of our own lives. In our day and time there has been a great tendency to shrug off the things of the Spirit as we become more and more involved in worldly things. We seem to be living in a world where people give little thought to others, as they are busily caring for their own needs. As followers of Christ, we must live outside ourselves and lose ourselves in service to others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/a-more-excellent-way.p9\" class=\"\">I believe we ought to remember what King Benjamin said so long ago.
