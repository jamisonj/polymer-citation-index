Some of these would be almost overpowering. He provided tools to help us be successful in our mortal probation. One set of those tools is the scriptures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-power-of-scripture.p7\" class=\"\">Throughout the ages, Father in Heaven has inspired select men and women to find, through the guidance of the Holy Ghost, solutions to life\u2019s most perplexing problems. He has inspired those authorized servants to record those solutions as a type of handbook for those of His children who have faith in His plan of happiness and in His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. We have ready access to this guidance through the treasure we call the standard works\u2014that is, the Old and New Testaments, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-power-of-scripture.p8\" class=\"\">Because scriptures are generated from inspired communication through the Holy Ghost, they are pure truth. We need not be concerned about the validity of concepts contained in the standard works since the Holy Ghost has been the instrument which has motivated and inspired those individuals who have recorded the scriptures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-power-of-scripture.p9\" class=\"\">Scriptures are like packets of light that illuminate our minds and give place to guidance and inspiration from on high. They can become the key to open the channel to communion with our Father in Heaven and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-power-of-scripture.p10\" class=\"\">The scriptures provide the strength of authority to our declarations when they are cited correctly. They can become stalwart friends that are not limited by geography or calendar. They are always available when needed. Their use provides a foundation of truth that can be awakened by the Holy Ghost. Learning, pondering, searching, and memorizing scriptures is like filling a filing cabinet with friends, values, and truths that can be called upon anytime, anywhere in the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-power-of-scripture.p11\" class=\"\">Great power can come from memorizing scriptures. To memorize a scripture is to forge a new friendship. It is like discovering a new individual who can help in time of need, give inspiration and comfort, and be a source of motivation for needed change. For example, committing to memory this psalm has been for me a source of power and understanding:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-power-of-scripture.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cThe earth is the Lord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-power-of-scripture.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cFor he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-power-of-scripture.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cWho shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-power-of-scripture.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cHe that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-power-of-scripture.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cHe shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122284\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122284)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122284)\">Psalm 24:1\u20135<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-power-of-scripture.p17\" class=\"\">Pondering a scripture like that gives great direction to life. The scriptures can form a foundation of support. They can provide an incredibly large resource of willing friends who can help us. A memorized scripture becomes an enduring friend that is not weakened with the passage of time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-power-of-scripture.p18\" class=\"\">Pondering a passage of scripture can be a key to unlock revelation and the guidance and inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Scriptures can calm an agitated soul, giving peace, hope, and a restoration of confidence in one\u2019s ability to overcome the challenges of life. They have potent power to heal emotional challenges when there is faith in the Savior. They can accelerate physical healing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-power-of-scripture.p19\" class=\"\">Scriptures can communicate different meanings at different times in our life, according to our needs. A scripture that we may have read many times can take on nuances of meaning that are refreshing and insightful when we face a new challenge in life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/the-power-of-scripture.p20\" class=\"\">How do you personally use the scriptures? Do you mark your copy? Do you put notes in the margin to remember a moment of spiritual guidance or an experience that has taught you a profound lesson? Do you use all of the standard works, including the Old Testament? I have found precious truths in the pages of the Old Testament that are key ingredients to the platform of truth that guides my life and acts as a resource when I try to share a gospel message with others. For that reason, I love the Old Testament. I find precious jewels of truth spread throughout its pages.
