We have heard much that we should remember and that if remembered and\nput into practice will make of us the people whom God designed that we should be.\n<\/p><p>\nI will close with reading the passage read by Brother Mark E. Petersen from Joshua:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve;\nwhether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the\ngods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the\nLord (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30028\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30028)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30028)\">Josh. 24:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod Grant that that may be the determination not only of us who are here but of every\nmember of the Church. We send our greetings to President Grant and ask God to bless him\nwith his choicest blessings.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
