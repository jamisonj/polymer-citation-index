As I sat in the sealing room, looking at the beautiful chandelier sparkling in the light of the temple, I remembered that day when I first held her. Her mother had her dressed in a little white dress, and I thought she was one of the most beautiful babies I had ever seen. Then this young woman walked through the door, once again dressed in white. She was radiant and happy. As she entered the room, I wished with all my heart that every young woman could envision that moment and strive to always be worthy to make and keep sacred covenants and receive the ordinances of the temple in preparation to enjoy the blessings of exaltation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/guardians-of-virtue.p7\" class=\"\">As this couple knelt at the sacred altar, they received promises beyond mortal comprehension that will bless, strengthen, and assist them on their mortal journey. It was one of those moments when the world stood still and all of heaven rejoiced. As the newly married couple looked into the large mirrors in the room, the groom was asked what he saw. He said, \u201cAll those who have gone before me.\u201d Then the couple looked into the large mirror on the opposite wall, and the bride said with tears in her eyes, \u201cI see all those who will follow after us.\u201d She saw her future family\u2014her posterity. I know that she understood again in that moment how important it is to believe in being chaste and virtuous. There is no more beautiful sight than a couple, properly prepared, kneeling together at the altar of the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/guardians-of-virtue.p8\" class=\"\">Your years in Young Women will prepare you for the temple.

Brother Moyle was a stonemason who was called by the prophet, Brigham Young, to work on the Salt Lake Temple. Each week he walked the distance of 22 miles from his home to the temple. One of his jobs was to carve the words \u201cHoliness to the Lord\u201d on the east side of the Salt Lake Temple. It was not easy and he had many obstacles to overcome. At one point, he was kicked in the leg by one of his cows. Because it would not heal, he had to have this leg amputated. But that did not stop him from his commitment to the prophet and to work on the temple. He carved a wooden leg, and after many weeks he again walked the 22-mile distance to the temple to do the work he had committed to do.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-09605_000_047\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Dieter\u00a0F.

They trained each week at Mutual, and as they walked, they shared what they were learning and feeling about temples.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/guardians-of-virtue.p13\" class=\"\">They began their walk to the temple early in the morning with a prayer. As they started out, I was impressed with their confidence. They had prepared well, and they knew they were prepared. Their eyes were set on their goal. Each step they took was symbolic of each of you as you too are preparing now to enter the temple. Your personal training has begun with your daily personal prayers, your daily reading of the Book of Mormon, and your working on Personal Progress.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/guardians-of-virtue.p14\" class=\"\">As these young women continued to walk, there were distractions along the course, but they stayed focused on their goal. Some began to feel blisters forming, and others felt knees starting to protest, but they kept going. For each of you, there are many distractions, hurts, and obstacles along your path to the temple, but you too are determined and keep going. The route these young women took was mapped out by their leaders, who had walked and driven the course and determined the safest and most direct way to go. Again, your course is marked, and you can be assured that the Savior has not only walked the course but will again walk it with you\u2014every step of the way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/guardians-of-virtue.p15\" class=\"\">Along this journey to the temple there were fathers, mothers, family members, and priesthood leaders acting as guardians. Their job was to ensure that everyone was safe and protected from danger. They made sure each young woman stayed well hydrated and had enough nourishment to maintain her stamina. There were aid stations provided by their priesthood leaders, with places to rest and to drink water. Young women, your fathers, your mothers, your bishops, and so many others will be your guardians as you walk your path to the temple. They will call out cautions and direct your course, and should you become injured or hurt or get off course, they will help you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/guardians-of-virtue.p16\" class=\"\">I was impressed that in the final miles of their walk, brothers, other young men, and friends came to support these determined young women and to cheer them on. One brother lifted his sister, who had large blisters on her feet, and carried her on his back the final distance to the temple. As these incredible young women reached their goal, tears were shed as they touched the temple and made a silent commitment to always be worthy to enter there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/guardians-of-virtue.p17\" class=\"\">The temple walk is a metaphor for your life. Parents and priesthood leaders stood guard along the route. They provided support and aid. Young women guarded and encouraged each other. Young men admired the strength, commitment, and stamina of the young women. Brothers carried sisters who had been injured. Families rejoiced with their daughters as they ended their walk at the temple and took them safely home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/guardians-of-virtue.p18\" class=\"\">In order to stay on the path to the temple, you must guard your personal virtue and the virtue of others with whom you associate.

It included things like obeying the Word of Wisdom, praying daily, paying my tithing, and committing to never miss church. I made those decisions once, and then in the moment of decision, I knew exactly what to do because I had decided beforehand. When my high school friends said, \u201cJust one drink won\u2019t hurt,\u201d I laughed and said, \u201cI decided when I was 12 not to do that.\u201d Making decisions in advance will help you be guardians of virtue.

It means that you understand the importance of chastity because you also understand that your body is a temple and that the sacred powers of procreation are not to be tampered with before marriage. You understand that you possess a sacred power that involves the holy responsibility of bringing other spirits to earth to receive a body in which to house their eternal spirit.
