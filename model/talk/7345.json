However, the cattle craved and needed supplemental nutrients from licking rock salt. The rock salt came from a salt mine some distance away. Grandfather replenished the salt at the salt licks by putting a packsaddle on a sturdy horse and filling the packsaddle with rock salt. I called the packhorse Slowpoke for good reason. Grandfather put me on Slowpoke with the saddle loaded with rock salt. He gave me the reins so I could guide the horse up the mountain following Grandfather on his horse.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/spiritual-nutrients.p6\" class=\"\">My horse Slowpoke was slow, but I didn\u2019t push him because he carried such a heavy load. It took a full day to ride up the mountain to the salt licks and to unload the rock salt from the pack animal. As the day got warmer, my sweaty legs would sting as they rubbed against the lumps of rock salt in the packsaddle. It was a joy when we crossed a stream and I could get off the horse and get rid of the sting by washing and drying my legs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/spiritual-nutrients.p7\" class=\"\">Grandfather would sing most of the day. Mostly he sang the songs of Zion. But one song he sang that impressed me greatly was \u201cShow me your companions, and I will tell you what you are.\u201d Looking back on it, taking salt to the mountain valley was an enjoyable experience, while the additional nutrients from the rock salt fortified the cattle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/spiritual-nutrients.p8\" class=\"\">A nutrient furnishes nourishment that promotes growth and healing both in animals and humans.

So he asked himself, \u201cWhat am I doing wrong?\u201d Then an episode at school came into his mind. He and some friends had been sharing jokes\u2014some of which were not so funny, and downright shameful. He not only had joined in but had even added some off-color comments of his own.

They all went out at the same time and returned at a specified time later in the evening. To everyone\u2019s surprise, Jim\u2019s cart was empty. He seemed rather sober, and some of the boys made fun of him. Seeing this and knowing that Jim had an interest in cars, the adviser said, \u201cCome outside, Jim. I want you to look at my car.

I knocked on the door and explained what we were doing, and she invited me in. She began to look for something to give me.

I pray that we can be totally committed in all of our family relationships, especially to our spouses, but also to our parents, our children, and grandchildren. May we be found bearing our personal testimonies of the truthfulness of this work all the days of our lives. May we go forward in righteousness as the humble servants of the Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-26911_000_023\"><a name=\"-26911_000_023\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-26911_000_023\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"45359\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45359)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45359)\">Luke 12:23<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-26911_000_023\"><a name=\"-26911_000_023\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-26911_000_023\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"45244\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45244)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45244)\">Job 32:8<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-26911_000_023\"><a name=\"-26911_000_023\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-26911_000_023\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"45427\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45427)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45427)\">1 Timothy 4:6<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-26911_000_023\"><a name=\"-26911_000_023\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-26911_000_023\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"45680\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45680)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45680)\">D&amp;C 20:37<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-26911_000_023\"><a name=\"-26911_000_023\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote5-26911_000_023\">5.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"45308\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45308)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45308)\">Matthew 12:36<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-26911_000_023\"><a name=\"-26911_000_023\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote6-26911_000_023\">6.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Carl Houghton, \u201cWhat Am I Doing Wrong?\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Tambuli,<\/span> May 1988, 42\u201343; <span class=\"emphasis\">New Era,<\/span> Sept. 1987, 12.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-26911_000_023\"><a name=\"-26911_000_023\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote7-26911_000_023\">7.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Robert B.
