What the Latter-day Saints have done by way of preaching the Gospel under all kinds of difficulties, building up cities and subduing waste lands, and establishing themselves in the earth, they have done by the revelations and commandments of God to them. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n465\"> I will say a few words concerning a certain principle, and why I say it is because we cannot help looking at the signs of the times as they appear today. I was reading in the news last evening a speech reported to have been made by Joseph Smith, son of the Prophet Joseph Smith, in which he accuses us of pursuing an entirely different course from that of his father; that his father had nothing to do with the endowments which form a part of our religious faith; and that his father had nothing to do with the patriarchal order of marriage; and he accuses our bishops of polluting the women of their several wards so that they are not fit for wives. This last accusation is so palpably false and so utterly mendacious as to be entirely unworthy of our notice, and I believe I ought to apologize to this congregation for referring to it at all. But it shows how weak must be the hope and faith of men who pretend <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"131b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD23\/JoD23_0131.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;131b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1396\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> to be teachers among the people when they descend to traduce the character of innocent men by willfully lying in the hope of bolstering up and establishing their own peculiar cause. And with regard to the others: I wish to say, that Joseph Smith utters falsehoods when he says what he is reported to have said about his father: for I bear record to this congregation, and I ask our young people to bear it in mind after I am gone, that Joseph Smith first made known to me the very ordinances which we give to the Latter-day Saints in our endowments. I received my endowments under the direction of Joseph Smith. Emma Smith, the widow of the Prophet, is said to have maintained to her dying moments that her husband had nothing to do with the patriarchal order of marriage, but that it was Brigham Young that got that up. I bear record before God, angels and men that Joseph Smith received that revelation;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"91428\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 91428)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(91428)\">D&amp;C 132:1-66<\/a><\/span> and I bear record that Emma Smith gave her husband in marriage several women while he was living, some of whom are today living in this city, and some may be present in this congregation, and who, if called upon, would confirm my words. But lo and behold, we hear of publication after publication nowadays, declaring that Joseph Smith had nothing to do with these things.

What God has revealed unto us, and that which we know ourselves to be right and true, we cherish and revere; and the covenants that we have entered into in consequence of the revelations of God to us, we hold sacred.
