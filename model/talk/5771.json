S. Lewis\u2019s metaphor about those who run around with fire extinguishers in times of flood. For instance, there are increasing numbers of victims of violence and crime, yet special attention is paid to the rights of criminals. Accompanying an ever increasing addiction to pornography are loud alarms against censorship. Rising illegitimacy destroys families and threatens the funding capacities of governments; nevertheless, chastity and fidelity are mocked. These and other consequences produce a harsh cacophony. When Nero fiddled as Rome burned, at least he made a little music! I have no hesitancy, brothers and sisters, in stating that unless checked, permissiveness, by the end of its journey, will cause humanity to stare in mute disbelief at its awful consequences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/becometh-as-a-child.p10\" class=\"\">Ironically, as some people become harder, they use softer words to describe dark deeds. This, too, is part of being sedated by secularism! Needless abortion, for instance, is a \u201creproductive health procedure,\u201d which is an even more \u201cspongy expression\u201d than \u201ctermination of pregnancy\u201d (George McKenna, \u201cOn Abortion: A Lincolnian Position,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Atlantic Monthly,<\/span> Sept. 1995, 52, 54). \u201cIllegitimacy\u201d gives way to the wholly sanitized words \u201cnonmarital birth\u201d or \u201calternative parenting\u201d (Ben J.

Some real tares even masquerade as wheat, including the few eager individuals who lecture the rest of us about Church doctrines in which they no longer believe. They criticize the use of Church resources to which they no longer contribute. They condescendingly seek to counsel the Brethren whom they no longer sustain. Confrontive, except of themselves, of course, they leave the Church, but they cannot leave the Church alone (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1980, 14). Like the throng on the ramparts of the \u201cgreat and spacious building,\u201d they are intensely and busily preoccupied, pointing fingers of scorn at the steadfast iron-rodders (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2115\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2115)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2115)\">1 Ne. 8:26\u201328, 33<\/a><\/span>). Considering their ceaseless preoccupation, one wonders, Is there no diversionary activity available to them, especially in such a large building\u2014like a bowling alley? Perhaps in their mockings and beneath the stir are repressed doubts of their doubts. In any case, given the perils of popularity, Brigham Young advised that this \u201cpeople must be kept where the finger of scorn can be pointed at them\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> sel.

Likewise, the arrogance of critics must be met by the meekness and articulateness of believers.

Hence, while journeying through our Sinai, we are nourished in the Bountiful-like oases of the Restoration. Of these oases some of our first impressions may prove to be more childish than definitive. Brushing against such lush and verdant vegetation, its fragrance is inevitably upon us. Our pockets are stuffed with varied and lush fruits, and we are filled with glee. There is no way to describe it all. In our appreciation, little wonder some of us mistake a particular tree for the whole of an oasis, or a particularly refreshing pool for the entirety of the Restoration\u2019s gushing and living waters. Hence, in our early exclamations there may even be some unintended exaggerations. We have seen, and partaken of, far too much; hence we \u201ccannot [speak] the smallest part which [we] feel\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10188\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10188)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10188)\">Alma 26:16<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/becometh-as-a-child.p14\" class=\"\">In addition to these oases, the Lord has made further and \u201cample provision\u201d for our journey, including families, neighbors, and fellow servants (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> sel.

Thanks to his innate goodness and the good work of others, ophthalmologist Valentim is not only a member, but is a stake president in Curitiba.
