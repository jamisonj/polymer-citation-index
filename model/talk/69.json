Bowen<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Albert E. Bowen, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1943, pp. 110-115<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nRecently I picked up a national magazine in which a contributor, after noting the muddled\nstate of thought about the needs of the near future of the world, asserts:\n<\/p><p>\nOur need, of course, if we are to have peace after the war, is a passion for humanity and for\nthe interests of humanity as predominant over all lesser interests whatsoever.\n<\/p><p>\nVery naturally he proceeds from that premise to this conclusion:\n<\/p><p>\nRELIGION A POTENT FACTOR IN WORLD PEACE\n<\/p><p>\nIt should be obvious, after what we saw in the last war and what we are already seeing in this\nwar, that peace can never come out of war itself. If it comes at all, it must be in spite of the\nwar and not because of it, and from a source altogether remote from its influence. I find no\nsuch source except in religion itself. For religion has this passion of which I speak.\n<\/p><p>\nThat statement might not be so arresting if it stood alone. But it does not. It is merely typical\nof assertions coming to be of almost daily occurrence. Scarcely do we pick up a reputable\nmagazine nowadays that we do not find in it somewhere declaration of the view that in the\nprecepts of religion are to be found the principles and in religion itself is to be found the\nspirit upon the adoption and practice and influence of which alone the hope of the world for\npeace and order must depend.\n<\/p><p>\nThis poses for religion a tremendous task and the question at once arises how this task is to\nbe accomplished. It means that somehow religion must come to have a dominating influence\nin shaping the policies and practices of governments, for, of course, it is the civil\ngovernments which control in the waging of war and the fashioning of peace. How is\nreligion to get in?\n<\/p><p>\nThere is another manifest implication in the premise, namely, that religion has not been\nperforming its rightful office, or the conditions which call for its intervention would not\nobtain. Does it have the power to do what is suggested and, if so, why has that power not\nbeen exercised?\n<\/p><p>\nI shall have in mind the Christian religion as I proceed to consider these questions.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the first place, if religion is to be a potent factor in shaping the conditions of peace, it must\nhave a medium through which it expresses itself&mdash;a mechanism of implementation. Of itself it\nis a spiritual ideal. But as a passive ideal, religion is of little value. It must carry its message;\nit must get itself accepted, for it comes to fruition only as its precepts come to dominate the\nlives and actions of men individually and in their collective relationships. To be effective it\nmust incorporate itself into an organized body. That body is the Church. That is the medium\nthrough which religion has implemented itself in any civilization. And may I add in passing\nthat so far as I know, no civilization has ever developed that did not rear itself upon the\nreligion of the people.\n<\/p><p>\nIf then, the influence of religion is, as postulated, the only source of hope for a world of\npeace, and if religion is made effective through the organized body called the Church, then it\nwould seem that there is indicated for the Church a place of transcendent importance in the\nshaping Of the future of the nations. This would seem to demonstrate the folly of saying that\nthe Church has no concern with the civil institutions of the day. If it is not concerned with\nthem, then it cannot carry into them the influence which it is its business to foster.\nFurthermore, the Church lives and operates within the domain of civil governments and to a\ndegree trader their control. Its members are so controlled. People and institutions, too, are\nalways influenced and modified and note or less molded by the thought and feeling which\ndominate the society in which they live, particularly the prescriptions of governments. We\nare caught up and held in the web of their practices and habits. With such powerful agencies\nin the shaping of our lives and affecting its own destiny, the Church must be concerned. I am\nnot unmindful of the fact that many people profess the conviction that no Church is\nnecessary; that religion is a thing of the spirit affecting the inner life of the individual; and\nthat it has nothing to do with the affairs of the political society commonly spoken of as the\nstate. \n<\/p><p>\nDEMOCRACY A THING OF THE SPIRIT\n<\/p><p>\nThat objection is not so formidable as it sounds. So is democracy a thing of the spirit. It does\nnot consist in frameworks such as constitutions and presidents and legislatures and statutes\nand judicial bodies and enforcement officers. You may have all these completely democratic in\nform and not have a democracy at all. But no one would argue from this that you could have\na living democracy without them, The essence of democracy&mdash;its spirit&mdash;is by itself an\nintangible ideal, inert and unfruitful, even though it burn in the hearts of individual men. Put\nthat flaming spirit, that throbbing, pulsating ideal into a mechanical organization comprising\na constitution which defines the limitations on the powers of government; write into it a bill\nof rights which protects the individual against invasion of his guaranteed privileges by\ngovernmental authority; let it provide for the making of laws to which all agree to render\nobedience; give it an executive authority to carry those laws into effect; set up a tribunal to\ninterpret the laws and resolve disputes between man and man and between citizen and\ngovernment, and it will carry a nation triumphant from a narrow fringe on the seashore across\nsix thousand miles of continent, plant towns and cities by the way, set up in them local\ngovernments by consent, establish schools, rear industries, subdue the earth and give to one\nhundred million people more of creature comfort, more of individual self-respect, more of the\nrecognition of human dignity, more independence of action and consequent self-reliance, more\nliberty of thought and freedom of action than were ever before known to any people during\nthe period of recorded history.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the political framework is to the spirit which is democracy, so the Church is to religion.\n<\/p><p>\nSo much for the means by which religion is to get itself into governments. Please notice that I\nhave not said, nor do I believe, that the Church should try to manage the government.\n<\/p><p>\nPOWER OF CHURCH WIELDED IN WORLD HISTORY\n<\/p><p>\nI am now prepared, purely for convenience, to use the word church interchangeably with the\nterm religion as I proceed to ask: Does religion have in it the power to do what it is suggested\nthat it alone must do?\n<\/p><p>\nThe best answer I know to that question is that in times past it has already done it. Given the\nsame conditions there is no reason to assume that it cannot do it again. It must, of course, be\nat once admitted that the Church, as the agency through which religion makes itself effective.\nis greatly weakened for its task by lack of unity within itself.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus, the fountain source of the religion of which we speak, selected some disciples and\ntaught them His message. Then He told them to go out and spread it everywhere. Shortly\nafter He left them, on one day, through the zeal and fervor of their conviction, they added to\ntheir body by baptism three thousand souls\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7502\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7502)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7502)\">Acts 2:41<\/a><\/span>).\nIgnoring the commands of the chief rulers, they\ncontinued their teaching, filling Jerusalem, so it was charged, with their doctrine. To all\ninterdictions Peter answered, \"We ought to obey God rather than men\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7506\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7506)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7506)\">Acts 4:19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn defiance of the proscriptions of the emperors, the Church projected itself into the very\nheart of the empire, and by the third century had raised itself from a position of despised\nignominy to the position where its worship had been accepted by the majority of the people of\nthe empire, and it had won for its members religious toleration, the right to hold public office,\nand for itself the restoration of its previously confiscated property. It was ever in the forefront\nof the struggle against tyranny and oppression. Through the long black night of the Dark\nAges, the Christian Church kept the flickering torch lighted and fought the long, hard battle\nfor the rights of man. The Christian religion, embodied in a physical organization, led certain\ndissenters to Holland; it took them across the Atlantic and gave strong leadership in\nfashioning the institutions that here grew up. What we have lately heard so much talked of as\nthe American system could not possibly have been conceived in materialism. It was the\nsolution of the problem of the age and was born of the travail of the spirit fostered and kept\nanimate by the Christian Church.\n<\/p><p>\nCAUSES FOR WANING OF RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE\n<\/p><p>\nWe are now prepared to ask why the Church has lost its former position of influence and\nleadership. It would require a volume to answer that question. I have neither the time nor the\nsweep of learning needed for the task. I can venture only a conclusion which, to my comfort,\nI find to be fortified by the opinions of others, more capable than I, who have given\nconsideration to the subject. The limits of time compel me to an over-simplification.\n<\/p><p>\nThe conclusion is that the teachers of religion, the Church itself, have weakened in their own\nconviction of the ultimate truth of the doctrines their creeds professed. Being without\nconviction, they have not taught with the voice of authority, and their following has\nfloundered in uncertainty. The causes are many and complex, among them, no doubt, being\nthe profound changes that have resulted from the extending of the frontiers of learning and\nconsequent changes in habits of living and measures of value. In external settings there has\nprobably been a greater transformation in one generation than in a thousand or two years\npreceding. It was brought about largely by the tremendous strides in the physical sciences\ngiving man such undreamed-of mastery over nature. It paved the way for the glamorous\nindustrial age, the age of invention and mechanization and production, which has literally\nrevolutionized the conditions of physical existence. Tools and gadgets and mechanisms\nassumed a dominant place in the life of the nation, and we came to regard them as of first\nconsequence to our welfare. We came to be so obsessed with the importance of material\nacquisitions that our vision of spiritual values was almost completely obscured. Man himself\nbecome inflated out of all proportion in his assumptions of self-sufficiency. He looked at the\nwork of his own hands, and he called it good. He believed that he held the key to the mastery\nof the world, and that by his own power he could create a state of being according to his own\nheart's desire. Bigger and better and greater and more were the goals of his ambition.\nThrough the discoveries of science and its methods of investigation, many ancient notions\nwere found to be untenable; old errors were revealed, theories exploded; and it was believed\nthat anything which laid claim to intellectual respectability must be able to meet the test of\nthe scientific method. Science and industry deal with objects and materials. Their fruits are\nmaterialistic, and the idealistic, intangible things of the spirit fell to low esteem. Religious\nteachers forgetting the teaching of the Master that life is \". . . more than meat, and the body\nthan raiment\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33833\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33833)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33833)\">Matt. 6:25<\/a><\/span>);\nforgetting that their mission was to discern and preserve\nspiritual values; tried to accommodate their teachings to the mood of the time and to give\nthem validity by submitting them not only to the scientific test, but, more basely, to the test\nof the habits and practices and likes of their adherents. They developed or tried to develop\nwhat might be called a theology of the flesh instead of the spirit. Thus science and the\npractice of the market place prescribed the conditions of religious teachings and the teachers\nthemselves instead of being inspired interpreters of spiritual values became the mere echoes of\nthe men of science and of their industrial contemporaries. As an editorial writer has phrased\nit:\n<\/p><p>\nThe Christian leadership has passed from the hands of the Church to the hands of the active\nand practical laity&mdash;the statesmen and educators, the columnists and pundits, the scientists and\ngreat men of action. And this is only another way of saying that there is no true Christian\nleadership at all.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd as a parting warning he declares:\n<\/p><p>\nSo far as the record goes, the American people would do as well by their souls to follow the\nadvice of the industrial leaders as to follow the advice of the spiritual leaders.\n<\/p><p>\nThus the flock is leading the Shepherd. * * * So long as the Church pretends, or assumes to\npreach absolute values, but actually preaches relative and secondary values, it will merely\nhasten the process of disintegration. We are asked to turn to the Church for our\nenlightenment, but when we do so we find that the voice of the Church is not inspired. The\nvoice of the Church today, we find, is the echo of our own voices. And the result of this\nexperience is disillusionment. . . This is a profound and absolute spiritual disillusionment,\narising from the fact that when we consult the Church we hear only what we ourselves have\nsaid. The effect of this experience upon the present generation has been profound. It is the\neffect of a vicious spiral, like that the economists talk about that leads into depressions. But in\nthis spiral there is at stake, not merely prosperity but civilization.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is only one way out of the spiral. The way out is the sound of a voice, not our voice,\nbut a voice coming from something not ourselves, in the existence of which we cannot\ndisbelieve. It is the earthly task of the pastors to hear his voice, to cause us to hear it, and to\ntell us what it says. If they cannot hear it, or if they fail to tell us, we as laymen, are utterly\nlost. Without it we are no more capable of saving the world than we were capable of creating\nit in the first place.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is a scorching indictment. But the words are not mine. They are the words of one\nprofoundly moved by the confusion and bewilderment of the times, and crying aloud for help,\none who recognizes that the Church must not follow and relay what others say, be they high\nor low. but must lead by declaring the voice of God. I have not used these words for the\npurpose of bringing under rebuke any church or any teacher of religion. Neither has anything\nthat I have said been with that intent. It will be clear to you that I have used the term Church\nin its all-inclusive sense and not in reference to any particular church. Nor has my purpose\nbeen to raise any quarrel with or to depreciate the value of the glorious discoveries of science,\nor the industrial benefits that have been born of them.\n<\/p><p>\nIndeed science itself has become rather humble, if it has not always been so. Its great\nexponents seem rather generally to recognize, as Mr. Longmuir's recent broadcast to the\nAmerican Academy for the Advancement of Science shows, that in the field of human\nbehavior, which is, after all, the chief factor in government, science has very narrow\nlimitations. For guidance in that we must look elsewhere.\n<\/p><p>\nI do not say that the Church could have prevented the wave of self-sufficiency and arrogant\npride and gross materialism that has swept over the land. I think that probably arose from\nforces beyond its control. But the mistake of the church lay in its abandonment of its own\nconvictions and its docile acquiescence in the flouting of spiritual realities and\nin its failure to hold fast to its faith in the reality of a living God, the well-spring of all\nreligion, and without whom there can be no religion.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have tried getting along without God and religion, and we see where it has brought us to.\nWe have tried following more or less blindly the scholars, the writers, the men of affairs, and\nthe political leaders, and we view with consternation the sorry plight to which they have\nbrought us. The universal cry for spiritual regeneration gives the Church another chance to\nsave the world and humanity, and offers a basis for hope.\n<\/p><p>\nTRUE FAITH THE WAY OF PEACE\n<\/p><p>\nThe early Church made its phenomenal advancement and attained its great influence because\nthose who bore its message believed devoutly in it. My purpose in speaking of these matters\nis to urge upon you who are gathered here&mdash;the members of our own faith&mdash;the leaders in\nyour respective stations, to teach without wavering implicit faith in the living God\nwho shapes the course and destinies of nations and who has revealed and does reveal the way\nof life which alone can lead to peace on earth and good will among men. There will be no\nenduring peace unless and until men accept the way of the Lawgiver of the universe. It is for\nus to try by every power of persuasion we possess to get men and nations to adopt that way\nand to stand resolutely against every influence and power which tends to lead away from it. I\nyield to no man in love of country and devotion to it. I have spent much of my life studying\nits history and its institutions. And I say that the demands of patriotism never require us to\nendorse what is not morally right.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is for us not to be deceived by slogans and smart sayings but to put the teachings of the\nSavior of the world above all other teachings and make them the standard by which we\nmeasure all acts and plans for action, that His righteousness might be made fruitful in the\nearth.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God grant us the power and the wisdom to do it, I pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
