McConkie, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1969, pp. 79-84<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI am grateful beyond any power of expression that I have for the knowledge that is in my\nheart of the truth and divinity of this great work. I am thankful for the testimony of Jesus, for\nthe whisperings of the Spirit that have come to my soul certifying that this kingdom, the\nChurch, is God's kingdom on earth; and I desire to bear that witness, not in words only but\nalso by my acts, to be in word and in deed a witness to the world of the truth and divinity of\nthe gospel cause&mdash;all in harmony with the instructions we have received in\nour revelations.\n<\/p><p>\nWill you join with me in considering these eternal truths: \n<\/p><p>\n<b>True religion revealed<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTrue religion comes by revelation; there is no other source.\n<\/p><p>\nWhere there is true religion, there is revelation; and where there is no revelation, there is no\ntrue religion.\n<\/p><p>\nGod reveals himself or he remains forever unknown.\n<\/p><p>\nHe is our Father in heaven; we are his spirit children, and he ordained the laws whereby we\ncan advance and progress and become like him.\n<\/p><p>\nHe is the author of the plan of salvation, which his servant Paul designates as \"the gospel of\nGod . . . Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42823\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42823)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42823)\">Rom. 1:1,3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHe has revealed this plan of salvation in successive gospel dispensations, and he is revealing\nhis mind and his will today, thereby showing that he is the same God yesterday, today, and\nforever (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24392\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24392)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24392)\">Heb. 13:8<\/a><\/span>),\nand that a soul is just as precious in his sight in this day as in any age.\n<\/p><p>\nThus true religion comes from God, and from no other source.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Priesthood administers gospel<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt is his priesthood that administers the gospel. It is his power that governs his church.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is at his direction that the gospel is preached and that the gifts of the Spirit are poured out\nupon the faithful.\n<\/p><p>\nHis is the power by which miracles are wrought, by which the sick are healed and the dead\nraised.\n<\/p><p>\nHe seals men up unto eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nHe makes men joint heirs with his Son.\n<\/p><p>\nHe gives them the fullness of his glory and kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nHe is the source of all things of every true principle, of every saving truth, of revealed\nreligion, and without revelation from him there is no true church, no true religion, and no\npersonal salvation.\n<\/p><p>\nGod sends apostles and prophets, wise and holy men who have the spiritual talent to\ncommune with him, to receive in their hearts his mind and will, and then to communicate\nthese eternal truths to their fellowmen. Joseph Smith was one of the greatest of these, and we\nhave living apostles and prophets today who make the truths of salvation available to us as a\npeople and to all who will come and join with us.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Salvation is personal<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nBut people are not saved en masse. Salvation is personal and individual. Religion must\ncome to one man standing alone, independent of all others.\n<\/p><p>\nIf I am to be saved, I personally must believe and obey the true religion.\n<\/p><p>\nI must get religion into my own heart and soul. What the Prophet Joseph Smith saw and\nbelieved and knew will not suffice. True, his revelations make salvation available to me; they\nopen the door. But I must see and believe and know for myself.\n<\/p><p>\n      I must know God.<br \/>\n      I must learn the truths of salvation.<br \/>\n      I must feel the power of his priesthood.<br \/>\n      I must receive the gifts of his Spirit.<br \/>\n      I must be born again.<br \/>\n      I must receive revelation.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Personal revelation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNo man can be saved unless and until he receives revelation. Revelation is the rock\nfoundation upon which true religion and personal salvation rest. Peter learned by personal\nrevelation that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Holy Messiah, through\nwhose atoning sacrifice salvation is offered to men. Then the Lord told him that upon this\nrock of revelation he would build his church\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35932\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35932)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35932)\">Matt. 16:16-18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf I do not build upon this rock, if I do not receive the same testimony of our Lord's divine\nSonship that Peter gained, if I do not know by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the\nLord, if I do not have the testimony of Jesus, that is, if I do not receive revelation, I have not\nreceived true religion, and I shall have no abiding inheritance in that church and kingdom\nwhich is founded upon the rock of revelation.\n<\/p><p>\nIn our day, in this final gospel dispensation, the revealed knowledge of the truth and divinity\nof the work includes the heaven-sent assurance that Joseph Smith is a\nprophet of God, that he is the revealer of the knowledge of Christ and of salvation to the\nworld today.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A testimony of the gospel<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe first great revelation which men must receive if they are to gain salvation is the\nrevelation of the divine Sonship of Christ, which knowledge is coupled with the Spirit-born\nassurance that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God. This revelation is called a testimony of the\ngospel.\n<\/p><p>\nBut a testimony is only the beginning of revelation. The recipient has just begun to drink at\nthe fountain of revealed truth. He has but opened the door to an immeasurably great\nstorehouse of spiritual knowledge.\n<\/p><p>\nThe great things that set the Lord's saints apart from the world are, first, that they know by\nrevelation that the work in which they are engaged is true, that they have testimonies of its\ndivinity, and, second, that they then receive added personal revelation concerning many\nthings.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Gift of Holy Ghost<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAt their baptism, God's saints have the hands of legal administrators placed upon their\nheads, and they receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, an endowment from on high. This\nendowment, this gift, is the right to the constant companionship of this member of the\nGodhead based on faithfulness.\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph Smith said: \"No man can receive the Holy Ghost without receiving revelations. The\nHoly Ghost is a revelator\" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>, p. 328).\n<\/p><p>\nAccordingly, those who are saints indeed, those who have been born again, those who are so\nliving as to be in tune with the Spirit&mdash;they are they who receive revelation, personal\nrevelation, revelation which is the mind and will of God to them as individuals. They know\nthere are apostles and prophets directing the kingdom who receive revelation for the Church\nand the world. But they as individuals receive personal revelation in their own affairs.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd there are no restrictions placed upon them; there are no limitations as to what they may\nsee and know and comprehend. No eternal truths will be withheld, if they obey the laws\nentitling them to receive such truths.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Revelation to prophets<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph Smith and the prophets had revelation. They saw God, viewed the visions of\neternity, entertained angels, came upon Mount Zion, stood in heavenly places, and had\ncommunion with the general assembly and Church of the Firstborn.\n<\/p><p>\nOf these very experiences Joseph Smith said: \". . . God hath not revealed anything to Joseph,\nbut what He will make known unto the Twelve, and even the least Saint may know all things\nas fast as he is able to bear them\" (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, p. 149).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Revelation for all men<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow let me read the words of a revelation, the words of the Lord God himself, the\nvery words of Deity. These words, spoken to Joseph Smith, announce that revelation is for all\nmen, that every faithful member of the Church can commune with his Maker, without limit\nand without restraint.\n<\/p><p>\nThey are: \"For thus saith the Lord&mdash;I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who\nfear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And to them will I reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from\ndays of old, and for ages to come, will I make known unto them the good pleasure of my will\nconcerning all things pertaining to my kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Yea, even the wonders of eternity shall they know, and things to come will I show them,\neven the things of many generations.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And their wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach to heaven; and before them\nthe wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the understanding of the prudent shall come to\nnaught.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For by my Spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make\nknown unto them the secrets of my will&mdash;yea, even those things which eye has not seen, nor\near heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15384\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15384)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15384)\">D&amp;C 76:5-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThus we learn that any man who obeys the law entitling him to receive revelation shall see\nand hear and know for himself. Revelation for the Church comes through those who are\nprophets, seers, and revelators to the Church, but personal revelation, revelation for the\nguidance of the individual, revelation which says to a man and a woman, \"Son, daughter, thou\nshalt be exalted; thou shalt have part and lot in my kingdom,\" this revelation comes to them\nas individuals, alone and apart from all others.\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph Smith received this revelation: \"Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that\nevery soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth\nmy voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15416\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15416)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15416)\">D&amp;C 93:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The brother of Jared<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAmong those who complied with the law of righteousness here revealed was the\nbrother of Jared, a prophet who lived some 2,000 years before our Lord's birth into mortality.\nOf thee vision which he saw, Moroni says: \". . . because of the knowledge of this man he\ncould not be kept from beholding within the veil; and he saw . . . the Lord; and he had faith\nno longer, for he knew, nothing doubting.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore, having this perfect knowledge of God, he could not be kept from within the veil;\ntherefore he saw Jesus; and he did minister unto him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22273\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22273)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22273)\">Ether 3:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Personal righteousness<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFrom these revelations we learn that there are no limitations placed upon any of us.\nRevelations are not reserved for a limited few or for those called to positions of importance in\nthe Church. It is not position in the Church that confers spiritual gifts. It is not being a\nbishop, a stake president, or an apostle that makes revelation and salvation available. These\nare high and holy callings which open the door to the privilege of great service among men.\nBut it is not a call to a special office that opens the windows of revelation to a truth seeker.\nRather it is personal righteousness; it is keeping the commandments; it is seeking the Lord\nwhile he may be found (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25375\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25375)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25375)\">Isa. 55:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod is no respecter of persons (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8086\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8086)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8086)\">Acts 10:34<\/a><\/span>).\nHe will give revelation to me and to you on the same terms\nand conditions. I can see what Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon saw in the vision of the\ndegrees of glory&mdash;and so can you. I can entertain angels and see God, I can receive an\noutpouring of the gifts of the Spirit&mdash;and so can you.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The course to glory<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThere are goals to gain, summits to climb, revelations to receive. In the eternal scope\nof things we have scarcely started out on the course to glory and exaltation. The Lord wants\nhis saints to receive line upon line, precept upon precept, truth upon truth, revelation upon\nrevelation, until we know all things and have become like him.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us press forward in making our callings and elections sure\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4901\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4901)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4901)\">2 Pet. 1:10<\/a><\/span>), until, as Joseph Smith said, we\nshall have the personage of Jesus Christ to attend us, or to appear to us from time to time,\nand until even he will manifest the Father unto us (see\n<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>, p. 151).\n<\/p><p>\nI know man can commune with his Maker, can petition the throne of grace and receive\nanswers to his prayers, because I have done so.\n<\/p><p>\nI know man can receive revelations, because I have received them. God has spoken to me, not\nfor the guidance of the Church, not for your benefit, but for mine. The same thing has or can\nor should happen in the life of every member of his kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nGod be praised that, unworthy though we are, he stands ready to and does in fact reveal\nhimself to those of us who are sons and daughters in his kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Witnesses of the truth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow in this day in which we live we have been appointed to stand as\nwitnesses of the truth. Our elders go forth proclaiming the message of the restoration to the\nworld. They go out to teach and to testify. When the Lord sends them forth, it is with this\ncommission: \". . . ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25372\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25372)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25372)\">Isa. 43:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd since God stands revealed or remains forever unknown, there is no way on earth or in\nheaven for anyone to come to a knowledge of him unless he receives a personal revelation of\nGod or unless he hearkens to the voice of witnesses who have received revelation. Man can\nand will receive revelation from the Holy Ghost if he heeds the testimony that is borne by the\nliving witnesses who are sent forth to raise their voices and to proclaim the everlasting gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nAs elders in Israel we are expected to be witnesses. We become witnesses because of personal\nrevelation. When a man receives the surety in his heart that this work is true, when he gains a\ntestimony by the power of the Holy Ghost, then he knows what the world does not know, and\nhe can go forth and bear record of it to them.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are not concerned particularly or especially with the matter of intellectuality. Everything\npertaining to the gospel is rational and reasonable. It is intellectual in the sense that we can\nsustain it by sense and reason and wisdom, but religion is something far more than\nintellectuality. Religion is a matter of revelation, of spirituality. Religion comes from God,\nand those who receive it become living witnesses of its truth and divinity.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Obligation to testify<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so there rests upon me and upon you, and upon all the elders of Israel, the\nobligation to testify of the truth and divinity of the work, and we can do it because we have\nreceived the revelations of the Holy Spirit to our souls certifying that the work is true.\n<\/p><p>\nNow I as one elder in Israel can stand alone, independent of all others&mdash;but there are\nthousands in a like category&mdash;and I can bear testimony of the truth and the divinity of this\nwork because the Holy Spirit has spoken to the spirit within me. The whisperings of the still\nsmall voice (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1248\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1248)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1248)\">1 Kgs. 19:12<\/a><\/span>)\nhave come to my soul, and have told me that there is a God in heaven who is\ninfinite and eternal, from everlasting to everlasting\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15327\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15327)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15327)\">D&amp;C 20:17<\/a><\/span>). They have told me that he chose his Only\nBegotten Son, the Firstborn in the spirit, Jesus our Lord, to be the Savior and the Redeemer\nof the world; that he sent his Son into the world&mdash;born of Mary and born of him, thus\ninheriting the power of mortality and the power of immortality&mdash;so that he could work out\nthe infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice, so that he could bring to pass immortality for all\nmen, and make eternal life available for those who believe and obey.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd not alone has the Spirit whispered to me that these great eternal verities, which come by\nthe grace of God, are true; it has certified to my soul that the heavens have been opened in\nthis day; that God has spoken anew; that Joseph Smith was called of him, anointed and\nempowered and endowed with power from on high, and commissioned to begin the rolling\nforth of this final, great, glorious dispensation.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Testimony a living thing<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow a testimony of the gospel to be effective, to be in force, to have power and\nefficacy and validity, has to be brought up to date. It is not enough for someone to know that\nJesus is the Lord and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. A testimony has to be a\ncurrent, living thing. And so I certify that I know, as do thousands of you, that those who\npreside over this church at this time&mdash;with President David O. McKay at the head, his\ncounselors in the Presidency, and these great brethren who comprise the Council of the\nTwelve and the Patriarch to the Church&mdash;are prophets, seers, and revelators. They hold the\nkeys of the kingdom. The power is in their hands to have the message of salvation presented\nin all the world.\n<\/p><p>\nI have sufficient background and understanding that I could reason these things out from the\nrevelations. I could read the scriptures and ascertain that all this is accurate and sensible, that\nit is logical and rational, but what I am now saying is something that is in\naddition to that. It is very helpful to have a knowledge of the gospel and be able to reason on\nthe principles of eternal truth; it is helpful in that it leads to a testimony of the divinity of the\nwork. But what I am now saying is that I am a witness of the truth and the divinity of the\nwork because the Holy Spirit has revealed to the spirit that is in me that this is God's work,\nthat this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the only true and living church upon\nthe face of the whole earth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15298\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15298)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15298)\">D&amp;C 1:30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Valiant in testimony<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow we have a revelation that says, in effect, that in order to be saved in the kingdom\nof God, we must be valiant in testimony. It is not enough to have a testimony, a knowledge\nof the divinity of the work, but it is a glorious thing to start there. In order to gain an\ninheritance in the celestial world, we have to be valiant in testimony\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15393\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15393)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15393)\">D&amp;C 76:79<\/a><\/span>), and we have to manifest\nthat valiance by keeping the commandments of God. God grant us the fortitude and courage\nand wisdom to seek him while he may be found, to learn for ourselves that he is the Lord and\nthat this is his work, and then give us the determination to press forward in steadfastness and\ndevotion, until in fact and in reality we do make our callings and elections sure\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4902\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4902)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4902)\">2 Pet. 1:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the name of Jesus Christ.
