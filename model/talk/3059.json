This one word is: <span class=\"emphasis\">decision.<\/span> Decision, I would say, is the use of that God-given right of free agency.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/decision.p5\" class=\"\">Some people want to force their decisions upon others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/decision.p6\" class=\"\">Some don\u2019t want to make their own decisions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/decision.p7\" class=\"\">Some have the gift of making quick and accurate decisions. Like all other gifts, the making of decisions requires practice.

He was sorting potatoes when someone asked him how he liked working on the farm. He said, \u201cI like the work all right, but these decisions get me down.\u201d It is said that the character can be measured by what one does in his leisure time. That\u2019s when he alone makes his own decisions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/decision.p9\" class=\"\">One of the important purposes of this life of mortality is to learn how to make decisions. A good leader in business or in church or in the home is one who can make good decisions.

Some young people want the Lord to tell them what subjects they should study, which school they should attend, which profession to follow, and which job offer they should take. True, much help may be received through prayer or a blessing, but the final decision is yours.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/decision.p14\" class=\"\">I have come to believe that the Lord is not so concerned about what we study or what profession we follow as long as it is an honest living.

From a study of your genealogy, find the talents you have inherited by the things you like to do, and do easily, that some of your ancestors have done.

Many young men who should go on a mission don\u2019t go because they had not made the decision early enough to plan on a mission. Then other activities seem to them to be more important.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/decision.p27\" class=\"\">Decide to teach the gospel all your life, not just for two years. Going on a two-year mission usually just teaches us how to teach the gospel. Then we should spend the rest of our lives teaching the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/decision.p28\" class=\"\">Teach by your own actions. Live a good, clean life. Decide against immorality. Decide against pornography. Decide to live a clean life so you will be worthy to be married for time and eternity in the temple of the Lord. Choose not only to be worthy but decide to marry in the house of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/decision.p29\" class=\"\">Choose to live the law of celestial marriage. The command in the marriage ceremony is to multiply and replenish the earth. In the Doctrine and Covenants when the Lord is referring to the blessings of celestial marriage (He is talking about husband-wife relationships), He makes this statement: \u201cAnd if ye abide in my covenant, and commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood,\u201d and so forth. (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17132\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17132)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17132)\">D&amp;C 132:19<\/a><\/span>.) What do you think He\u2019s talking about? Is it possible that He was referring to abortion? Think about it! Is there more innocent life than that of the unborn child? And why is murder referred to when the Lord is talking about marriage? Conception is a contract with God that you will create a body, and He contracts to put the spirit of life within it. Any covenant of the Lord cannot be broken without a penalty.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/decision.p30\" class=\"\">Choose to study the scriptures. Learn what the plan of the gospel is.
