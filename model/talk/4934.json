Their shoes looked so good that I was anxious to meet the man that could put such a shine on missionaries\u2019 shoes. Even though he had not chosen to listen to the missionaries\u2019 message, I considered the shoeshine man my friend, and we visited while he was busy shining my shoes. He indicated that his wife had died, that he had no family, and that about the only pleasure he had in life was seeing people walk away happy with the shoes he had just shined.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/no-more-strangers-and-foreigners.p4\" class=\"\">His place of business was on the curbside of a small square on a busy street in downtown Lisbon. His stand seemed to have all that was necessary. It consisted of a short, rusty, three-legged stool, upon which my frail friend would sit as he shined the shoes that were placed on a stained and well-used shoeshine box that was full of his polishes and brushes, and there was an ornate lamppost (which was kindly furnished by the city of Lisbon), upon which the customer would lean while he was having his shoes shined.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/no-more-strangers-and-foreigners.p5\" class=\"\">He would carefully apply two coats of polish, using a brush to polish between each coat. Last, he applied a special product that would give the shoes that extra special shine. With a final snap of the cloth, he would stand up, take off his little Portuguese cap, make a deep bow, and say, <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cPronto. Seus sapatos foram engrashados pelo o melhor engraxate do mundo.\u201d<\/span> \u201cThere. Your shoes were shined by the very best shoeshine man in the world.\u201d I was convinced that I had had my shoes shined by the very best.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/no-more-strangers-and-foreigners.p6\" class=\"\">A few months after our mission, I was called to serve as the Regional Representative to Portugal and had the opportunity to return to Lisbon a number of times. As occasion permitted, I would have my shoes shined by the \u201cbest shoeshine man in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/no-more-strangers-and-foreigners.p7\" class=\"\">The last few times that I went, I was unable to find him at his usual place of business. I finally inquired at the prestigious stores that surrounded the square. The response was the same, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened to him. It seems that we had heard that he had died.\u201d I remember thinking, Could it be that the best shoeshine man in the world had died, and no one really knew or even seemed to care? I wondered: Had there been someone there with him, or did he slip away unnoticed?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/no-more-strangers-and-foreigners.p8\" class=\"\">May we contrast that for a moment with Brother and Sister Joaquim Aires, a marvelous man and his wife who came to Portugal following the 1974 revolution of Portugal\u2019s colonies in Angola and Mozambique. They had returned to Portugal unknown and with very few possessions. A great blessing occurred in their lives. They opened their door to two young missionaries, who taught them of the restoration of Christ\u2019s church. They received the missionaries, accepted their message, and were baptized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/no-more-strangers-and-foreigners.p9\" class=\"\">As is the opportunity for all worthy men in the Church, he received the priesthood\u2014authority to act in the name of our Father in Heaven\u2014and to become a leader in the Church. Brother Aires became President Aires, president of one of the mission districts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/no-more-strangers-and-foreigners.p10\" class=\"\">One day I received a telephone call. President Aires was in the hospital in Coimbra, several hours\u2019 travel away. He had suffered a very serious cerebral hemorrhage and was in very critical condition. Another priesthood holder and I made the trip as quickly as possible. As we walked quietly into the hospital room, we found him asleep. My first inclination was not to awaken him. And then I thought he would want to know that we had come. So I reached over and carefully touched his hand. He slowly opened his eyes and then looked at me for a moment, and then the tears came to both of our eyes. He then said in a very weak and soft voice, \u201cI knew you would come. I knew you would come. Would you please give me a blessing.\u201d In his dear, sweet faith, he was asking for a priesthood blessing, the same that is taught of and recorded in the Bible.
