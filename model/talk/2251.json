This week and every other week, in this country and every other country, men and women will be getting together to discuss their problems, exchange ideas, and try to develop more effective techniques for accomplishment. If one doctor discovers better methods for improving health, relieving pain, or saving lives, that information is immediately passed on to others. As a consequence, the skill of all doctors is increased, and every one of us is made the beneficiary of every medical discovery.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/keep-the-commandments.p4\" class=\"\">If you had lived in Jerusalem 1900 years ago, your life expectancy at birth would have been approximately 19 years.

On July 7, 1972, Harold B. Lee became the eleventh president of the church of Jesus Christ in this dispensation of our world\u2019s history. And in a conference with some seventy-five members of the press and representatives of other news media, he was asked what was the most important counsel that he had to give to the people of the world.

Excluding Enoch, who was translated at age 430, the other nine of the ten patriarchs lived to an average age of 912 years. In one sense they served as the founding fathers of our world civilization. And each was a great man in his own right. Adam will always stand at the head; and under the direction of that magnificent Being, the Savior of the world, he will forever preside over his posterity. Adam was a mighty spirit before this earth was formed, and he was faithful throughout his long mortality. Three years before his death he called together Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah, who were all high priests, and all of the residue of his posterity who were righteous unto the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and there he bestowed upon them his last blessing. The record says:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/keep-the-commandments.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the Lord appeared unto them, and they rose up and blessed Adam, and called him Michael, the prince, the archangel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/keep-the-commandments.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the Lord administered comfort unto Adam, and said unto him: I have set thee to be at the head; a multitude of nations shall come of thee, and thou art a prince over them forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/keep-the-commandments.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd Adam stood up in the midst of the congregation; and, notwithstanding he was bowed down with age, being full of the Holy Ghost, predicted whatsoever should befall his posterity unto the latest generation.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15972\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15972)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15972)\">D&amp;C 107:54\u201356<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/keep-the-commandments.p21\" class=\"\">And the primary message of that great general conference was also centered in that fundamental human requirement to \u201cKeep the commandments.\u201d Many of those who attended this conference in the year of the world 927 had made inspiring records in righteousness. The Bible says that Seth, the son of Adam, was a perfect man. At age 65 Enoch was called on a special mission to preach the gospel, which lasted for the next 365 years. The record says of him:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/keep-the-commandments.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he saw the Lord, and he walked with him, and was before his face continually; and Enoch walked with God three hundred and sixty-five years, making him four hundred and thirty years old when he was translated.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15971\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15971)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15971)\">D&amp;C 107:49<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/keep-the-commandments.p23\" class=\"\">Certainly Enoch was one of the best educated men who ever lived in the world.

This city of Zion and all of its people were translated and taken up to God in the year of the world 1052.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/keep-the-commandments.p24\" class=\"\">All of these founding patriarchs lived in the days of great wickedness, and yet the scripture says that Noah was also perfect in his generation.
