In that way he brought the gospel back to earth, for the record contained the gospel in its simplicity and in its fulness. The record was there, it was the word of God, and it came about by the act of God. It was a mighty miracle of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/the-angel-moroni-came.p54\" class=\"\">So Moroni fulfilled two biblical prophecies in coming to Joseph Smith: the fourteenth chapter of Revelation [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125328\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125328)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125328)\">Rev. 14<\/a><\/span>] and the twenty-ninth chapter of Isaiah [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125266\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125266)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125266)\">Isa. 29<\/a><\/span>]. He did come to earth as an angel. He did deliver to Joseph Smith the golden record which had been prepared under the direction of Almighty God. It is a new witness for the Lord Jesus Christ; it declares, as does the Bible, that Jesus of Nazareth indeed is the Son of God, our Savior and Redeemer. That book is available to all mankind. A million copies are published each year, in more than a score of languages.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/the-angel-moroni-came.p55\" class=\"\">So, again, we testify that the Book of Mormon is true. It is the word of Almighty God, restored in this day by angelic ministry and by the direction of God himself. We testify that Moroni came as an angel on September 21 , 1823, revealing his ancient record and that he did so as a servant of Jesus Christ. Before its publication, he allowed twelve modern American citizens of good repute to examine the golden record so that they could bear witness of having seen or handled it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/the-angel-moroni-came.p56\" class=\"\">We testify that Joseph Smith indeed was a modern prophet of God, raised up specially for the purpose we have described.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/the-angel-moroni-came.p57\" class=\"\">And most solemnly we testify that Jesus Christ of Nazareth is the Son of God, our Savior, our Redeemer, our Creator. We testify further that we are His ordained servants, and we speak by the power that he restored to us and has given to us in this day. And we testify, in all solemnity, that this work in which we are engaged is verily true, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
