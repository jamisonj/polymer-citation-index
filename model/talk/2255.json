One day I received a telephone call from my counterpart in Newark, New Jersey, who said that a passenger train had arrived without its baggage car. The patrons were angry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/watch-the-switches-in-your-life.p17\" class=\"\">We discovered that the train had been properly made up in Oakland, California, and properly delivered to St. Louis, from which station it was to be carried to its destination on the east coast.

Each has thrown a switch in the life of a boy that put him on a track that carried him far away from what might have been a great and foreordained calling. And as Nephi said, \u201c\u2026 thus the devil cheateth their souls and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3887\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3887)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3887)\">2 Ne. 28:21<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/watch-the-switches-in-your-life.p20\" class=\"\">I hold in my hand a small package that I bought in Switzerland.

The seeds are tiny, like small dry flecks of pepper. But on the face of the package is pictured what they might become\u2014the mature plant, the flower that grows high in the Swiss and Austrian Alps, that weathers the storms that rage through those mountains, that blooms beneath the snow, that gives beauty to Alpine slopes and meadows. These tiny seeds have within them the potential for vigorous and beautiful life.

Your I.Q. may not be the highest in the world. So what? Our jails are filled with clever men who were anything but smart. I have concluded that the work of the world is not done by intellectual geniuses. It is done by men of ordinary capacity who use their abilities in an extraordinary manner. As a member of this church you have the obligation to seek learning and to improve your skills.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/watch-the-switches-in-your-life.p24\" class=\"\">It matters not whether you choose to be merchant, teacher, carpenter, plumber, mechanic, doctor, or to follow any other honorable vocation. The important thing is that you qualify to be useful workers in society. It is so easy and so tragic to become a drifter, a drop-out. It is so challenging and so satisfying to be a producer. In so doing, you will bless not only your own lives and the lives of those you serve, but you will also bring honor to and respect for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. For your identity as a Mormon will be recognized and the image of the Church will be improved by reason of the opinion which others have of you as you serve them. You cannot afford ever to do cheap or shoddy work.

I spoke the other day with a young man who wished to go on a mission. In previous months he had been immoral. He and the girl with whom he had been associated thought they had done a clever thing. But he had come to realize that he had taken from her something precious that could never be restored, and that he had lost something of his own for which there was no compensation. With tears running down his cheeks he made his own judgment that he was unworthy to go into the world to teach to others a standard of behavior he had been unable to live himself. He had neither peace nor gladness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/watch-the-switches-in-your-life.p30\" class=\"\">Be clean, for the sake of your posterity. Someday each of you will meet the girl of your dreams. If you truly love her, you would rather cut off your right arm than hurt her. Never lose sight of the fact that you are the line through which will pass the qualities of your forebears to the posterity who will come after you. Pause and think. Will those qualities be diminished or enhanced because of your behavior? Be clean, and your strength will be as the strength of ten because your heart is pure.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/watch-the-switches-in-your-life.p31\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Be obedient,<\/span> my dear young friends.

While the father worked through the day, the boy amused himself with one thing and another. Over the fence were some old farm buildings derelict and tumbled down. The boy with imagination saw in them castles to be entered. He climbed through the fence and approached the buildings to begin his exploration. As he drew near, a voice was heard to say, \u201cHarold, don\u2019t go over there.\u201d He looked to see if his father was around. He was not. But the boy heeded the warning. He turned and ran.
