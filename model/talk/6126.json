What a blessing these beautiful temples will be to these dedicated Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/are-we-keeping-pace.p7\" class=\"\">Again quoting President Hinckley: \u201cIf temple ordinances are an essential part of the restored gospel, and I testify that they are, then we must provide the means by which they can be accomplished. \u2026 The temple ordinances become the crowning blessings the Church has to offer.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-98911_000_004\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1998, 88.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/are-we-keeping-pace.p8\" class=\"\">There is an urgency in this work that motivates us to extend the blessings of the temple to as many of our Heavenly Father\u2019s children as possible. I was impressed with an experience of President Wilford Woodruff when he told of a visitation he received from the Prophet Joseph Smith some time after the Prophet was martyred. According to President Woodruff\u2019s own account: \u201c[Joseph Smith] came to me and spoke to me. He said he could not stop to talk with me because he was in a hurry. The next man I met was Father Smith; he could not talk with me because he was in a hurry. I met half a dozen brethren who had held high positions on earth, and none of them could stop to talk with me because they were in a hurry. I was much astonished. By and by I saw the Prophet again and I got the privilege of asking him a question.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/are-we-keeping-pace.p9\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018Now,\u2019 said I, \u2018I want to know why you are in a hurry.

Every dispensation that has had the priesthood on the earth and has gone into the celestial kingdom has had a certain amount of work to do to prepare to go to the earth with the Savior when he goes to reign on the earth. Each dispensation has had ample time to do this work. We have not. We are the last dispensation, and so much work has to be done, and we need to be in a hurry to accomplish it.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/are-we-keeping-pace.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cOf course, that was satisfactory,\u201d President Woodruff concluded, \u201cbut it was new doctrine to me.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-98911_000_004\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff<\/span> (1946), 288\u201389.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/are-we-keeping-pace.p12\" class=\"\">Other latter-day prophets have been similarly motivated to move us along more quickly in accomplishing the significant work of this last great dispensation.

President Hinckley is doing all that he can do to accelerate the work. He is traveling the world to an unprecedented degree to strengthen and edify the Saints and to urge them upward and onward. He has made himself available to the world media in order to share the message of the Restoration with the widest possible audience. And he is overseeing the most extensive era of temple building in history in an attempt to speed up our ability to accomplish the overwhelming amount of work we have been assigned to complete in this dispensation of time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/are-we-keeping-pace.p15\" class=\"\">Our President is dynamically out in front, showing the way. The question we must all ask ourselves is, \u201cAre we keeping pace with him?\u201d Each one of us must be prepared to answer that question. I can assure you that it is a subject of considerable discussion among the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. I hope the same is true of every council in every ward and stake in the Church. This is not the time to relax or to coast in our callings. Every council of the Church should be working together on ways to be more effective in preparing our members to be worthy to enjoy all the blessings of the Church and especially the blessings of the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/are-we-keeping-pace.p16\" class=\"\">We are rapidly approaching a time when the number of operating temples throughout the world will be double what it was just four short years ago. Now is a good time to ask, <span class=\"emphasis\">stake presidents<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">bishops,<\/span> what are your stake and ward councils doing to fill these temples with worthy members and sufficient dedicated workers? Are your priesthood quorums functioning at peak efficiency? Are the home and visiting teachers involved in serving those families to whom they are assigned? Are your auxiliaries actively building faith and testimonies? Are the activities in your stake and ward aimed at strengthening the family and every member? Are you carefully coordinating the proselyting efforts with the stake and full-time missionaries, helping them to find, teach, and baptize many more people? Are your councils concerning themselves with helping every new convert and less-active member become fully fellowshipped and completely anchored to the doctrines of the Church?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/are-we-keeping-pace.p17\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, there is much to be done by us to complete the work assigned by the Lord to this dispensation. We must focus our work, and we must work smarter if we are to accomplish our role in preparing all Church members to receive their temple blessings. Church leaders, both men and women, can and must extend the length of their reach and broaden the power of their influence. We must be wise to protect and teach our own families first and then take full advantage of the inspired Church council system to achieve greater success in the work Heavenly Father has given us to do, within the time frame He has given us to do it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/are-we-keeping-pace.p18\" class=\"\">Take, for example, the critical role of the ward council in fellowshipping every convert and activating those who are less active. As each member now knows, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are greatly concerned over the well-being of every new and less-active member of the Church. No ward or branch council should allow a new convert to feel insecure in his newly embraced Church membership. And yet there are still too many of them who do not feel warmly welcomed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/are-we-keeping-pace.p19\" class=\"\">Recently a new member wrote to me: \u201cSometimes I \u2026 feel like it was a mistake for me to be baptized. I know this Church is true, and I have a strong testimony, but I still question. \u2026 When I was investigating, everyone from my ward were always there for me and always wanted to talk to me and always wanted to help me out. \u2026 Since I was baptized it\u2019s like they don\u2019t even notice when I go to church or when I don\u2019t. I hardly hear from anybody. \u2026 I just can\u2019t understand why the people in my ward have just forgotten me. I feel so lonely and confused. \u2026 I can\u2019t talk to my bishop because \u2026 we aren\u2019t close at all. He didn\u2019t even remember me when I went back to church. Please help me if you can.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/are-we-keeping-pace.p20\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, while wonderful progress has been made, the time has come when we must marshal every resource to fellowship every convert and bless the lives of many more of our Heavenly Father\u2019s children. This can best be accomplished when ward council members see that each organization does its part to make sure new members have friends, have an assignment, and are nourished by the good word of God. Every soul is very precious to our Heavenly Father. We must never forget that through the Atonement, the Lord Jesus Christ paid a great price for the redemption of each one of us. His suffering must not be in vain because we fail to nurture and teach those who are striving to be active in the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/are-we-keeping-pace.p21\" class=\"\">You sisters can help build personal testimony in the lives of every woman, young woman, and child in the ward. How grateful we are for your strength. Sisters, talk together in your councils about how to love, support, and teach each other the beautiful blessings and promises of the gospel. How wonderful it would be if every woman in the world understood her true destiny as expressed in the Young Women theme. You know the words: \u201cWe are daughters of our Heavenly Father who loves us, and we love him. We will \u2018stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places \u2026\u2019 as we strive to live the Young Women Values, which are\u2014Faith, Divine Nature, Individual Worth, Knowledge, Choice and Accountability, Good Works, and Integrity.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-98911_000_004\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Young Women Leadership Handbook<\/span> (1992), 4.]<\/span><\/sup> Learning of and acting upon these values will save and bless both young and older women.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/are-we-keeping-pace.p22\" class=\"\">You members of the bishopric and Young Men presidency, get close to each young man and help him to be worthy to be ordained at the assigned age to the appropriate priesthood.
