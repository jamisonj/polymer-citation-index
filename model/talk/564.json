That expression of\nbrotherhood, love, just given by Brother Stephen L Richards is akin, indeed it is identical\nwith the spirit that prompted the Apostle of old to say, \"I know that I have passed from death\nunto life because I love the brethren\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1031\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1031)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1031)\">1 Jn. 3:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat is the sublime feeling which every member holding the Priesthood may experience if he\nwill do his duty and live uprightly before the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nUNBECOMING GAMES\n<\/p><p>\nI have in mind only one or two items to give at the conclusion of this impressive conference.\nOne that I mention by way of caution is that in your carnivals that you hold in order to raise\nmoney for building purposes, you avoid those games which are unbecoming, or that will cast\nin any way reflection upon our young girls or men who hold the Priesthood. We know the\ndifficulties that you have to raise fifty per cent of the cost of these edifices, and we commend\nyou highly, and our sisters, for the effort you put forth. But there are some games which are\ncarried on in carnivals outside the Church which are unbecoming the recreation furnished by\nthe Church officers.\n<\/p><p>\nOne I will name is a feature in which young Beehive Girls come out in public in bathing\nsuits, sit on a spring board before young men who throw balls to hit a certain spot which will\nloosen the spring-board, and cause the young girl to drop into a tank of water.\n<\/p><p>\nI have seen colored and white men do that for so much money, but let us not have our young\ngirls do it, nor men who hold the leadership in the Priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nFELLOWSHIP IN THE PRIESTHOOD\n<\/p><p>\nNow, there are three other items which I will name, just briefly I hope, and I will illustrate\neach by practical experiences. The first is the value of companionship in quorums, already\nmentioned by my counselors.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the most pleasing experiences of this great conference was meeting a bishop who\ncame to the stand and said, \"I am here with some of my deacons, whom I should like to have\nthe privilege of meeting you.\" A true leader accompanying his quorum boys to conference!\n<\/p><p>\nFellowship in the Priesthood! If we can get the bishops to fellowship the priests in every\nward, and in some way, at opportunities favorable, meet those young men and young women\nof corresponding age in some social or groups or meetings, and win their admiration and\nconfidence, we can avoid some unpleasant things which are occurring in our towns. For those\npriests and girls determine largely the moral atmosphere of your town. You bishops are the\nleaders. Your counselors can aid you in associating with the teachers and the deacons.\n<\/p><p>\nThis companionship applies also to Elders.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many ways in which we can get these indifferent elders together without inviting\nthem to do things which are difficult. Some of them do not like to pray. They hesitate about\nstanding in public to preach, and some of them would rather go fishing or playing golf on\nSunday than attend meeting. But, not one of those indifferent elders will refuse an invitation,\nfor example, to come to a funeral of one of the townsfolk, or one of their members, or of one\nof their members' wives, and if you will come as a quorum and sit together as a quorum,\nthere is one means of fellowship. Our High Priests are doing it more than Seventies or Elders.\n<\/p><p>\nI have attended a number of funerals where I have seen reserved seats for High Priests, in\npaying respect to a departed brother. There is group fellowship.\n<\/p><p>\nAgain these indifferent men will come to your quorum socials. Make those socials of a high\norder, and thus you will come in personal contact with them.\n<\/p><p>\nWe must be mutually helpful. This world would not exist if it were not for the mutual aid we\ngive one another from the time we are born until we are laid away.\n<\/p><p>\nREVERENCE\n<\/p><p>\nA second principle to which I wish to refer is reverence. I have spoken upon this several\ntimes, and intend to continue to speak upon it, because I look upon reverence as one of the\nhighest qualities of the soul. An irreverent man is not a believing man. I think a man cannot\ntestify of his knowledge of the existence of God and take God's name in vain. He can do it\nby words, but as the old king in \"Hamlet,\" his words will fly up, but his thoughts remain\nbelow.\n<\/p><p>\nI was deeply impressed with the lesson that President George Q. Morris taught his\nmissionaries in the Sacred Grove. They have an entrance there now, a sort of fence and a gate\nleading into the sacred spot, where they hold the service.\n<\/p><p>\nThere as you enter the gate is a sign, \"Quiet Please.\" I wish everybody in the Church could\nexperience that quiet attitude of several hundred missionaries in that Sacred Grove, and as\nsoon as the Amen of the benediction was given, these elders retired without consultation,\nwithout shaking hands, to the outside part of the grove.\n<\/p><p>\nIn our meeting houses today we have reverence just as soon as the hour comes for worship,\nbut in Sunday Schools particularly, at the change of classes there is a hub-bub. That is not\neducative to our children. They have done away with the marching we used to have when I\nwas in the Sunday School work in Weber. They now think it undignified for older persons to\nmarch.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, Superintendents, you may do this, at least&mdash;when you separate for class work, let a\nclass rise and pass out to the room, and then another class follow, without this careless,\nsometimes boisterous attitude of everybody's mingling and talking as he goes to his class.\n<\/p><p>\nReverence indicates high culture, and true faith in deity and in his righteousness.\n<\/p><p>\nKINDNESS TO ANIMALS\n<\/p><p>\nThe third is kindness. The first line in what is now known as the \"Psalm of Love\" is this:\n\"Love suffereth long and is kind\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"205\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 205)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(205)\">1 Cor. 13:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA true Latter-day Saint is kind to animals, is kind to every created thing, for God has created\nall. He is right, the author of the \"Ancient Mariner\" when he deplores the killing of the\nalbatross, when he wrote these lines: \n<\/p><p>\n\"He prayeth best who loveth best all things both great and small,\n<\/p><p>\nFor the dear God who loveth us, he made and loveth all.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI am mentioning this because I have seen, in my travels, such cruelty in the world,\nparticularly in the Near East. I was touched with the treatment that those people gave, and\nprobably now give the humble little donkey. Every caravan is led by that poor, humble\ncreature, carrying a heavier load than his own weight, it seemed sometimes. Often the driver,\nthe leader of those camels, if he became weary would climb on top of the load the donkey\nwas carrying. As you drive along those highways, on the roads you would  see the carcasses\nof the donkeys that walked and carried, struggled and staggered until they fell. They were\nunloaded and left for their bones to bleach on the side of the highway.\n<\/p><p>\nCamels, if a bit obstreperous, would have steel prongs piercing the sides of their jaws. If they\nhappened to pull back, the clamp would close and those prongs penetrate not only the skin but\nthe flesh as well.\n<\/p><p>\nHowever, we need not go to the Near East to see cruelty to animals. We see it around here if\nwe but open our eyes. It is a good thing to teach our boys to be kind. A man who was\nworking for me once on the farm came home about sundown, and said, \"I have just killed a\nporcupine over there.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI said, \"Why did you kill it?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"just for fun.\" And I said, \"Did you kill it or is it over there suffering?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Oh, I killed it.\" Well, I wondered, so I just took time to cross those two creeks and go over\nto the little hill. He had not killed it. The poor creature was just stunned, its head was beaten,\nand he was struggling. What fun can there be in treating dumb animals in that cruel way!\n<\/p><p>\nKINDNESS TO WIVES\n<\/p><p>\nBut I mention this now, because I think we are cruel to our wives. I have here two letters,\none anonymous, another signed by a woman. They are asking \"What shall we do? Our\nhusbands are cruel to us.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSays one, \"My husband has a terrible temper. He comes home and scolds the children. He is\ncruel to me. At first he seemed to be a good, loving husband, but when my first baby was\nborn, then was born my troubles.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Bowen is aiding greatly in taking care of appeals for cancellations of sealings. I am\ngrieved, brethren, I say \"I\" because the responsibility of canceling those sealings rests upon\nthe one who holds that key. I am grieved indeed to note in those appeals the number of\ninstances which indicate that some husbands treat their wives cruelly.\n<\/p><p>\nI cannot imagine a man's being cruel to a woman. I cannot imagine her so conducting herself\nas to merit such treatment. Perhaps there are women in the world who exasperate their\nhusbands but no man is justified in resorting to physical force or in exploding his feelings in\nprofanity. There are men, undoubtedly, in the world who are thus beastly, but no man who\nholds the Priesthood of God should so debase himself.\n<\/p><p>\nSome of us are now past the threescore and ten. We can look back over the short life, and it\ndoes seem short, and treasure those things which seem most precious. Tonight, one of those\nthings, one of the most precious possessions is my memory of a home in which love was\nsupreme, in which I cannot recall ever a cross word having passed between father and mother.\nWe owe that blessing to our children.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Love suffereth long and is kind\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"206\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 206)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(206)\">1 Cor. 13:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe spirit of kindness is as enduring as love itself. Let us go home, and if we have been\ncruel, either by treating our wives with indifference, or by scolding, or loud talking, if we\nhave been cruel to our children by neglect, or by striking them, let us see if we cannot repent\nand look introspectively and see whether or not we are not to blame for some of the\nconditions that arouse these passions.\n<\/p><p>\nCHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren, I wish to bear you a testimony which I think I have never before given in\npublic. Since childhood it has been very easy for me to believe in the reality of the visions of\nthe Prophet Joseph Smith. What I am going to say may seem very simple to you, but to me it\nis a heart petal.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen a very young child in the home of my youth, I was fearful at night. I traced it back to\na vivid dream in which two Indians came into the yard. I ran to the house for protection, and\none of them shot an arrow and hit me in the back. Only a dream, but I felt that blow, and I\nwas very much frightened, for in the dream they entered, one a tall one, and a smaller one,\nand sneered and frightened mother.\n<\/p><p>\nI never got over it. Adding to that were the fears of mother, for when father was away with\nthe herd or on some mission, mother would never retire without looking under the bed, so\nburglars or men who might enter the house and try to take advantage of mother and the\nyoung children were real to me.\n<\/p><p>\nWhatever the conditions, I was very much frightened. One night I could not sleep, and I\nfancied I heard noises around the house. Mother was away in another room. Thomas E. by\nmy side was sleeping soundly. I became terribly wrought in my feeling, and I decided to pray\nas my parents had taught me.\n<\/p><p>\nI thought I could pray only by getting out of bed and kneeling, and that was a terrible test.\nBut I did finally bring myself to get out of bed and kneel and pray to God to protect mother\nand the family. And a voice as clearly to me as mine is to you, said, \"Don't be afraid.\nNothing will hurt you.\" Where it came from, what it was, I am not saying. You may judge.\nTo me it was a direct answer, and there came an assurance that I should never be hurt in bed\nat night.\n<\/p><p>\nEASY TO BELIEVE\n<\/p><p>\nI say it has been easy for me to understand and believe the reality of the visions of the\nProphet Joseph. It was easy for me in youth to accept his vision, the appearance of God the\nFather and his Son, Jesus Christ to the boy praying\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30305\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30305)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30305)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>).\nI thought of nothing else. Of course that\nis real. It was easy for me to believe that Moroni came to him there in the room\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30308\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30308)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30308)\">JS&mdash;H 1:30-33<\/a><\/span>). Heavenly\nbeings were real from my babyhood on, and as years came those impressions strengthened by\nreason and strengthened by the inspiration of God directly to my soul.\n<\/p><p>\nI know that those visions were real, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and when\nwe say this it means that I know that Jesus lives, that Christ is our Redeemer and that this is\nhis Church. We are merely his representatives. When we accept that, then the reality of God\nthe Father, Father of our spirits, is easy to accept.\n<\/p><p>\nThese things being real, brethren, we cannot do anything else but try our utmost to do what\nJesus Christ, our Redeemer, asks us to do, for he has given us the Gospel that bears his name,\nand in the words of Peter, \"There is none other name given under heaven whereby we must\nbe saved\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7648\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7648)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7648)\">Acts 4:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you. With all my heart I bless you, and pray that peace and love and kindness will\nabide not only in your hearts, but in your homes, that your wives, our wives and our children\nmay have memories sweet of a home in which God was pleased to dwell.\n<\/p><p>\nMay this be our lot, our experience, throughout the Church in all the world, I pray in the\nname of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
