As related by Luke, a certain lawyer tempted Jesus, saying, \u201cMaster, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32385\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32385)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32385)\">Luke 10:25<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p7\" class=\"\">In New Testament times a lawyer was the equivalent of a scribe, who was by profession a student and teacher of the law, including the written law of the Pentateuch, and also \u201cthe traditions of the elders.\u201d (Bible Dictionary, s.v. <span class=\"emphasis\">Lawyer<\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p8\" class=\"\">This learned man sought either to test the Lord concerning His knowledge of the law or to display his own.

However, the scholar was not satisfied with so simple a response. Luke records that the learned man, \u201cwilling to justify himself,\u201d asked a further question of the Lord, \u201cWho is my neighbour?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32390\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32390)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32390)\">Luke 10:29<\/a><\/span>.) And Jesus answered by telling a story:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cA certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cBut a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32391\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32391)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32391)\">Luke 10:30\u201335<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p18\" class=\"\">Understanding of this parable is improved when we recall that the work of the ministering in the sanctuary was assigned to the tribe of Levi. The Levite\u2019s duty was to assist the priests in their religious services. Likewise, the essential responsibility of a priest was to serve as a mediator between his people and God by representing them officially in worship and sacrifice. (See Bible Dictionary, s.v. <span class=\"emphasis\">Priest <\/span>and <span class=\"emphasis\">Levites<\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p19\" class=\"\">The people of Samaria consisted of a mixed population of Israelites and Gentiles. The Jews despised them. The priest and the Levite refused aid to the half-dead man who was in obvious need, and even distanced themselves from him by walking on the \u201cother side.\u201d It was the despised Samaritan who had compassion on the wounded fellow. He tenderly bound up his wounds, administered soothing oil, disinfected his wounds, placed him upon his own beast and took him to an inn, and stayed with him overnight. He then paid the cost of his care and assured the host that whatever more was spent would be repaid.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p20\" class=\"\">The Savior then asked a further question of the scholar, \u201cWhich now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32392\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32392)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32392)\">Luke 10:36<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p21\" class=\"\">The lawyer was caught in his own cunning, but accurately answered, \u201cHe that shewed mercy on him.

The beauty of the parables of the Lord is that they have many applications, and thus their teaching value is unending. I would like to suggest an application of the principles taught in this parable to a current setting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p24\" class=\"\">There are many of God\u2019s children who are wounded or sick in spirit. Many once enjoyed fellowship with the body of the Saints, but for one reason or another are now on the roadside. They are the less active among us. Generally, we know who they are and have association with them in various settings, but because they are not physically sick or injured, we too often play the part of the priest or the Levite and walk by \u201con the other side.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p25\" class=\"\">In this dramatic parable, Jesus contrasted the response of the two respected religionists with that of a despised citizen of Samaria. There is at least a scintilla of similarity here to an elders president, a high priests group leader, a member of the bishopric, or a home teacher, and to the less-active brother or sister who has fallen inactive by the wayside. Perhaps we do not despise them, but we sometimes ignore them or otherwise disregard them. Each of us can be a good Samaritan by dealing compassionately with these neglected brothers and sisters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p26\" class=\"\">We can bind up their spiritual wounds by rendering needed service, pouring in the soothing oil of friendship and supplying the soul-healing balm of genuine brotherly and sisterly love. We can set them in our own automobiles and accompany them to our homes and places of worship, devote the necessary time and attention to warmly fellowship them. The good Samaritan spent the night with his wounded friend and stayed with him until satisfied that he was on his way to recovery. Similarly, we ought to become close enough to these less-active brothers and sisters to truly become their friends and support and sustain them while they spiritually heal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p27\" class=\"\">This parable also teaches that a little sacrifice and investment of one\u2019s time and money may be necessary. Such healing care should not be given out of duty, but rendered out of a full heart. Indeed, even the lawyer seemed to catch the spirit of the Lord\u2019s teachings in the parable, because it was he who defined a neighbor as \u201che that shewed mercy.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32395\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32395)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32395)\">Luke 10:37<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p28\" class=\"\">Most of us are acquainted with someone who is spiritually ill or wounded, lying on the roadside half dead, and who desperately needs the assistance of a good LDS brother or sister\u2014that is, <span class=\"emphasis\">a Latter-day Samaritan.<\/span> Our prophet has repeatedly reminded us that rescuing the less active is one of our greatest challenges of service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p29\" class=\"\">I recount a simple parable, as told through an interpreter by a Sunday School president in Hong Kong:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-latter-day-samaritan.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cAn enterprising turkey gathered the flock together and, following instructions and demonstrations, taught them how to fly.
