We are all totally in the hands of the Lord. As many of you know, I recently underwent major surgery. It is the first time in my 95 years that I have been a patient in a hospital.

My doctors say that I still have some residual problems.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p8\" class=\"\">I am now approaching my 96th birthday.

Since that time I have spoken in every general conference of the Church. I have given well over 200 such talks. I have dealt with a great variety of subjects. But running through all has been a dominant thread of testimony of this great latter-day work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p17\" class=\"\">But things have changed and are changing. My beloved companion of 67 years left me two years ago. I miss her more than I can say. She was really a remarkable woman, one with whom I walked side by side in perfect companionship for more than two-thirds of a century. As I look back upon my life, I do so with a measure of wonder and awe. Everything good that has happened, including my marriage, I owe to my activity in the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p18\" class=\"\">I had occasion the other evening to review an incomplete list of societies and organizations that have honored me, all because of my activity in the Church. Presidents of the United States, a substantial number of them, have come to the Office of the Presidency of the Church. I have on my office wall a photograph of my presenting a Book of Mormon to President Ronald Reagan. In my bookcase is the Presidential Medal of Freedom given to me by President Bush. I have been to the White House on a number of occasions. I have hosted and mingled with prime ministers and ambassadors of many nations, including Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and Harold Macmillan of the United Kingdom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p19\" class=\"\">I have known and worked with every President of the Church from President Grant down to Howard W.

I have known and loved all of the General Authorities through these many, many years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p20\" class=\"\">I am now trying to deal with the many books and artifacts that I have accumulated over the years. In the course of this process I found an old journal with sporadic entries from the years 1951 to 1954. At that time I was a counselor in my stake presidency and had not yet been called as a General Authority.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p21\" class=\"\">As I read through this old journal, I recalled with appreciation how, through the kindness of the Lord, I came to know very intimately and well all of the First Presidency and members of the Quorum of the Twelve. Such an opportunity could not now be had by anyone because the Church is much larger.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p22\" class=\"\">The journal contains entries such as the following:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cMarch 11, 1953\u2014President McKay discussed with me the April conference program for mission presidents.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cThursday, March 19\u2014Joseph Fielding Smith asked that I get one of the Brethren to illustrate handling of Saturday night missionary conferences. \u2026 I believe that Spencer W.

He said, \u2018A farmer had a large tract of land. When he grew old it became too much for him. He had a family of boys. He called the boys around him and told them they would have to carry the load. The father rested. But one day he walked out into the field. The boys told him to go back, they did not need his help. He said, \u201cMy shadow on this farm is worth more than the labor of all of you.\u201d\u2019 President McKay said that the father in the story represented President Stephen L Richards, who was ill, but whose contribution and friendship President McKay valued so highly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cFriday, April 3, 1953\u2014Attended temple meeting with General Authorities and mission presidents from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. More than 30 mission presidents spoke.

All making good progress.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cTuesday, April 14\u2014President Richards at office, had a pleasant visit with him.

Bowen, member of the Council of the Twelve, died after more than a year of serious illness. Another of my friends has gone. \u2026 I got to know him well. He was a wise and steady man. Could never be rushed, and was never in a rush. Extremely deliberate\u2014a man of uncommon wisdom, a man of great and simple faith. The old, wise heads are passing on. They were my friends. In my brief time I have seen many of the great men of the Church come and go. Most of them I have worked with and known intimately. Time has a way of erasing their memory. Another five years and such names as Merrill, Widtsoe, Bowen\u2014all powerful figures\u2014will be forgotten by all but a few. A man must get his satisfaction from his work each day, must recognize that his family may remember him, that he may count with the Lord, but beyond that, small will be his monument among the coming generations.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p30\" class=\"\">And so it goes. I read it only to illustrate the remarkable relationship I had as a young man with members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p31\" class=\"\">During my years I have also walked among the impoverished and poor of the earth and shared with them my love, my concern, and my faith. I have associated with men and women of privilege and stature from many parts of the earth. Through these opportunities I hope I have made at least a small difference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p32\" class=\"\">When I was a young man, a mere boy of 11, I received a patriarchal blessing from a man I had never seen before and never saw thereafter. It is a remarkable document, a prophetic document. It is personal, and I will not read extensively from it. However, it contains this statement: \u201cThe nations of the earth shall hear thy voice and be brought to a knowledge of the truth by the wonderful testimony which thou shalt bear.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p33\" class=\"\">When I was released from my mission in England, I took a short trip on the continent. I had borne my testimony in London; I did so in Berlin and again in Paris and later in Washington, D.C. I said to myself that I had borne my testimony in these great capitals of the world and had fulfilled that part of my blessing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p34\" class=\"\">That proved to be a mere scratching of the surface. Since then I have lifted my voice on every continent, in cities large and small, all up and down from north to south and east to west across this broad world\u2014from Cape Town to Stockholm, from Moscow to Tokyo to Montreal, in every great capital of the world. It is all a miracle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p35\" class=\"\">Last year I asked members of the Church throughout the world to again read the Book of Mormon. Thousands, even hundreds of thousands, responded to that challenge. The Prophet Joseph said in 1841, \u201cI told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 4:461).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p36\" class=\"\">Accepting the truth of this statement, I think something remarkable must have happened to the people of this Church. They were observed reading the Book of Mormon while riding the bus, while eating lunch, while in the doctor\u2019s office waiting room, and in scores of other situations. I trust and hope that we have drawn closer to God because of the reading of this book.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p37\" class=\"\">Last December it was my privilege, together with many of you, to honor the Prophet Joseph on the 200th anniversary of his birth. With Elder Ballard, I was at his birthplace in Vermont while this great Conference Center was filled with Latter-day Saints and the word was carried by satellite transmission across the world in tribute to the beloved Prophet of this great latter-day work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p38\" class=\"\">And so I might go on. I apologize again for speaking in a personal vein. However, I do so only as an expression of appreciation and gratitude for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, all of this coming to pass because of the place in which the Lord has put me. My heart is overwhelmed with gratitude and love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p39\" class=\"\">To repeat:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I took the one less traveled by,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And that has made all the difference.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god.p43\" class=\"\">I trust that you will not regard what I have said as an obituary.

The vision given the Prophet Joseph in the grove of Palmyra was not an imaginary thing. It was real. It occurred in the broad light of day. Both the Father and the Son spoke to the boy. He saw Them standing in the air above him. He heard Their voices. He gave heed to Their instruction.
