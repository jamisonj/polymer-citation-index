I salute them, and you, my brethren, as my friends.\n<\/p><p>\nTRUE FRIENDLINESS\n<\/p><p>\nI have a friendly feeling toward all those who hear my voice, and toward all mankind. I hope\nthat feeling is reciprocated. I would like to do something for my friends, but what can I do? I\nremember the Apostle Peter on one occasion when there was an afflicted person pleading for\naid, said, \"Money I have not, but such as I have, I give freely unto you. Be ye healed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7515\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7515)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7515)\">Acts 3:6<\/a><\/span>). And he was healed.\n<\/p><p>\nMoney I have not to give to my friends who are so numerous, but as a witness for the Lord\nJesus Christ I would point the way to those who have not understood the way of life and\nsalvation&mdash;the way into that narrow path that leads to that goal. And to those who have\nentered the path I would counsel them to neither deviate to the right nor to the left, but to\npursue a straightforward course, that when they reach the end of the trail they will not be\ndisappointed with their life's work.\n<\/p><p>\nQuoting from Whittier's \"Maud Muller\":\n<\/p><p>\nOf all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: It might have been.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE REQUIREMENTS OF THE GOSPEL\n<\/p><p>\nI desire to add my testimony to the testimonies of my brethren of this conference, for I have a\ntestimony abiding in my soul, and I know without any question that the work in which we\nLatter-day Saints are engaged is the work of the Lord, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, the\npower of God unto salvation unto all those who accept it and live according to its precepts\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42660\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42660)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42660)\">Rom. 1:16<\/a><\/span>). It\nis the same as that which was instituted in the councils of heaven before the world was. It is\nnot a new gospel, but the old one restored.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is the same as Christ our Lord taught and lived, and by living it made him what he was in\nlife and what he is after life, enthroned in glory at the right hand of our Father in heaven. It\nis intended to make us like him and to save us with him, and it will do so if we follow in his\nfootsteps, and walk in the light as he is in the light, loving the Lord and keeping his\ncommandments, and this I admonish all my hearers and myself, that it will be the efforts of\nour lives so to do.\n<\/p><p>\nIt involves the accepting and receiving of certain principles and ordinances, the keeping of\ncertain commandments, the obeying of the laws of God, performing acts of service to our\nFather in heaven, and to his children here on the earth, the making of sacrifices, the forming\nof family relations, ties that are to exist throughout the eternities, to live and serve the Lord\nby faith and not by sight (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3002\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3002)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3002)\">2 Cor. 5:7<\/a><\/span>),\nputting our trust in him, living by every word that proceedeth forth from his mouth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33865\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33865)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33865)\">Matt. 4:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is reward ample, that of forgiveness of sin, a wonderful blessing innate in the gospel of\nChrist; the companionship of the Holy Ghost, the resurrection with the just, and eternal life\nand exaltation in the kingdom and presence of God the Eternal Father and his Son Jesus\nChrist.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior said to his disciples:\n<\/p><p>\nIn my Father's house are many mansions: . . .

There is satisfaction in having been right, and disappointment in\nhaving been wrong on any question which we may have considered; especially is that true\nwhere others have considered the same question and their views and ours differ. The more\nimportant the question under consideration, the greater the satisfaction if right, and the greater\nthe disappointment if wrong.\n<\/p><p>\nTESTIMONY OF THE TRUTH COMES THROUGH REVELATION\n<\/p><p>\nThe most important question that has ever engaged the attention of man is that of religion, or\nsalvation; of what it consists, and how it may be attained. There is no other question that has\nreceived the attention of so many people, and on no other question has there been such a\ndiversity of opinion. Hence, the many religious organizations upon the earth today.\n<\/p><p>\nThe time is to come when every knee is to bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the\nChrist (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41223\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41223)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41223)\">Philip. 2:10-11<\/a><\/span>).\nThen, if not before, as sure as there is a God in heaven and life beyond the veil&mdash;and\nthere is nothing surer&mdash;then men will know, all men will know the truth pertaining to religion\nand salvation.\n<\/p><p>\nBut it is not necessary that we wait until that time, for to know the truth pertaining to\nsalvation the Lord has given us the key to this knowledge, when he said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall know\nof the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27134\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27134)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27134)\">John 7:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHow would we know? By the revelations of God through the Holy Ghost. The same as Peter\nreceived the light and knowledge. When Christ our Savior asked his disciples: \"Whom say ye\nthat I am?\" Peter answered: \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33909\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33909)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33909)\">Matt. 16:15-16<\/a><\/span>).

One has been born again and the other has not. The rich man, Nicodemus, who\ncame to Jesus by night professing belief in him, saying that he knew he must be a teacher\nsent of God for no man could do the work that he did, except God be with him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27114\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27114)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27114)\">John 3:1-2<\/a><\/span>), received this\nreply:\n<\/p><p>\nVerily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of\nGod (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27118\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27118)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27118)\">John 3:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNicodemus not understanding how it would be possible for a man to be born again, the Savior\nreplied: \". . .

We have a\nsplendid example of that where an angel of the Lord appeared to Philip, and told him to go\ndown south to the way leading from Jerusalem, to meet a certain Ethiopian who had been up\nto Jerusalem to worship and was returning to his home in Gaza, Ethiopia. Philip did as he was\nrequired, and as this man came along in his chariot&mdash;for he was a wealthy man, a man of high\nrepute, the treasurer to the queen's treasury in Ethiopia&mdash;he had the Bible open upon his knees\nto the 53rd chapter of Isaiah, and Philip hailed him and asked him if he understood what he\nwas reading. \"How can I,\" said he, \"except some man shall guide me?\" He invited Philip into\nthe chariot, and he sat beside the Ethiopian and taught him the gospel. When they came to a\nplace that had plenty of water, he said: \"Here is water. Why should not I be baptized?\"\n<\/p><p>\nPhilip said: \"If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest.\" He professed belief in Jesus\nChrist, and Philip and he went down into the water, and he was baptized by Philippians When\nthey came up out of the water. Philip was caught away by the Spirit of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7520\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7520)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7520)\">Acts 8:26-39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA teacher is needed.\n<\/p><p>\nI refer you, my friends, to the case of Saul of Tarsus.
