As a prophet of God, President Gordon B. Hinckley put world conditions and our opportunities into crystal clear perspective. Two of his recent comments to priesthood and auxiliary leaders illustrate that prophetic vision. First, regarding the challenge we face:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/how-to-live-well-amid-increasing-evil.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cThe traditional family is under heavy attack. I do not know that things were worse in the times of Sodom and Gomorrah. \u2026 We see similar conditions today. They prevail all across the world. I think our Father must weep as He looks down upon His wayward sons and daughters.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-24905_000_036\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cStanding Strong and Immovable,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,<\/span> 10 Jan. 2004, 20.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/how-to-live-well-amid-increasing-evil.p6\" class=\"\">Now concerning our extraordinary opportunities:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/how-to-live-well-amid-increasing-evil.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cWho in the earlier days could have dreamed of this season of opportunity in which we live? \u2026 The Church is in wonderful condition. \u2026 It will grow and strengthen. \u2026 It is our opportunity and our challenge to continue in this great undertaking, the future of which we can scarcely imagine.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-24905_000_036\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cThe State of the Church,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 2003, 4, 7.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/how-to-live-well-amid-increasing-evil.p8\" class=\"\">You have a choice. You can wring your hands and be consumed with concern for the future or choose to use the counsel the Lord has given to live with peace and happiness in a world awash with evil. If you choose to concentrate on the dark side, this is what you will see. Much of the world is being engulfed in a rising river of degenerate filth, with the abandonment of virtue, righteousness, personal integrity, traditional marriage, and family life. Sodom and Gomorrah was the epitome of unholy life in the Old Testament. It was isolated then; now that condition is spread over the world. Satan skillfully manipulates the power of all types of media and communication. His success has greatly increased the extent and availability of such degrading and destructive influences worldwide. In the past some effort was required to seek out such evil. Now it saturates significant portions of virtually every corner of the world. We cannot dry up the mounting river of evil influences, for they result from the exercise of moral agency divinely granted by our Father. But we can and must, with clarity, warn of the consequences of getting close to its enticing, destructive current.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/how-to-live-well-amid-increasing-evil.p9\" class=\"\">Now the brighter side. Despite pockets of evil, the world overall is majestically beautiful, filled with many good and sincere people. God has provided a way to live in this world and not be contaminated by the degrading pressures evil agents spread throughout it. You can live a virtuous, productive, righteous life by following the plan of protection created by your Father in Heaven: His plan of happiness. It is contained in the scriptures and in the inspired declarations of His prophets. He clothed your intelligence with spirit and made it possible for you to enjoy the wonder of a physical body. When you use that body in the way He has decreed, you will grow in strength and capacity, avoid transgression, and be abundantly blessed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/how-to-live-well-amid-increasing-evil.p10\" class=\"\">When God, our Eternal Father, and His Beloved Son appeared to Joseph Smith in that sublime vision in the Sacred Grove, They began to place on earth again that plan of happiness and all required to sustain it. Part of that restoration included additional sacred scriptures to complement the treasured record of the Bible. These precious scriptures are contained in the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Our Father knew of our day. He prepared the scriptures and provided continuing divine guidance to sustain us. That help will assure that you can live with peace and happiness amid increasing evil.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/how-to-live-well-amid-increasing-evil.p11\" class=\"\">Consider these verses:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/how-to-live-well-amid-increasing-evil.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cAll things must come to pass in their time.

Four young elders and I had spent the day crossing over a mountain pass on a treacherous road. Then we struggled up a riverbed to see if the teachings of the Savior would help a destitute people. What we saw that day was discouraging\u2014undernourished children, adults subsisting on meager crops, some with eyes glazed from seeking refuge with alcohol and drugs. I looked at the tiny, barren village below: a cluster of adobe thatched-roof houses beaten by the harsh environment. The only evidence of life was barking dogs searching for food. There was no electricity, telephone, running water, roads, proper sanitation, nor doctors there. It seemed so hopeless. Yet a solemn prayer confirmed that we should be there. We found a humble people who embraced the restored gospel with determination to live it. They did that under harsh conditions where severe poverty, alcohol, drugs, witchcraft, and immorality were in plentiful supply.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/how-to-live-well-amid-increasing-evil.p22\" class=\"\">Under the guidance of exceptional missionaries, the people learned to work hard to cultivate the fields. They produced a harvest of nutritious vegetables and raised rabbits for better protein. But the best lessons came from beloved missionaries who taught them of a God who loved them, of a Savior who gave His life that they might succeed. Their physical appearance began to change. The light of truth radiated from their happy faces. As devoted, loving emissaries of the Lord, missionaries patiently taught truth to a willing people. Wives and husbands learned how to live in harmony, teach truth to their children, pray, and sense guidance of the Spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/how-to-live-well-amid-increasing-evil.p23\" class=\"\">I watched a six-year-old boy who had carefully observed our first baptismal service act out with his younger sister what he had seen. He carefully arranged her hands, raised his tiny arm to the square, mumbled words, gently lowered her into a depression in the sun-baked earth, led her to a rock where he confirmed her, then shook her hand. The youth learned most quickly. They became obedient to the light of truth taught by the missionaries and in time by their own parents. Through their faith and obedience, I have seen how in one generation youth baptized in that village have overcome a seemingly hopeless future. Some have been missionaries, graduated from universities, and been sealed in the temple. Through their diligence and obedience, they have found purpose and success in life despite an early harsh physical and evil-saturated environment. If it can be done in Quiriza, Bolivia, it can be done anywhere.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/how-to-live-well-amid-increasing-evil.p24\" class=\"\">Have you noticed how Satan works to capture the mind and emotions with flashing images, blaring music, and the stimulation of every physical sense to excess? He diligently strives to fill life with action, entertainment, and stimulation so that one cannot ponder the consequences of his tempting invitations. Think of it. Some are tempted to violate the most basic commandments of God because of seductive actions portrayed as acceptable. They are made to seem attractive, even desirable. There seems to be no serious consequence, rather apparent lasting joy and happiness. But recognize that those performances are controlled by scripts and actors. The outcome of decisions made is likewise manipulated to be whatever the producer wants.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/how-to-live-well-amid-increasing-evil.p25\" class=\"\">Life is not that way. Yes, moral agency allows you to choose what you will, but you cannot control the outcome of those choices. Unlike the false creations of man, our Father in Heaven determines the consequences of your choices. Obedience will yield happiness, while violation of His commandments will not.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/how-to-live-well-amid-increasing-evil.p26\" class=\"\">Consider the lives of those who create what for some are captivating images of life. They generally turn to the most vicious of the destructive influences they depict so appealingly in the media. They may be wealthy, but they are miserable and without conscience.

You are so needed. There are so few willing to make the sacrifice you are making to live righteously. You can develop the sensitivity, love, and kindness to gain supreme happiness within the covenant of an eternal marriage. You will bless your children with insight the world can never give them. Your example will set the course for their successful life as the world becomes even more difficult. You are needed to strengthen the growing kingdom of the Lord and to be role models for so many who lack the light of truth you have.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/how-to-live-well-amid-increasing-evil.p30\" class=\"\">Avoid worldly wickedness.

God\u2019s eternal purpose is for you to be successful in this mortal life. No matter how wicked the world becomes, you can earn that blessing. Seek and be attentive to the personal guidance given to you through the Holy Spirit. Continue to be worthy to receive it.

Through obedience, let Him guide you to peace and happiness amid increased evil in the world, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24905_000_036\"><a name=\"-24905_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-24905_000_036\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cStanding Strong and Immovable,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,<\/span> 10 Jan. 2004, 20.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24905_000_036\"><a name=\"-24905_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-24905_000_036\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cThe State of the Church,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 2003, 4, 7.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24905_000_036\"><a name=\"-24905_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-24905_000_036\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"43572\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43572)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43572)\">D&amp;C 64:32\u201334<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24905_000_036\"><a name=\"-24905_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-24905_000_036\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"43325\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43325)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43325)\">Rom. 12:21<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24905_000_036\"><a name=\"-24905_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote5-24905_000_036\">5.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"43212\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43212)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43212)\">Josh. 24:15<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24905_000_036\"><a name=\"-24905_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote6-24905_000_036\">6.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"43543\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43543)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43543)\">D&amp;C 24:8<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24905_000_036\"><a name=\"-24905_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote7-24905_000_036\">7.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"43580\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43580)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43580)\">D&amp;C 75:16<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24905_000_036\"><a name=\"-24905_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote8-24905_000_036\">8.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"43517\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43517)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43517)\">Moro. 10:32<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-24905_000_036\"><a name=\"-24905_000_036\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote9-24905_000_036\">9.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"43462\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43462)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43462)\">Alma 41:10<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
