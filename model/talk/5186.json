Our favorite places to hike were in the high mountains. We all loved the challenge of a tough climb up and then that exhilarating moment of standing at what seemed to be the top of the world. We would carefully scan the horizon, relishing the sight of other peaks and valleys.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/look-up-and-press-on.p6\" class=\"\">One of the best adventures of my life was the day we climbed three adjacent mountain passes. Beginning early in the morning, we began our ascent, moving ever higher. The hike proved long and demanding, yet each view held its own majesty and perspective. My satisfaction at what I saw far exceeded any weariness I felt. I have never forgotten the awe and accomplishment I experienced when I stood at the top of a mountain and looked out on this wide and wonderful world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/look-up-and-press-on.p7\" class=\"\">Today, my beloved Relief Society sisters, we join hands around the world while we stand on another type of peak. From this pinnacle of 150 years of Relief Society, we survey the rich fruits of charity sown from seeds of faith in 135 countries and territories. How satisfying it is to see testimonies built, individuals blessed, charity developed and exercised, families strengthened, and sisterhood enjoyed by over three million Relief Society members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/look-up-and-press-on.p8\" class=\"\">Your vantage point may actually be a mountaintop. It may be the knoll of a grassy plain or a mound of sand in the desert. It could be a favorite stretch of beach or the icy crest of a snow-packed hill. It may be the top step of your own front porch. Whatever your perspective, today I ask you to stand arm in arm with me and look up! Let us climb together to new spiritual heights. We will echo Isaiah\u2019s words, \u201cLet us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25694\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25694)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25694)\">Isa. 2:3<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/look-up-and-press-on.p9\" class=\"\">Today I ask you to undertake with me a spiritual journey worthy of our best efforts.

Never in the history of the Church have the women of Zion been linked so closely together. This is symbolic, reminding us that we come together in the greatest of all causes, the gospel of Jesus Christ. As a young girl growing up in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, I often imagined climbing the distant peaks I could see. Today as we are literally linked together across the continents of the world, we ascend mountains far greater than those I saw.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/look-up-and-press-on.p11\" class=\"\">Sisters, we are the covenant people, blessed to live on the earth when we can prepare in earnest for the second coming of our Savior. I pray that we will daily rejoice in being alive now when we can covenant through baptism and in the house of the Lord. I feel as Nephi expressed, \u201cMy soul delighteth in the covenants of the Lord\u00a0\u2026\u00a0; yea, my soul delighteth in his grace, and in his justice, and power, and mercy in the great and eternal plan of deliverance from death.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4464\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4464)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4464)\">2 Ne. 11:5<\/a><\/span>.) To be a woman of covenant is a sacred and holy calling. Our covenants should ennoble us, serving as inspiration and incentive. A deepened understanding of our covenants lifts our vision to the loftier vistas awaiting us. As we are \u201ctrue followers of \u2026 Jesus Christ,\u201d we can become the daughters of God, \u201cthat when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38641\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38641)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38641)\">Moro. 7:48<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/look-up-and-press-on.p12\" class=\"\">In this quest for the best in us, we are like Sariah, who, with Lehi and their family, left Jerusalem at the Lord\u2019s command.

I wonder when he reached the top if he paused, as I often have at such a height, to look around and see how far he and his family had come and the direction in which they still needed to go.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/look-up-and-press-on.p14\" class=\"\">Beloved sisters, from my vantage point I see your goodness and potential. I know your lives have their difficulties. I also see how far you\u2019ve climbed already and what dazzling heights you\u2019ve attained. I feel the love of the Savior for you and your love for Him. Our Lord Himself promised, \u201cI will go before your face.

The president calmly explained that each Relief Society unit around the Church would be undertaking a project. The worker said, \u201cYou mean 18,000 groups of Relief Society women are going to do something in their local communities? Then you\u2019ll change the world.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/look-up-and-press-on.p16\" class=\"\">We will change the world. For the better. For this journey to great heights is not any ordinary journey, any more than was Sariah\u2019s. Ours is a quest to change ourselves, to become even truer disciples of our Lord and Savior. We will lift our eyes to the mountains and move ceaselessly towards exaltation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/look-up-and-press-on.p17\" class=\"\">And how shall we scale this mountain? One faithful step at a time. I have a good friend with whom I have often counseled over the years about some of my gravest concerns. Particularly when I begin a new task and feel unsure, she invariably says enthusiastically, \u201cHow exciting! Elaine, you can do this.\u201d I have been grateful for her confidence. Sisters, I say today, we can do this. We will build the kingdom of God\u2014one person and one home at a time. Married, single, older, younger, mothering, or childless, we are going to prove that Eliza R. Snow, an early and inspired Relief Society leader, was right: \u201cThere is no sister so isolated, and her sphere so narrow but what she can do a great deal towards establishing the Kingdom of God upon the earth.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Woman\u2019s Exponent,<\/span> 15 Sept. 1873, p. 62.)

Since we strive to become eternal family units, we should prize our families. Dear sisters, stay close to your husband, your children, your parents, your brothers and sisters, and those who feel like family because your lives have joined. Consider them your fellow voyagers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/look-up-and-press-on.p19\" class=\"\">A woman of mighty faith joined the Church and, because of pressing economic circumstances, left her family and homeland. Her journey took her far, but her faith took her farther. When she was well into her retirement years, she was called to be the ward Relief Society president. That calling brought forth a lifetime of knowledge and skill. She was a woman of such loving faith that the sisters of her Relief Society were drawn together as she put her arms around them physically and spiritually. A young mother asked her how she developed such radiant faith. This sister replied, \u201cTurn your back on the problems and look for the light.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/look-up-and-press-on.p20\" class=\"\">Sisters, as we climb the mountains, especially those in our own backyards, let us look to the Lord, who is the light. Show that light to your family and those who feel like family, for the brush at our feet will snag us, and obstacles will surely bruise us. But warm and steady, the light beckons us on. Follow it, knowing the challenges are real, but so is the Lord. Light a torch of faith at home and keep it burning brilliantly, even when the night is long and the journey difficult.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/look-up-and-press-on.p21\" class=\"\">We shall scale our spiritual peaks with courage. Courage is a powerful tool. With it we can dig into the bedrock and stand steady, even when the footing is treacherous. I see so much of courage in you. You walk miles to church. You rebuild a home ruined by floods. You go to school, sometimes with your desk on your head. You stretch limited money so you can feed your family. You face death, survive drought, and forgive after a divorce. You repent when that\u2019s what is needed. You let go of old habits and espouse the gospel instead. You pay tithing when your children need shoes. You live through winter without warm clothes. You raise children alone. You accept a Church calling when you have no idea how to do it. You work to feel good about yourself, even as you feel so imperfect. You reach out to someone who may not extend a hand to you. You patch up a long-standing family argument. You put your family first, even when other options entice you. Cultivate courage, for it will help you live confidently and well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/look-up-and-press-on.p22\" class=\"\">The prophet Moses told the children of Israel, who were ready to enter a new territory of many unknowns, \u201cBe strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid\u00a0\u2026\u00a0: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21378\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21378)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21378)\">Deut. 31:6<\/a><\/span>.)
