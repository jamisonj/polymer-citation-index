For years many of our members have been affected by worldwide disasters, both natural and man-made. We also understand that families have had to tighten their belts and are concerned about enduring these challenging times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/two-principles-for-any-economy.p6\" class=\"\">Brethren, we do feel very close to you. We love you, and we pray always for you. I have seen enough ups and downs throughout my life to know that winter will surely give way to the warmth and hope of a new spring. I am optimistic about the future. Brethren, for our part, we must remain steadfast in hope, work with all our strength, and trust in God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/two-principles-for-any-economy.p7\" class=\"\">Lately I have been thinking of a time in my life when the weight of worry and concern over an uncertain future seemed ever present. I was 11 years old and living with my family in the attic of a farmhouse near Frankfurt, Germany. We were refugees for the second time in a period of only a few years, and we were struggling to establish ourselves in a new place far away from our previous home. I could say that we were poor, but that would be an understatement. We all slept in one room that was so tiny there was scarcely space to walk around the beds. In the other small room, we had a few pieces of modest furniture and a stove that Mother used to cook meals on. To get from one room to the other, we had to pass through a storage area where the farmer kept his equipment and tools, along with assorted meats and sausages hanging from the rafters. The aroma always made me very hungry. We had no bathroom, but we did have an outhouse\u2014down the stairs and some 50 feet (15 m) away, though it seemed much farther during wintertime.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/two-principles-for-any-economy.p8\" class=\"\">Because I was a refugee and because of my East German accent, other children often made fun of me and called me names that deeply hurt. Of all the times of my youth, I believe this may have been the most discouraging.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/two-principles-for-any-economy.p9\" class=\"\">Now, decades later, I can look back on those days through the softening filter of experience. Even though I still remember the hurt and despair, I can see now what I was unable to see then: this was a period of great personal growth. During this time, our family bonded together. I watched and learned from my parents. I admired their determination and optimism. From them I learned that adversity, when confronted with faith, courage, and tenacity, could be overcome.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/two-principles-for-any-economy.p10\" class=\"\">Knowing that some of you are experiencing your own periods of anxiety and despair, I wanted to speak today about two important principles that sustained me through this formative period of my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>The First Principle: Work<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/two-principles-for-any-economy.p12\" class=\"\">To this day, I am deeply impressed by the way my family worked after having lost everything following World War II! I remember my father\u2014a civil servant by education and experience\u2014taking on several difficult jobs, among which were coal miner, uranium miner, mechanic, and truck driver. He left early in the morning and often returned late at night in order to support our family. My mother started a laundry and worked countless hours doing menial labor. She enlisted my sister and me in her business. With my bike I became the pickup and delivery service. It felt good to be able to help the family in a small way, and though I did not know it at the time, the physical labor turned out to be a blessing to my health as well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/two-principles-for-any-economy.p13\" class=\"\">It wasn\u2019t easy, but the work kept us from dwelling too much on the difficulties of our circumstances. Although our situation didn\u2019t change overnight, it did change. That\u2019s the thing about work. If we simply keep at it\u2014steady and constant\u2014things certainly will improve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/two-principles-for-any-economy.p14\" class=\"\">How I admire men, women, and children who know how to work!

It is the foundation of our work as priesthood holders.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/two-principles-for-any-economy.p19\" class=\"\">Remember, we are only temporary travelers in this world.

While the phrase \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d may work as an excuse to avoid skateboarding, decline the invitation for a motorbike ride, or bypass the spicy curry at the buffet, it is not an acceptable excuse for avoiding covenant responsibilities to consecrate our time, talents, and resources in the work of the kingdom of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/two-principles-for-any-economy.p21\" class=\"\">There may be those who, after many years of Church service, believe they are entitled to a period of rest while others pull the weight.

But in spite of limited options, I always felt an eagerness to learn. I remember one day, while I was out on my bike delivering laundry, I entered the home of a classmate of mine. In one of the rooms, two small desks were nestled against the wall. What a wonderful sight that was! How fortunate those children were to have desks of their own! I could imagine them sitting with open books studying their lessons and doing their homework. It seemed to me that having a desk of my own would be the most wonderful thing in the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/two-principles-for-any-economy.p26\" class=\"\">I had to wait a long time before that wish was fulfilled. Years later, I got a job at a research institution that had a large library. I remember spending much of my free time in that library. There I could finally sit at a desk\u2014by myself\u2014and drink in the information and knowledge that books provide. How I loved to read and learn! In those days I understood firsthand the words of an old saying: Education is not so much the filling of a bucket as the lighting of a fire.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/11\/two-principles-for-any-economy.p27\" class=\"\">For members of the Church, education is not merely a good idea\u2014it\u2019s a commandment.
