Mostly they walked and walked and walked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/keep-walking-and-give-time-a-chance.p7\" class=\"\">When the pioneers broke camp each morning, the cattle had to be fed and watered, fires built, breakfasts cooked, a cold meal for noon prepared and packed, repairs made, teams hitched, and wagons reloaded. Every single morning.

Because the pace was set by slow-moving oxen, no one had to run to keep up with the wagons. On a good day, on a no-problem day (is there ever such a thing?), the pioneers covered about 15 miles. Usually it was less than 10. Imagine how puny that seemed compared to their ultimate goal of 1,300 miles!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/keep-walking-and-give-time-a-chance.p9\" class=\"\">On a bronze frieze<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-97905_000_037\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Sculpted by Avard Fairbanks.]<\/span><\/sup> in the Winter Quarters cemetery, a detail shows a mother resting her hand inside the wagon as she walked the distance to the Salt Lake Valley.

I believe it has everything to do with us. Most of our lives are not a string of dramatic moments that call for immediate heroism and courage. Most of our lives, rather, consist of daily routines, even monotonous tasks, that wear us down and leave us vulnerable to discouragement. Sure, we know where we\u2019re going, and if it were possible we would choose to jump out of bed, work like crazy, and be there by nightfall. But our goal, our journey\u2019s end, our Zion is life in the presence of our Heavenly Father.

The pioneer steadiness, the plain, old, hard work of it all, their willingness to move inch by inch, step by step toward the promised land inspire me as much as their more obvious acts of courage. It is so difficult to keep believing that we are making progress when we are moving at such a pace\u2014to keep believing in the future when the mileage of the day is so minuscule.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/keep-walking-and-give-time-a-chance.p12\" class=\"\">Do you see yourself as a heroic pioneer because you get out of bed every morning, comb your hair, and get to school on time? Do you see the significance of doing your homework every day and recognize the courage displayed in asking for help when you don\u2019t understand an assignment? Do you see the heroism in going to church every single Sunday, participating in class, and being friendly to others? Do you see the greatness in doing the dishes over and over and over? Or practicing the piano? Or tending children? Do you recognize the fortitude and belief in the journey\u2019s end that are required in order to keep saying your prayers every day and keep reading the scriptures?
