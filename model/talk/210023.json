It is a pleasing thing for the human mind, to contemplate that it has some object to worship; that there is a being, far exalted above us, who dwells in the heavens, who is worthy of all adoration and praise; and that we are his children, in possession of a portion of his attributes. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n528\"> The world which we inhabit is a fallen creation, a fallen world, shut out from the presence of our Father, the being whom we worship, so that we cannot behold his face, nor the glory of his presence. It is for a wise purpose, that we are placed here, in this fallen condition. It seems to be so, as far as we have been made acquainted with the purposes of the great Jehovah. It seems to be the ordeal, through which all intelligent beings must pass, in order to gain that fullness of exaltation, in the presence of God, which is promised in his word. <\/div> <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"197b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD21\/JoD21_0197.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;197b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7712\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v21n529\"> We were not always in the condition we are now in.

A long time before you and I came here upon this stage of action, we had an intelligent existence; we dwelt in a better world than this, and a world that had been redeemed, a world that had been sanctified and glorified; in other words, a world that had been made celestial, just as we are in hopes that our present world will, at some future period, be exalted to the celestial glory, and become the habitation of celestial beings. That world we occupied, before we came here, was celestial; our Father had his dwelling place there, or, at least, one of his dwelling places; and we were surrounded by our Father's glory, we were familiar with his countenance, familiar with the beautiful mansions that were there&#x2014;familiar with all the glory that existed there, so far as we were capable of comprehending.

The second chapter of Genesis (new translation), informs us that the spirits of fowls were created in heaven, the spirits of fish and cattle, and all things that dwell upon the earth, had their pre-existence. They were created in heaven, the spiritual part of them; not their flesh and bones. We are also told in this inspired translation, that these living trees which we behold&#x2014;for God has given life unto all things&#x2014;had their spiritual existence in heaven before their temporal existence; every herb and every tree, before it was planted out on the earth, that is, the spiritual part of it, the life of it, that which, in other words, animates, that which gives power to the vegetable to bring forth fruit after its likeness&#x2014;the spiritual part existed in heaven.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52376\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52376)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52376)\">Gen. 2:1-6 (JST)<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"92384\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 92384)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(92384)\">Moses 3:1-5<\/a><\/span> It  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"201a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD21\/JoD21_0201.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;201a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/7708\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>was a spiritual creation first.
