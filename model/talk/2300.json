April 6, 1973, is a particularly significant date because it commemorates not only the anniversary of the organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in this dispensation, but also the anniversary of the birth of the Savior, our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith wrote this, preceding a revelation given at that same date:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cThe rise of the Church of Christ in these last days, being one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh, it being regularly organized and established agreeable to the laws of our country, by the will and commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16045\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16045)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16045)\">D&amp;C 20:1<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p7\" class=\"\">Traditionally since that time, the spring conferences of the Church are held on the days of each year which include April 6.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p8\" class=\"\">Two years later another revelation followed, which had great significance then, and today has even greater meaning as viewed in the light of the demands of the increasing membership in the Church. This is a quotation which may be something of a text for my next few remarks today:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cFor Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her stakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16139\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16139)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16139)\">D&amp;C 82:14<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p10\" class=\"\">Zion, as used here, undoubtedly had reference to the Church.

The borders of Zion, where the righteous and pure in heart may dwell, must now begin to be enlarged. The stakes of Zion must be strengthened.

Her boundaries are being enlarged, her stakes are being strengthened. In the early years of the Church specific places to which the Saints were to be gathered together were given, and the Lord directed that these gathering places should not be changed, but then he gave one qualification: \u201cUntil the day cometh when there is found no more room for them; and then I have other places which I will appoint unto them, and they shall be called stakes, for the curtains or the strength of Zion.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16180\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16180)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16180)\">D&amp;C 101:21<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p31\" class=\"\">At the Mexico City Area Conference last August, Elder Bruce R.

It could not be accomplished as set forth by a man-made formula; it could only be accomplished when the fullness of the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ are taught and practiced, as declared by the apostle Paul to the Ephesians, who said that the church is \u201cbuilt upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21855\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21855)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21855)\">Eph. 2:20<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p55\" class=\"\">The mission of the Church has also been defined:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p56\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p57\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that all that will hear may hear.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16001\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16001)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16001)\">D&amp;C 1:4, 11<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p58\" class=\"\">Obedient to that instruction, and from the beginning of the Church, there have been missionaries sent to all parts of the world. Today we have increasing numbers of missionaries, mostly younger men, who have been schooled from their childhood to prepare themselves for a call to serve as missionaries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p59\" class=\"\">From a handful of missionaries in the early days of the Church, this number has been increased to over 17,000 serving today, each at his own expense, or at the expense of his immediate family, for a period of two or more years, each with a conviction in his heart that one so called has the divinity of his calling in his mind as he may go forth into any part of the world to which he may be called.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p60\" class=\"\">Another reason that might be given for the increase in the Lord\u2019s work: perhaps as never before have there been so many people of the world searching for answers to the many perplexing problems.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p61\" class=\"\">While the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ have not changed, the methods in meeting these challenges of the needs of today\u2019s world must respond to the demands of our time. Fortunately the Lord has given, in the revelations to this church, the guidelines by which we should respond to the demands of the times. The plan of salvation has defined the way by which he would have us deal with the temporal needs of the people. The welfare plan of the Church seeks out those in distress. Where the newly found members are located, the plan of temporal salvation is, primarily, to teach the individuals how to take care of themselves. The Lord has provided a hedge against the terrifying impact upon the sanctity of the home and marriage, by strengthening the home and by providing guidelines to parents to teach their children the basic principles of honesty, virtue, integrity, thrift, and industry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p62\" class=\"\">There is a concern of the Church for the individual members, from childhood to youth, and from among the youth into adulthood, to respond to the needs of members of the Church of every age.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p63\" class=\"\">In answer to the questions as to whether or not there may have been any dropouts or members who have fallen away, our answer has always been to recall the Master\u2019s parable of the sower, where the sower went out to sow. Some of the seeds fell on fertile ground, but among the seeds which fell on fertile ground, some produced thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, and some ninetyfold. So today, in about that same ratio, we have some who are partially active, some are more so, and some who are thoroughly active in the Church, but we are always reaching out to the ones who have strayed away, and we are constantly trying to bring them back into full activity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p64\" class=\"\">But perhaps the most important reason of all for the growth of the Church is the individual testimonies of the divinity of this work, as would be multiplied in the hearts of the individual members of the Church. For the strength of the Church is not in the numbers, nor in the amount of tithes and offerings paid by faithful members, nor in the magnitude of chapels and temple buildings, but because in the hearts of faithful members of the Church is the conviction that this is indeed the church and kingdom of God on the earth. Without that conviction, as one of my eminent business associates remarked, \u201cThe welfare plan of the Church would be but a shambles\u201d; also missionary work would not flourish; and members would not be faithful in making generous contributions to the Church to finance its many operations. The secret of the strength of this church may be found in the statement of a president of a student body at one of our state-operated universities, whose identity, of course, is confidential. This is a quotation from his personal letter addressed to me:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p65\" class=\"\">\u201cWith the rule of the radical ideas which are sweeping the country, there has come a breakdown of family ties which is despised in many intellectual circles. The country is seemingly plied with sex education, abortion, planned parenthood, pornography, women\u2019s liberation, communal living, premarital sex, and postmarital permissiveness. \u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p66\" class=\"\">And then this young college student leader concludes with this heartwarming declaration, which I know came from the depths of his soul. This is what he wrote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p67\" class=\"\">\u201cPresident Lee, I want you to know that the Latter-day Saint students on campus who keep the commandments are 100 percent behind you. Thank God we have leaders who stand firm against the subtle battle of the adversary who is striking at the home, the most vital unit of the world. Thank you for being the kind of a person that we, as young people growing up in this mixed-up world, can understand and can follow.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p68\" class=\"\">By that same token, and in the language of that brilliant college student, I am convinced that the greatest of all the underlying reasons for the strength of this church is that those who keep the commandments of God are 100 percent behind the leadership of this church. Without that united support it would be readily understood that this church could not go forward to meet the challenges of the day. Our call is for the total membership of the Church to keep the commandments of God, for therein lies the safety of the world. As one keeps the commandments of God, he is not only persuaded as to the righteousness of the course that is being followed under the leadership of the Church, but also will have the Spirit of the Lord to guide him in his individual activities, for each baptized member has been given a sacred endowment when he was baptized and which has been committed to every baptized member of the Church by the authority of the priesthood: the gift of the Holy Ghost, which, as the Master declared, would teach all things, would bring all things to their remembrance, and even show them things to come. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"28745\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28745)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28745)\">John 14:26<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p69\" class=\"\">It will be clearly understood, then, that the great responsibility that the leaders and teachers in the Church have is to persuade, to teach, to direct aright, that the commandments of Almighty God will be so lived as to prevent the individual from falling into the trap of the evil one who would persuade him not to believe in God and not to follow the leadership of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p70\" class=\"\">I want to bear my sacred witness that because I know of the divinity of this work, I know that it will prevail; and that though there may be enemies within and without the Church who would seek to undermine and would seek to find fault and try to undermine the influence of the Church in the world, this church will be borne off triumphantly and will stand through the test of time when all the man-made efforts and weapons forged against the Lord\u2019s word will fall by the wayside. I know that our Lord and Master Jesus Christ is the head of this church; that he has daily communion through agencies known to him, not only to the leaders of the Church in high positions, but also to individual members as they keep the commandments of God. To that I bear my sacred witness and leave my blessing upon all the faithful of the Church, and indeed in the world everywhere, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
