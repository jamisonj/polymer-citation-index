Interstate 15 is its official name. This super freeway carries the output of factories, the products of commerce, and masses of humanity toward appointed destinations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p5\" class=\"\">Several days ago, while driving to my home, I approached the entrance to Interstate 15. At the on-ramp I noticed three hitchhikers, each one of whom carried a homemade sign which announced his desired destination. One sign read \u201cLos Angeles,\u201d while a second carried the designation \u201cBoise.\u201d However, it was the third sign which not only caught my attention but caused me to reflect and ponder its message. The hitchhiker had lettered not Los Angeles, California, nor Boise, Idaho, on the cardboard sign which he held aloft. Rather, his sign consisted of but one word and read simply \u201cANYWHERE.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p6\" class=\"\">Here was one who was content to travel in any direction, according to the whim of the driver who stopped to give him a free ride. What an enormous price to pay for such a ride. No plan. No objective. No goal. The road to anywhere is the road to nowhere, and the road to nowhere leads to dreams sacrificed, opportunities squandered, and a life unfulfilled.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p7\" class=\"\">Unlike the youthful hitchhiker, you and I have the God-given gift to choose the direction we go. Indeed, the apostle Paul likened life to a race with a clearly defined goal. To the saints at Corinth he urged: \u201cKnow ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"614\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 614)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(614)\">1 Cor. 9:24<\/a><\/span>.) In our zeal, let us not overlook the sage counsel from Ecclesiastes: \u201cThe race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21434\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21434)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21434)\">Eccl. 9:11<\/a><\/span>.) Actually, the prize belongs to him who endures to the end.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p8\" class=\"\">Each must ask himself the questions: \u201cWhere am I going?\u201d \u201cHow do I intend to get there?\u201d \u201cReally, what is my divine destiny?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p9\" class=\"\">When I reflect on the race of life, I remember another race, even from childhood days. Perhaps a shared experience from this period will assist in formulating answers to these significant and universally asked questions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p10\" class=\"\">When I was about ten, my boyfriends and I would take pocketknives in hand and from the soft wood of a willow tree fashion small toy boats. With a triangular-shaped cotton sail in place, each would launch his crude craft in a race down the relatively turbulent waters of the Provo River. We would run along the river\u2019s bank and watch the tiny vessels sometimes bobbing violently in the swift current and at other times sailing serenely as the water deepened.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p11\" class=\"\">During such a race, we noted that one boat led all the rest toward the appointed finish line. Suddenly, the current carried it too close to a large whirlpool, and the boat heaved to its side and capsized. Around and around it was carried, unable to make its way back into the main current. At last it came to rest at the end of the pool, amid the flotsam and jetsam which surrounded it, held fast by the fingerlike tentacles of the grasping green moss.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p12\" class=\"\">The toy boats of childhood had no keel for stability, no rudder to provide direction, and no source of power. Like the hitchhiker, their destination was \u201cANYWHERE,\u201d but inevitably downstream.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p13\" class=\"\">We have been provided divine attributes to guide our destiny. We entered mortality not to float with the moving currents of life, but with the power to think, to reason, and to achieve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p14\" class=\"\">Our Heavenly Father did not launch us on our eternal journey without providing the means whereby we could receive from Him God-given guidance to ensure our safe return at the end of life\u2019s great race. Yes, I speak of prayer. I speak, too, of the whisperings from that still, small voice within each of us; and I do not overlook the holy scriptures, written by mariners who successfully sailed the seas we too must cross.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p15\" class=\"\">Individual effort will be required of us. What can we do to prepare? How can we assure a safe voyage?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p16\" class=\"\">First, we must visualize our objective. What is our purpose? The Prophet Joseph Smith counseled: \u201cHappiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> pp. 255\u201356.) In this one sentence we are provided not only a well-defined goal, but also the way we might achieve it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p17\" class=\"\">Second, we must make continuous effort. Have you noticed that many of the most cherished of God\u2019s dealings with His children have been when they were engaged in a proper activity? The visit of the Master to His disciples <span class=\"emphasis\">on the way<\/span> to Emmaus, the good Samaritan <span class=\"emphasis\">on the road<\/span> to Jericho, even Nephi <span class=\"emphasis\">on his return<\/span> to Jerusalem, and Father Lehi <span class=\"emphasis\">en route<\/span> to the precious land of promise. Let us not overlook Joseph Smith <span class=\"emphasis\">on the way<\/span> to Carthage, and Brigham Young <span class=\"emphasis\">on the vast plains<\/span> to the valley home of the Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p18\" class=\"\">Third, we must not detour from our determined course. In our journey we will encounter forks and turnings in the road. There will be the inevitable trials of our faith and the temptations of our times. We simply cannot afford the luxury of a detour, for certain detours lead to destruction and spiritual death. Let us avoid the moral quicksands that threaten on every side, the whirlpools of sin, and the crosscurrents of uninspired philosophies. That clever pied piper called Lucifer still plays his lilting melody and attracts the unsuspecting away from the safety of their chosen pathway, away from the counsel of loving parents, away from the security of God\u2019s teachings. His tune is ever so old, his words ever so sweet. His prize is everlasting. He seeks not the refuse of humanity but the very elect of God. King David listened, then followed, then fell. But then so did Cain in an earlier era, and Judas Iscariot in a later one.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p19\" class=\"\">Fourth, to gain the prize we must be willing to pay the price. The apprentice does not become the master craftsman until he has qualified. The lawyer does not practice until he has passed the bar. The doctor does not attend our needs until internship has been completed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">You are the fellow that has to decide<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Whether you\u2019ll do it or toss it aside. \u2026 <\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Whether you\u2019ll try for the goal that\u2019s afar<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Or just be contented to stay where you are.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p24\" class=\"\">Edgar A.

The reporter asked, \u201cCan you walk?\u201d The answer, \u201cNot yet, but I will.\u201d \u201cDo you think you will be able to complete your mission?\u201d Came the reply, \u201cOthers think not, but I will.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p30\" class=\"\">With microphone in hand, the reporter continued: \u201cI understand you have received a special letter containing a get-well message from none other than the president of the United States.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Randall, \u201cI am very grateful to President Ford for his thoughtfulness; but I received another letter, not from the president of my country, but from the president of my church\u2014The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2014even President Spencer W. Kimball. This I cherish. With him praying for me, and the prayers of my family, my friends, and my missionary companions, I will return to Guatemala. The Lord wanted me to preach the gospel there for two years, and that\u2019s what I intend to do.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/which-road-will-you-travel.p31\" class=\"\">I turned to my wife and commented, \u201cHe surely must not know the extent of his injuries.

Behind he left a trail of skeptics, a host of doubters, but also hundreds amazed at the power of God, the miracle of faith, and the reward of determination. Ahead lay honest, God-fearing, and earnestly seeking sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. They shall hear His word. They shall learn His truth. They shall accept His ordinances.
