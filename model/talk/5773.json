What a great privilege it is to be in the presence of God\u2019s living prophet and to receive from him, and others who have been called by the Lord, the inspired words of counsel, testimony, and admonition that have been delivered in this wonderful conference. I testify that what we have heard from them has been \u201cthe will of the Lord, \u2026 the mind of the Lord, \u2026 [and] the voice of the Lord\u201d and, as the scriptures declare, is \u201cthe power of God unto salvation\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20571\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20571)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20571)\">D&amp;C 68:4<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p4\" class=\"\">In this respect, I am reminded of a declaration made at the conclusion of conference many years ago by Elder Marion G. Romney of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: \u201cWe have heard enough truth and direction in this conference,\u201d he declared, \u201cto bring us into the presence of God if we would follow it\u201d (in Conference Report, Apr. 1954, 132\u201333).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p5\" class=\"\">Please note that it is insufficient to just <span class=\"emphasis\">hear<\/span> the word of God in gatherings such as this conference. In order to have God\u2019s word impact our lives\u2014to receive the promised blessings\u2014we must <span class=\"emphasis\">follow<\/span> it. Indeed, the Lord has proclaimed: \u201cFor you shall <span class=\"emphasis\">live<\/span> by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20585\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20585)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20585)\">D&amp;C 84:44<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p6\" class=\"\">We have heard God\u2019s words at this conference, and now our responsibility is to live by them. At the conclusion of our last general conference, President Gordon B. Hinckley said: \u201cI will be a better man if I will put into my life the things of which I have been reminded in this conference, and I would like to suggest that each of you will be a better man or woman if you will put into your lives something of what you have heard in this great conference\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1995, 89).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p7\" class=\"\">By following this counsel, we strengthen our conversion to Christ and His gospel and, in this sense, become more committed to keeping covenants and commandments and in doing our duty in the Church. This, in my opinion, is the solution to one of the major challenges that I have observed during the years in which I have served in my present and other leadership callings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p8\" class=\"\">Whenever I have asked stake presidents about their biggest challenge or concern, they repeatedly say, \u201cTo have the Saints committed and converted so they will be faithful in keeping their covenants and fulfilling their callings.\u201d I have given that challenge a lot of prayerful consideration. Certainly Latter-day Saints do not lack opportunities to hear the word of God, but, unfortunately, they are often dilatory in the follow-through and the application in living the word.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p9\" class=\"\">What is it that gives us a testimony and a desire to serve the Lord \u201cwith all [our] heart, might, mind and strength\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20462\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20462)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20462)\">D&amp;C 4:2<\/a><\/span>) and to \u201cbe diligent in keeping the commandments of the Lord\u201d?

In this regard, it is of interest to consider Christ\u2019s words to Peter: \u201cWhen thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32588\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32588)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32588)\">Luke 22:32<\/a><\/span>). Thus, commitment seems to be an outgrowth or fruit of conversion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p11\" class=\"\">In order to receive a fulness of promised blessings in our lives, and to be fully effective in our callings, we must become converted. Would any of us truly do any less than our very best in keeping a covenant or commandment, fulfilling an assignment, or in following Christ if we were truly converted in our hearts?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p12\" class=\"\">A truly converted follower of Christ\u2014one who merits the designation of disciple or Saint\u2014could not be casual or complacent in his or her approach to service in the Church nor in keeping covenants and commandments. Such a one would surely follow the Lord\u2019s admonition to \u201clearn his [or her] duty, and to act \u2026 in all diligence\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20632\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20632)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20632)\">D&amp;C 107:99<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p13\" class=\"\">What does it mean to be converted? President Harold B. Lee said, \u201cConversion must mean more than just being a \u2018card carrying\u2019 member of the church with a tithing receipt \u2026 [or] a temple recommend.\u201d One who is converted \u201cstrive[s] continually to improve inward weaknesses and not merely the outward appearances\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Church News,<\/span> 25 May 1974, 2).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p14\" class=\"\">One who is converted and committed will not simply \u201cgo through the motions\u201d in fulfilling a Church service assignment. A converted home teacher will not be satisfied with just making a visit to one of his assigned families so he can report to his quorum leader that his home teaching is \u201ccompleted\u201d or \u201cdone.\u201d A converted Primary teacher would not be content to merely \u201cgive\u201d a lesson but would want to teach by the Spirit, thereby making a real difference in the impressionable lives of the children entrusted to his or her care.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p15\" class=\"\">Truly converted Latter-day Saints do not go to the temple because of a quota they are expected to fulfill, but out of a sincere desire to perform sacred and saving ordinances in behalf of deceased ancestors\u2014or even complete strangers\u2014who cannot do the work for themselves. We do not serve others or fulfill assignments for statistical or reporting purposes, but in a spirit of love and a commitment to Christ and our Father in Heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p16\" class=\"\">In this respect, consider the counsel of President Hinckley, given in a leadership training meeting:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cThere is much more to be achieved than statistical improvement,\u201d President Hinckley said. \u201cMore importantly, <span class=\"emphasis\">we should be concerned with the spiritual dimension of our people and the enlargement of this dimension.<\/span> There is a tendency in all of us to ask for better statistical performance. There is a tendency to <span class=\"emphasis\">impose<\/span> quotas behind which usually lies <span class=\"emphasis\">imposition of pressure<\/span> to achieve improved statistics. <span class=\"emphasis\">In the work of the Lord there is a more appropriate motivation than pressure. There is the motivation that comes of true conversion.<\/span> When there throbs in the heart of an individual Latter-day Saint a great and vital testimony of the truth of this work, he [meaning, of course, men and women] will be found doing his duty in the Church. He will be found in his sacrament meetings. He will be found in his priesthood meetings. He will be found paying his honest tithes and offerings. He will be doing his home teaching. He will be found in attendance at the temple as frequently as his circumstances will permit. He will have within him a great desire to share the Gospel with others. He will be found strengthening and lifting his brethren and sisters. [In other words, he will be committed.] <span class=\"emphasis\">It is conversion that makes the difference<\/span>\u201d (Regional Representatives\u2019 seminar, 6 Apr. 1984; emphasis added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p18\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, if you are not presently enjoying the blessings that come from conversion and commitment, I urge you to take the necessary steps to bring about this change in your heart. Perhaps my appeal is much the same as that extended by the prophet Alma when he said to the people of his day: \u201cAnd now behold, I ask of you, my brethren [and sisters] of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10167\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10167)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10167)\">Alma 5:14<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p19\" class=\"\">This \u201cmighty change in your hearts\u201d is what conversion is all about. President Joseph Fielding Smith said, \u201cPeople are converted by their hearts being penetrated by the Spirit of the Lord when they humbly hearken to the testimonies of the Lord\u2019s servants\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Church History and Modern Revelation,<\/span> 2 vols.

In order to make it effective\u2014to receive the promised blessings\u2014we must <span class=\"emphasis\">follow<\/span> it; or, as President Smith noted, we must \u201c<span class=\"emphasis\">hearken<\/span> to the testimonies of the Lord\u2019s servants.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p21\" class=\"\">May I humbly admonish each of you to evaluate your present state of conversion and commitment. I invite you to have a personal interview with yourself in which you ask how effective you are in your present calling to serve. Consider how fully you are keeping the commandments and acting upon the counsel given you by the prophets and other divinely called leaders of the Church, yes, including your stake president and bishop. Do you have to be reminded of your duty, or are you a committed self-starter and finisher?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/conversion-and-commitment.p22\" class=\"\">Let us return to Alma\u2019s question: \u201cHave ye spiritually been born of God?\u201d It is noteworthy that Alma concluded his admonition to the people of his day by bearing testimony of how his personal conversion was obtained: \u201cBehold, I testify unto you that I do know that these things whereof I have spoken are true.
