Never more than at Easter time is there so much meaning in that declaration from John the Beloved, which praises the Father as well as the Son: \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-99905_000_007\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29938\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29938)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29938)\">John 3:16<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-hands-of-the-fathers.p5\" class=\"\">I am a father, inadequate to be sure, but I cannot comprehend the burden it must have been for God in His heaven to witness the deep suffering and Crucifixion of His Beloved Son in such a manner.

He endured what He saw because it was the only way that a saving, vicarious payment could be made for the sins of all His other children from Adam and Eve to the end of the world. I am eternally grateful for a perfect Father and His perfect Son, neither of whom shrank from the bitter cup nor forsook the rest of us who are imperfect, who fall short and stumble, who too often miss the mark.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-hands-of-the-fathers.p6\" class=\"\">In considering such beauty of the \u201cat-one-ment\u201d in that first Easter season, we are reminded that this relationship between Christ and His Father is one of the sweetest and most moving themes running through the Savior\u2019s ministry. Jesus\u2019 entire being, His complete purpose and delight, were centered in pleasing His Father and obeying His will. Of Him He seemed always to be thinking; to Him He seemed always to be praying.
