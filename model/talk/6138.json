After I offered a prayer at the sacrament table in our ward, a girl who was present told me I sounded like I was reading a commercial. Can you imagine the shame I felt? After 50 years that rebuke still stings. Brethren, remember the significance of those sacred prayers. You are praying as a servant of the Lord in behalf of the entire congregation. Speak to be heard and understood, and say it like you mean it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-and-the-sacrament.p35\" class=\"\">Deacons should pass the sacrament in a reverent and orderly manner, with no needless motions or expressions that call attention to themselves. In all their actions they should avoid distracting any member of the congregation from worship and covenant making.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-and-the-sacrament.p36\" class=\"\">All who officiate in the sacrament\u2014in preparing, administering, or passing\u2014should be well groomed and modestly dressed, with nothing about their personal appearance that calls special attention to themselves. In appearance as well as actions, they should avoid distracting anyone present from full attention to the worship and covenant making that is the purpose of this sacred ordinance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-and-the-sacrament.p37\" class=\"\">This principle of non-distraction applies to things unseen as well as seen. If someone officiating in this sacred ordinance is unworthy to participate, and this is known to anyone present, their participation is a serious distraction to that person. Young men, if any of you is unworthy, talk to your bishop without delay. Obtain his direction on what you should do to qualify yourself to participate in your priesthood duties worthily and appropriately.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-and-the-sacrament.p38\" class=\"\">I have a final suggestion. With the single exception of those priests occupied breaking the bread, all who hold the Aaronic Priesthood should join in singing the sacrament hymn by which we worship and prepare to partake. No one needs that spiritual preparation more than the priesthood holders who will officiate in it. My young brethren, it is important that you sing the sacrament hymn. Please do so.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-and-the-sacrament.p39\" class=\"\">The Aaronic Priesthood holds the keys of the \u201cgospel of repentance and of baptism, and the remission of sins\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20949\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20949)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20949)\">D&amp;C 84:27<\/a><\/span>). The cleansing power of our Savior\u2019s Atonement is renewed for us as we partake of the sacrament. The promise that we \u201cmay always have his Spirit to be with [us]\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20889\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20889)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20889)\">D&amp;C 20:77<\/a><\/span>) is essential to our spirituality. The ordinances of the Aaronic Priesthood are vital to all of this. I testify that this is true, and I pray that our brethren of the Aaronic Priesthood will understand the importance of their sacred responsibilities and act worthily in them, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
