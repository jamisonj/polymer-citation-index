Her husband, an air force pilot, had just been shot down and had died in combat over Vietnam. As she was ushered into my office, I saw her hugging a large picture. We sat down to talk and she showed me the picture of her husband, a handsome pilot with his helmet in his hands, standing proudly beside his jet fighter plane.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/after-much-tribulation-come-the-blessings.p4\" class=\"\">She sobbingly said how much she loved him and couldn\u2019t believe that he was gone. She continued by saying that she was a convert of nearly two years. She had met her husband while in college, and it was he who had introduced her to the gospel. Later she was baptized, and they were sealed in the temple for time and all eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/after-much-tribulation-come-the-blessings.p5\" class=\"\">Her life with him had been beautiful and everything a person could ask for.

The people clustered around the grave site while the bishop and those participating stood facing the family. I couldn\u2019t help but notice that while many were overcome with sadness and wept during the service, the widow sat peacefully by her beloved husband.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/after-much-tribulation-come-the-blessings.p19\" class=\"\">I knew that she had the knowledge of the resurrection and plan of salvation. I later learned that she and her husband had journeyed to the New Zealand Temple and had been sealed together for time and all eternity. In her life, this was not a total calamity but rather a part of God\u2019s plan. There was about her an air of peace and appreciation for the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/after-much-tribulation-come-the-blessings.p20\" class=\"\">President Kimball stated: \u201cThe Lord has not promised us freedom from adversity or affliction.

A few years ago in Japan, a stake was being organized from a mission district. In the course of an interview, the district president stated that he would shortly be moving to another city where he had accepted a promotion with his company to become the manager of their largest branch. But the Lord wanted this man to serve as the new stake president. He was called before the General Authority who inquired whether his superiors would reconsider the promotion and allow him to remain in the city where he might be able to serve his church in this very important position.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/after-much-tribulation-come-the-blessings.p24\" class=\"\">Immediately the district president stated that he had given his word to his superiors who had already made changes in all of the branches in the company, except in the branch that he was to supervise. He had asked for a delay of his assignment until after the organization of the stake.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/after-much-tribulation-come-the-blessings.p25\" class=\"\">Notwithstanding this explanation, the General Authority asked the district president if he would be kind enough to contact his superiors with this request and then notify him of the results.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/after-much-tribulation-come-the-blessings.p26\" class=\"\">Late that night I received a call from the district president. His employer had been understandably dismayed by his request to remain in the city and reconsider the promotion. The company president asked him to seriously think again about his request and then to call him back in five minutes. In that short interval of time, he would be forced to make a decision that would affect the rest of his life. At that moment he called to ask my advice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/after-much-tribulation-come-the-blessings.p27\" class=\"\">My reply to him was that the Lord had sent one of his Apostles to organize a stake of Zion in Japan. If he had to give his answer to the Lord himself, would it be any different? He thanked me, then called his employer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/after-much-tribulation-come-the-blessings.p28\" class=\"\">Early the next morning, he came to the mission home and was officially called as the new stake president. When the General Authority inquired about his status with the company, the district president responded that his promotion was canceled and that he would have to accept whatever they decided to give him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/after-much-tribulation-come-the-blessings.p29\" class=\"\">Before he left, the General Authority blessed this man and stated that although he would go through a period of trials and tribulations at work, the time would come when he would be called upon by his employer to help make great and important decisions for his company, because he had made a decision to serve the Lord rather than to accept personal gain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/after-much-tribulation-come-the-blessings.p30\" class=\"\">A few years later, this man\u2014still a stake president\u2014became the assistant to the president of his company, fulfilling the promise made by an Apostle of the Lord.
