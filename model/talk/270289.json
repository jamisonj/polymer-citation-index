The things which John saw had no\n  allusion to the scenes of the days of Adam, Enoch, Abraham or Jesus, only so far as is plainly\n  represented by John, and clearly set forth by him. John saw that only which was lying in futurity and\n  which was shortly to come to pass. See Rev. 1:1-3,<span class=\"footRef\">7<\/span> which is a key to the whole subject: &ldquo;The\n  revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him, to show unto his servants things which must\n  shortly come to pass; and He sent and signified it by His angel unto His servant John: who bare\n  record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.\n  Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of his prophecy and keep those<\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"111807\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 111807)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(111807)\">Alma 5:50<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"115609\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 115609)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(115609)\">D&amp;C 109:77<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">2. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107545\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107545)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107545)\">Dan. 7:3<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">3. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107560\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107560)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107560)\">Dan. 7:16<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">4. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107561\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107561)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107561)\">Dan. 7:17<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">5. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107077\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107077)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107077)\">Isa. 23:17<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107806\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107806)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107806)\">Matt. 4:8<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"114728\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 114728)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(114728)\">D&amp;C 84:82<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"115279\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 115279)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(115279)\">D&amp;C 103:7-8<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"115376\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 115376)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(115376)\">D&amp;C 105:32<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">6. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107546\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107546)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107546)\">Dan. 7:3-7<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">7. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"110661\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 110661)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(110661)\">Rev. 1:1-3<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
