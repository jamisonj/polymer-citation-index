My heart is full of\ngratitude to the Lord for my membership in this Church and for my fellowship with the Saints\nand the brethren. To me, the conference started last Wednesday when we met with these\ngrand mission presidents for two sessions in the temple and heard them tell of the fine work\nthat is being accomplished in the mission fields and the wonderful spirit they have in their\nwork One who had just been released said, \"I find it difficult to become interested in my\nbusiness.\" Another of the presidents said, \"I prayed that the Lord would let me stay a few\nmonths longer, and when my successor arrived and apologized for being late, I said 'You\ndon't need to apologize. You just answered my prayers.'\" It is wonderful how these men can\nmake the sacrifices they make and then feel as they feel. I felt the same when I returned from\nmy first mission. I went into Oregon selling bonds for a company. Every home I entered, I\nfound it difficult to offer them bonds to purchase I wanted to offer them the gospel of the\nLord Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nEARTH CRAMMED WITH HEAVEN\n<\/p><p>\nI couldn't help thinking as I sat through these meetings: Isn't it really a pity that it is so hard\nfor truth to get its boots on and to be able to reach the honest in heart of the earth? If they\njust knew what we have&mdash;if their eyes were opened to see and understand! How wonderful it\nwould be for all of our Father's children who really want to do right, if they could know the\ntruth, instead of having to wait, many of them, to get it, possibly, in the eternal worlds.\n<\/p><p>\nI thought of the words of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, when she said,\n<\/p><p>\nEarth's crammed with heaven,<br \/>\nAnd every common bush acre with God; <br \/>\nAnd only he who sees takes off his shoes; <br \/>\nThe rest sit round it and pluck blackberries.\n<\/p><p>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                 &mdash;from \"Aurora Leigh\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I thought, if the world could only know how the Lord has crammed the earth with\nheaven, and how every common bush is afire with God, through the restoration of the gospel.\nWe have heard it referred to here today. \"A marvelous work and a wonder\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25111\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25111)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25111)\">Isa. 29:14<\/a><\/span>), and it is all of\nthat, far beyond the ability of any man or any woman to comprehend. The greatest mission of\nthe Latter-day Saints is to be able to understand and appreciate what the Lord has done, and\nthen make their lives conform thereto. The Lord said, in a revelation to the Prophet Joseph\nSmith, that \"against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all\nthings\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12797\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12797)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12797)\">D&amp;C 59:21<\/a><\/span>).\nI acknowledge the hand of God in all things. I believe that he rules\nin the heavens above and that he rules upon this earth. We have heard the brethren today\nspeak of the fulfillment of prophecy, and Peter of Old said,\n<\/p><p>\nWe have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed,\nas unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise\nin your hearts: \n<\/p><p>\nKnowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.\n<\/p><p>\nFor the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4813\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4813)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4813)\">2 Pet. 1:19-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nKINGDOM OF GOD\n<\/p><p>\nYou heard Brother Sonne this morning read from one of the tracts that Brother Penrose wrote\nof how the kingdoms of this world would be destroyed. We read in Daniel's interpretation of\nNebuchadnezzar's dream, in which he states that the kingdoms of this world should become\nas the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind should carry them away. We have\nseen them one by one being carried away. But that was not all Daniel saw.\nIn the more sure word or prophecy which holy men of old gave us under the inspiration and\npower of the Holy Ghost, he saw that the God in heaven should set up a kingdom in the last\ndays which should never be destroyed, but like a little stone cut out of the mountains without\nhands, should roll forth until it should become a great mountain and fill the whole earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10608\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10608)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10608)\">Dan. 2:35-45<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOne of our missionary boys preached on that theme down in Florida while I was president of\nthe Southern States Mission, and I think that boy is in this congregation today. At the close of\nthe meeting a minister who was present at that meeting met me at the door&mdash;I always went to\nthe door to meet those who had honored us with their presence&mdash;and he said, \"Mr. Richards,\nyou don't mean to tell me that you think that kingdom is the Mormon Church, do you?\"\n<\/p><p>\nI said, \"Why not?\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe said, \"It couldn't be.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"And why couldn't it?\" I said.\n<\/p><p>\nHe said, \"You can't have a kingdom without a king, and we haven't any king, and so haven't\na kingdom.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Oh,\" I said, \"my friend, you did not read quite far enough. You just read the seventh chapter\nof Daniel (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10609\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10609)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10609)\">Dan. 7:13-14<\/a><\/span>),\nand you will see that Daniel saw one like the Son of Man coming in the clouds of\nheaven and unto him was given the kingdom, that all other kingdoms powers, and dominions\nshould serve and obey him. Now, how can the kingdom be given to him,\" I asked, \"when he\ncomes in the clouds of heaven, if there is no kingdom here prepared for him? Maybe you\nwould like to know what is going to become of that kingdom. If you will just read it, you\nwill see that Daniel said,\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole\nheaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is\nan everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall Serve and obey him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10611\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10611)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10611)\">Dan. 7:27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, and as\nif that were not quite long enough, Daniel adds, 'even for ever and ever'\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10610\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10610)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10610)\">Dan. 7:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPART OF KINGDOM\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brothers and sisters, if you can see heaven in earth, if you have eyes that see, ears that\nhear, hearts that understand, you know what you are a part of as members of this Church.\nYou are a part of that great kingdom that is being established in the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident John Taylor once made this statement: \n<\/p><p>\nWe are gathered here for the express purpose of carrying out the purposes of God. The\nworld, however, do not understand it. But I will tell you what they will do, by and by.\nYou will see them flocking to Zion by thousands and tens of thousands, and they will\nsay, We don't know anything about your religion, we don't care much about religious\nmatters, but you are honest and you are honorable and you are upright and just and\nyou have a good, just, and secure government [speaking of the\nGovernment of the Church], and we want to put ourselves under your protection for\nwe cannot feel safe anywhere else\" (<i>Gospel Kingdom<\/i>, pp. 71-72).\n<\/p><p>\nIMPRESSIONS OF VISITORS\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the last six months I have had occasion to hear people express themselves as to how\nthey feel about this. We were in the Hotel Utah with one of the greatest economists in the\nworld, and after President Smith had spoken, this man stood up. He was overcome; he had to\nshed a few tears; then he told us that never in his life had he been in such presence or in such\ninfluence. Then he paid us some compliments about our people and said he had felt it on the\nstreet and wherever he went.\n<\/p><p>\nWe had another great national leader here not long ago who made a similar declaration. He\nsaid, \"I have to come out here in these valleys of the mountains to get inspiration,\" but he did\nnot want us to tell what he had said because he has to live with those people back in the\nEast, but he said it just the same.\n<\/p><p>\nA few weeks, ago a lady from Orlando, Florida, came into the office of the Presidency. The\nreceptionist called me and said that this lady would like to know something more about the\nChurch and would I have time to interview her. Well, I had preached in Orlando, Florida,\nmany times, and built a little chapel there, so anyone from Orlando looked good to me. I said,\n\"Send her up.\" She wanted to know all about the Church. She said, \"Mr. Richards, I have\ntraveled all over the United States&mdash;I just came from California.\" (I would tell you what she\nsaid about California, but I used to be president of a stake down there, and so my interests\nthere forbid.) But she said, \"I don't know what it is, but I feel it everywhere I go. You are\ndifferent here; you have something different here than I have felt anywhere I have been.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well,\" I said \"that is simple, we have the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSTORY OF MINISTER\n<\/p><p>\nIf we just had eyes that could see, ears that could hear; if we could see heaven crammed into\nthis earth in this great work that God has set his hand to do, and every common bush afire\nwith God&mdash;we could understand the story one of the mission presidents told in the report\nmeeting at the temple, of the missionary who called at the home of a minister. This\nmissionary offered to leave a tract, and the minister would not accept it; so, as he left the\ndoor he put the tract in the mailbox, and when he came back the next time the minister\ninvited him in. Now, to make the story short, what that man read impressed him, and finally\nhe paid for the publication of a thousand copies of the Book of Mormon. He gave nine\nhundred of them to the missionaries and kept the other hundred for his family. When the\nmission president invited him to speak at one of our conferences, he said\n\"Well, if you call me, I will preach what I have always preached.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe mission president said, \"You preach anything you want to as long as you preach the\ntruth.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen he said, \"Hand me your Book of Mormon,\" He stood up, held up that Book of Mormon\nbefore them and said, \"Here is the greatest book I have ever read.\" Then he pledged his\nloyalty to the Bible, but he said, \"I've got something out of this book that I haven't got out of\nany other book, including the Bible.\" That was a minister speaking.\n<\/p><p>\nIf every minister in all the world professedly of the Christian Church could only humble\nhimself enough to put that book to the test, we might have a great army of men all over the\nworld bearing to their faithful people the witness of the great and mighty work the Lord has\nset his hand to do in this day, the new witness for the Lord Jesus Christ in the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nMESSAGE FROM GOD\n<\/p><p>\nSpeaking of these marvelous things, I heard Brother Ballard make this statement when he\nvisited our mission. He said that one of our greatest national commentators, and he told the\nname but I will not give it here today as it will serve the purpose without, said he was asked\nwhat message could be broadcast to the world that would be considered more valuable than\nany other message that could possibly be broadcast. After giving the matter some thought and\nconsideration, he decided that to be able to say to the world over the radio that a man who\nhad lived upon the earth and had died had returned again with a message from God would be\nthe greatest message that could be broadcast to the world. Well, that being true, we have the\ngreatest message, for we announce to the world that not only one man, but many men,\nprophets of the living God who have lived upon the earth have returned again with messages\nfrom God; not only messages, but also keys and power in order that the kingdom of God\nmight again be established in the earth as promised by Peter when he said, that the heavens\nmust receive the Christ until the restitution of all things spoken by the mouth of all the holy\nprophets since the world began (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7631\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7631)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7631)\">Acts 3:21<\/a><\/span>).\nDo you mean to tell me that if we believe in the words of the\nholy prophets as I have referred to today, that we have any right to expect the Lord Jesus\nChrist ever to come in fulfillment of this promise made except there first be a restitution of\nall things? There isn't time for me to go into the restitution of all things here today. We have\nbuilt a monument in the state of New York to just such an individual to Moroni, who lived\nupon this continent four hundred years following the crucifixion of the Savior and returned\nagain to deliver the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated to the Prophet\nJoseph Smith. There stands that majestic monument to his honor, the only one like it in all\nthe world.\n<\/p><p>\nThink also of what John the Baptist brought&mdash;the Aaronic Priesthood, Peter, James, and\nJohn, the Melchizedek Priesthood; the prophets Moses, Elijah, and Elias came with the keys\nof their dispensations.\n<\/p><p>\nHOLY PRIESTHOOD\n<\/p><p>\nThen I am reminded of another story one of the mission presidents told in the temple last\nWednesday. He took out of his pocket a letter from a minister and read it to us, in which he\nstated that he never believed that he did not have as much authority as any other man in the\nworld to administer the ordinances of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ until he met the\nMormon missionaries and read the Book of Mormon. Now he admitted that he had to accept\nbaptism at the hands of the missionaries of this Church.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have been told in this conference that we have to have the Priesthood, and I want to tell\nyou that if the world understood and knew the value of the sealing power and ordinances of\nthe Holy Priesthood that God has sent to us in this dispensation, it would revolutionize this\nwhole world.\n<\/p><p>\nTEMPLE WORK\n<\/p><p>\nI have one more thought I want to leave with you in the next few minutes, and that is about\nthis temple here, and the rest of our temples. When the corner stone of this temple was laid,\nBrigham Young said something like this,\n<\/p><p>\nWe are gathered here today upon one of the most momentous occasions that this world\nhas ever known since the foundations thereof were laid, an occasion that has caused\nthe tongues of prophets to speak and their pens to write.\n<\/p><p>\nYou read the words of Isaiah, where he saw the mountain of the house of the God of Jacob\nestablished in the tops of the mountains in these latter days, and he added,\n<\/p><p>\nAll nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us\ngo up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach\nus of his ways, and we will walk in his paths\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25106\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25106)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25106)\">Isa. 2:2-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI want to tell you, outside of these holy temples and the sealing ordinances therein, men\ncannot learn fully of his ways, nor can they walk in his paths.\n<\/p><p>\nI have some wonderful testimonies in regard to this matter, but I will only take time to read\na few words from a sermon President Woodruff delivered from this pulpit in 1898, as\nrecorded in the conference pamphlet.\n<\/p><p>\nI am going to bear my testimony to this assembly, if I never do it again in my life,\nthat those men who laid the foundation of this American government, and signed the\nDeclaration of Independence, were the best spirits the God of heaven could find on the\nface of the earth. They were choice spirits, not wicked men. General\nWashington and all the men that labored for the purpose were inspired of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nAnother thing I am going to say here, because I have a right to say it. Every one of\nthose men that signed the Declaration of Independence with General Washington,\ncalled upon me as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the Temple at St. George,\ntwo consecutive nights, and demanded at my hands that I should go forth and attend to\nthe ordinances of the House of God for them (<i>Conference Report<\/i>, 1898, pp. 89-90).\n<\/p><p>\nI wonder what the ministers of the world would say if they only knew that this were true, and\nit is true. When these great men who framed the Constitution of our nation came back they\nwere not interested in the future destiny and the development of this great land of America.\nThey came back to request that the ordinances of the house of God be administered for them.\n<\/p><p>\nSo I say,\n<\/p><p>\nEarth's crammed wit heaven<br \/>\nAnd every common bush alive with God; <br \/>\nAnd only he who sees takes off his shoes.<br \/>\nThe rest sit round it and pluck blackberries.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God help us to see and understand his marvelous work I pray in the name of the Lord\nJesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
