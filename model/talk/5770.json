First, I\u2019d like to say that it\u2019s wonderful to see all of you gathered in the Tabernacle this Easter morning. You\u2019re a wonderful sight. It is a remarkable thing to contemplate the many more who are assembled in more than 3,000 halls in various parts of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p4\" class=\"\">I regret that many who wish to meet with us in the Tabernacle this morning are unable to get in. There are very many out on the grounds. This unique and remarkable hall, built by our pioneer forebears and dedicated to the worship of the Lord, comfortably seats about 6,000. Some of you seated on those hard benches for two hours may question the word <span class=\"emphasis\">comfortably.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p5\" class=\"\">My heart reaches out to those who wish to get in and could not be accommodated. About a year ago I suggested to the Brethren that perhaps the time has come when we should study the feasibility of constructing another dedicated house of worship on a much larger scale that would accommodate three or four times the number who can be seated in this building.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p6\" class=\"\">We recognize, of course, that we can never build a hall large enough to accommodate all the membership of this growing Church. We\u2019ve been richly blessed with other means of communication, and the availability of satellite transmission makes it possible to carry the proceedings of the conference to hundreds of thousands throughout the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p7\" class=\"\">But there are still those in large numbers who wish to be seated where they can see in person those who are speaking and participating in other ways. The structure we envision will not be a sports arena. It will be a great hall with fixed seating and excellent acoustics. It will be a dedicated house of worship, and that will be its primary purpose. It will be fashioned in such a way that only a portion or the entire hall may be used, according to need. It will accommodate not only religious services, but will serve other Church purposes, such as the presentation of sacred pageants and things of that kind. It will also accommodate some community cultural events that will be in harmony with its purpose.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p8\" class=\"\">The architectural and engineering studies have not gone far enough for us to make a detailed announcement, but the results thus far are encouraging, and we\u2019re hopeful that they will materialize.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p9\" class=\"\">Now for a moment I wish to speak of a personal matter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p10\" class=\"\">It was a year ago at this conference when in a solemn assembly you raised your hands to sustain me in this great and sacred calling. My heart swells with gratitude for your expressions of confidence. I am humbled, I am overwhelmed by your words of kindness, loyalty, and love. I think I understand, in a measure at least, the magnitude of this responsibility. I have no desire other than to do that which the Lord would have done. I am His servant, called to serve His people. This is His Church. We are only custodians of that which belongs to Him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p11\" class=\"\">I am deeply grateful for the two good and able men who stand at my side as counselors and who have been so loyal and helpful. I am grateful for my Brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Nowhere else will you find a more dedicated and able body of men who love the Lord and seek to do His will. I am likewise grateful for the Quorums of the Seventy and the Presiding Bishopric. I am grateful for the Area Authorities, for stake presidents and bishops and those who preside over quorums, for faithful mission presidents and temple presidents. I am thankful for the auxiliary organizations, and for the strength and capacity and dedication of those who preside over the Relief Society, the Young Women, the Sunday School, and the Primary organizations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p12\" class=\"\">I am thankful for every member of this Church who walks in faith and faithfulness. We are all in this together, as Latter-day Saints, bound by a common love for our Master, who is the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world. We are a covenant people who have taken upon ourselves His holy name.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p13\" class=\"\">The Church is the stronger or the weaker as each member is strong or weak in his or her faith and performance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p14\" class=\"\">During this past year I have traveled extensively. I am determined that while I have strength, I will get out among the people at home and abroad to express my appreciation, to give encouragement, to build faith, to teach, to add my testimony to theirs and at the same time to draw strength from them. I thank all of those who are assisting in this.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p15\" class=\"\">I intend to keep moving with energy for as long as I can. I wish to mingle with the people I love. Recently I have met with many of our youth, thousands of them. These have been wonderfully reassuring experiences. It is an inspiration to look into the eyes of young men and women who love the Lord, who want to do the right thing, who want to build lives that are productive and fruitful of great good. They are working hard to develop skills that will bless them and the society of which they will become a part. They are serving missions for the Church in unprecedented numbers. They are clean, bright, able, and happy. Surely the Lord must love those of this choice generation of youth who learn and serve in His Church. I love them, and I want them to know that. Life is not easy for them. I think that never before has evil been presented in so attractive and beguiling a manner by those who with sinister designs seek to grow wealthy on the tragedies of lives that become blighted and marred as they partake of these evil goods.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p16\" class=\"\">I salute fathers and mothers who are loyal to one another and who nurture their children in faith and love. There has been a wonderful response to the Proclamation on the Family, which we issued last October. We hope you will read it and reread it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p17\" class=\"\">This work is growing across the world in a remarkable and wonderful way. The Lord is opening the doors of the nations. He is touching the hearts of the people. The equivalent of 100 new stakes of Zion are coming into the Church each year. This brings with it significant challenges. As has been widely noted, we have passed the line where we now have more members of the Church outside the United States than we have in the United States.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p18\" class=\"\">Thank you, my brothers and sisters, for the goodness of your lives. I thank you for your efforts in trying to measure up to the very high standards of this, the Lord\u2019s Church. Thank you for your faith. Thank you for your sustaining hands and hearts. Thank you for your prayers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/this-glorious-easter-morn.p19\" class=\"\">As everyone here knows, there is only one reason for any of us serving.

He had taught them of His eventual death and Resurrection, but they had not understood. Now they were forlorn and dejected.

To which we reply that beyond these is the witness and the testimony, borne by the power of the Holy Ghost, of the truth and validity of this most remarkable event.
