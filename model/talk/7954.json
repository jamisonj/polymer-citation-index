We had a little garden a few kilometers from where we lived, and there was always so much to do to prepare the garden each season. We worked on the gazebo or built or repaired fences. In my memory this work always occurred in the freezing cold, heavy snow, or pouring rain. But I loved it. My father would teach me how to do things with patience and acceptance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/being-accepted-of-the-lord.p6\" class=\"\">One day he invited me to tighten a screw and warned, \u201cRemember, if you put it in too tight, it will break.\u201d Proudly, I wanted to show him what I could do. I tightened with all my might, and, of course, I broke the screw. He made a funny comment, and we started over. Even when I \u201cmessed up,\u201d I always felt his love and confidence in me. He passed away more than 10 years ago, but I can still hear his voice, sense his love, enjoy his encouragement, and feel his acceptance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/being-accepted-of-the-lord.p7\" class=\"\">The feeling of being accepted by someone we love is a basic human need. Being accepted by good people motivates us. It increases our sense of self-worth and self-confidence. Those who cannot find acceptance from desirable sources often seek it elsewhere. They may look to people who are not interested in their well-being. They may attach themselves to false friends and do questionable things to try to receive the acknowledgment they are seeking. They may seek acceptance by wearing a particular brand of clothing to generate a feeling of belonging or status. For some, striving for a role or a position of prominence can also be a way of seeking acceptance. They may define their worth by a position they hold or status they obtain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/being-accepted-of-the-lord.p8\" class=\"\">Even in the Church we are not always free from this type of thinking. Seeking acceptance from the wrong sources or for incorrect reasons puts us on a dangerous path\u2014one that is likely to lead us astray and even to destruction. Instead of feeling cherished and self-confident, we will eventually feel abandoned and inferior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/being-accepted-of-the-lord.p9\" class=\"\">Alma counseled his son Helaman, \u201cSee that ye look to God and live.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10705_000_040\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124296\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124296)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124296)\">Alma 37:47<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> The ultimate source of empowerment and lasting acceptance is our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.

This pattern was given by the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith: \u201cVerily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest, and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice\u2014yea, every sacrifice which I, the Lord, shall command\u2014they are accepted of me.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-10705_000_040\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124297\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124297)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124297)\">Doctrine and Covenants 97:8<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/being-accepted-of-the-lord.p11\" class=\"\">This pattern consists of three simple steps:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\"><ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Know that our hearts are honest and broken,<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Know that our spirits are contrite, and<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Be willing to observe our covenants by sacrifice, as commanded by the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/being-accepted-of-the-lord.p15\" class=\"\">First, we need to know that our hearts are honest and broken. How do we know that? We begin by engaging in sincere self-reflection. The heart is the center of our feelings. As we look into our hearts, we screen ourselves. What no one around us knows, we surely know. We know our motives and desires. When we engage in sincere, honest reflection, we do not rationalize or deceive ourselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/being-accepted-of-the-lord.p16\" class=\"\">There is also a way to judge if our hearts are broken. A broken heart is a soft, an open, and a receptive heart.

We consciously prepare ourselves for the sacred ordinance. We renew and confirm our sacred promises to the Lord. In this way we feel His acceptance and receive His assurance that our efforts are recognized and our sins are forgiven through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. During this ordinance, the Lord promises us that as we are willing to take upon us the name of His Son and always remember Him and keep His commandments, we will always have His Spirit to be with us. Having the Holy Ghost as our constant companion is the ultimate indicator of being accepted of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/being-accepted-of-the-lord.p22\" class=\"\">Other ways to observe our covenants by sacrifice are as simple as accepting a calling in the Church and faithfully serving in that calling or following the invitation of our prophet, Thomas\u00a0S. Monson, to reach out to those who are standing at the wayside and need to be spiritually rescued. We observe our covenants by sacrifice by giving silent service in our neighborhood or community or by finding the names of our ancestors and doing temple work for them. We observe our covenants by sacrifice by simply striving for righteousness, being open, and listening to the promptings of the Spirit as we live our daily lives. Sometimes observing our covenants means nothing more than standing firmly and faithfully when the storms of life are raging all around us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/being-accepted-of-the-lord.p23\" class=\"\">After explaining the pattern of how to be accepted by Him, the Lord uses a wonderful illustration to show how we profit as individuals and families as we seek His acceptance.
