He said the Janzen family from his ward, while on a family outing in the mountains, had lost their seven-year-old son, Mathew. Darkness had brought the search to a halt Friday evening. But within a short period of time Saturday morning, over a hundred brothers and sisters from the stake drove to the rescue site to join the search. After several hours of combing the trails, roads, and backwoods, little Mathew was finally found. Can you imagine the joy as he was swept into the arms of his mother and father? I listened through tears of grateful parents as they asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Then this reply: \u201cI took the wrong turn and got lost. When it got dark I tried to build a shelter and sleep, but it was so cold I couldn\u2019t. I knelt down on a rock and prayed five times last night and again this morning. You taught me if I was ever lost, if I would pray to Heavenly Father and stay on the trail, I would find you.

As a general rule, all parents have a desire to be good parents and are aware that within the home environment children are provided the best opportunity to be taught gospel principles and gospel understanding. The risen Lord, while visiting the Nephites, referred to the words of Isaiah, \u201cAnd all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6319\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6319)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6319)\">3 Ne. 22:13<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/take-time-for-your-children.p7\" class=\"\">A few weeks ago, while attending a stake conference in the Philippines, where I currently live, I listened to eleven-year-old Joseph stand at the pulpit with childlike faith and express the following: \u201cMy sister got a toothache. I told her, \u2018Get Dad to give you a blessing.\u2019 He did, and it went away. My parents taught me to pray when I was a child. I said things that were funny, but I know Heavenly Father heard me. We always read the scriptures when I was young.

Some Latter-day Saint families are what we refer to as the \u201ctraditional family,\u201d consisting of parents and children all together in a permanent relationship, with both mother and father sharing in the responsibility of caring for children. Others have witnessed the loss of one of the parents and become one of the many single-parent families. I am one who grew up in a single-parent home. My father lost his life as a result of a construction accident when I was two years old, leaving my mother with seven children to raise. Even in single-parent families, the family continues on, for families are forever. Perhaps few human challenges are greater than that of being good parents. Yes, even with the best intentions, conscientious, good parents sometimes experience feelings of despair, failure, and hurt when children do not make right choices and turn out the way we would like. Even in those circumstances it is so important for parents to love, pray for, and never give up hope for a son or daughter who may have strayed or brought disappointment. Elder Howard W. Hunter stated: \u201cThe responsibilities of parenthood are of the greatest importance. The results of our efforts will have eternal consequences for us and the boys and girls we raise. Anyone who becomes a parent is under strict obligation to protect and love his children and assist them to return to their Heavenly Father\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1983, p. 65).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/take-time-for-your-children.p9\" class=\"\">Parents should be the master teachers of their children. The Church will assist parents in their teaching and training, but only assist. The Church cannot be a substitute for parental responsibility. Elder Richard L. Evans said the home \u201cis also the source of our personal lives, and in a sense the determiner of our everlasting lives. And so our plea is for parents to take the time it takes to draw near to the children God has given them. Let there be love at home. Let there be tenderness and teaching and caring for and not a shifting of responsibility onto others. God grant that we may never be too busy to do the things that matter most, for \u2018Home makes the man\u2019\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Richard Evans\u2019 Quote Book,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1971, p. 21).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/take-time-for-your-children.p10\" class=\"\">As we bear this great responsibility of parenthood, may I share with you, in the spirit of trying to be helpful, a few thoughts that parents might use to strengthen their families against worldly temptations and to bring the love, unity, and success that all desire.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"strong\">Start early.<\/span> \u201cColumnist Sydney Harris was once asked by an anxious parent, \u2018How can I get my 16-year-old son to mind me?\u2019 He answered simply, \u2018Shrink him down to six months and start over, differently.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cThis may not be encouraging advice to those with problem teenagers, but to those just starting on the adventure of parenthood, it may serve as a reminder that love and training cannot be postponed\u201d (Jon M.
