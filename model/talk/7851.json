There stood a freezing boy wearing a ragged shirt with a dirty rag tied about a swollen jaw. His head was covered with scabies. He held a rusty tin can and a spoon, the symbol of an orphan beggar. As I struggled to open the door to give him money, the train pulled out.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/and-a-little-child-shall-lead-them.p6\" class=\"\">I will never forget that starving little boy left standing in the cold, holding up an empty tin can.

It was night, and while Elder Tuttle spoke, a little boy, perhaps six years old, appeared in the doorway. He wore only a ragged shirt that went about to his knees.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/and-a-little-child-shall-lead-them.p8\" class=\"\">On our left was a small table with a plate of bread for the sacrament. This starving street orphan saw the bread and inched slowly along the wall toward it. He was almost to the table when a woman on the aisle saw him.

I groaned within myself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/and-a-little-child-shall-lead-them.p9\" class=\"\">Later the little boy returned.

As we obey the commandments and live the gospel fully, we will be protected and blessed. With our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren, our prayer is that each one of our growing family will have that same devotion toward those precious little ones.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/and-a-little-child-shall-lead-them.p58\" class=\"\">Fathers and mothers, next time you cradle a newborn child in your arms, you can have an inner vision of the mysteries and purposes of life. You will better understand why the Church is as it is and why the family is the basic organization in time and in eternity. I bear witness that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true, that the plan of redemption, which has been called the plan of happiness, is a plan for families. I pray the Lord that the families of the Church will be blessed, parents and children, that this work will roll forth as the Father intends. I bear this witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10405_000_005\"><a name=\"-10405_000_005\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote1-10405_000_005\">1.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"122807\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122807)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122807)\">Moroni 8:12<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10405_000_005\"><a name=\"-10405_000_005\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote2-10405_000_005\">2.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"122808\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122808)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122808)\">Psalm 127:3, 5<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10405_000_005\"><a name=\"-10405_000_005\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote3-10405_000_005\">3.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"122809\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122809)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122809)\">1\u00a0Corinthians 15:19<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10405_000_005\"><a name=\"-10405_000_005\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote4-10405_000_005\">4.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"122810\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122810)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122810)\">Isaiah 11:6<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10405_000_005\"><a name=\"-10405_000_005\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote5-10405_000_005\">5.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"122811\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122811)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122811)\">Matthew 18:2\u20134<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10405_000_005\"><a name=\"-10405_000_005\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote6-10405_000_005\">6.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"122812\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122812)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122812)\">Matthew 19:14\u201315<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10405_000_005\"><a name=\"-10405_000_005\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote7-10405_000_005\">7.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"122813\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122813)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122813)\">3\u00a0Nephi 17:12<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10405_000_005\"><a name=\"-10405_000_005\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote8-10405_000_005\">8.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"122814\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122814)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122814)\">3\u00a0Nephi 17:21\u201322<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-10405_000_005\"><a name=\"-10405_000_005\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\"><a name=\"footnote9-10405_000_005\">9.<\/a><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"122815\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122815)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122815)\">3\u00a0Nephi 17:24<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
