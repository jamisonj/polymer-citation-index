Last night most of you\nwere present at the bishops' meeting in the Assembly Hall, and while we were together two\nand a half hours, we only covered a very small portion of the program in which you bishops,\nparticularly, are as much interested as are we.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE AARONIC PRIESTHOOD PROGRAM\n<\/p><p>\nI thought tonight I would like to say a few words about the Aaronic Priesthood program of\nthe Church. I am very grateful for my assignment to labor with the young men and for the\nfine work that is being done by the bishops and their associates in their behalf. I feel we have\na program that really is effective.\n<\/p><p>\nI have no thought of criticism for the past, but in trying to follow our program of a record of\nevery boy, and a monthly boys' leadership meeting, where the bishopric Sit at the head and\nwith them those who are interested in the care of the Aaronic Priesthood in the wards&mdash;the\nMutual, and Sunday School officers, who also are charged with the responsibility of working\nwith the same age group&mdash;it seems to me that we have been able to keep closer in touch with\nthe boys.\n<\/p><p>\nFor instance, through this program we found in one ward thirty-three boys between the ages\nof twelve and twenty-one who held no Priesthood. Another ward had twenty. When the\nbishop discovered this, he was as much surprised as anyone could be. He had never checked\nbefore.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen visiting a stake recently, it was reported to me that a son of one of our recent General\nAuthorities had never been ordained, even to the office of a deacon. When his own son was\nto be ordained, the bishop asked him if he held such Priesthood that he could officiate, and he\nhad to apologize and tell the bishop that he had never even been ordained a deacon. A time\nhad been set, but for some reason he could not come, and no one followed the matter up to\nfind out why.\n<\/p><p>\nOnly this week I learned that one of our present General Authorities was not baptized until he\nwas fifteen, because there was no checkup in the ward. We now have a program whereby\nevery boy is being looked after&mdash;and we are trying to consider the boys more individually\nrather than in groups. It is my impression that we will come to a day in the Church when our\ngreatest achievements will be through individual work.\n<\/p><p>\nINDIVIDUAL WORK WITH BOYS\n<\/p><p>\nIn our work this winter with the Aaronic Priesthood, we are studying in the teachers' training\ncourse, Dr. Stott's book, <i>How to Win Boys<\/i>, and the author paraphrases a statement of the\nMaster as he went along the Sea of Galilee and gathered to himself the fishermen, saying,\n\"Come, and I will make you fishers of men\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33823\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33823)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33823)\">Matt. 4:19<\/a><\/span>);\nDr. Stott says, \"Come, and I will make you\nfishers of boys.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen he indicates that all over the world there are literally thousands and tens of thousands of\nboys, waiting to be caught, if we only use the right kind of bait.\n<\/p><p>\nIn a demonstration of a boys' monthly leadership meeting in a stake recently, one of the\nbrethren in reporting a visit he had made to a home said: \"You'll never get John into his\nPriesthood meeting on Sunday morning so long as there is snow on the mountain so he can\ngo skiing.\" After the discussion was ended and no solution was offered to get John off the\nmountain, I said to the bishop, \"Bishop, are you going to leave John out on the mountain\nskiing on Sunday mornings?\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe have a feeling that there should be sufficient genius of leadership in this group with the\nbishopric at the head assisted by their helpers in the Aaronic Priesthood, the M.I.A., and\nSunday School workers, that when they pool their wisdom, certainly they can find the kind of\nbait that will bring John off the mountain on Sunday morning.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are some of us, I fear, who have the feeling that there are only a few that will be\nsaved. I am not unmindful of the fact that the Savior said, \"Strait is the gate and narrow is the\nway\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33840\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33840)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33840)\">Matt. 7:14<\/a><\/span>),\nbut I also remembered that in the 76th section of the D&amp;C, the Lord indicates that He\nwill save all the works of His hands, except the Sons of Perdition\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11876\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11876)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11876)\">D&amp;C 76:42-43<\/a><\/span>), and I have never been able\nto feel that the sons of Latter-day Saint fathers and mothers born under the covenant, are\nlikely to be so classified. They are born heirs of all the gifts and blessings of the Gospel of\nJesus Christ. So, as far as I am concerned, I believe if we will do our duty, with the help of\nthe Almighty, we need not fear that any of our boys will be lost.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, when we gather them in, it is very important that we have something for them. They\nwant to be fed, and I think besides teaching them their duties in the Priesthood, one of the\ngreatest things we ought to have in mind is to try to plant in their hearts a testimony of the\nGospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nA TESTIMONY OF THE GOSPEL OF GREAT WORTH\n<\/p><p>\nMy experience in the Church has taught me that the most powerful motivating thing I know\nof in this world is a testimony of the Gospel. Possessing it, men and women will do anything;\nthey will make any sacrifice. When we listened here yesterday to the testimonies of Brother\nKimball and Brother Benson, whom we sustained as new members of the Quorum of the\nTwelve, both indicated that they were making financial sacrifices. I had the privilege of\nattending Washington Stake conference a week ago last Sunday with President Benson, and he\ntold me of some of the financial offers that had been made to him. I took occasion before the\npeople of the stake to compliment them on the honor that had come to them in the call of\ntheir stake president, but I assured them that Brother Benson would make great financial\nsacrifices, but God granted unto the children of men blessings that were worth far more than\nmoney, and reminded them of when Peter and John went to the temple and at the gate thereof\nfound a man who had been a cripple from his youth, and when he asked alms at their hands,\nPeter said: \"Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, give I thee. In\nthe name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.\" And immediately the cripple's feet\nand ankle bones received strength, and he walked into the temple with Peter and John\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7503\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7503)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7503)\">Acts 3:1-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYou do not buy gifts like that with money. They are the riches of heaven, that come through\nfaith and a testimony of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nRecently I read the new book by Brother Hinckley on the life of President Daniel H. Wells,\nand I was greatly impressed with the power of his testimony. When he saw the Saints move\ntoward the West, although he was not a member of the Church and at that time possessed\nmuch property and a wife who was opposed to the Church, and a son, he had to make a\nchoice to cast his lot with the Saints or remain with his wife and son and his property. He left\nhis property to her, and left her and the boy behind, going on with the Saints; and the Lord\nmultiplied unto him because of his sacrifice, and that because of his testimony of the Gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nYou and I know, as we have witnessed on every side, particularly in our ministry in this\nChurch, how marvelously people sacrifice, and how willingly they do it when their souls are\ntouched with a testimony of the Gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nWILLING SACRIFICES\n<\/p><p>\nI think of a little woman in our ward. We as a bishopric approached her and her husband,\nwho was not a member of the Church, and asked them if they were in a position to send their\nson on a mission. We said, \"We don't know whether you have any rich relatives who can\nhelp you.\" We knew they were of meager circumstances. We said, \"The boy is worthy to go, and\nwe would be proud to have him represent our ward.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBy that time tears were trickling down the little mother's face, and she said, \"Bishop, if you\nwill send my boy on a mission, I'll see that he has the money if I have to work every day he\nis gone to keep him in the mission field.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhen living in California, I passed a bakery night after night on my way home from work\nand saw one of our good sisters in her little bakery uniform clerking while she kept two of\nher sons in the mission field.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to see this testimony planted in the hearts of our boys and our girls, and I want\nyou to know that I know boys can have a testimony of the Gospel, even in their youth.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE PROMISE OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS\n<\/p><p>\nA statement reached us at the Presiding Bishop's office a few days ago from one of our\neducators who in teaching a Sunday School class made this statement: \"I don't know whether\nit would be proper for us to teach our young people to read <i>Leaves from My Journal<\/i>, by\nWilford Woodruff, for fear they might expect similar spiritual experiences, and be\ndisappointed.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI wonder if there are really very many Latter-day Saints who would be\nafraid to promise unto the youth of Zion the spiritual gifts and blessings that God, the Eternal\nFather Himself, has promised.\n<\/p><p>\nWe cannot offer our young people the Bible as the word of God, or the standard Church\nworks, and believe only a small portion of that which is written therein.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter the Savior was resurrected, He commissioned His disciples to go into all the world and\npreach the Gospel to every creature, and then he promised them spiritual gifts and blessings as\na result of their faith (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32975\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32975)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32975)\">Mark 16:15-18<\/a><\/span>).\nI find nowhere in all Holy Writ where the Savior ever rescinded the\npromises He made unto those who would accept His Gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nOn the day of Pentecost, the Spirit of God was poured out like cloven tongues of fire, and\nPeter, representing the apostles, spoke until men were moved upon and smitten in their hearts,\nand said: \"Men and brethren, what shall we do?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7498\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7498)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7498)\">Acts 2:37<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd Peter, the mouthpiece of God upon the earth, replied:\n<\/p><p>\nRepent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of\nsins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\n<\/p><p>\nFor the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many\nas the Lord our God shall call (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7500\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7500)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7500)\">Acts 2:38-39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI want you to know that as far as I am concerned, that promise has been made good in my\nlife, and I have faith it will be made good in the lives of my children and their children, unto\nthe latest generation, if they have faith in God and are willing to keep His commandments.\n<\/p><p>\nThen I remind you that in the last chapter of the Book of Mormon, Moroni writes at some\nlength on this subject. He tells of the marvelous gifts of the Holy Ghost, and says that by the\npower of the Holy Ghost might we know the truth of the words contained in that book, for\n\"by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38224\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38224)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38224)\">Moro. 10:5<\/a><\/span>). Then\nhe warns us that we deny not the gifts of God, and enumerates them and then adds that these\ngifts shall never be taken away as long as the world shall stand, except according to the\nunbelief of the children of men (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38225\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38225)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38225)\">Moro. 10:7-25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nClosing that historic record with that promise, I feel we ought to live to anticipate and expect\nthe gifts of the Spirit of God. . . I was in this tabernacle when Wilford Woodruff told&mdash;and I\nthink it was his last public address&mdash;how marvelously the Lord had led and guided and\ninspired him, and how we would not have Bishop So-and-So, if he had not heeded the\npromptings of the Spirit of God not to take the company of emigrants on the boat down in\nNew Orleans, how that by the inspiration of the Spirit he arose in the night aria moved his\nteam and wagon just in time to escape the falling oak that had stood there all those years, etc.\n<\/p><p>\nThat made an impression upon my life. I would like my children impressed with that kind of\ninspiration, spiritual power, spiritual gifts. Now, as I look back over my life, I want to bear\ntestimony to you, my brethren, here this night, that the Lord has been kind to me, and I have\nhad evidences enough all through my ministry to know that the sweetest thing in this world\nthat I know anything about is the companionship of the Spirit of God, and the gifts and\nblessings that come by virtue of the same.\n<\/p><p>\nA KNOWLEDGE OF GOD COMES THROUGH HIS SPIRIT\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my testimony that when you read the words of the Master that \"this is life eternal, that\nthey might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27105\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27105)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27105)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>),\nyou are not going to know Him just because you read about Him in books; you are\ngoing to know Him because you have partaken of His Spirit and of his power, and you have\nbeen lifted up until you know there is a power in this world so much greater than yours that it\nleaves no room for doubt.\n<\/p><p>\nWe should remember the words of Paul when he said that the things of God are understood\nby the Spirit of God, and the things of man are understood by the spirit of man, and the\nnatural man understandeth not the things of God, for they are foolishness unto him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"94\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 94)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(94)\">1 Cor. 2:11-15<\/a><\/span>). We do\nnot want natural men teaching our boys in the Aaronic Priesthood; we want men of God, who\nhave faith in God and faith in His promises, and faith in spiritual gifts and spiritual power.\n<\/p><p>\nYou brethren do not need to be afraid to promise your children or the youth of Zion that the\nblessings and gifts of the Holy Ghost will be theirs if they will live for them. You do not\nhave to fulfill these promises. God, the Eternal Father, who made them, will fulfill them. And\nwhen they have a testimony and spiritual conviction in their souls, you do not need to worry\nabout your boys or your girls, no matter where they go.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
