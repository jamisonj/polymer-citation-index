It is a plea to those who anxiously struggle with worry, or with grief or disappointment, with guilt, or with shame.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/balm-of-gilead.p13\" class=\"\">We see so much unnecessary suffering, so many who cripple themselves spiritually carrying burdens which could be put down. Many suffer from real misfortune and injustice. Sadly, some only imagine that they do. In either case, self-inflicted penalties soon become cruel and unusual punishment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/balm-of-gilead.p14\" class=\"\">If the burden is guilt, then repentance is the Balm of Gilead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/balm-of-gilead.p15\" class=\"\">Some, however, seek to cure guilt with self-justification, a quack medicine which only covers the symptoms; it will never cure the cause. Self-justification leads one to blame another for his mistakes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/balm-of-gilead.p16\" class=\"\">For example, when you seek financial gain, you may be tempted by others to miscalculate, even ignore, risks. When things go wrong\u2014and they can go wrong even in carefully managed affairs\u2014some look for others to blame. They want some \u201cdeep pocket\u201d to make them whole. They want someone else to carry their responsibility like the scapegoat of Old Testament times, which was ceremonially burdened with the sins of others and left to wander in the wilderness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/balm-of-gilead.p17\" class=\"\">They have little difficulty finding some attorney willing to act as high priest in transferring their responsibility to someone else.

I refer to those who do so to justify themselves and shift their own responsibility to someone else.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/balm-of-gilead.p19\" class=\"\">Such efforts are successful often enough to permit self-serving lawyers to convince yet another client that he need not honor his own commitments. The word <span class=\"emphasis\">integrity<\/span> becomes tarnished by counsel and client alike. And there follows that long trail of acrimony with brother against brother over property or money.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/balm-of-gilead.p20\" class=\"\">Be careful lest you yourself become the goat and carry unseen spiritual burdens into the wilderness. More serious by far than the loss of property or money are the unseen spiritual penalties which accrue like interest on a debt which one day, in the eternal scheme of things, must surely be paid.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/balm-of-gilead.p21\" class=\"\">I read somewhere of a young couple who settled in the wilderness. While the man cleared the land, his wife tended things about the homestead.
