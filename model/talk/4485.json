This gift comes undeviatingly by personal revelation to those who strive to obey the commandments of the Lord and to follow the counsel of the living prophets.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/the-great-imitator.p35\" class=\"\">This personal revelation will surely come to all whose eyes are single to the glory of God, for it is promised that their bodies will be \u201cfilled with light, and there shall be no darkness\u201d in them (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18660\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18660)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18660)\">D&amp;C 88:67<\/a><\/span>). Satan\u2019s efforts can be thwarted by all who come unto Christ by obedience to the covenants and ordinances of the gospel. The humble followers of the divine Master need not be deceived by the devil if they will be honest and true to their fellow men and women, go to the house of the Lord, receive the sacrament worthily, observe the Sabbath day, pay their tithes and offerings, offer contrite prayers, engage in the Lord\u2019s work, and follow those who preside over them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/the-great-imitator.p36\" class=\"\">I wish to testify that there are forces which will save us from the ever-increasing lying, disorder, violence, chaos, destruction, misery, and deceit that are upon the earth. Those saving forces are the everlasting principles, covenants, and ordinances of the eternal gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. These same principles, covenants, and ordinances are coupled with the rights and powers of the priesthood of Almighty God. We of this church are the possessors and custodians of these commanding powers which can and do roll back much of the power of Satan on the earth. We believe that we hold these mighty forces in trust for all who have died, for all who are now living, and for the yet unborn.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/the-great-imitator.p37\" class=\"\">I pray that, through the spreading of righteousness, the evil hands of the destroyer might be stayed and that he may not be permitted to curse the whole world. I also pray that God will overlook our weaknesses, our frailties, and our many shortcomings and generously forgive us of our misdeeds. I further pray that He will bring solace to the suffering, comfort to those who grieve, and peace to the brokenhearted, in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
