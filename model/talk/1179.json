McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1961, pp. 122-125<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nThe singing, as you know, for this afternoon and this morning has been furnished by the\nmembers of the Tabernacle Choir. We have been inspired with their singing. I think it would\nbe fitting at this moment to represent you as well as the General Authorities in saying just a\nword, at least, of appreciation of the services rendered by many during this three-day\nconference in making this inspirational gathering so meaningful: \n<\/p><p>\nFirst, to the General Authorities, we express deep appreciation for the inspirational messages\nthey have given to us. Second, to the public press, the reporters, for their fair and accurate\nreports throughout the sessions of the conference. Third, to the city officials the city traffic\nofficers in handling increased traffic. etc; members of the fire department, some of whom you\nmet after one or two of these sessions; and to the Red Cross representatives who have been on\nhand to render any assistance and service that might be needed. To the Tabernacle ushers who\nhave rendered service in seating the great  audiences of these conference sessions. Quietly and\nunobtrusively they have looked after your convenience and welfare.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have already expressed, and we do so again, appreciation to the radio and television\nstations throughout our own city and the nation who all through the three days have carried\nthe proceedings of these inspirational sessions. These stations have been the means of\npermitting untold thousands of persons to hear the proceedings of the one hundred thirty-first\nsemiannual conference.\n<\/p><p>\nWe appreciate especially those who have furnished the singing throughout this conference. Let\nme remind you again, as you enjoy the service they have rendered: <i>first<\/i>, the\nRelief Society Singing Mothers from the Central Utah and Mt. Timpanogos regions, who\nrendered service faithfully for two days with the Relief Society sisters before they joined us\nFriday morning. Sister Florence Jepperson Madsen conducted. <i>Next<\/i>, the University of Utah\nMixed Chorus for the Saturday morning session, with Ardean W. Watts conducting. The\nUniversity of Utah Institute of Religion, University Stake Chorus, and the Bonneville Strings,\nfurnished the music for the Saturday afternoon session, with Elder David Austin Shand\nconducting.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Third<\/i>, the Tabernacle Choir Men's Chorus last night. How inspiring that group was! <i>Fourth<\/i>,\nlast, but certainly not least, the Tabernacle Choir, who furnished the music this morning and\nthis afternoon, with Elder Richard P. Condie and Elder Jay E. Welch conducting, and how\nthey have thrilled not only this nation, but also people in other countries, wherever they have\nbeen. Our best wishes and prayers go with them in their prospective tour, for they will receive\na welcome wherever they go. God bless them, and all officials connected with that great\norganization.\n<\/p><p>\nWe mention again these beautiful antheriums from Oahu Stake.\n<\/p><p>\nIndeed, we thank all those who have contributed in any way to the success and inspiration of\nthis great conference.\n<\/p><p>\nCarlyle said: \"There is one godlike virtue, the essence of all that ever was or ever will be of\ngodlike in this world&mdash;the veneration done to human worth by the hearts of men.\" During\nthe last few days especially, and frequently in the position which General Authorities occupy,\nwe have occasion to ask men and women to accept certain positions and to devote their time\nand their means to the work of the kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nRecently I have seen men's hearts touched, tears roll down their cheeks, as they were\nsurprised to hear a request of the General Authorities to accept some responsibility or be\ncalled in some other position. Without exception, no matter what sacrifice they had to make\nfinancially no matter how unable they feel themselves to fill the position, each one has said,\n\"Yes, if that is what the Church wants, I will do it.\"\n<\/p><p>\nFrequently we hear reports from wards and branches of efforts the people put forth to\ncontribute, perhaps to the erection of a building, perhaps to renovate, or to build an addition\nto a present building. They see that two, three, four, sometimes six or seven groups&mdash;wards\nor branches&mdash;have to meet in one building, and they feel the necessity of contributing of\ntheir means. And what those members of the Church, unknown beyond the borders of their\nbranch or ward, do to make more effective conditions to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ!\n<\/p><p>\nI wish all the world could glimpse the willingness of those people, the sacrifices they have to\nmake. I think it would preach the gospel more effectively than any one other thing we could\ndo. I recall just a few years ago of visiting a stake and dedicating their meetinghouse. I\nlearned of the struggles they had in order to finish paying for that building. None of our\nchapels are dedicated until they are free from debt. That means that millions of dollars have\nbeen spent in the erection of stake houses and ward buildings throughout the 336 stakes and\nsixty-seven missions.\n<\/p><p>\nThat meetinghouse had just been paid for about a week before the dedicatory services were\nheld. The bishop had to call for an extra contribution, and a young boy who earned his money\nby washing cars, polishing shoes, and doing little odd jobs, had quite a little sum of money,\nfor a boy, in the bank. I received this information from the banker himself who was an officer\nin the stake. I do not know whether the father had contributed much to the chapel. I had my\nown thoughts, but when the bishop made an extra call for money this boy went to the bank\nand asked the banker, \"How much have I in the bank?\" He told him, and I think it was\nsomething near one hundred dollars. Sister McKay, who knew about the circumstances, says it\nwas near a hundred. The boy said, \"Well, I shall take ten dollars, and you give the rest to the\nbishop to finish paying on this meetinghouse.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Oh, but you can't afford that,\" said the banker.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Yes, I can,\" and he took ten dollars for himself and gave the balance to the bishop.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a lesson! I think I told that afterwards when I went back to the stake, and the young\nboy was then on a mission. I cite this incident merely as an illustration of the loyalty and\nfaith of the membership of the Church. I appreciate these acts, and because of them, in our\nhearts there will be a love for one another, which is the Spirit of the Christ, the spirit of\nbrotherhood, the spirit of love.\n<\/p><p>\nI am a great believer in the doctrine of James. He was a practical man in the early Church.\nPaul preached faith; James preached works, and it was James who said, \". . . shew me thy\nfaith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26149\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26149)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26149)\">James 2:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can\nfaith save him?\n<\/p><p>\n\"If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,\n<\/p><p>\n\"And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding ye\ngive them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy\nworks, and I will shew thee my faith by my works\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26143\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26143)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26143)\">James 2:14-18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThroughout this conference emphasis has frequently been made by the speakers to the great\nresponsibility resting upon the membership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nto declare to the world that God lives; that Jesus Christ, his Son, is our Savior; that his is the\nonly name \". . . under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7882\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7882)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7882)\">Acts 4:12<\/a><\/span>). It\nwas said at the opening of this conference that there are men and women who are now forty\nto fifty years old who have heard all their lives that God does not exist, that Jesus Christ is a\nmyth. You have heard the testimony from men with tears in their eyes, if you were close\nenough to see, their lips quivering with emotion, testify that they know that God lives, that\nJesus is the Christ, and that they appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and gave instructions\nabout organizing his Church, and that Peter, James, and John, who held the authority from the\nChrist himself, gave that authority in this dispensation; that the Melchizedek Priesthood was\nbestowed upon the Prophet and Oliver Cowdery; that John the Baptist who baptized Jesus\nChrist bestowed the Aaronic Priesthood, a direct successor of the authority from heaven.\n<\/p><p>\nNow you know that. You know these men. I give you my testimony that God lives; that he is\nclose to us; that his spirit is real, that his voice is real; that Jesus Christ, his Son, stands at the\nhead of this great work; and no matter how much the atheistic philosophy takes hold of\nblinded boys and girls and men who hear Satan's voice, the truth stands as declared by the\nFather and the Son to that boy Prophet. You and I and all the members of the Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have the responsibility to declare that truth to the world, and\nthe world is full of honest men and women waiting to hear that truth. Let us not condemn\nthem. Condemn the evil men who would blind them with their sophistry and with false\nreasoning. Some of our young boys are so blinded, but it is our duty as officers of the Church\nto lead them from that blindness to the truth. I think I can repeat here, as I did last night, for\nthose misguided boys: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Dim as the borrow'd beams of moon and stars<br \/>\n     To lonely, weary, wandering travelers,<br \/>\n     Is reason to the soul; and as on high<br \/>\n     Those rolling fires discover but the sky,<br \/>\n     Not light us here, so Reason's glimmering ray<br \/>\n     Was lent, not to assure our doubtful way<br \/>\n     But lead us upward to a better day.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;                         &mdash;Dryden\n<\/p><p>\nThat brighter day is the light of the Holy Spirit emanating from God the Father, and his Son,\nJesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you, my dear fellow workers, bless you in your homes. Make your faith shown by\nyour works in your home; husbands true to your wives, not only in act, but\nin thought; wives true to your husbands, not only in act, but in thought; children true to your\nparents. Do not arrogate to yourselves that they are old-fashioned in their beliefs and that you\nknow more.\n<\/p><p>\nGirls, follow that sweet mother and her teachings. Boys, be true to your fathers who try to\nlive the gospel; then strangers, seeing such homes, will say, \"Well, if that is the result of\nMormonism, I think it is good.\" You will show your faith by your works in everyday life\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26150\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26150)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26150)\">James 2:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you that we may have power so to do, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
