In Proverbs we read, \u201cWho can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41597\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41597)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41597)\">Prov. 31:10<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"41598\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41598)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41598)\">Prov. 31:10\u201331<\/a><\/span>.) The virtuous woman described in Proverbs was a woman who was prepared. She worked willingly, stretched out her hand to the poor, saw to the physical needs of her household, sought after knowledge. She had profound reverence for the Lord. While many of her tasks may appear to be temporal in nature, her blessings were eternal ones.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p6\" class=\"\">When we speak of preparedness, often our first thoughts center on temporal or physical preparations\u2014food, clothing, shelter. While these preparations are important and necessary, they are not all-inclusive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p7\" class=\"\">There is a crucial balance between the temporal and the spiritual aspects of this principle. The Lord has said, \u201cAll things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18790\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18790)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18790)\">D&amp;C 29:34<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p8\" class=\"\">The Lord taught us a very important lesson when he visited the home of his friends Mary and Martha. While Martha attended to the needs of her guest, Mary sat and listened to the words of the Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p9\" class=\"\">We read: \u201cBut Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore that she help me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd Jesus answered \u2026 , Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cBut one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32330\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32330)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32330)\">Luke 10:40\u201342<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p12\" class=\"\">In his counsel, \u201cbut one thing is needful,\u201d could the Lord have been referring to one thing lacking in Martha\u2019s preparation? Probably. There is need for balance. Our physical preparation\u2014including a clean, orderly home\u2014makes it possible for the Spirit to be present. Likewise, the Spirit of the Lord brings an atmosphere of peace and contentment to our orderly home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p13\" class=\"\">One sister told of her preparation to receive a General Authority guest in her home for stake conference. Everything was to be perfect. Extensive cleaning and cooking were done. Her ten children were prepped as to what their roles should be. She worked hard! By the time he arrived she was exhausted and couldn\u2019t enjoy his visit. Too late, she realized that spiritual preparation was \u201cneedful\u201d also.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p14\" class=\"\">She stated, \u201cIt is because of our spiritual preparation that we can find answers to our everyday challenges. It is because of our spiritual preparation that we can find joy in enduring and overcoming our trials. It is because of our spiritual preparation that we can feel the greatest joy of all, a nearness and closeness to our Savior and Father in Heaven.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p15\" class=\"\">How, then, do we prepare?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p16\" class=\"\">We prepare by developing a strong relationship with our Heavenly Father through prayer, scripture study, and obedience to the commandments; by knowing our own worth; and by sustaining the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p17\" class=\"\">Qualities of spirituality do not come without effort. Like any other talent with which we are blessed, they must be constantly practiced. A famous pianist once said, \u201cIf I fail to practice for one day, I can tell the difference in my playing. If I fail to practice for two days, my family can tell the difference. If I fail for three days, the whole world can tell the difference.\u201d This same principle applies to us in our quest for exaltation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p18\" class=\"\">In applying the parable of the ten virgins to our lives, our modern prophets have explained that the oil of preparation is accumulated drop by drop through daily righteous living.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p19\" class=\"\">Consistently attending sacrament meetings adds oil to our lamps. So too will fasting, praying individually and as a family, visiting teaching, controlling our bodily appetites, teaching gospel principles, nourishing and nurturing, watching over one another, studying the scriptures, keeping the commandments. Each act of dedication and obedience is a drop of oil with which we can refuel our lamps. Keeping the commandments and following the words of the prophet may be the greatest preparation we can make for any eventuality to come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p20\" class=\"\">A few years ago while we were serving in the mission field, a minister who was investigating the Church said, \u201cI hear you talk about the benefit of a living prophet. What sort of pronouncements has he made lately?\u201d We replied, \u201cThe prophet has taught us that we need to live frugally. We need to stay out of debt, fix up our homes, and plant gardens that we may enjoy the fruit of our labor.\u201d The minister thought for a moment and then said, \u201cThat is not what I would have imagined a prophet to say, but as I consider it, what better advice could be given?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p21\" class=\"\">Often the advice that is given by our prophets is so simple and practical that we overlook it and fail to heed it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p22\" class=\"\">We are taught that we have great worth in the eyes of our Heavenly Father. The Primary children sing, \u201cI am a child of God.\u201d The Young Women recite their theme which begins, \u201cWe are daughters of our Heavenly Father, who loves us,\u201d and the prophets have declared that virtuous women are more priceless than rubies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p23\" class=\"\">Listen to this simple direction from our prophet to the young women of the Church, which applies to all of us: \u201cLive up to your divine potential. Remember who you are and the divine heritage that is yours\u2014you are literally the royal daughters of our Father in Heaven.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1986, p. 85.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t settle for less than what the Lord wants you to be.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1986, p. 84.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p25\" class=\"\">Unfortunately, many of us fail to recognize what the Lord wants us to be. A sister wrote to me recently, telling of some events that led her to realize how much her Heavenly Father loved her and had blessed her. She said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cI have had very low self-esteem and have not felt \u2018good enough\u2019 to have a close relationship with [my Father in Heaven]. This has kept me self-centered and unable to serve as effectively as I could. During the last few months I have felt a yearning desire within me, an urgency, if you will, to draw nearer to my Father in Heaven. Lately I have felt his arm around me and his great love extending to me\u2014a beautiful feeling of acceptance. With this have come many gifts: more patience, more self-control, [more understanding]. I know this is the Holy Ghost teaching me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cI have learned when priorities are in order and I prepare personally each day with prayer, scripture study, and physical care, I am happier and a more profitable servant.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p28\" class=\"\">We learn from this that we also prepare by serving, teaching, nurturing, and helping others prepare. As we work daily to attain righteousness and a spiritual way of life, we have a responsibility to elevate others, to help them realize their divine potential, and to be an instrument in the hands of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p29\" class=\"\">Yes, being a woman brings blessings and responsibilities. Often there are tasks which, when filled, are without visibility, acclaim, or attendant worldly power. Nonetheless they are vital to the progress of humankind. When we are diverted from our course, serious weaknesses may appear in our lives and in the lives of family members, as well as in society.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p30\" class=\"\">Because of \u201cthe subtle craftiness of men [who] lie in wait to deceive\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18900\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18900)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18900)\">D&amp;C 123:12<\/a><\/span>), many, even of the very elect, are being deceived.

My own mother has shared with me some of her goals and aspirations. Often as she began a project, something would happen to change her course of action: a mother-in-law in her waning years needed a home and special care, a younger sister needed help to complete her schooling. There were those with whom she worked who also desperately needed help. She was always there to serve. She gave this service graciously, and though not all her own personal plans were accomplished, she looks back on her life and says that if she had it to do all over again, she wouldn\u2019t change anything. Service to others brings that kind of satisfaction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p32\" class=\"\">It is according to our natures, sisters, to have feelings of charity and benevolence. It isn\u2019t always easy to put these feelings into action. But as women, we should pray for charitable desires and opportunities and then work to foster these godlike attributes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/becoming-a-prepared-people.p33\" class=\"\">I suppose that Emma Smith had more than her share of frustration and disappointment.
