We, all of us, believe that our God is a God of order, that all things that are conducted by him are conducted in the most perfect order, according to law. Hence it is written somewhere in the New Testament, I think in the 14th chapter of Paul's 1st epistle to the Corinthians that: &#x201C;My house is a house of order, and not a house of confusion.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"73772\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 73772)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(73772)\">1 Cor. 14:33,40<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"91496\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 91496)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(91496)\">D&amp;C 132:8<\/a><\/span> What we mean by this is, that everything pertaining to the salvation of men, which is acceptable in the sight of heaven, must be in accordance with strict law.

That ordinance is baptism, which must be performed according to the pattern and law of heaven; it must not be varied from. Sprinkling will not do; pouring water on the head will not do; baptism administered by a man having no authority from heaven will not be accepted; it must be administered according to law, order and authority, by one who is commissioned, to whom the Lord has spoken and to whom he has given revelation and called to  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"272a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD14\/JoD14_0272.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;272a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/5255\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>perform that work, then it will be acceptable, and will be acknowledged in heaven, and be recorded in the archives of eternity; and when the books are opened it will be found in those books that that man or that woman has complied with the order of God's house, given heed to the institutions and ordinances of his kingdom, and having continued to do so to the end he or she can be saved. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v14n1016\"> God has also ordained that when he bestows upon the children of men spiritual gifts that they must be received in order; they must be given according to the laws and institutions of the church, through the administration of that authority and power that he has established here on the earth.

Thirty-nine years ago a revelation was given, a passage or two of which I will now read; &#x201C;A revelation of Jesus Christ unto his servant Joseph Smith, and six elders, as they united their hearts and lifted up their voices on high. Yea, the word of the Lord concerning his church, established in the last days for the restoration of his people, as he has spoken by the mouth of his prophets, and for the gathering of his saints to stand on Mount Zion, which shall be the city of the New Jerusalem. Which city shall be built, beginning at the temple lot, which is appointed by the finger of the Lord, in the western boundaries of the State of Missouri, and dedicated by the hand of Joseph Smith, Jun., and others with whom the Lord was well pleased.&#x201D; <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v14n1028\"> I now notice another prediction: &#x201C;Verily this is the word of the Lord, that the city of the New Jerusalem shall be built up by the gathering of the saints, beginning at this place, even the place of the temple, which temple shall be reared in this generation. For verily this generation shall not all pass away until an house shall be built unto the Lord, and a cloud shall rest upon it, which cloud shall be even the glory of the Lord, which shall fill the house.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"87477\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 87477)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(87477)\">D&amp;C 84:1-5<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v14n1029\"> We will now read an item from the sixth paragraph: &#x201C;The sons of Moses,&#x201D; that is, those that pertain to the two priesthoods, &#x201C;the sons of Moses and the sons of Aaron shall offer an acceptable offering and sacri<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"275b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD14\/JoD14_0275.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;275b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/5252\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>fice in the house of the Lord, which house shall be established in this generation, upon the consecrated spot as I have appointed&#x2014;And the sons of Moses and of Aaron,&#x201D; that is, those who receive the two priesthoods, &#x201C;shall be filled with the glory of the Lord, upon Mount Zion in the Lord's house, whose sons are ye; and also many whom I have called and sent forth to build up my church.

Yes! The Latter-day Saints have as firm faith and rely upon this promise as much as they rely upon the promise of forgiveness of sins when they comply with the first principles of the Gospel. We just as much expect that a city will be built, called Zion, in the place and on the land which has been appointed by the Lord our God, and that a temple will be reared on the spot that has been selected, and the cornerstone of which has been laid, in the generation when this revelation was given; we just as much expect this as we expect the sun to rise in the morning and set in the evening; or as much as we expect to see the fulfillment of any of the purposes of the Lord our God, pertaining to the works of his hands. But says the objector, &#x201C;thirty-nine years have passed away.&#x201D; What of that? The generation has not passed away; all the people that were living thirty-nine years ago have not passed away; but before they do pass away this will be fulfilled. What is the object of this Temple?
