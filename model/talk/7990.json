I use the word <span class=\"emphasis\">secret<\/span> because the principles upon which a teacher\u2019s success rests can be understood only by those who have a testimony of what took place on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of 1820.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/teaching-with-the-power-and-authority-of-god.p7\" class=\"\">In response to a 14-year-old boy\u2019s humble prayer, the heavens were opened. God the Eternal Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared and spoke to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The long-awaited restitution of all things had begun, and the principle of revelation was everlastingly established in our dispensation. Joseph\u2019s message, and our message to the world, can be summarized in two words: \u201cGod speaks.\u201d He spoke anciently, He spoke to Joseph, and He will speak to you. This is what sets you apart from all other teachers in the world. This is why you cannot fail.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/teaching-with-the-power-and-authority-of-god.p8\" class=\"\">You have been called by the spirit of prophecy and revelation and have been set apart by priesthood authority.

You are His agent, and you are authorized and commissioned to represent Him and to act on His behalf. As His agent, you are entitled to His help. You must ask yourself, \u201cWhat would the Savior say if He were teaching my class today, and how would He say it?\u201d You must then do likewise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/teaching-with-the-power-and-authority-of-god.p10\" class=\"\">This responsibility may cause some to feel inadequate or even somewhat fearful.

Of course, you must diligently prepare for each lesson and strive to learn how you can teach so as to help your students exercise their agency and allow the gospel to enter into their hearts, but the first and most important part of your service is your personal, spiritual preparation. As you follow this counsel, the First Presidency has promised: \u201cThe Holy Ghost will help you to know what to do.

The power of the gospel comes into the lives of those who so live that the Holy Ghost is their companion and who follow the promptings they receive. Some focus their attention only on obtaining the word, and they become experts in delivering information. Others neglect their preparation and hope that the Lord in His goodness will somehow help them get through the class period. You cannot expect the Spirit to help you remember the scriptures and principles you have not studied or considered.
