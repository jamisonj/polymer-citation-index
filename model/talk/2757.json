Some seek to substitute Caesars for Christ. Others are blinded because they are \u201clooking beyond the mark\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25867\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25867)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25867)\">Jacob 4:14<\/a><\/span>) when the mark is Christ. Many sects\u2014without the reinforcing rods of revelation\u2014have been badly shaken by theological tremors; the resulting ecclesiastical erosion has been so rapid it is measured in months, not centuries. Some crusaders without a cross have actually removed the divinity of Jesus Christ from the center of their doctrines\u2014only to see all the other doctrinal dominoes tumble, too.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/jesus-of-nazareth-savior-and-king.p4\" class=\"\">Thus, foolishness, fear, and fashion have flattened the theology of many.

He helped to prepare this planet for us and led\u2014not pushed\u2014us from our premortal post. I thank him for the untold things he did, across the ages of that first estate, to prepare perfectly for his unique role\u2014while I was doing so very much less. I thank him, further, for not deserting those of us who are slow or stragglers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/jesus-of-nazareth-savior-and-king.p10\" class=\"\">I testify that his intelligence is vastly superior in every field to the very brightest mortals in those fields and that his intellect in scope and truth far exceeds all human intellects. I thank him for encapsulating that exquisite mind in both perfect love and perfect humility. His brilliance is not the \u201ccatch-me-if-you-can\u201d kind, but a pleading and patient, \u201cCome, follow me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31970\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31970)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31970)\">Luke 18:22<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/jesus-of-nazareth-savior-and-king.p11\" class=\"\">I testify that his premortal performance reflected both an astonishing selflessness and a breathtaking commitment to freedom as a condition of our genuine growth. I thank him for combining his long view of our needs with a short step forward to volunteer his services. Never has anyone offered so much to so many in so few words as when Jesus said, \u201cHere am I, send me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7328\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7328)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7328)\">Abr. 3:27<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/jesus-of-nazareth-savior-and-king.p12\" class=\"\">I testify that he assisted in the creation and management not only of this planet, but other worlds.

He who did not need to die himself was willing to be bound by the chains of death so he could break them for all mankind. I testify that he is thereby our advocate with the flawless Father. I thank him for letting us decide how we will regard him, our Rescuer. I thank him for his discerning way of knowing us without controlling us, for never letting the needs of now crowd out the considerations of eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/jesus-of-nazareth-savior-and-king.p15\" class=\"\">I testify that in eloquent example he partook voluntarily of the bitter cup in the awful, but for him avoidable, atonement; we must, therefore, drink from our tiny cups. I thank him for likewise not interceding on our behalf, even when we pray in faith and reasonable righteousness, for that which would not be right for us. Our glimpse of Gethsemane should teach us that all prayers are petitions!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/jesus-of-nazareth-savior-and-king.p16\" class=\"\">I testify that, though he never needed it, he gave to us what we desperately needed\u2014that program of progress\u2014repentance, which beckons us to betterness. I thank him for helping me, even forgiving me, when I fall short, when I testify of things known but which are beyond the border of my behavior, and for helping me to advance that border, bit by bit. His relentless redemptiveness exceeds my recurring wrongs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/jesus-of-nazareth-savior-and-king.p17\" class=\"\">I testify that he has given us, and will give us, living prophets.

I thank him who did everything perfectly for sharing his precious work with those of us who then do it so imperfectly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/jesus-of-nazareth-savior-and-king.p21\" class=\"\">I testify that he and the Father are serious about stretching our souls in this second estate.

I thank him for blessing me therein with a wife, children, parents, leaders, and friends to help me. I thank him now for the tender times, the jarring times, the perplexing times, and even for the times when my learning is so painfully public\u2014lest in such moments to come I am too taxed to testify or too anguished to appreciate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/jesus-of-nazareth-savior-and-king.p23\" class=\"\">I thank Jesus for foregoing fashionableness and for enduring not only the absence of appreciation but also for speaking the truth, knowing beforehand that misunderstanding and misrepresentation would follow. I thank him for his marvelous management of time, for never misusing a moment, including the moments of meditation. Even his seconds showed his stewardship.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/jesus-of-nazareth-savior-and-king.p24\" class=\"\">No son ever complemented his Father so gracefully, honored his Father so constantly, or trusted his Father so completely as did Jesus.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/jesus-of-nazareth-savior-and-king.p25\" class=\"\">Thus, I add my small voice to the anthem of appreciation that has proceeded from this pulpit over the decades.
