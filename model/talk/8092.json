They know well our Heavenly Father\u2019s plan for His children, for they were present with us in that great Council in Heaven when it was all presented. They try to take advantage of our weaknesses and frailties, deceiving us with \u201cmists of darkness \u2026 , which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth them away into broad roads, that they perish and are lost.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-12455_000_028\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130676\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130676)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130676)\">1\u00a0Nephi 12:17<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/yes-we-can-and-will-win.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">Despite the opposition we face, as President Monson has taught, this is a war that we can and will win.

One of these examples is Captain Moroni in the Book of Mormon. This remarkable young man had the courage to defend the truth at a time when there were many dissensions and wars which put at risk the very survival of the entire Nephite nation. Although he was brilliant in exercising his responsibilities, Moroni remained humble. This and other attributes made him an extraordinary instrument in the hands of God at that time. The book of Alma explains that if all men had been like Moroni, \u201cthe very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; [and] the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-12455_000_028\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130677\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130677)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130677)\">Alma 48:17<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> All of Moroni\u2019s attributes stemmed from his great faith in God and in the Lord Jesus Christ<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-12455_000_028\">4<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130678\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130678)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130678)\">Alma 48:13<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> and his firm determination to follow the voice of God and His prophets.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-12455_000_028\">5<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130679\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130679)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130679)\">Alma 43:23\u201324<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130680\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130680)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130680)\">48:16<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/yes-we-can-and-will-win.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">Figuratively, all of us need to transform ourselves into modern Captain Moronis in order to win the wars against evil. I know a very faithful young deacon who transformed himself into a modern Captain Moroni. Inasmuch as he has sought to follow the counsel of his parents and Church leaders, his faith and determination have been tested every day, even at his young age. He told me one day he was surprised by a very difficult and uncomfortable situation\u2014his friends were accessing pornographic images on their cell phones. In that exact moment, this young man had to decide what was most important\u2014his popularity or his righteousness. In the few seconds that followed, he was filled with courage and told his friends that what they were doing was not right. Moreover, he told them that they should stop what they were doing or they would become slaves to it. Most of his classmates ridiculed his counsel, saying that it was a part of life and that there was nothing wrong with it. However, there was one among them who listened to the counsel of that young man and decided to stop what he was doing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/yes-we-can-and-will-win.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">This deacon\u2019s example had a positive influence on at least one of his classmates. Undoubtedly, he and his friend faced mockery and persecution because of that decision. On the other hand, they had followed the admonition of Alma to his people when he said, \u201cCome ye out from the wicked, and be ye separate, and touch not their unclean things.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-12455_000_028\">6<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130681\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130681)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130681)\">Alma 5:57<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/general-priesthood-session\/yes-we-can-and-will-win.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">The pamphlet <span class=\"emphasis\">For the Strength of Youth<\/span> contains the following counsel, approved by the First Presidency for the youth of the Church: \u201cYou are responsible for the choices you make.

We need to be alert to this danger. We cannot allow ourselves to be confused by popular messages that are easily accepted by the world and that contradict the doctrine and true principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Many of these worldly messages represent nothing more than an attempt of our society to justify sin.
