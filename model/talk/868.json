McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1956, pp. 88-91<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nThis afternoon at the height of a most inspirational meeting I saw two young men on\nmy left in the gallery rise from their seats and walk out of the building. I hastily put on my\nlong distance glasses to see more definitely who they were. They impressed me as being\nteachers, about the age of 15.\n<\/p><p>\nThat little act emphasized one of the points to be mentioned at this Priesthood Meeting, and\nthat is the attitude of our young men bearing the Aaronic Priesthood who are asked to\nadminister the emblems of our Lord's death and life. No more sacred ordinance has been\ngiven to us by the Lord than the administration of the Sacrament. I shall not dwell long upon\nits significance, the principal one of which is a covenant that we make with the Lord. We\ngive our word of honor to do certain things, which as the Brethren said today, are contributive\nto our spiritual growth and happiness if kept, but which weaken our characters if we violate\nthem.\n<\/p><p>\nSay over in your mind briefly just what that covenant is. Those two men who are representing\nthe audience appeal to the Lord in the name of the Redeemer, and ask him to bless and\nsanctify that bread or water to the souls of all those who partake of it. That is a sacred\napproach. \"That they may do it in remembrance of the body (or blood) of thy Son, and\nwitness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the\nname of thy Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he hath\ngiven them,\" then the result, \"that they may always have his Spirit to be with them\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13448\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13448)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13448)\">D&amp;C 20:77,79<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat is one of the prayers given to us word for word. Young men who are given the\nPriesthood, the importance of which we have heard tonight, are asked to give the\ncongregation the opportunity to make that covenant, and the two priests who are to bless it, or\nthe four who are to participate, should be instructed regarding the importance and sacredness\nof their calling. No whispering should be engaged in by those boys. All preparation should be\ncarefully made before the hour of the sacrament meeting, and those young men should at least\nrefrain from conversation, even if they do not contemplate the responsibility which is theirs.\n<\/p><p>\nI am not going to say much about the dress. We are not a people who look to formality,\ncertainly we do not believe in phylacteries, in uniforms, on sacred occasions, but I do think\nthat the Lord will be pleased with a bishopric if they will instruct the young men who are\ninvited to administer the sacrament to dress properly. He will not be displeased if they come\nwith a white shirt instead of a colored one, and we are not so poor that we cannot afford\nclean, white shirts for the boys who administer the sacrament. If they do not have them, at\nleast they will come with clean hands, and especially with a pure heart.\n<\/p><p>\nI have seen deacons not all dressed alike, but they have a special tie or a special shirt as\nevidence that those young men have been instructed that \"you have a special calling this\nmorning. Come in your best.\" And when they are all in white I think it contributes to the\nsacredness of it. Anything that will make the young boys feel that they have been called upon\nto officiate in the Priesthood in one of the most sacred ordinances in the Church, and they too\nshould remain quiet, even before the opening of the meeting.\n<\/p><p>\nThat is just preliminary. I said I saw these two boys leave the building this afternoon, and it\nreminded me that in some of our wards, these young men who have been appointed to\nadminister the sacrament, and who have officiated in the order of the Priesthood, start for the\ndoor and leave the worshiping assembly. I will not say it is sacrilege, but I will say that it is\nnot in keeping with the order and sacredness of the service which they have rendered by\nvirtue of the Priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nInstruct them, bishops. When they accept that duty, they accept the responsibility of remaining\nthroughout that entire meeting hour. They are part of it. A bishop would not think of leaving.\nHis counselors would not. Neither should your representatives who administer the sacrament.\n<\/p><p>\nThere should be more order in the administration of the sacrament. A keener sense of the\npromise, the covenant, we make will add much to the spirituality of the membership of the\nChurch, and will entitle us to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Indeed that is a principal end of\nour existence.\n<\/p><p>\nI like that parable Jesus gave when he said, \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow;\nthey toil not, neither do they spin: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of\nthese\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34766\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34766)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34766)\">Matt. 6:28-29<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Consider the lilies, how they grow,\" with their roots down in the ground seeking for\nsustenance, and all that sustenance and vitality going up through the stem for one purpose,\nuntil that flower blossoms in the sunshine in fulfillment of its life, receiving the glory of the\nsunshine, and the completion of pistol and stamens.\n<\/p><p>\nSo we, with our tentacles in the earth, our hands, our brains, which God has given us\nphysically, seek life and sustenance in subduing matter. Why? That we might realize the ideal,\nthat our souls too may blossom in the sunshine of God's Holy Spirit, \"that thy Spirit may be\nalways with us.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, let us have the Lesser Priesthood remain and participate in that administration in\nsacredness, in reverence, and contribute to the order of the worshiping assembly.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is one other principle to which I wish to call attention tonight, and that is the\nobservance of the Sabbath Day. I was grieved, recently, and probably you were, to receive an\ninvitation to attend the opening of a new multi-million dollar runway at the Hill Field Air\nForce Base. All our service boys will want to be there. Thousands of loyal citizens will want\nto be there, but why should it be on Sunday? We have our boys of the Air Force here tonight.\nThey are loyal. Our boys are bringing honor to our Country. Their Captains, their officers,\nwrite to us and tell us how proud they are, and that goes for the boys particularly who are\nmaintaining the ideals of the Church. Most of them are&mdash;God bless them.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, among those ideas is worshiping on the Sabbath Day, keeping it holy. I wish that they,\nin order to be loyal to their troops and associates, would not have to go up there on Sunday. I\nunderstand that possibly the State National Guard here in our own State may ask the members\nof the National Guard to go out and drill on Sunday. I hope not.\n<\/p><p>\nSunday is worship day. It is holy (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22654\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22654)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22654)\">Ex. 20:8<\/a><\/span>).\nThis is a Christian nation, and the Lord has promised that\nas long as we keep him in mind and worship him this Country will stand&mdash;this Government\nwill stand (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22204\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22204)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22204)\">Ether 2:12<\/a><\/span>).\nNo other nation can take it or destroy it. But if we forget Him, God's promises are\nnot binding.\n<\/p><p>\nWhy should Sunday be observed as a day of rest? First, Sunday is essential to the true\ndevelopment and strength of body, and that is a principle which we should proclaim more\ngenerally abroad, and practice. I know that you men who have sedentary occupations, as we\ndo in the Church, say it is good to go out and have exercise. That will be better for us. But\nthere is something more than just that. Sunday is a day when we change our clothes, put on\nclean linen. It is truth that \"cleanliness is next to godliness,\" and the Lord said, \"Be ye clean\nthat bear the vessels of the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25178\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25178)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25178)\">Isa. 52:11<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13537\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13537)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13537)\">D&amp;C 133:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBacon, the great philosopher, said, \"Cleanliness of body was ever esteemed to proceed from a\ndue reverence to God. The consciousness of clean linen is in and of itself a source of moral\nstrength, second only to that of a clean conscience.\" The farmer who makes his boys go out\nand haul hay, even when a storm is coming, is doing his boys an injustice. It would be much\nbetter to let that hay be destroyed than to deprive those boys of a sense of coming nearer to\nthe Eternal Spirit, and partake of the sacrament, that they may always have his Spirit to be\nwith them.\n<\/p><p>\nA second purpose for keeping holy the Sabbath Day is: \"That thou mayest more fully keep\nthyself unspotted from the world.\" Contemplation during that sacred hour, self communion,\nand higher than that, communion in thought and feeling with the Lord&mdash;the realization that\nHe is near enough to be aware of what you are thinking. What you think about&mdash;is really\nwhat you are.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Nae treasures, nor pleasures,<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;     Could make us happy lang; <br \/>\nThe heart ay's the part ay<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;     That makes us right or wrang.\"\n<\/p><p>\nKeep thyself unspotted from the world, and ask God to forgive you if you have in mind\ninjuring anyone who trusts you&mdash;I mean morally&mdash;or if you have in mind wronging anybody,\ncleanse it from your mind. Read Doctrine and Covenants Section 59\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13471\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13471)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13471)\">D&amp;C 59:1-24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a third reason. Keeping holy the Sabbath Day is a law of God, resounding through\nthe ages from Mt. Sinai. You cannot transgress the law of God without circumscribing your\nspirit. Finally, our Sabbath, the first day of the week, commemorates the greatest event in all\nhistory: Christ's resurrection and his visit as a resurrected being to his assembled Apostles.\nHis birth, of course, was necessary, and just as great, so I say this is one of the greatest\nevents in all history.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The Sunday,\" says Emerson, \"is the core of our civilization, dedicated to thought and\nreverence. It invites to the noblest solitude, and to the noblest society.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe have other instructions and suggestions, but I will add no more than to commend the\nexcellent admonitions given by Brother Petersen, President Clark, and President Richards.\n<\/p><p>\nI will conclude with reference to an incident as a missionary in Scotland in 1898. After\nhaving been in Stirling only a few weeks, I walked around Stirling Castle with my senior\ncompanion, Elder Peter G. Johnston of Idaho. We had not yet secured our lodging in Stirling.\nI confess I was homesick. We had spent a half-day around the castle, and the men out in the\nfields ploughing, that spring day, made me all the more homesick, and took me back to my\nold home town.\n<\/p><p>\nAs we returned to the town, I saw an unfinished building standing back from the sidewalk\nseveral yards. Over the front door was a stone arch, something unusual in a residence, and\nwhat was still more unusual, I could see from the sidewalk that there was an inscription\nchiseled in that arch.\n<\/p><p>\nI said to my companion: \"That's unusual! I am going to see what the inscription is.\" When I\napproached near enough, this message came to me, not only in stone, but as if it came from\nOne in whose service we were engaged: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Whate'er Thou Art, Act Well Thy Part.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI turned and walked thoughtfully away, and when I reached my companion I repeated the\nmessage to him.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to follow that motto. It is just another expression of Christ's words: \"He that will\ndo the will of God shall know of the doctrine, whether the work is of God, or whether I\nspeak of myself\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27686\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27686)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27686)\">John 7:17<\/a><\/span>),\nand that testimony leads us all to the guidance of the Holy Spirit in life. I\nhumbly pray that the Priesthood assembled this night (the number we will give you\ntomorrow&mdash;the greatest, probably, in the history of the Church) will take upon themselves the\nresponsibilities which God has placed upon them, and do their duty wherever it may be, and I\nask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
