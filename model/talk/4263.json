We remember the experience of our beloved prophet President Spencer W. Kimball. As a fourteen-year-old boy he accepted the challenge of reading the Bible from cover to cover. Most of his reading was done by coal oil light in his attic bedroom. He read every night until he completed the 1,519 pages, which took him approximately a year; but he attained his goal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/to-the-youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p14\" class=\"\">Of the four great standard works of the Church\u2014the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price\u2014I would particularly urge you to read again and again the Book of Mormon and ponder and apply its teachings.

It will fortify you against the evils of our day. It will bring a spirituality into your life that no other book will. It will be the most important book you will read in preparation for a mission and for life. A young man who knows and loves the Book of Mormon, who has read it several times, who has an abiding testimony of its truthfulness, and who applies its teachings will be able to stand against the wiles of the devil and will be a mighty tool in the hands of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/to-the-youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p16\" class=\"\">Further, I would encourage you brethren of the Aaronic Priesthood to receive a patriarchal blessing. Study it carefully and regard it as personal scripture to you\u2014for that is what it is. A patriarchal blessing is the inspired and prophetic statement of your life\u2019s mission together with blessings, cautions, and admonitions as the patriarch may be prompted to give. Young men, receive your patriarchal blessing under the influence of fasting and prayer, and then read it regularly that you may know God\u2019s will for you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/to-the-youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p17\" class=\"\">May I now direct your attention to the importance of attending all of your Church meetings.

Teach them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/to-the-youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p58\" class=\"\">As I indicated last October as we met in general priesthood session, you have the major responsibility for teaching your sons the gospel. I would encourage you to reread that address. As important as the organizations of the Church are for teaching our youth, fathers have a sacred calling to continually teach and instruct members of their families in the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/to-the-youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p59\" class=\"\">Priesthood leaders, remember that the bishop is the president of the Aaronic Priesthood. Bishops, your first and foremost responsibility is the Aaronic Priesthood and the young women of your wards.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/to-the-youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p60\" class=\"\">Stay close to your young men. Get inside their lives. A personal interview once a year with them is not sufficient to fulfill your sacred duty. Visit with them often. Attend their quorum and Scout meetings. Go on their campouts. Participate in their youth conferences. Promote father-and-son activities. Talk with them often about a mission, and regularly visit with them about their personal worthiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/to-the-youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p61\" class=\"\">Strengthen the Aaronic Priesthood quorums. Effectively use the videotape entitled \u201cVitalizing the Aaronic Priesthood Quorums\u201d and the accompanying training guide. These are some of the finest training tools we have in the Aaronic Priesthood. Bishoprics, quorum advisers, and quorum presidencies should regularly use this training program.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/to-the-youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p62\" class=\"\">Now, in closing, my young men of the Aaronic Priesthood, how I love you, how I respect you, how I pray for you. Remember the counsel I have given you tonight. It is what the Lord would have you hear now\u2014today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/to-the-youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p63\" class=\"\">Live up to your godly potential. Remember who you are and the priesthood that you bear. Be modern-day sons of Helaman.
