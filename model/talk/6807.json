Yet some members clear that barrier with ease. I have observed them carefully in my travels. I can picture some of them now.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p5\" class=\"\">Saturday is a market day across the world. In the countryside of Ghana, in Ecuador, and in the Philippine Islands, countless people bring the produce of their farms and their handicrafts to a town to sell. They talk with those they meet on the road. And they visit with those near them as they wait for someone to buy. Much of the talk is about the struggles of existence, of breaking out of poverty, and sometimes about danger.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p6\" class=\"\">Among those on the roads and in the markets are Latter-day Saints. Much of their talk with those they meet would be the same as you would hear anywhere in the world. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d \u201cIs that your son with you?\u201d \u201cHow many children do you have?\u201d But there will be a difference in the Latter-day Saints. It would be noticeable in their eyes as much as in their words. They listen carefully with the look of someone who cares about the answers to questions and who cares about the person.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p7\" class=\"\">If the conversation lasts more than a few minutes, it would turn to things that matter deeply to both of them. They would talk of what they believe brings happiness and what brings sadness. And the talk would turn to hopes for this life and the next. The Latter-day Saint would express quiet assurance. Not every time, but sometimes, the Latter-day Saint would be asked, \u201cWhy are you so much at peace?\u201d \u201cHow do you know these things you say you know?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p8\" class=\"\">And then there would come a quiet answer. Perhaps it would be about Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appearing to the young boy Joseph Smith. It might be about the resurrected Savior\u2019s loving ministry, as described in the Book of Mormon, to common people who had faith in Him and who loved Him as we do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p9\" class=\"\">If you could hear such a conversation, which reaches spiritual things in a marketplace or on a street, you might ask: \u201cHow could I do that? How could I become better at sharing my faith with those who do not yet feel what I feel?\u201d It is a question for each of us who are members. That same question is on the mind of every bishop and branch president in the Church who now has the charge to lead missionary work among his people. The answer to that question is at the heart of the harvest which will come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p10\" class=\"\">I\u2019ve studied carefully and prayerfully some who are remarkably faithful and effective witnesses of the Savior and His Church. Their stories are inspiring. One humble man was called as the president of a tiny branch. There were so few members he could not see how the branch could function. He walked into a grove of trees to pray. He asked God what he should do. An answer came. He and the few members began inviting friends to join with them. In a year, hundreds had come into the waters of baptism and become fellow citizens in the Lord\u2019s Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p11\" class=\"\">I know a man who travels almost every week in his work. On any day there are missionaries somewhere in the world teaching someone he met. There is another man who seems undeterred by how many he must speak to before any of them wish to be taught by the missionaries. He doesn\u2019t count the cost in his effort but only the happiness of those whose lives are changed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p12\" class=\"\">There is no single pattern in what they do. There is no common technique. Some always carry a Book of Mormon to give away. Others set a date to find someone for the missionaries to teach. Another has found questions which draw out feelings about what matters most in life to a person. Each has prayed to know what to do. They each seem to get a different answer, suited especially to them and to the people they meet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p13\" class=\"\">But in one way they are all alike. It is this: they have a common way of seeing who they are. They can do what they have been inspired to do because of who they are. To do what we are to do, we will have to become like them in at least two ways. First, they feel that they are the beloved children of a loving Heavenly Father. Because of that they turn to Him easily and often in prayer. They expect to receive His personal direction. They obey in meekness and humility, as the children of a perfect parent. He is close to them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p14\" class=\"\">Second, they are the grateful disciples of the resurrected Jesus Christ. They know for themselves that the Atonement is real and necessary for all. They have felt cleansed through baptism by those in authority and the receipt of the Holy Ghost for themselves. And because of the peace they have experienced, they are like the sons of Mosiah, \u201cdesirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-23905_000_013\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40192\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40192)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40192)\">Mosiah 28:3<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p15\" class=\"\">Those who speak easily and often of the restored gospel prize what it has meant to them. They think of that great blessing often. It is the memory of the gift they have received which makes them eager for others to receive it. They have felt the love of the Savior. For them these words are their daily, hourly reality:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cThere is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment.

The Apostle John was clear about that: fear will be gone when we are made <span class=\"emphasis\">perfect<\/span> in love. We can pray for that gift of perfect love. We can pray with confidence that we can feel the Savior\u2019s love for us and for all we meet. He loved us and them enough to pay the price of all our sins. It is one thing to believe that. It is something far more to have our hearts changed to feel it every moment. The command to pray to feel the Savior\u2019s love is also a promise.

He carries with him a copy of the Book of Mormon. The night before a short trip recently, he decided not to take a copy with him but instead to carry what is called a pass-along card. But in the morning, a spiritual impression came: \u201cTake a Book of Mormon with you.\u201d He put one in his bag.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p24\" class=\"\">A woman he knew sat next to him on the plane, and he wondered, \u201cIs this the one?\u201d She rode with him again on the return trip.

She said that she was supposed to pay tithing to her church but she didn\u2019t. And then she said, \u201cWhat is this about the Book of Mormon?\u201d He explained that it was scripture, another witness of Jesus Christ, translated by the Prophet Joseph Smith. She seemed interested. So he reached down into his bag and said: \u201cI was impressed to bring this book with me. I think it is for you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p26\" class=\"\">She began to read it. As they parted, she said, \u201cYou and I are going to have to have more conversations about this.\u201d What my friend could not know, but God did, was that she was looking for a church. God knew she had watched my friend and wondered what about his church made him so happy. God knew she would ask about the Book of Mormon, and He knew she would be willing to be taught by the missionaries. She was prepared. So was my friend. And so can you and I be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p27\" class=\"\">Your worthiness and your desire will shine in your face and your eyes. You will be excited about the Lord\u2019s Church and His work, and it will show. You will be His disciple 24 hours a day in every situation. You won\u2019t need to build up your courage for one great moment to speak to someone and then retreat. The fact that most people are not interested in the restored gospel will have little bearing on what you do and say. Speaking what you believe will be part of what you are.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p28\" class=\"\">My father was like that. He was a scientist. He lectured to audiences in countries around the world. Once I read a talk he had given to a large scientific convention. In it, he referred to creation and a Creator as he talked about his science. I knew that few, if any, in that audience would have shared his faith. So I said to him with wonder and admiration, \u201cDad, you bore your testimony.\u201d He looked at me with surprise on his face and said, \u201cDid I?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p29\" class=\"\">He had not even known that he was being brave. He simply said what he knew was true. When he bore testimony, even those who rejected it knew it came not by design but because it was part of him. He was what he was, wherever he was.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p30\" class=\"\">That is the mark of every person who is bold and effective in sharing the gospel. They see themselves as children of a loving, living Father in Heaven. And they see themselves as disciples of Jesus Christ. It takes no discipline for them to pray. They do it naturally. It is no special effort to remember the Savior. His love for them and theirs for Him is always with them. That is who they are and how they see themselves and see those around them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/a-child-and-a-disciple.p31\" class=\"\">Now that may seem to us to require a great change, but we can be confident that it will come.
