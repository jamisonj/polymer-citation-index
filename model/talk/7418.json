It is our responsibility to conduct our lives so that we are ever worthy of the priesthood we bear. We live in a time when we are surrounded by much that is intended to entice us into paths which may lead to our destruction. To avoid such paths requires determination and courage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-gift.p9\" class=\"\">Courage counts. This truth came to me in a most vivid and dramatic manner many years ago. I was serving as a bishop at the time. The general session of our stake conference was being held in the Assembly Hall on Temple Square in Salt Lake City. Our stake presidency was to be reorganized. The Aaronic Priesthood, including members of bishoprics, were providing the music for the conference. As we concluded singing our first selection, President Joseph Fielding Smith, our conference visitor, stepped to the pulpit and read for sustaining approval the names of the new stake presidency. He then mentioned that Percy Fetzer, who became our new stake president, and John Burt, who became the first counselor\u2014each of whom had been counselors in the previous presidency\u2014had been made aware of their new callings before the conference began. However, he indicated that I, who had been called to be second counselor in the new presidency, had no previous knowledge of the calling and was hearing of it for the first time as my name was read for sustaining vote. He then announced, \u201cIf Brother Monson is willing to respond to this call, we will be pleased to hear from him now.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-gift.p10\" class=\"\">As I stood at the pulpit and gazed out on that sea of faces, I remembered the song we had just sung. It pertained to the Word of Wisdom and was titled \u201cHave Courage, My Boy, to Say No.\u201d That day I selected as my acceptance theme \u201cHave Courage, My Boy, to Say Yes.\u201d The call for courage comes constantly to each of us\u2014the courage to stand firm for our convictions, the courage to fulfill our responsibilities, the courage to honor our priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-gift.p11\" class=\"\">Wherever we go, our priesthood goes with us.

During the final phases of World War II, I turned 18 and was ordained an elder\u2014one week before I departed for active duty with the navy. A member of my ward bishopric was at the train station to bid me farewell. Just before train time, he placed in my hand a book which I hold before you tonight. Its title: <span class=\"emphasis\">The Missionary\u2019s Hand Book.<\/span> I laughed and commented, \u201cI\u2019ll be in the navy\u2014not on a mission.\u201d He answered, \u201cTake it anyway. It may come in handy.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-gift.p15\" class=\"\">It did. During basic training our company commander instructed us concerning how we might best pack our clothing in a large seabag. He then advised, \u201cIf you have a hard, rectangular object you can place in the bottom of the bag, your clothes will stay more firm.\u201d I thought, \u201cWhere am I going to find a hard, rectangular object?\u201d Suddenly I remembered just the right rectangular object\u2014<span class=\"emphasis\">The Missionary\u2019s Hand Book. <\/span>And thus it served for 12 weeks at the bottom of that seabag.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-gift.p16\" class=\"\">The night preceding our Christmas leave, our thoughts were, as always, on home. The barracks were quiet. Suddenly I became aware that my buddy in the adjoining bunk\u2014a member of the Church, Leland Merrill\u2014was moaning in pain. I asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Merrill?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-gift.p17\" class=\"\">He replied, \u201cI\u2019m sick.

Then, in desperation, he whispered, \u201cMonson, aren\u2019t you an elder?\u201d I acknowledged this to be so, whereupon he pleaded, \u201cGive me a blessing.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-gift.p20\" class=\"\">I became very much aware that I had never given a blessing. I had never received such a blessing; I had never witnessed a blessing being given. My prayer to God was a plea for help. The answer came: \u201cLook in the bottom of the seabag.\u201d Thus, at 2:00 a.m. I emptied on the deck the contents of the bag. I then took to the night-light that hard, rectangular object, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Missionary\u2019s Hand Book,<\/span> and read how one blesses the sick. With about 120 curious sailors looking on, I proceeded with the blessing.

I had received a phone call from Rosa Salas Gifford, whom I did not know. She explained that her parents had been visiting from Costa Rica for a few months and that just a week prior to her call, her father, Bernardo Agusto Salas, had been diagnosed with liver cancer. She indicated that the doctors had informed the family that her father would live just a few more days. Her father\u2019s great desire, she explained, was to meet me before he died. She left her address and asked if I could come to her home in Salt Lake City to visit with her father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-gift.p24\" class=\"\">Because of meetings and obligations, it was rather late when I left my office. Instead of going straight home, however, I felt impressed that I should drive further south and visit Brother Salas that very evening. With the address in hand, I attempted to locate the residence. In rather heavy traffic and with dimming light, I drove past the location where the road to the house should have been. I could see nothing. However, I don\u2019t give up easily. I drove around the block and came back. Still nothing. One more time I tried and still no sign of the road. I began to feel that I would be justified in turning toward home. I had made a gallant effort but had been unsuccessful in finding the address. Instead, I offered a silent prayer for help. The inspiration came that I should approach the area from the opposite direction. I drove a distance and turned the car around so that I was now on the other side of the road. Going in this direction, the traffic was much lighter. As I neared the location once again, I could see, through the faint light, a street sign that had been knocked down\u2014it was lying on its side at the edge of the road\u2014and a nearly invisible, weed-covered track leading to a small apartment building and a single, tiny residence some distance from the main road. As I drove toward the buildings, a small girl in a white dress waved to me, and I knew that I had found the family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-gift.p25\" class=\"\">I was ushered into the home and then to the room where Brother Salas lay. Surrounding the bed were three daughters and a son-in-law, as well as Sister Salas. All but the son-in-law were from Costa Rica. Brother Salas\u2019s appearance reflected the gravity of his condition. A damp rag with frayed edges\u2014not a towel or a washcloth but a damp rag with frayed edges\u2014rested upon his forehead, emphasizing the humble economic circumstances of the family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-gift.p26\" class=\"\">With some prompting, Brother Salas opened his eyes, and a wan smile graced his lips as I took him by the hand. I spoke the words, \u201cI have come to meet you.\u201d Tears welled up in his eyes and in mine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-gift.p27\" class=\"\">I asked if a blessing would be desired, and the unanimous answer from the family members was affirmative. Since the son-in-law did not hold the priesthood, I proceeded by myself to provide a priesthood blessing. The words seemed to flow freely under the direction of the Spirit of the Lord. I included the Savior\u2019s words found in the <span class=\"citation\" id=\"50485\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50485)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50485)\">Doctrine and Covenants, section 84, verse 88<\/a><\/span>: \u201cI will go before your face.

I spoke carefully so they could understand my English. And then, with my limited Spanish language ability, I let them know that I loved them and that our Heavenly Father would bless them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-gift.p28\" class=\"\">I asked for the family Bible and directed their attention to <span class=\"citation\" id=\"50239\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50239)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50239)\">3 John, verse 4<\/a><\/span>: \u201cI have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.\u201d I said to them, \u201cThis is what your husband and father would have you remember as he prepares to depart this earthly existence.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-gift.p29\" class=\"\">With tears streaming down her face, Brother Salas\u2019s sweet wife then asked if I would write down the references for the two scriptures I had shared with them so that the family might read them again. Not having anything handy on which I could write, Sister Salas reached into her purse and drew from it a slip of paper. As I took it from her, I noticed it was a tithing receipt. My heart was touched as I realized that, despite the extremely humble circumstances in which the family lived, they were faithful in paying their tithes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/the-priesthood-a-sacred-gift.p30\" class=\"\">After a tender farewell, I was escorted to my car.
