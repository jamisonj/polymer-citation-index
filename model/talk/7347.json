If we have had conferred upon us the Melchizedek Priesthood, we have been given the keys of the kingdom that carry with them eternal powers.

In revelation the Lord has mandated that this people get all the education they can. He has been very clear about this. But there is a troubling trend taking place. Elder Rolfe Kerr, Commissioner of Church Education, advises me that in the United States nearly 73 percent of young women graduate from high school, compared to 65 percent of young men. Young men are more likely to drop out of school than young women.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/rise-up-o-men-of-god.p36\" class=\"\">Approximately 61 percent of young men enroll in college immediately following high school, compared to 72 percent for young women.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/rise-up-o-men-of-god.p37\" class=\"\">In 1950, 70 percent of those enrolled in college were males, and 30 percent were females; by 2010 projections estimate 40 percent will be males, and 60 percent will be females.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/rise-up-o-men-of-god.p38\" class=\"\">Women have earned more bachelor\u2019s degrees than men every year since 1982 and more master\u2019s degrees since 1986.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/rise-up-o-men-of-god.p39\" class=\"\">It is plainly evident from these statistics that young women are exceeding young men in pursuing educational programs. And so I say to you young men, rise up and discipline yourself to take advantage of educational opportunities. Do you wish to marry a girl whose education has been far superior to your own? We speak of being \u201cequally yoked.\u201d That applies, I think, to the matter of education.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/rise-up-o-men-of-god.p40\" class=\"\">In addition, your education will strengthen your service in the Church.

It easily becomes an addiction of the worst kind. Let me read to you from a letter I received from a victim:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/rise-up-o-men-of-god.p42\" class=\"\">\u201cI would like to share something with you that I have not been able to share with anyone else. I am a 35-year-old male. For most of my adult life I have been addicted to pornography. I am very ashamed to admit this, \u2026 but for the most part, my addiction is as real as that of an alcoholic or a drug addict. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/rise-up-o-men-of-god.p43\" class=\"\">\u201cThe main reason for my writing is to tell you that the Church can\u2019t do enough to counsel the members to avoid pornography. I was first introduced to this material as a child. I was molested by an older male cousin, and pornography was used to attract my interest. I am convinced that this exposure at an early age to sex and pornography is at the root of my addiction today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/rise-up-o-men-of-god.p44\" class=\"\">\u201cI think it is ironic that those who support the business of pornography say that it is a matter of freedom of expression. I have no freedom. I have lost my free agency because I have been unable to overcome this. It is a trap for me, and I can\u2019t seem to get out of it. <span class=\"emphasis\">Please, please, please<\/span> plead with the brethren of the Church not only to avoid but eliminate the sources of pornographic material in their lives. Besides the obvious things like books and magazines, they need to turn off cable movie channels in their homes. I know many who have these services and claim that they are able to screen the bad things out, but this is not true. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/rise-up-o-men-of-god.p45\" class=\"\">\u201cPornography and perversion have become so commonplace in our lives that the sources of this material are everywhere. I have found pornographic magazines by the roadside and in dumps. We need to talk to our children and explain how evil these things are and encourage them to avoid looking at them when they come across them. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/rise-up-o-men-of-god.p46\" class=\"\">\u201cFinally, President Hinckley, please pray for me and others in the Church who may be like me to have the courage and strength to overcome this terrible affliction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/rise-up-o-men-of-god.p47\" class=\"\">\u201cI am unable to sign my name, and I hope that you will understand.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/rise-up-o-men-of-god.p48\" class=\"\">The computer is a wonderful instrument when it is properly used.
