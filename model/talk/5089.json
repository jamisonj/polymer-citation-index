You had your <span class=\"emphasis\">young<\/span> friends around you, and I had my <span class=\"emphasis\">old<\/span> friends around me. There is, however, a vital difference between us\u2014I have had seventy-plus years of experience and learning beyond yours.

There have been many disappointments and heartaches, but <span class=\"emphasis\">always<\/span> opportunities, new horizons, and blessings beyond measure.

Football came to our school later than most. It was 1923. We had neither equipment nor a coach. But the great day arrived when our high school principal was able to buy twelve inexpensive football outfits\u2014but not football shoes with cleats. We used our basketball shoes. Our chemistry teacher was recruited to be our coach because he had once witnessed a <span class=\"emphasis\">real<\/span> game.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/a-time-for-preparation.p8\" class=\"\">He taught us a few simple plays and how to tackle, and then we were ready to play\u2014or so we thought.

Their school band started to play (they had more students in the band than we had in our entire high school)\u2014and then through the gates came their team. They kept coming and coming\u2014all thirty-nine of them\u2014fully equipped, and shoes with cleats. The twelve of us\u2014a full team of eleven plus one all-round substitute, watched in amazement.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/a-time-for-preparation.p10\" class=\"\">The game was most interesting! To say it was a learning experience is rather mild. After just two plays, we had no desire to have the ball\u2014so we kicked it, and they scored. Whenever they got the ball, they would run a baffling play and score. Our goal was to get rid of the ball\u2014it was less punishing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/a-time-for-preparation.p11\" class=\"\">In the final minutes of the game they became a little reckless and a wild pass fell into the arms of Clifford Lee, who was playing halfback with me. He was startled, not knowing for sure what to do\u2014that is, until he saw them thundering after him. Then he knew what to do and boy, was he fast! But he wasn\u2019t running for points, he was running for his life! Clifford made a touchdown; six points went up on the scoreboard. The final score\u2014106 to 6! We really didn\u2019t deserve the six points, but with our bloody shirts and socks, and cuts and bruises\u2014we took them anyway.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/a-time-for-preparation.p12\" class=\"\">A learning experience?
