As I have reread the account of the Savior\u2019s resurrection, I have been impressed that the Savior\u2019s first words as a resurrected being provide the foundation for our relationships with others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p4\" class=\"\">You will recall that early in the morning of the first day of the week, Mary had gone to the sepulchre where they had placed the Lord\u2019s body. Finding the stone that sealed the tomb removed, she ran and told Peter and John that the Lord\u2019s body had been taken. Peter and John hurried to the tomb to confirm this report. When they saw the empty tomb, they returned to their homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p5\" class=\"\">But Mary Magdalene \u201cstood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre.\u201d There she saw two angels in white, who asked her, \u201cWhy weepest thou?\u201d And she replied, \u201cBecause they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p6\" class=\"\">Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus, but she did not recognize him. The Savior also asked why she was weeping. Mary said, thinking she was talking to the gardener, \u201cSir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29100\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29100)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29100)\">John 20:11\u201315<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p7\" class=\"\">The Savior then called her by name, as he also could each of us, and she immediately recognized him.

We are sons and daughters of God. Our Heavenly Father is in a very real sense the actual Father of our spirits, which gives literal significance to the phrase \u201cOur Heavenly Father.\u201d It follows that we are all brothers and sisters regardless of race, creed, or nationality. There is a spark of divinity in each of us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p13\" class=\"\">How should this truth affect our relationships with others?

We must love one another and unselfishly share our gifts, talents, and resources. It is little wonder that, when asked by the Pharisee, a lawyer by profession, \u201cMaster, which is the great commandment in the law?\u201d the Savior answered: \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cThis is the first and great commandment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cOn these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36779\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36779)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36779)\">Matt. 22:36\u201340<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p18\" class=\"\">And again, in the closing moments of his life he made this glorious pronouncement:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cA new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cBy this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29088\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29088)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29088)\">John 13:34\u201335<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p21\" class=\"\">William Shakespeare once said, \u201cThey do not love that do not show their love.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Two Gentlemen of Verona,<\/span> act 1, sc. 2, line 31.) We need to show our love, beginning in the home and then widening our circle of love to encompass our ward members, our less active and nonmember neighbors, and also those who have passed beyond the veil.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p22\" class=\"\">To leaders in the Church, to every member, may I ask you to reach out as never before and extend the hand of fellowship to our brothers and sisters who need the light of the gospel. I am persuaded that much of our love is confined to mere lip service and dreams of good deeds accomplished, but true love must be expressed in unselfish acts of kindness that bring others closer to our Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p23\" class=\"\">How often I think of the great example of Peter and John as they approached the temple at the hour of prayer. A certain man, lame from his birth, was laid at the gate called Beautiful to ask alms of those who entered. When he saw Peter and John approaching, he extended his hand for their contribution. Peter said to him, \u201cLook on us.\u201d He immediately gave heed, expecting to receive something of them. \u201cThen Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p24\" class=\"\">I believe this is as far as we have gone, in most cases, in helping our fellowmen in today\u2019s world. However, Peter did not stop with mere words. The scripture records that he then \u201ctook him by the right hand, and lifted him up,\u201d and immediately the man\u2019s feet and ankles received strength and he stood, walked, leaped, and entered the temple praising God.

Their family has always been active in the Church, trying their best to live the commandments. They were shocked and disappointed, however, when their daughter became engaged to a nonmember. The next day the mother was telling a good friend about her feelings. She knew her daughter\u2019s fiancee was a fine young man, but she felt angry, hurt, betrayed, and numb and did not want to give her daughter a wedding or even see her. She said that the Lord must have guided her to talk to her friend because she received this reply:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cWhat kind of a mother are you that you only love her when she does what you want her to do? That is selfish, self-centered, qualified love. It\u2019s easy to love our children when they are good; but when they make mistakes, they need our love even more. We should love and care for them no matter what they do. It doesn\u2019t mean we condone or approve of the errors, but we help, not condemn; love, not hate; forgive, not judge. We build them up rather than tear them down; we lead them, not desert them. We love when they are the most unlovable, and if you can\u2019t or won\u2019t do that, you are a poor mother.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/reach-out-to-our-fathers-children.p28\" class=\"\">With tears streaming down her face, the mother asked her friend how she could ever thank her.
