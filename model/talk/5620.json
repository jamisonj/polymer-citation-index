I don\u2019t think that even my mother ever dreamed that her son would sit in these chairs. As I explained last night in general priesthood meeting, my long association with President Gordon B. Hinckley has blessed me over most of my adult life. As you know, he is a man of remarkable gifts and talents. All these long years he has been teaching, guiding, and blessing all of us. Over the years we have seen him grow in strength as the Lord has time and time again called and magnified him. He has had increasingly burdensome responsibilities in many callings, including as a counselor to three Presidents of the Church. He has magnified each calling he has received with great inspiration, intelligence, and energy in a remarkable way. His ministry has blessed the work of God throughout the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/heirs-to-the-kingdom-of-god.p5\" class=\"\">I also feel privileged to have worked so closely with President Thomas S. Monson ever since he was the newest Apostle. President Monson has been blessed with a great mind and capacity. He has always been an outstanding leader as a boy and a man.

His outgoing and caring heart has blessed the people of this church tremendously over the many years of his ministry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/heirs-to-the-kingdom-of-god.p6\" class=\"\">Today I would like to speak to the members of the Church worldwide. I hope we can all overcome any differences of culture, race, and language. Since the early days of the Church, the General Authorities and missionaries have traveled over much of the earth to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ, as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and to establish the Church with keys and authority in many lands. An impressive and enjoyable part of our ministry has been to worship with the wonderful people of many cultures and ethnic groups. It has been soul satisfying to feel of their spiritual strength and their love and to love them in return.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/heirs-to-the-kingdom-of-god.p7\" class=\"\">Now the curtains are opening up to more and more of the nonindustrialized nations. In some of these countries a large percentage of the population is poor. Many of them have much less opportunity than others to acquire the comforts of life and even some of the necessities. We have seen men and women working to exhaustion from sunrise to sundown for a pittance. Yet their ready smiles and cheerful countenances indicated that they had found some happiness with their lot in life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/heirs-to-the-kingdom-of-god.p8\" class=\"\">Some might say, \u201cWhere is the justice in the fact that some of God\u2019s children have so much of health and this world\u2019s goods and others so very little?\u201d So many of those who have in abundance seem unappreciative of what they have. But we have also seen the generosity of members of this church who have great concern for those worldwide who lack the necessities of life. They generously contribute to help the poor in many countries, even though we have no members there.
