When I arrived at the hotel in Atlanta, I opened the package of magazines. I found that my secretary, for no accountable reason, had put in the package two extra copies of the June issue, an issue that featured temple marriage. I left the two copies in the hotel room and, as planned, distributed the other copies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/three-goals-to-guide-you.p39\" class=\"\">On the final day of meetings, I had no desire to attend the scheduled luncheon but felt compelled to return to my room. The telephone was ringing as I entered. The caller was a member of the Church who had heard I was in Atlanta. She introduced herself and asked if I could provide a blessing for her 10-year-old daughter. I agreed readily, and she indicated that she and her husband, their daughter, and their son would come immediately to my hotel room. As I waited, I prayed for help. The applause of the convention was replaced by the feelings of peace which accompanied prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/three-goals-to-guide-you.p40\" class=\"\">Then came the knock at the door and the privilege which was mine to meet a choice family. The 10-year-old daughter walked with the aid of crutches. Cancer had required the amputation of her left leg; however, her countenance was radiant, her trust in God unwavering. A blessing was provided. Mother and son knelt by the side of the bed while the father and I placed our hands on the tiny daughter. We were directed by the Spirit of God. We were humbled by its power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/three-goals-to-guide-you.p41\" class=\"\">I felt the tears course down my cheeks and tumble upon my hands as they rested on the head of that beautiful child of God. I spoke of eternal ordinances and family exaltation. The Lord prompted me to urge this family to enter the holy temple of God. At the conclusion of the blessing, I learned that such a temple visit was planned. Questions pertaining to the temple were asked. I heard no heavenly voice, nor did I see a vision. Yet there came clearly into my mind the words, \u201cRefer to the <span class=\"emphasis\">New Era.<\/span>\u201d I looked toward the dresser, and there were the two extra copies of the temple issue of the <span class=\"emphasis\">New Era.<\/span> One copy was given to the daughter and the other to her parents.

Sometimes, of course, more is needed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/three-goals-to-guide-you.p48\" class=\"\">I learned recently of loving service given to a mother when her children were very young.

I\u2019m going to take them to my house for a couple of hours while you take a nap.\u201d Said this grateful mother: \u201cI was so thankful for her welcome offer, it wasn\u2019t until this had happened many times that I realized if she had seen my lights on in the middle of the night, she was up with one of her children as well and needed a nap just as much as I did. She taught me a great lesson, and I\u2019ve since tried to be as observant as she was in looking for opportunities to serve others.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/three-goals-to-guide-you.p49\" class=\"\">Countless are the acts of service provided by the vast army of Relief Society visiting teachers. A few years ago I heard of two of them who aided a grieving widow, Angela, the granddaughter of a cousin of mine. Angela\u2019s husband and a friend of his had gone snowmobiling and had become victims of suffocation through a snowslide. Each of them left a pregnant wife\u2014in Angela\u2019s case, their first child, and in the other case, a wife not only expecting a child but also the mother of a toddler. In the funeral held for Angela\u2019s husband, the bishop reported that upon hearing of the tragic accident, he had gone immediately to Angela\u2019s home. Almost as soon as he arrived, the doorbell sounded. The door was opened, and there stood Angela\u2019s two visiting teachers. The bishop said he watched as they so sincerely expressed to Angela their love and compassion. The three women cried together, and it was apparent that these two fine visiting teachers cared deeply about Angela. As perhaps only women can, they gently indicated\u2014without being asked\u2014exactly what help they would be providing. That they would be close by as long as Angela needed them was obvious. The bishop expressed his deep gratitude in knowing they would be a real source of comfort to her in the days ahead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/three-goals-to-guide-you.p50\" class=\"\">Such acts of love and compassion are repeated again and again by the wonderful visiting teachers of this Church\u2014not always in such dramatic situations but just as genuinely, nevertheless.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/three-goals-to-guide-you.p51\" class=\"\">I extol you who, with loving care and compassionate concern, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and house the homeless.
