When Paul wrote those words, he was a prisoner under\nNero. Two charges were pressed against him: one, that he had conspired, so it was alleged by\nNero's partisans, to set fire to Rome; second, he was accused of introducing a novel and\nunlawful religion. That was Paul's second imprisonment. Many of his friends had left him.\nDemas, who had been in the Church, had forsaken him and gone home\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5134\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5134)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5134)\">2 Tim. 4:10<\/a><\/span>). Alexander, the\ncoppersmith, an apostate, had testified against him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5138\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5138)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5138)\">2 Tim. 4:14<\/a><\/span>); but Luke remained by his side\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5135\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5135)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5135)\">2 Tim. 4:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nEvidently Peter, Paul, and other leaders of the Church were troubled in their\nday by apostate groups even as leaders today are troubled by apostates who usurp authority,\nmisinterpret scripture, and preach false doctrine. In the spirit of charity perhaps we should say,\ntroubled by apostates who are mentally ill.\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems that every age in the world has been afflicted with just such apostates and such\nperverted truth, and with incorrigible youth, degenerate groups, who make every age seem\nworse than those which preceded it. For example, listen to this: \"The world is passing through\ntroublous times. Young people of today think of nothing but themselves. They have no\nreverence for parents or old age. They are impatient of all restraint. They talk as if they alone\nknow everything. As for girls, they are forward, immodest, and unwomanly in speech,\nbehavior, and dress.\" No, that was not for today&mdash;that was written in 1274 A.D.&mdash;685 years\nago!\n<\/p><p>\nHere is another: \"President Frederick C. Perry of Hamilton College, expressing distrust of\ngloomsters who view the world with alarm, has cited these writings taken from an Assyrian\ntablet dated 2800 B.C. as proof that political prophecy for a dismal future has always been\nprevalent: \n<\/p><p>\n\"'The earth is degenerating in these latter days. There are signs that the world is speedily\ncoming to an end. Bribery and corruption abound. The children no longer obey their parents.\nEvery man wants to write a book, and it is evident that the end of the world is speedily\napproaching.'\" That was written 2800 B.C.!\n<\/p><p>\nWell, the era through which we are passing is no exception. On the flyleaf of the book,\n<i>The Naked Communist<\/i>, by W. Cleon Skousen, we find this quotation, (and I admonish everybody\nto read that excellent book of Chief Skousen's): \n<\/p><p>\n\"The conflict between communism and freedom is the problem of our time. It overshadows\nall other problems. This conflict mirrors our age, its toils, its tensions, its troubles, and its\ntasks. On the outcome of this conflict depends the future of mankind.\"\n<\/p><p>\nElaborating that statement, I should say that the most urgent problem of our day is a spiritual\nproblem. I agree with one leading educator who said, and I quote: \"Unless the spiritual\nproblem is solved, civilization will fail; indeed we already have a foretaste of that failure in\nmany parts of the world: \n<\/p><p>\n\"The Nazi creed presents a new conception of civilization. It is the supposition, advanced with\nfanatical zeal, that civilization consists primarily in material achievements, and can reach its\ngoal without ethical considerations. It accents power, authority, and obedience, denies human\nequality and the worth of the individual.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<i>The False Teachings of Communism<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nIn their false teachings the Communists accept the doctrine of Marx, who denies the existence\nof God, and repudiates man's immortality. Second, they deny the divinity of Jesus Christ, and\nof course, his resurrection. They challenge the free agency of man.\n<\/p><p>\nIn that first sentence that I read from Paul to Timothy, Paul declares the existence of God,\nand we shall see how authoritatively he supports that. He declares <i>the divinity of Jesus Christ,<\/i>\nand the <i>reality of his resurrection<\/i>. I read again what he said to Timothy, and this is almost his\nfarewell message to that boy, \"I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ,\nwho shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5129\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5129)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5129)\">2 Tim. 4:1<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nThe United States recently entertained the leading man of the ideology that denies the God,\nJesus Christ, and the right of free agency and dignity of man. Even while he was here we\ncould hear echoing his own words: \n\"We remain the atheist that we have always been; we are doing as much as we can to liberate\nthose people who are still under the spell of this religious opiate.\"  Those are his words.  He\nsaid further:  \"Those who expect us to abandon communism will have to wait until a shrimp\nlearns to whistle.\"\n<\/p><p>\nA number of years ago, Lord Balfour, Prime Minister of Great Britain, delivered a lecture in\nthe McEwen Hall of the University of Edinburgh on the subject, \"The Moral Values Which\nUnite the Nations.\" In an interesting and convincing manner, Lord Balfour presented the\nfollowing fundamental ties that unite the different nations of the world: \n<\/p><p>\n     1. Common Knowledge.<br \/>\n     2. Common Commercial Interest.<br \/>\n     3. The Intercourse of Diplomatic Relationship.<br \/>\n     4. The Bonds of Human Friendship.\n<\/p><p>\nThe audience greeted his masterful address with a great outburst of applause. As the presiding\nofficer arose to express his appreciation and that of the audience, a Japanese student, who was\ndoing graduate work at the University of Edinburgh stood up, and leaning over the balcony,\nsaid, \"But, Mr. Balfour, what about Jesus Christ?\"\n<\/p><p>\nMr. Robert E. Spear, to whom Professor Lang related this incident, writes: \"One could have\nheard a pin drop in the hall. Everyone felt at once the justice of the rebuke. The leading\nstatesman of the greatest Christian empire in the world had been dealing with the different ties\nthat are to unite mankind, and had omitted the one fundamental and essential bond. And\neveryone felt, too, the dramatic element in the situation&mdash;that the reminder of his forgetfulness\nhad come from a faraway non-Christian land.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Preach the word,\" Paul admonishes Timothy. What \"word\"? That \". . . Jesus Christ, who hath\nabolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5127\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5127)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5127)\">2 Tim. 1:10<\/a><\/span>).\nThose words were named in that letter. Let us consider that.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold the man,\" said Pontius Pilate, Roman governor of Judea, as Jesus, mockingly\nbedecked with a purple robe, his hair plaited with a crown of thorns, stood before the mob\nwho cried, \"Crucify him; crucify him!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27879\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27879)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27879)\">John 19:5-6<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nAs on the occasion of that historic trial, so through the ages men have beheld Christ from\ndifferent viewpoints. Some who reject him as venomously as did the rabble, see in him and in\nhis disciples \"investors of a Christian moral system that has undermined and sapped the vigor\nof the European world.\" Others with clearer insight, begotten by experience, behold him as\nthe originator of a system that \"promotes industry, honesty, truth, purity, and kindness, a\nsystem that upholds law, favors liberty; is essential to it, and would unite men in one great\nbrotherhood.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOthers behold him as the \"one perfect character&mdash;the peerless personality of history,\" but\ndeny his divinity. Millions accept him as the Great Teacher, whose teachings, however, are\nnot applicable to modern social conditions. A few&mdash;O how few!&mdash;of the approximately two\nbillion inhabitants of the globe, accept him for what he really is&mdash;\"the Only Begotten of the\nFather; who came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13762\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13762)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13762)\">D&amp;C 76:41<\/a><\/span>), and to bear the\nsins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness.\"\n<\/p><p>\nToday civilized nations are sitting on a mountain of explosives, accumulated in defiance of\nChrist's teachings. Let the heat of hatred, suspicion, and greed become a little more intense,\nand there will be such an international explosion as will greatly retard, if not forcibly drive\nfrom the midst of mankind, the hoped-for peace heralded by the heavenly hosts when Christ\nas a babe was born in Bethlehem.\n<\/p><p>\nProve it as a fact, and it is, that Christ did appear after death as a glorified resurrected Being,\nand you have the answer to the question of the ages: \"If a man die, shall he live again?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26690\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26690)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26690)\">Job 14:14<\/a><\/span>) Let\nus look at the deep significance of the testimony of the disciples of Jesus, which may be\nbetter understood when we realize that with Jesus' death the apostles were stricken with\ngloom. When he was crucified, their hopes all but died. That his death was a reality to the\ndisciples is shown in their intense grief, in the statement of Thomas, in the moral perplexity\nof Peter, and in the evident preparations for a permanent burial of their Master.\nNotwithstanding the assurance of Christ, often repeated during the two and a half years he\nwas with them, that he would return to them after death, the apostles seemed not to have\naccepted, or at least not comprehended the statement as a literal fact.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat was it, we ask the world, that suddenly changed these disciples to confident, fearless,\nheroic preachers of the gospel of Jesus Christ? It was a revelation that Christ had risen from\nthe grave his promises had been kept, his Messianic mission fulfilled. \"The final and absolute\nseal of genuineness had been put on all his claims, and the indelible stamp of\na divine authority upon all his teachings. The gloom of death had been banished by the\nglorious light of the presence of the risen, glorified Lord and Savior.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOn the evidence of these unprejudiced, unexpected, incredulous witnesses the resurrection has\nits impregnable foundation. There was one young man among them. I do not know whether\nwe know about his life, but I like to think of him as a sort of independent thinker, not paying\nmuch attention to his mother's religion&mdash;his mother had joined the Christian Church\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7849\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7849)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7849)\">Acts 12:12<\/a><\/span>), but he\ndid not pay much attention to it until he was disturbed one night by his mother's voice asking\nhim to rise quickly, \"don't stop to dress, throw a cloak around your body and rush to\nGethsemane and tell Jesus that Judas and soldiers are coming to arrest him.\" I think that\nyoung man who fled naked from the men who snatched the sheet from his body\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33113\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33113)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33113)\">Mark 14:51-52<\/a><\/span>), was John\nMark, the author of one of the four Gospels. We know he did join the Church, later, and that\nhe labored with Peter. We know that Paul, in that letter to Timothy, said: \"Bring Mark with\nyou. He is profitable to our ministry, and let us hear his testimony\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5136\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5136)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5136)\">2 Tim. 4:11<\/a><\/span>).\nWe know he went on a mission to the northern part of Africa, and you travelers today can\nwalk over ruins built to his memory.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Testimony of Mark<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nWe have no evidence that Mark joined the Church while the Savior was on the earth.\nUndoubtedly the Savior was in Mark's home. At any rate we are justified in assuming that he\nwas acquainted with the Master. Mark does not himself recount any appearance of the Risen\nLord, but he testifies that the Lord would meet his disciples. From Mark we hear the glorious\nproclamation of the first empty tomb in all the world. For the first time in history the words\n\"Here lies\" were supplanted by the divine message, \"He is risen\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33115\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33115)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33115)\">Mark 16:6<\/a><\/span>). No one can doubt that Mark\nwas not convinced in his soul of the reality of the empty tomb, and if my inference is right,\nhe knew about the trial, the humiliation to which Jesus was subjected, and the crucifixion, and\nhe became a minister of the gospel. To the proclaiming of this truth he devoted his life, and if\ntradition can be relied upon, he sealed his testimony with his blood.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Testimony of Luke<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nThe text we read said that Luke stood by Paul's side at the jail\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5137\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5137)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5137)\">2 Tim. 4:11<\/a><\/span>). It was not long after that\nbefore Paul, according to tradition, was beheaded. Luke was a physician. He spent many years\nof his life studying about this man, Jesus, who was crucified. He experienced the darkness\nthat spread over that country when Jesus was crucified. According to all trustworthy testimony\nwe have the gospel of Luke as it came from his own hand. In chapter 24 Luke testifies to the\ndivine message: \"Why seek ye the living among the dead?\n<\/p><p>\n\"He is not here, but is risen\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31512\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31512)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31512)\">Luke 24:5-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWith equal assurance as to their accuracy we can accept his statement and witness in regard to\nPeter's and Paul's and other apostles' testimony regarding the resurrection. \"To whom also he\n[Christ] shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them\nforty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7834\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7834)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7834)\">Acts 1:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWho can doubt Luke's absolute confidence in the reality of the risen Redeemer? Contrast his\ntestimony, his life, with that of upstarts who deny the existence of God and laugh at the claims\nof Jesus Christ as the Redeemer.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is true that neither Mark nor Luke testify as to having personally seen the Risen Lord, and\ntherefore some urge that their recorded testimonies cannot be taken as firsthand evidence.\nThat they do not so testify, and yet were convinced that others did see him, shows how\nincontrovertible was the evidence among the apostles and other disciples that the resurrection\nwas a reality.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Testimony of Paul<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nFortunately, however, there is a document which does give the personal testimony of an\neyewitness, a witness to an appearance of Jesus after his death and burial. This personal\ntestimony also corroborates the testimony not only of these two men, Mark and Luke, but of\nothers also. I have in mind Saul, a Jew of Tarsus, educated at the feet of\nGamaliel, a strict Pharisee, and before his conversion a bitter persecutor of all who believed\nin Jesus of Nazareth. And there is a quotation from the oldest authentic document in existence\nrelating or testifying to the resurrection of Christ, in which we find Saul's (Paul's) words,\nsent back to people who had joined the Church, whom he loved and who loved him, saying: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our\nsins according to the scriptures;<br \/>\n\"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: <br \/>\n\"And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:<br \/>\n\"After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part\nremain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.<br \/>\n\"After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.<br \/>\n\"And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.<br \/>\n\"For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I\npersecuted the church of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"313\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 313)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(313)\">1 Cor. 15:3-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Testimony of Modern Revelation<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nIn addition to the ancient apostles, we have the testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith who\ngives in an unequivocal description the following stirring testimony in relation to his first\nvision: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages . . . standing above me in the air.\nOne of them spake unto me, calling me by name, and said, pointing to the other&mdash;This is My\nBeloved Son. Hear Him!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30392\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30392)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30392)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>). These words were spoken nearly\ntwo thousand years after the events to which I have already called your attention!\n<\/p><p>\n<i>The Latter-day Saint Belief<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nThus, my dear fellow workers and my friends in the world, the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints stands with Peter with Paul, with James, and with all the other apostles in\naccepting the resurrection, not only as being literally true, but also as the consummation of\nChrist's divine mission on earth. Other great religious leaders among the nations of the world\nsince history began have taught virtue, temperance, self-control, service, obedience to\nrighteousness and duty; some have taught a belief in one supreme ruler and in a hereafter; but\nonly Christ broke the seal of the grave and revealed death as the door to immortality and\neternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nIf Christ lived after death, so shall men, each one taking his place in the next world for which\nhe is best fitted. Since love is as eternal as life, the message of the resurrection is the most\ncomforting, the most glorifying ever given to man; for when death takes a loved one from us,\nwe can look with assurance into the open grave and say, \"He is not here; he will rise again\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34992\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34992)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34992)\">Matt. 28:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMy dear fellow workers, it is just as easy for me to accept as a divine truth the fact that\nChrist preached to the spirits in prison while his body lay in the tomb as it is for me to look\nat you from this pulpit. It is true! It is just as easy for me to realize and note this&mdash;that one\nmay so live that he may receive impressions and direct messages through divine inspiration.\nThe veil is thin between those who hold the priesthood and divine messengers on the other\nside of the veil.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us say today as Paul wrote to Timothy: \"Preach the word . . . do the work of an\nevangelist, make full proof of thy ministry\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5131\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5131)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5131)\">2 Tim. 4:2,5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . The Lord is God, and beside him there is no Savior.<br \/>\n\"Great is his wisdom, marvelous are his ways, and the extent of his doings none can find out.<br \/>\n\"His purposes fail not, neither are there any who can stay his hand.<br \/>\n\"From eternity to eternity he is the same, and his years never fail.<br \/>\n\"For thus saith the Lord&mdash;I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and\ndelight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.<br \/>\n\"Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13760\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13760)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13760)\">D&amp;C 76:1-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us in this age so threatened with an ideology of benighted people of disbelief in\nGod our Father and in his Son Jesus Christ and in the restored gospel through those divine\nPersonages, to preach the Word and to be true to our callings no matter what\nor where they may be, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
