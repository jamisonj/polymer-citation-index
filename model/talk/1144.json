I believe there\nare a few lines which would sum up very beautifully the truths that have been spoken from\nthis pulpit.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a simple prayer, and as far as I am concerned, the author is anonymous. \"O God, our\nFather, always keep us thankful, and never let us forget the source of all our blessings and our\ngreat privilege to share them with others.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI am so grateful for those words because I feel they sum up beautifully the things which have\nbeen given in these marvelous sessions from those who have preceded me. The opening\nremarks of President McKay, saluting youth, commending them for their courage and\nfortitude in seeking to know the truth and to follow it, were most inspirational, as has been\neach of the brethren, to Brother Romney who has just preceded me with his beautiful\ntestimony of the divinity of Jesus Christ. There is one, I should like to say at this point,\nwhom I have missed, and I am sure I voice the thoughts of thousands who have been and are\nhere; the voice and the words of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. God bless you, President\nClark.\n<\/p><p>\nBecause of this sharing, there was an assignment that came to Sister Longden and me last\nNovember&mdash;it came earlier than that but because of the conditions and circumstances over\nwhich we had no control, we were not able to start our journey until the fourth of November\n1960.\n<\/p><p>\nWe left Salt Lake City with President and Sister Kendall W. Young, who were to be installed\nin the French Polynesian (or Tahitian) Mission, and with us were their four little\nchildren&mdash;the oldest not yet seven. You talk about faith&mdash;here it is exemplified&mdash;these people willing\nto leave the comforts of home and the pursuits here of their daily labors to go out and serve\nthe Lord in those beautiful but faraway islands of the South Pacific.\n<\/p><p>\nWe arrived in Papeete, Tahiti, after twenty-seven hours. The final journey from Honolulu to\nPapeete took ten hours and fifteen minutes which is quite a long time to be in the air. But we\nwere blessed. We arrived there Saturday morning. On Sunday, the next day,\nPresident Young was installed as the new mission president. President Joseph R. Reeder was\nreleased as president of the French Polynesian Mission. In a few days President and Sister\nReeder, their son and daughter and a young elder, Ralph Anderson from Brigham City, Utah,\nwho was in the Tahitian Mission presidency, started for Rarotonga on the Church ship,\n<i>Paraita<\/i>, so named after Addison Pratt, one of the first missionaries to labor in the South\nPacific isles as early as 1844. That will give you an idea of how our \"sharing\" was taking\nplace even in those early days.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Reeder was installed the following Sunday as President of the Rarotonga Mission.\nWe had eighty-one percent attendance in our meeting that day. That is something for you\nstake presidents here in the States to shoot at&mdash;eighty-one percent of the total membership of\nthe Church on the Island of Rarotonga&mdash;as we created a new mission in the Cook Islands\nwith headquarters in Rarotonga.\n<\/p><p>\nThe missionaries in Rarotonga as well as those in Tahiti, Tonga, Samoa, Australia, and New\nZealand, are dedicated young men, giving their all in sharing the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nI shall always remember one missionary who wished to stay several months longer after\ncompleting his full term in the mission field, but he sensed that finances might be running\nshort at home so he wrote to his mother, who is a widow, asking her advice. While we were\nin Tahiti he received a letter from her stating, \"If necessary, I'll scrub floors in order to keep\nyou in the mission field your full time and longer.\" Faith, sharing with others!\n<\/p><p>\nThe missionary activity in these two missions, the increasing baptisms, the stepped-up interest\nof investigators is most heartwarming. I believe our members there are fully converted to the\ntruth and know why they are being baptized. There is a lovely missionary endeavor which\ntakes place every three weeks as each Matson liner comes into Papeete. The French and the\nTahitian branches, combined, furnish a forty-five-minute program for all the tourists on board\nship, and there is usually a full complement of passengers. The program consists of classical\nas well as native music sung by a chorus of beautiful young Tahitian members led by one of\nthe missionaries. There are also some impressive native dances by young and old, and you\nwould thrill at the music&mdash;the choruses, the individual numbers. We were told by the\ncaptains of both ships on which we witnessed the show that this was always the favorite\nentertainment of their passengers.\n<\/p><p>\nOur journey then took us to Suva, Fiji, and to Nuku'alofa, Tonga, where we met with\nPresident M. Vernon Coombs and Sister Coombs. They have been in the mission field in\nTonga on and off since 1911. The people love them, and they love the Tongan Saints.\nPresident Coombs had arranged an interview with Crown Prince Tungi, who was very grateful\nfor the courtesy and hospitality extended to him by President McKay on a visit here a few\nyears ago. Perhaps one of the most thrilling, humbling moments of our lives was as we arrived\nat the Church college in Nuku'alofa. The Saints were all dressed in pure white, mostly sitting\non the floor to make more room. As we arrived they stood and sang like angels, \"We Thank\nThee O God For a Prophet.\" Right then I had the privilege of telling them I knew they were\nsinging their thanks for our prophet, David O. McKay, and I would convey their love and\ngreeting to him.\n<\/p><p>\nI shall never forget the 1,400 Saints assembled at a music and dance festival presented by\nseveral branches of the Tongan Mission. This time we saw the great MIA program in action. I\nam ready for any stake president now, or anyone in the Mutual organization who says, \"It\nwon't work in our stake.\" We saw it work. We saw this marvelous program in\naction&mdash;dancing, singing, the drama, speech. Also we met with Tongan Master M-Men and Golden\nGleaners.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, sharing the gospel is a happy experience&mdash;more so when we see the gospel principles\napplied in the daily lives of others. I am grateful for the faith of the missionaries in the South\nPacific and, though we are limited in number in some of these missions, the\nmission presidents are meeting this challenge through the development of; young Tahitians,\nTongans, and Samoans who are qualified and worthy, who already know the language. These\nyoung people are called as missionaries to serve with the missionaries from the States. That is\ndoubling our number of missionaries, and great good is being accomplished.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom Tonga we moved on to Samoa, where a fine work is being accomplished. Here we saw\nmuch of another phase of activity in the Church&mdash;the labor missionary program. It was my\nprivilege to hold a special meeting with seventy-seven of them, and then as the Apia Chapel\nwas dedicated with 526 in attendance, to see and hear a chorus of fifty young labor\nmissionaries dressed in white shirts and trousers with black bow ties, singing under the\ndirection of Sister Barker, whose husband is the principal of the Church school at Pesega.\nThey sang with so much meaning, and they sang not only in Samoan, but they had learned\nalso the English interpretation. The building program is going forward in Samoa, as will the\nproselyting and school programs.\n<\/p><p>\nLast year in Samoa there were 2,393 baptisms. That is about an average of forty for every\nmissionary. I am sure that will make President Moyle happy. We talk about \"sharing the\ngospel.\" They have been doing that down there. Three years ago there was one entire village\nof forty-five converted because of the activity of our missionaries. When we held a service\nthere, three years later, there were 150 in attendance in that little village.\n<\/p><p>\nThey have many ideas that they are putting into effect in order to bring to these wonderful\npeople of the South Pacific the Pearl of Great Price. I cannot say too much for the work that\nhas and is being done by President Charles I. Sampson and his most dedicated counselors,\nPresident Rivers and President Harrington. President Harrington, a stalwart young man\ngraduated from Stanford University, a Samoan, his parents living in Honolulu, will soon be\nwinding up his two and a half years in the mission field&mdash;a tower of spiritual strength to his\npeople.\n<\/p><p>\nWe were so pleased to see the schools as well as the churches teaching people to develop and\nutilize the talents with which God has blessed them! Yes, we are truly sharing the gospel of\nJesus Christ with these wonderful people of the South Pacific.\n<\/p><p>\nOur journey was extended to include those great countries of Australia and New Zealand. We\nhad the opportunity of touring the Southern Australian Mission and the Australian Mission.\nWhen you travel from Melbourne, which is the headquarters of the Southern Australian\nMission, and go around to Perth, it is like traveling from Salt Lake City to New York. And in\nthe other direction, when you leave Sydney, of the Australian Mission, going north to Cairns,\nit is a similar distance. At the time we left, a new area was being opened, as Brother [Spencer\nW.] Kimball had encouraged them to do, in Darwin and Port Moresby and Thursday Island in\nNew Guinea. This was after a survey had been made at the time of the visit of Brother\nKimball.\n<\/p><p>\nChristmas Eve we were in the railroad yards at Perth&mdash;106 degrees, and we saw a little\ntrain&mdash;not the luxury and the comforts and conveniences to which we are accustomed in this\nnation. Twenty-five of our members, including one little family of seven, mother and father\nand five children were leaving for New Zealand to go to the temple to be sealed to one\nanother. I called Sister Longden's attention to the little canvas bag on the back of the railroad\ncar, and in that bag was the culinary water which was to sustain them until they were able to\nrefill it. Faith! Because they had received that witness Brother Romney has just spoken of I\nThey had that evidence in their souls. The light of the gospel of Jesus Christ had penetrated\nthe darkness, and they felt the spirit of urgency to go to a temple of the Lord. They were\nwilling to sell all their possessions. It would take some three weeks for their journey,\nchanging to four different trains going through Australia, and then in Sydney they would\nboard a ship which would take them to Auckland. They would then travel\nanother eighty miles to the temple site. They knew they were doing the will of the Lord. We\nshall never forget the look of hallowed, excited expectation on the faces of each of those dear\nSaints.\n<\/p><p>\nWe truly saw the gospel of Jesus Christ in action. President Moyle used the word this\nmorning&mdash;applying&mdash;application. We hear, we read, we have an opportunity to believe, and\nthen we must apply these truths in order to reap the blessings. I am so thankful that our\njourney was extended to Australia and New Zealand, that we came to know these wonderful\npeople. I held three stake conferences in Australia, in Melbourne, in Sydney, and Brisbane\nand was privileged to see the faith of the people there and the attendance at our meetings and\nto hear some faith-promoting stories and witness them.\n<\/p><p>\nI could mention other similar experiences. Sixty-nine Tongan Saints, when we were in Suva,\nwere just returning from the temple, happy and at peace because they had realized lifelong\ndreams. Another thirty-eight disembarked from a huge plane in Auckland three days before\nwe left for home. We met them in Auckland at the airport. Nine couples, nine fathers and\nmothers and twenty children were going to the temple to have that eternal union. God bless\nthem.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter spending ten days each in the New Zealand South and New Zealand missions, we held\nthree stake conferences in New Zealand: Hawkes Bay, Hamilton, and in Auckland. I am\ngrateful for the memories I have of these experiences. The attendance was excellent in all\nstakes. Fifty-three percent were present at our meetings in Auckland, even though the\nAuckland Stake had been divided two and a half months before when Brother Kimball was\nthere creating a new stake, Hamilton, leaving only part of Auckland Stake. It has been\nwonderful to shake the hand of President William Roberts, from Auckland, here for this\nconference, also of President Higbee from Hawkes Bay and others here from these stakes of\nZion down under.\n<\/p><p>\nNow in conclusion, as we share this gospel with others, may I give you the words of the Lord\nas recorded in the seventh chapter of Matthew. Christ had been teaching the people in his\ncustomary way&mdash;by parables. He spoke of one of the men who was wise, because he built\nhis house upon the rock, and the one who was foolish, because he had built his house upon\nthe sand. I am interested in the closing words of that chapter, \"And it came to pass when\nJesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35106\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35106)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35106)\">Matt. 7:28-29<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay we then be wise and follow the teachings of our great prophet and mouthpiece of the\nLord today, as well as of those who have been called to labor and serve with him, and the\nleaders in the missions and in the stakes and wards and branches, and all the auxiliary\norganizations, for we are being taught and led by authority and not by the teachings of the\nscribes. We then will be true Latter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nI am deeply thankful for my membership in this, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints. May I give you in conclusion the words of Karl G. Maeser. The gospel has been\nsummed up for us&mdash;the kingdom. Those who will inherit the kingdom must be true\nLatter-day Saints. This is Brother Maeser's definition of a true Latter-day Saint. \"A true\nLatter-day Saint is one who has dedicated himself soul and body to God in all things,\ntemporal and spiritual, in all his doings, in all the meditations of his heart, in all his desires,\nhis anticipations and hopes for the future, in life and in death to belong to the Lord only, and\nhas based all his actions, all his thoughts, all his endeavors, all his interests upon that\nfoundation that he belongs to the Lord.\" As we truly belong to the Lord we will feel called to\nshare that belonging with others.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we be true Latter-day Saints, sharing the gospel freely with others, I humbly pray as I\nbear my witness to you that these things are true, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ our\nSavior. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
