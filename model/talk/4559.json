Each Sabbath day millions of Latter-day Saints make this promise. What does it mean to \u201calways remember\u201d our Savior?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">To remember means to keep in memory. In the scriptures, it often means to keep a person in memory, together with associated emotions like love, loyalty, or gratitude. The stronger the emotion, the more vivid and influential the memory. Here are some examples:<\/p>\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Most of us have the clearest memories of our mortal parents, who gave us birth and nurtured us through childhood. This kind of memory does not dim with the passing years, but with wisdom and perspective becomes ever more meaningful. As I grow older, I think more frequently of my father and my mother. I will always remember them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Shortly before my wife was to give birth to our first child, we learned that the baby must be born by cesarean section. I was then a student at Brigham Young University, going to school full time and working almost full time. From my meager earnings, a little over $1.00 an hour, we had saved enough money for the hospital and doctor bills, but nothing in our plans or emotions had prepared us for this shocking announcement. We scarcely knew what a cesarean birth was, and we feared the worst.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A few days later we faced our ordeal. After what seemed an eternity, I stood at a window in the hospital hallway, looking into a basket containing our firstborn. The joy of seeing her and knowing that my beloved companion had survived the operation was inexpressible. As I experienced that moment, I became aware of a stranger standing beside me. He introduced himself as Dr. N. Frederick Hicken, the surgeon who had come from Salt Lake City to perform the operation. His presence reminded me that a surgeon\u2019s fee had not been in our plans, and I began to ask him if I could pay his fee over a period of time. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, young man,\u201d he said in a kindly way. \u201cThis is one from the Hickens to the Oakses.\u201d Before I could stammer a thank-you, he was gone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I was filled with wonder at this unexpected gift. Our benefactor must have known my father, a young medical doctor who died when I was a boy. He must have given us this gift because of something my father had done. I marveled at the goodness of this man who had come to us in our crisis and had, without recompense, used his powers to preserve the lives of those I loved. The emotion of that moment made the memory indelible. The name of that doctor is precious to me. I will always remember him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some time ago, someone praised me for something I had done. Even as I received that compliment I knew I did not deserve it. The credit belonged to wise and wonderful teachers who had taught me what to do and how to do it. My teachers were memorable. I shudder to think what I would have lost if teachers had not helped me want to learn and then taught me what I needed to know. I will always be grateful to my teachers. I will always remember them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/always-remember-him.p12\" class=\"\">By now you must surely realize that I have given these three examples because the reasons why I will always remember these persons are related to the reasons why we should always remember Jesus Christ: He is our Creator, our Redeemer, and our Teacher.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Our Creator, Our Redeemer, Our Teacher<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/always-remember-him.p14\" class=\"\">Under the direction and according to the plan of God the Father, his Son Jehovah \u201ccreated the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6119\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6119)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6119)\">3 Ne. 9:15<\/a><\/span>).

More recently, a Utah convert to the Church has written of his concern at the way some non-LDS adults with good basic values come to Utah with high expectations for a life among good neighbors and then, as he wrote, \u201cfind themselves excluded at best and ostracized at worst.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/always-remember-him.p50\" class=\"\">Of course, there will be differences in the personal standards and social activities of faithful Latter-day Saints and members of other groups. But these differences are no excuse for ostracism, arrogance, or unkindness by LDS people. As my convert friend wrote, \u201cI personally believe that Satan is as active among the Saints in turning them away from their neighbors as he is in turning disaffected persons against the Church.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/always-remember-him.p51\" class=\"\">As we covenant that we will always remember our Savior, we must not forget Jehovah\u2019s command to Israel:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/always-remember-him.p52\" class=\"\">\u201cBut the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30948\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30948)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30948)\">Lev. 19:34<\/a><\/span>; see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"22972\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22972)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22972)\">Ex. 22:21<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"21349\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21349)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21349)\">Deut. 10:19<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/always-remember-him.p53\" class=\"\">We should always remember how Jesus commanded us to love our neighbor as ourselves.
