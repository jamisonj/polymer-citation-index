The prayer was answered\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30329\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30329)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30329)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Father and the Son appeared to him which appearance\nreaffirmed to the world that God, our Eternal Father, is a being with body, parts and passions\nand in whose image we are created.  His visit confirmed to the world that the despised\nNazarene crucified upon Calvary's Hill was the only begotten of the Father in the flesh&mdash;the\nCreator of mankind.\n<\/p><p>\nBy divine direction, this young man, Joseph Smith, unearthed a sacred record buried centuries\nago in the ancient Hill Cumorah.  This record contained the revelations of the Lord to the\npeople that lived upon this the American Continent centuries ago.  The scriptures in this holy\nrecord are among the most profound ever given to any people or in any dispensation.  For\nexample, Lehi declared: \n<\/p><p>\nAdam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3554\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3554)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3554)\">2 Ne. 2:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn this day, a new philosophy had fallen upon the ears of a disillusioned generation.  The\nworld was in the throes of a great apostasy.\n<\/p><p>\nAs we think of the joy mentioned by Lehi, I submit the following questions: Could men have\njoy in the doctrine that unbaptized babes would burn in hell forever?  Could men have joy in\nbeing denied the right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience? Could men\nhave joy in being denied the right to read the word of God? Could men have joy in the\nthought that mental and physical torture manifests genuine repentance?  Could men have joy\nin being lead into the realms of ignorance and worshiping a God of whom they could not\nconceive?\n<\/p><p>\nMany statements fell from the mouth of the young Prophet, but one which startled the world\nwas the declaration:  \"The glory of God is intelligence\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13290\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13290)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13290)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span>).\n\"Men cannot be saved in ignorance\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50036\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50036)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50036)\">D&amp;C 131:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord, through this American Prophet, revealed in the Book of Moses,\nChapter 1, Verse 39, that his glory and work was as declared by the Lord: \n<\/p><p>\nFor behold, this is my work and my glory&mdash;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life\nof man (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39052\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39052)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39052)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHad anyone previous to the Prophet Joseph Smith ever revealed to the world the most\nimportant work and glory of the Creator?  Imagine if you will he who created all things&mdash;the\nuniverse, endless worlds and man declared that his most important objective was to bring to\npass the immortality and eternal life of man.  If the work and objectives of the Lord are to be\naccomplished, there had to be established a direct relationship between our Father in heaven\nand man on earth. Channels of communication had to be reopened so that the Lord could\nreveal his mind and will to those he selected to represent him.  Hence, the priesthood was\nrestored to establish the former relationship wherein God directed his work for the bringing\nabout the immortality and eternal life of man.  John the Baptist returned to earth and\nconferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic Priesthood, the same authority\nwhich existed in the days of John the Baptist which holds the keys of the ministering of\nangels and the gospel of repentance and baptism by immersion for the remission of sins\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30339\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30339)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30339)\">JS&mdash;H 1:68-72<\/a><\/span>). \nShortly thereafter, by divine direction, the Apostolic Presidency, Peter, James, and John\nbestowed upon Joseph Smith and his associate the Melchizedek Priesthood\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13229\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13229)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13229)\">D&amp;C 27:12<\/a><\/span>) which holds the\nkeys of loosening and binding both upon the earth and in the heavens, the laying on of hands\nfor the gift of the Holy Ghost, the keys to preach the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue\nand people, the keys for the work for the dead, and, hence, the relationship which existed\nbetween the prophets and apostles of old was established in this day to the end that the Lord's\nplans for the eternal blessing of his children might be brought into fruition.  Priesthood is\ndivine authority, and as Joseph Smith declared: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . is an everlasting principle and existed with God from eternity and will to eternity without\nbeginning of days or end of years. The keys have to be brought from heaven whenever the\nGospel is sent.\n<\/p><p>\nIn Section 121, Verse 36, of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants, to confirm the above statements, the\nLord declared: \n<\/p><p>\nThat the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and\nthat the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of\nrighteousness (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13320\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13320)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13320)\">D&amp;C 121:36<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe priesthood is that which places a man in condition to receive the ministration of angels\nand to enjoy the presence of God the Father and his son Jesus Christ, which substantiates the\ndeclaration of the former apostle, John the Beloved, when he declared: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd this is life eternal that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom\nthou hast sent (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27615\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27615)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27615)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, this is a new day&mdash;the day of which the Apostles of old spoke when they\nprophesied a time of great refreshing would come when there would be a restoration of all\nthings before the second coming of the Redeemer of the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7709\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7709)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7709)\">Acts 3:19-21<\/a><\/span>).  Does all of this mean\nanything to you and to me?  My beloved brethren who hold the priesthood must realize that\nthe joy of which Lehi spoke is the joy of service in the Lord's work; the joy of contributing\nto the salvation of the souls of our Heavenly Father's children; the joy of rendering service\nwhen called upon by those who preside over us and furthering the work of the Lord&mdash;his\nwork to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man; and the, joy in sustaining those\nwho preside over us.\n<\/p><p>\nToday in the stakes of the Church, there are 156,000 men endowed with the authority of the\nHoly Melchizedek Priesthood, the priesthood after the order of the Son of God, and 129,000\nholding the Aaronic Priesthood, or a total of 285,000 sons of God holding divine\nauthority&mdash;the most precious gift that has ever been bestowed upon mankind.\n<\/p><p>\nThe membership of the Church in stakes only is 1,034,000 of whom 28% hold either the\nMelchizedek or the Aaronic Priesthood.  By the way of comparison, the largest church in the\nUnited States with a membership of 29,407,000 has but 45,000 members authorized to\nparticipate in the rituals of the Church and to carry on its work, which indicates that 1.5% of\nthe total membership as against 28% of the membership of the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints enjoy the privilege of service.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the greatest evidences of the divine origin of this great Church and its priesthood lies\nin the fact that every male member of the Church over the age of twelve who is worthy may\nhold the priesthood of God and function therein.  The bestowal of divine authority upon so\nmany of the Lord's sons is an evidence that our Heavenly Father is no respecter of persons. \nStation in life and wealth make no difference.  Faith in him and the gospel of salvation and\nobedience thereto wherein men live lives that are compatible with the wishes of our Heavenly\nFather qualify men to hold the priesthood.  Priesthood privileges, powers and service are not\nin the hands of a few.  All of these blessings are not for the General Authorities, stake\nauthorities or bishoprics, but for every worthy holder of the priesthood.  After all, salvation is\nan individual matter, and priesthood service in the cause of the Savior contributes to salvation\nand exaltation in the Celestial Kingdom.  Brigham Young makes this point very clear in the\nfollowing declaration: \n<\/p><p>\nThe Gospel of salvation&mdash;The Priesthood of the Son of God&mdash;is so ordered and organized, in\nthe very nature of it, being a portion of that law of heaven by which worlds are organized,\nthat it is calculated to enlighten the children of men and give them power to save themselves.\n<\/p><p>\nContinuing with another statement, President Brigham Young stated: \n<\/p><p>\nThe Gospel and the Priesthood are the means he employs to save and exalt his obedient\nchildren to the possession with him of the same glory and power to be crowned with crowns\nof glory, immortality and eternal lives.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the joy of which Lehi spoke:  \"Men are that they might have joy,\" and the highest\ndegree of joy will only be found in the presence of God the Eternal Father and his Son Jesus\nChrist and to share his glory with him.\n<\/p><p>\nSome of our brethren who hold the priesthood and have within their grasp all of the blessings\nand privileges promised to the faithful have laid aside the opportunity of service and for some\nreason or another have become indifferent and thereby forgotten the covenants they made with\nthe Lord when they received the priesthood.  In the 108th Section of the Doctrine &amp;\nCovenants, Verse 3, the Lord very implicitly reminds us of our priesthood covenants when he\ndeclared: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd arise up and be more careful henceforth in observing your vows, which you have made\nand do make, and you shall be blessed with exceeding great blessings\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13308\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13308)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13308)\">D&amp;C 108:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNo individual who holds either the Aaronic or the Melchizedek Priesthood has received it but\nwhat they were asked the question as to whether or not they would be faithful and true and to\nkeep themselves sweet and unspotted from the sins of the world, and to render whatever\nservice may be required.\n<\/p><p>\nTo those who are active in the priesthood, the Lord has admonished us in the 108th Section\nof the Doctrine &amp; Covenants, the 7th Verse, as follows: \n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, strengthen your brethren in all your conversation, in all your prayers, in all your\nexhortations, and in all your doings\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13309\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13309)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13309)\">D&amp;C 108:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis places squarely upon the shoulders of all of us the responsibility to strengthen those who\nmay be weak in the spirit of tolerance, patience, and love.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I think of our inactive brethren, I feel that they are to some degree the\n\"Forgotten Men.\"  Might I ask you the question, \"What have you done to encourage and\nstimulate the indifferent young men or older men to activity in the Church?\"  This should be\nthe time to take an individual inventory of your attitude and my attitude toward our brethren. \nThese men are not problem men, but they are men with a problem. Neither are they marked\nmen, nor are they to be stigmatized, but rather your responsibility and mine is to find\nsolutions to their problems.  We must never forget that the Priesthood is a Divine\nBrotherhood, and the Divine Brotherhood of God should radiate love, good will and\nhelpfulness to all.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are no deficiencies in the priesthood organization as the Lord has revealed it to us, but\nthere may be some deficiencies in those of us who fail to carry out the plan of the priesthood\nin being our brother's keeper.  Our brethren who are not as interested as they might be have\noutstanding qualities of character, and these qualities could well be emulated by all of us. \nAgain, the statement of Lehi of old: \"Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they\nmight have joy,\" and the greatest joy of all is brought forcibly to our attention in the 18th\nSection of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants, the 15th Verse: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and\nbring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of\nmy Father! (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13221\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13221)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13221)\">D&amp;C 18:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd in the 16th Verse: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the\nkingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13222\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13222)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13222)\">D&amp;C 18:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAgain, in the spirit of kindness, tolerance and patience let us strive to the accomplishment of\nbringing back into the fold of activity every member of the priesthood, and that by uniting\ntogether we shall lift one another up to the full stature of servants of God, even from the\ndeacon to the high priest.\n<\/p><p>\nThese past two years due to the untiring work of stake presidencies, high councilmen,\nbishoprics and senior Aaronic Priesthood advisors, it has been possible to organize 1,581\nsenior Aaronic Priesthood quorums and groups constituted of the following: 826 senior priests\nquorums, 368 senior teachers quorums, 371 senior deacons quorums, and 16 mixed groups.\nThese priesthood quorum organizations require the services of approximately 5,000 of our\nsenior Aaronic Priesthood brethren to make up the presidencies. This is a most encouraging\naccomplishment, but we cannot cease our efforts upon this accomplishment, but we must look\nforward to see what there is left to be done.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the stakes, there are 65,000 senior members of the Aaronic Priesthood.  If all of these\nbrethren were organized into quorums as the Lord has indicated in the 107th Section of the\nDoctrine &amp; Covenants, we would have at least a total of 5,000 Senior Aaronic Priesthood\nquorums.  The accomplishment of this will require unceasing effort.\n<\/p><p>\nIn 1953, 3,000 senior members of the Aaronic Priesthood were advanced to the Melchizedek\nPriesthood.  For this accomplishment, I would have you know we are most grateful, but\nunfortunately there were more of our brethren joined the senior Aaronic Priesthood group than\nwere advanced to the Melchizedek Priesthood, which brings me to another question, \"What\nabout our sons who hold the Aaronic Priesthood under the age of twenty-one&mdash;these\nwonderful young men who Elbert Hubbard declared were made of 'Soul Stuff'?\" And the\nmost valuable \"Soul Stuff\" in the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ are these young men born\nin this dispensation.  They are the choice spirits, for they have been born in most instances\nunder the new and everlasting covenant. It causes us deep concern when we find that during\nthe year 1953 there were 3,332 twenty-year-old deacons, teachers and priests that within the\ncoming year will become members of the senior Aaronic Priesthood group. \nThis terse statement tells a sad story.  If we were to go into the lives of these young men, out\nof our investigation, we would find that someone, either a bishop, a bishop's counselor or an\nAaronic Priesthood advisor has been remiss in his duty.  I can't help but believe that all of\nthese young men have become inactive and disinterested because they have lost contact with\nthe Church, and we lose contact with all of these potential members of the senior Aaronic\nPriesthood by our failure to keep in constant touch with them, particularly when they are\ninactive and indifferent.  There is but one solution to keep Aaronic Priesthood members under\nthe age of twenty-one interested, motivated and active in their priesthood work, and that is\nthrough a very definite system of personal contacts.  The Church has been built up on\npersonal contacts.  Your grandfather and my grandfather accepted the gospel because of many\npersonal contacts made by missionaries.  The contact system is still the most profitable and\nonly one whereby inactive and indifferent members of the Church can be brought back into\nthe fold.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to relate a beautiful story of one of the great spiritual leaders of the Church,\nPresident Edward J. Wood, former president of the Alberta Temple and Alberta Stake.  The\nstory as related to me by him is as follows: \n<\/p><p>\nThe bishop of his ward called into a special meeting some of the brethren, and among them\nwas President Wood. The bishop announced that the brethren had been called together to go\non a special mission, and this was the mission: The bishop announced, \"We have a group of\nyoung men under the age of twenty-one who hold the Aaronic Priesthood who now manifest\nno interest and render no service.  They must be brought back.  Hence, I am calling each one\nof you brethren on a special mission to bring back one of these boys.\"  President Wood said,\n\"I wondered at first what kind of a mission my bishop was calling me to perform when I was\npresident of the Alberta Temple and president of the Alberta Stake of Zion, but when he\nmade his announcement, I gladly responded to the call.  My assignment was to visit a boy\nwho lived five miles out of Cardston.  I thought first of the boy's family.  I knew I would\nhave to face an indifferent father and an indifferent mother, and so I decided to invite him to\nattend the ward Priesthood Meeting with me which was held on a week night.  I drove the\nfive miles to the boy's home, and as I anticipated, the father was indifferent and the mother\nwas indifferent saying, 'If our son decides to go to priesthood meeting with you that is his\nprivilege.'\"  And so the president stated that after a good deal of persuasion the boy\nreluctantly consented to go to priesthood meeting.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the time it took to drive the five miles, what do you suppose this wise man talked\nabout?  Did he talk about the Church?  \"No.\" Did he talk about priesthood?  \"No.\" Was he\ncritical of the boy for his failure to at tend to his priesthood obligations? \"No.\" But, he talked\nabout the things that the boy and all boys are interested in, namely athletics.  He opened up\nthe subject by telling the boy of his own experience when he and his brother William were\nthe champion bicycle riders of the State of Utah.  Was the boy interested? \"Surely,\" for he,\ntoo, was interested in athletics as all boys are.  The president of the stake, the president of the\nTemple brought himself down to the level of the boy in being able to look through the eyes\nof a boy, and with the same viewpoint, the boy opened his heart to President Wood and was\nwilling to talk about his achievements in the field of athletics.\n<\/p><p>\nArriving at the chapel, President Wood asked the boy if he would attend his deacons meeting,\n\"Yes,\" he would. Then, the president requested him to listen intently and to report to him as\nto what had been said and what had been done.  After the meeting, it was easy to open up a\ndiscussion on the priesthood, and as the boy reported in all frankness and forthrightness, he\ntold the president that he hadn't heard anything he liked, nor was there\nanything done in the quorum meeting that inspired him. President Wood asked him what was\nwrong, and the boy readily answered, \"The teacher was not prepared.  I knew he was not\nprepared because when the quorum opened its meeting, he handed the manual first to one boy\nand then to another to read a paragraph.\" He said, \"I might as well of stayed home, I am sure\nI would have learned more.\" There were no assignments made to the deacons, either for\npassing the sacrament or gathering fast offerings.  In fact, there was no action in the quorum\nmeeting, and boys love action.\n<\/p><p>\nArriving home, the president extended another invitation to the boy to attend priesthood\nmeeting.  The boy consented, but during the interim between the first meeting and the second,\nthe president of the stake went to the advisor of the deacons quorum and pointed out to him\nthe reason why the boys were inactive and indifferent, the president's reason being that the\nteacher was unprepared, secondly, the president of the deacons quorum was not called up to\npreside over the quorum, and thirdly, no assignments were being made.  You can rest assured\nthat the next week the teacher was prepared, the presidency of the deacons quorum was in its\nplace presiding over the meeting, and assignments were made, and thus for six consecutive\nweeks the man with the greatest amount of responsibility and work to do made a round trip of\ntwenty miles to pick up a deacon and take him to priesthood meeting. As the seventh week\ndawned, the president asked himself the question, \"I wonder if I am accomplishing anything\nin behalf of this boy?  Tonight I will make a test of my plan.\"  In place of driving to the\nboy's home, the president went to priesthood meeting, and soon the fruits of the president's\nefforts were manifested, for thirty minutes late, the deacon came in.  At the end of the\nmeeting, President Wood declared, \"I received the greatest thrill of my life.  That boy sided\nup to me and placed his hand in mine, looked me squarely in the eye, and expressed his\ngratitude and appreciation for what I had done in just two words in boy language, 'My Pal.'\"\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, that is the solution to the problem of the Aaronic Priesthood under the age of\ntwenty-one where they become indifferent&mdash;\"Palship,\" and may I emphasize it is the solution. \nPalship first means contacts with boys. It means that if you establish palship, you have their\nconfidence, good will, and their love.  They will follow you to the ends of the earth if\nnecessary.  Yes, Elbert Hubbard was right when he declared, \"Boys are made of Soul Stuff,\"\nand the most precious \"Soul Stuff\" in all the world is found in the Church of the Lord Jesus\nChrist, for herein are potential General Authorities, stake presidents, and bishoprics, and\nnumerous other future leaders.\n<\/p><p>\nYes brethren, there are some outstanding achievements due to the efforts of you Aaronic\nPriesthood workers.  It affords me a great thrill to announce tonight that more than 15,000\nyoung men will receive an Individual Aaronic Priesthood Award for their faithfulness and\nservice in the priesthood, for they have attended their sacrament meetings priesthood\nmeetings, have paid a full tithing, have kept the Word of Wisdom and met their priesthood\nobligations in full.  Again, we must not look back at what we have done, but rather we should\nlook forward and remember that out of a total of 63,000 members of the Aaronic Priesthood\nunder the age of twenty-one, there are still 48,000 who have not achieved as have the 15,000.\nThese 48,000 should enjoy that divine thing that I choose to call \"palship.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, there is but one question left, \"Are you and I our brother's keeper?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23618\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23618)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23618)\">Gen. 4:9<\/a><\/span>). The answer is\nobvious.  The priesthood of God is a divine order founded upon the love of God for his sons,\nfor God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, and his son so loved the world\nthat he gave his life for the redemption of all, and if you and I love our\nneighbors, as God has commanded, as ourselves, we shall close our priesthood ranks and we\nwill gather our brethren who may be inactive in the priesthood to our side and present to the\nworld a priesthood solidarity which will give all of us the strength to destroy the enemy of\nindifference and temptation and criticism, and which will inspire us to be as one, as are the\nFather and the Son one, and as Lehi declared: \"Men are that they might have joy\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3555\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3555)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3555)\">2 Ne. 2:25<\/a><\/span>), and above\nthat and most important of all that we shall be instrumental in the Lord's greatest work to\nbring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39053\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39053)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39053)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>), which I humbly pray will be the\nheartfelt desire and accomplishment of all of us, in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p><p>\nBishop Joseph L. Wirthlin: \n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, the First Presidency, out of their kindness and generosity, have permitted the\nPresiding Bishopric to show you a film tonight that deals with the procedures of the Adult\nAaronic Priesthood plan and program.  May I say to you that in this film there is a story and\nin the story there is a character.  We want you to understand that while we show the extremes\nto which this particular man went, the purpose is to show what can be done if we are kind\nand patient, no matter how far afield some of our brethren may go.  This film does not intend\nto carry the impression that all of our senior Aaronic brethren have gone as far as this\nparticular character went.\n<\/p><p>\n(There was then presented on a screen a film story entitled \"Come Back, My Son.\")\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
