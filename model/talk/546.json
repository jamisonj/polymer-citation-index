Smith, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1951, pp. 79-82<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nIt is truly a privilege and honor to be here and partake of the spirit and influence of this\noccasion. I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be with me while I occupy this time. I want\nto acknowledge my gratitude for the prayer that was offered in my behalf and in behalf of the\nother patriarchs at the opening of this conference. I rejoice in the spirit of this conference and\nin the influence that radiates from such gatherings. I appreciate the privilege of being in the\npresence of the General Authorities and such a multitude of the priesthood and Saints. Truly,\nthis is a happy people, and why shouldn't we be happy? We possess the greatest knowledge\ngiven to man&mdash;the knowledge of the gospel. Then the greatest happiness comes from our\nefforts to give it to others.\n<\/p><p>\nHenry Thoreau wrote: \n<\/p><p>\nIt is something to be able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue and to so\nmake a few objects beautiful, but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very\natmosphere and medium through which we look&mdash;to affect the quality of the day.\nThat is the highest of arts.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE ART OF LIVING\n<\/p><p>\nThoreau is trying to remind us that great art is not restricted to painting, music, sculpture, and\nwriting. There is an art to living, too. Who of all people are better prepared to affect the\nquality of the day for others than are the members of the Church of Jesus Christ? The art of\nliving should be at its best among the Latter-day Saints. One must first have his own house in\norder. He must first live the gospel himself; then he can affect the quality of the day for\nothers.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat can bring greater joy to man than a knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ, to know\nthat God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God, to know the plan of\nsalvation, and to know that he has an opportunity to follow that plan and receive\nsalvation&mdash;yes, even exaltation. Then take that knowledge and give it to others, paint the atmosphere and\nmedium through which they look.\n<\/p><p>\nIt thrills me to see the faces of converts to the Church fill with joy when they tell me their\nexperiences through which they joined the Church, to see the reverence paid to those\nmissionaries who brought them the gospel; how they, too, know that God lives and that Jesus\nis the Christ; and that his gospel has been restored to the earth. Those missionaries were the\ngreatest artists.\n<\/p><p>\nSuch art is not confined to the ordained missionaries. Every member of the Church can so\nlive as to change the atmosphere around him for the benefit of others. Teach the principles of\nthe gospel through your very deeds, acts of kindness; be sincere in your religion and live it\nstrictly, that through your deeds others shall follow.\n<\/p><p>\nSaid the Savior,\n<\/p><p>\nYe are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.\n<\/p><p>\nNeither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it\ngiveth light unto all that are in the house.\n<\/p><p>\nLet your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify\nyour Father which is in heaven\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34413\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34413)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34413)\">Matt. 5:14-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nChrist was speaking to his disciples in that greatest of all sermons, the Sermon on the Mount,\nwhen he gave this commandment. It was to those same disciples that Jesus had explained the\ngospel plan in all its fullness. They had listened to him, talked to him, come under the\ninfluence of his divine personality. They had witnessed the miracles he had performed, so\nbecause of their greater knowledge and their great privileges theirs was the responsibility to\nlet their light so shine before men that others might see their good works and glorify their\nFather, which is in heaven.\n<\/p><p>\nEXEMPLARS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS\n<\/p><p>\nToday, my brothers and sisters, that command is directed to us. We have received a light and\nknowledge that was given to the disciples of old. It is our responsibility to let our light so\nshine until it really reaches the ends of the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nIf each individual member of this entire Church would sincerely strive to do his or her best,\njust think what might be accomplished. We can spread gloom around us, we can spread good\ncheer, or we can be such an example of righteousness that others will want to follow the\npattern of our lives. A chain reaction goes on that is endless in its effects. When a knowledge\nof the divinity of the gospel is given to you, you can pass it on to others. If you are living the\ngospel, they will hear your testimony. Remember the saying: \"How can I hear what you are\nsaying, when what you are is ringing so loudly in my ears?\"\n<\/p><p>\nPOWER IN TESTIMONIES\n<\/p><p>\nLive the gospel first, then teach it to others. Declare your testimony to others on every\noccasion. There is a power in bearing your testimony.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember an occasion in the mission field in Germany, when I had been tracting. I was\ngetting a bit discouraged, having met nothing but passive attention. After climbing some stairs\nI knocked on a door, and a large man opened it and with a very gruff attitude greeted me. I\ngave him my brief message, as we did in those days in presenting a tract at the door; he\nturned and picked up a handful of leaflets off the table near the door and shook them in my\nface and declared to me that I was the fifth person who had been to his door that day with\njust such leaflets. He was a large man and very rough in his approach. I expected any moment\nthat I might be thrown down the stairs, but he declared that none of us knew that we had the\ngospel. He said, You all say that it is true; this is the way; you all say that. None of you\nknow.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI met the challenge, and I stood straight before him and looked him square in the eyes, and I\nbore my testimony to him that I knew that this is the gospel of Jesus Christ and the only\nmethod by which he could gain salvation, and I went on at some length bearing my testimony\nto this man. Afterward I was surprised at the fluency of my speech because I had not been in\nGermany very long, I did not understand the language very well, but when I had finished, he\nhad changed his tone entirely and very humbly begged my pardon and promised to read the\ntract, which I am sure he did.\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure that as we bear our testimonies in our sacrament meetings, that same effect goes out\nto others and assists others in strengthening their testimonies. And as we have heard\ntestimonies here in this conference, they are a strengthening power to all of us. It was the\nstrengthening power of their testimonies of the divinity of the gospel that was the motivating\npower to the pioneers in their trek across the plains; it gave them the courage to face the\nhardships and trials of that long journey.\n<\/p><p>\nA testimony is more than a mathematical calculation. It is more than the result of a given\nexperience. As a young man enumerated a number of experiences in the process of his\nconversion, after each experience he said, \"That was not what converted me.\" Again, \"And\nthat was not what converted me.\" It was the accumulation of many experiences with sincerity\nand prayer which put him in tune to the promptings of the Holy Ghost. And so it is with me\nand all others who have a testimony. The Spirit testifies from within.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE SPIRIT WITHIN\n<\/p><p>\nYes, I have had many experiences in the mission field and at home of healings, the blind\nmade to see, the evil spirits rebuked, but the testimony of the divinity of the gospel comes not\nalone from these experiences but from the spirit within, which testifies of God and that he\nlives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that he has established his gospel in the earth, with the full\npower of the priesthood through which all the ordinances unto salvation and exaltation may be\nperformed.\n<\/p><p>\nThat knowledge burns within me, and even though Satan has tried to take it from me, he has\nnot succeeded and never shall, for I know this is the gospel of Jesus Christ, the power unto\nsalvation, the light and life of the world. I know that President David O. McKay has been\nchosen of God to lead this people in this day. I sustain him and his Counselors and all the\nother General Authorities, and I pray God's blessings upon them.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless each of us with a burning testimony of the divinity of this gospel, and\nmay the Lord help us to extend it to others that they too may receive the joy and blessings of\nthe gospel, that the earth may speedily be prepared for his coming. May we all carry with us\nfrom this conference a renewed determination to go forth proclaiming his gospel in deed and\nin precept is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
