Mark is one of the sweetest characters that I have ever met&mdash;kind,\ngenerous, tolerant, but fearless in the defense of right. I know you brethren who have not met\nhim will love him when you do meet him, and the better acquainted you become the more\nyou will love him.\n<\/p><p>\nREPORT OF CONDITIONS IN EUROPE\n<\/p><p>\nI am very pleased to have this opportunity of again reporting briefly the conditions in the\nEuropean missions. Our members, as far as we are able to hear from them, are still carrying\non. We continue to receive reports from the Palestine-Assyrian Mission; they are at least four\nmonths on the way, but they arrive. The last reports were received last Monday, April 3, and\nthey were mailed November 30, 1943. Their Priesthood and sacrament and Relief Society\nmeetings and also Sunday Schools are held as usual.\n<\/p><p>\nWe also get reports regularly from the French-Swiss district. On the 20th of each month the\nbooks are closed and before the 30th, the reports are made out and mailed. The last report\nwas that of December 1943. It stated that they had just held a district conference in\nLaChaux-du-Fonds, one of the most successful ever held. They began Saturday night previous\nto the regular sessions of the conference, with a concert. The hall was too small for the large\nattendance. After the preliminary part of the program they had refreshments. One of the\nsentences in that report, about the refreshments is rather revealing; it states, \"We were\ndelighted to be served with some real syrup.\" God bless them! If we only knew the conditions\nthat exist there, brethren, we would be more willing to follow instructions to grow and store\nmore.\n<\/p><p>\nThe report also shows that three other successful conferences have been held; that one new\nhall has been rented and some of the others cleaned and remodeled; there have been ten\nbaptisms during the year.\n<\/p><p>\nWe were also delighted to receive a brief report from our members in Finland. This is the\nfirst time for months that we have heard anything from them. It said:\n<\/p><p>\nThrough the grace of God, our men called to the colors have been protected. In spite of the\nwar, fast meetings have been held regularly, and a small Sunday School is sustained in the\nLarsmo Branch, which is attended by children, almost entirely, of non-members.\n<\/p><p>\nThese brethren and sisters are paying their tithing, although they cannot send the money out\nof Finland; so they have accumulated quite a sum; and it is recommended by the presiding\nelder that some of the money be used for the purchase of a building lot for a chapel.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have also heard from the Danish Mission. Two sheets of their\npublication, Skandinaviens Stjerne, were mailed from Sweden, and I quote as follows:\n<\/p><p>\nA bright moment in 1943 was the reopening of the Frederikshavn Branch, where the Saints\nhave exhibited a zeal and joy for the Gospel that is inspirational. This, the most northern\nbranch in Denmark, should have splendid future possibilities for success, and to other\nbranches and members be an excellent example to pattern after. The Saints in that city do not\nhesitate to walk eight and ten miles to attend a meeting.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the past year we came in singular manner in contact with a former missionary, Elder\nHomer P. Anderson, who at present is in German captivity. Many will remember Brother\nAnderson from his labors in Esbjerg and Copenhagen. He sends his greetings to everyone\nindividually and writes: \"I am praying for the Saints.\" Do not let us forget him, either, in our\nprayers.\n<\/p><p>\nThrough the Women's Relief Society, we have rejoiced in being able to assist our Norwegian\nbrethren and sisters who were in need. To judge by the letters we have received, the\nprovisions we have been able to send to them have been the means to relieve them of real\nwant.\n<\/p><p>\nAll the Saints in Denmark took this merciful act to heart, and had it been, in their power to\ndo so, they would have done it more effectively.\n<\/p><p>\nThe statistical report, for the year 1943, December not included, shows: baptisms performed,\n21; children blessed, 16; members who died, 12; promoted in the Priesthood, 24; marriages, 3.\n<\/p><p>\nAll the meetings must be held in the daytime, as the people are not permitted to be out after\ndark.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom the Swedish Mission we get reports regularly as usual, although they, as all other\nreports, are censored. Quoting from the last letter received March 27, dated January 14:\n<\/p><p>\nWe celebrated our fifth Christmas with thankful feelings toward God in heaven. Our cities are\nagain immersed in light; provisions and other commodities are exhibited in store windows,\nand the rationing of commodities has to some extent improved in defiance of the prolongation\nof the war.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are at present in this land about 35,000 fugitives of different nationalities, with whom\nwe are sharing our bread, and we know that the Lord blesses our government for our charities\nwhich the nation as a whole has contributed. Of course, a certain amount of inflation has been\nfelt, and there are, without doubt, many difficulties for some of our citizens to get debits and\ncredits to balance.\n<\/p><p>\nThis year we have baptized nineteen people, ordained twenty-five to the Priesthood, and\nblessed twenty-one children, from all of which we see that the Lord has been good to us. We\nare so grateful for the peace, love and unity that prevails. We do thank the Lord for the\nspiritual help which has been manifest in actions. For instance, tithing shows a very\nsubstantial increase each year since 1939, and the year 1943 has been especially good.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom the British Mission the last letter, received March 18 and mailed February 24, states:\n<\/p><p>\n<i>The Church News<\/i> and <i>The Improvement Era<\/i>, and other magazines are coming in fairly\nregularly, and we thank you for the material we receive. We have a permit now to send some\nChurch literature to our members of the Church who are prisoners of war. The pocket edition\nof the Book of Mormon and <i>The Principles of the Gospel<\/i> have been distributed to all service\nmembers with whom we can possibly get into contact, that is, those who\nhave not received the books direct from Zion. Altogether about 600 packets have been\ndistributed.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have held altogether three L.D.S. service men's conferences, one in London, one in\nWigan, and the last one in Birmingham, at which there were about 200 service men and\napproximately that number of our local members, chiefly young people, present. It was a\ngrand affair. We began on Saturday afternoon with a basketball game between two L.D.S.\nteams from the north of England. It was a lively game, attended by about 300 people. A\nsociable, get-acquainted hour was the next item on the program. Then a grand concert\nfollowed, and the evening concluded with our Gold and Green Ball.\n<\/p><p>\nSunday was devoted to the L.D.S. service men's conference, and the chapel was packed to\ncapacity. We are planning another missionwide service men's conference to be held sometime\nin May.\n<\/p><p>\nIn various parts of the country the brethren in the forces are taking advantage of holding\nservices, Mutual classes and religious discussions. There are at least a dozen places where our\nbrethren are doing this very valued work.\n<\/p><p>\nADVICE TO MEMBERS UPON WITHDRAWAL OF MISSIONARIES\n<\/p><p>\nAfter the 699 missionaries had been evacuated from the twelve missions in the European\ngroup, shortly after the beginning of this world war, our members naturally were somewhat\ndiscouraged, downhearted and blue. We encouraged them as best we could, advised them as\nwe advise our new missionaries, especially those who are somewhat homesick, and perhaps\nlovesick, that the best tonic, the best remedy for such sickness and for the blues is a gospel\nconversation. It is also a good remedy for worry. I think it is really as good&mdash;and that is\nsaying something for me&mdash;as a fishing trip. You can forget your forget your worries through a\nGospel conversation.\n<\/p><p>\nWe also suggested to our members this motto, or slogan, as we called it: \"Every member a\nmissionary.\" From the reports and letters, I am sure that most of our members are living up to\nthat motto. I would suggest, if I may, that slogan to you fine mission presidents who are here\nrepresenting the seventeen missions in the North American group. You are losing most of\nyour missionaries; they are being \"evacuated\" or transferred to the service of our country, and\nI am sure that the members, if they would follow this motto, could carry on the work. \"Every\nmember a missionary.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI know every service man is a missionary. God bless them. I was delighted with President\nGrant's message to our service men. They are preaching the Gospel, and in the most effective\nway, as President Grant stated, by their example. People generally, and especially young\npeople, would rather at any time <i>see<\/i> a sermon than <i>hear<\/i> one.\n<\/p><p>\nEXAMPLE BETTER THAN PREACHING\n<\/p><p>\nMay I suggest, too, brethren, that we have an opportunity here at home, by our example, to\npreach the Gospel. There are thousands of strangers in our midst, and if we would keep in\nmind always the first part of the thirteenth Article of Faith: \"We believe in being honest,\ntrue, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6610\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6610)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6610)\">A of F 1:13<\/a><\/span>), and to so\nlive that it could be said of all of us who are here this morning, and the Latter-day Saints\ngenerally, not that we believe only, but that we are honest, we are true, we are chaste, we are\nbenevolent, we are virtuous and we are doing good to all men, it would not matter so much\nthen if we did not have so many missionaries in the field, such an example would be much\nmore effective than all our preaching.\n<\/p><p>\nMay our Father in Heaven give us the desire, the will-power, the courage and the faith to so\nlive and to follow His slogan, His admonition: \"Let your light so shine before men, that they\nmay see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33876\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33876)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33876)\">Matt. 5:16<\/a><\/span>), I pray in the name of\nJesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
