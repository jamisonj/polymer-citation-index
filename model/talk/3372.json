As a matter of fact, there is no fundamental virtue about which they will not be taught, for in the Book of Mormon, as has already been said, is to be found \u201cthe fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17362\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17362)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17362)\">D&amp;C 20:9<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"17357\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17357)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17357)\">D&amp;C 19:26<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-book-of-mormon.p59\" class=\"\">And so, I counsel you, my beloved brothers and sisters and friends everywhere, to make reading the Book of Mormon a few minutes each day a lifelong practice.

I am persuaded by my own experience and that of my loved ones, as well as by the statements of the Prophet Joseph Smith, that one can get and keep closer to the Lord by reading the Book of Mormon than by reading any other book.

The spirit of reverence will increase; mutual respect and consideration for each other will grow. The spirit of contention will depart. Parents will counsel their children in greater love and wisdom. Children will be more responsive and submissive to the counsel of their parents. Righteousness will increase. Faith, hope, and charity\u2014the pure love of Christ\u2014will abound in our homes and lives, bringing in their wake peace, joy, and happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-book-of-mormon.p61\" class=\"\">That we will seek these blessings through reading the Book of Mormon, I humbly pray and leave my blessings with you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
