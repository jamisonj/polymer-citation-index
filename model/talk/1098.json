Dyer, <i>Conference Report<\/i> October 1960, pp. 58-62<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nWith my dear wife and missionary companion, we are most grateful for the privilege of being\ninvited to return at this conference time to be refortified with the spirit and the strength of\nthese wonderful gatherings. I want to say to the First Presidency of the Church that the\ninspiration of their direction that has come to us during the past nine months has been in large\nmeasure the reason for the expanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ among the people of\nEurope. We have been in almost constant contact by telephone, by letter, and by other means,\nwith the inspiration and direction of the First Presidency of the Church. In standing here this\nafternoon, I do so for and in behalf of the thirteen mission presidents who are now laboring in\nEurope, and I bring to this conference their greetings, as well as to the parents of their\nmissionaries, and to all who have served in these many missions of Europe.\n<\/p><p>\nThese mission leaders are President and Sister T. Bowring Woodbury of the British Mission;\nPresident and Sister Levi B. Thorup of the Danish Mission; President and Sister John D.\nWarner of the Finnish Mission; President and Sister Edgar B. Brossard of the French Mission;\nPresident and Sister J. Henry Volker of the Netherlands Mission; President and Sister Ray\nEngebretsen of the Norwegian Mission; President and Sister Bernard P. Brockbank of the\nNorth British Mission; President and Sister Percy K. Fetzer of the North German Mission;\nPresident and Sister A. Gideon Omer of the Swedish Mission; President and Sister William S.\nErekson of the Swiss Mission; and the new mission recently organized, President and Sister\nW. Whitney Smith of the Austrian Mission; President and Sister T. Quentin Cannon of the\nSouth German Mission; and President and Sister Stephen C. Richards of the West German\nMission. And with them also I bring the greetings of 1700 missionaries who are now laboring\nin Europe. I am happy to report that I have had the opportunity during these past months to\nlook into their faces, to feel their spirit, and once again to say within my heart and to\nproclaim aloud that I have confidence in the youth of this Church.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful to say that there is a unification in the programs of our missionary work in\nEurope. Each and every mission is pursuing the work of proselyting in the same manner, and\nthe faith and the testimony of the missionaries who are carrying the gospel to the peoples of\nthese ancient lands are in evidence. Presaged by the visits made to Europe by President\nMcKay at the time of the temple dedications, followed by other visits by members of the\nQuorum of the Twelve and by President Moyle, the visit by Elder Harold B. Lee at the time\nof the organization of the Manchester Stake&mdash;these have presaged an awakening among the\npeople of these ancient lands.\n<\/p><p>\nIn August 1959 all of the European missions combined were responsible for ten percent of the\nconverts of that month. In the month of August of this year, the European missions were\nresponsible for thirty-five percent of the converts of the Church for that month, and I only\nre-echo the faith and the testimony of the mission presidents who are there when I say that we\nhaven't even scratched the surface. God is touching the hearts of the people, they are\nlistening, and are receiving answers to their desires and their prayers. I only wish that I had\nthe time to tell of the many personal cases of conversion that have come to these thousands of\npeople in the past year, and to reassure you, my brethren and sisters, that these people are\nconverted to the gospel of Jesus Christ. They have answered a call that has come to them\nunder the power and the influence of the Spirit of God. I have always felt in my heart that\nwhen the Holy Ghost bears record to anyone that he ought to do something about that, and\nwe are encouraging our missionaries in all of these lands to be alert to the reaction of the\npower of the Spirit in the minds and the hearts of these people, and in that very moment to\npersuade, to encourage, to teach, to testify, and to challenge that they may be willing to\naccept the gospel message that has come to them.\n<\/p><p>\nI would be insensible to what is taking place in these ancient lands if I did\nnot say that we are witnessing the fulfilling of a prophecy&mdash;a prophecy made by\nPresident McKay at the time I was called to go into the lands of Europe, wherein he stated to\nme that the time had come for the gospel of Jesus Christ to be expanded in these lands. The\npeople are ready for the gospel, and we are finding them responding to the efforts of the\nmissionaries as they bear record by the power of faith and testimony of the truths of the\ngospel unto those with whom they make this contact.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the instructions that the First Presidency gave to me was to go into all of the lands of\nEurope, to go into every mission, and I think it was President Moyle who said to me that I\nmight well go to the French Mission first. We heeded this counsel, and with my good wife I\nwent into the land of France and in association with President and Sister Brossard, spent some\nthree weeks there last February&mdash;a land where ninety-two percent of the population belong to\nthe Catholic Church. We found our splendid missionaries responsive to motivation and a new\nmethod of contacting the people and teaching them by the power of the Spirit and testimony.\n<\/p><p>\nWe labored in that land, and under the inspiration of God the hearts of the missionaries were\ntouched, and I shall never forget a meeting held in Brussels at the close of the tour of that\nmission with the missionary leaders, who went from that meeting with such faith that it\nengendered itself into the hearts of every one of the missionaries. We said to them, \"We want\nyou to go back to the people you have been meeting with, and where they have not listened\nto you before, to bear your testimony to them, and to do it with all the strength and the power\nthat you have.\" From that day to this in that mission the Lord has awakened in the hearts of\nmany hundreds the desire to receive the gospel of Jesus Christ. For here in a land rich with\ngreat cathedrals have come over 600 converts to the Church already this year, to meet in\nrented halls, but who now are looking forward to the time when they can associate with their\nbrethren and sisters in the erecting of beautiful chapels to better serve the needs of old and\nnew members alike. As of today there is not a single LDS\nchapel in all of France, and anyone who would question the faith of these people who have\ncome into the Church would need only to be there and see the transition that they have made\nfrom cathedrals of worship to halls on second and third floors, and who now are laboring as\nstated with our other Saints to help in the erection of our own chapels. This has been true in\nall of the missions of Europe.\n<\/p><p>\nI think one of the greatest testimonies that has come to me in these past months has been the\nresponsiveness of the local members of the Church in Europe, where we have nearly 60,000.\nWe transferred Church leadership to these local members. While in February of this year there\nwere nearly 600 of our full time missionaries engaged in branch, district, and auxiliary\nactivity, today there are fewer than a hundred, and it is the avowed determination of these\nwonderful mission presidents to see to it that local leaders be called in these also. This\naccomplished two things: It has relieved the missionaries that they can do more proselyting,\nand it has strengthened the branches of the Church in these countries.\n<\/p><p>\nLet me tell you of one example which is typical. In the tour of the French Mission, when we\nvisited the city of Nice, we had several missionaries there all engaged in branch work. One\nwas the branch president, one was a counselor, another a superintendent of Sunday School, all\nwere engaged. The thought had been that local brethren were not worthy or capable, but we\nsought out and called the best man we had. That afternoon we interviewed four or five of the\nlocal elders, and with Brother Brossard selected the one to be president of the branch. We\ncalled in his wife and asked her to support him. That night we set him apart and others of the\nlocal brethren into other positions thus relieving missionaries, and in the very next month\nthese missionaries baptized twenty-one people, two of whom were doctors, one an attorney,\nand the other a schoolteacher.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Nice Branch today is strong, and since that meeting there have been approximately sixty\npeople come into the Church in that one branch, and they are attending their meetings.\n<\/p><p>\nI stood on the street at Trondheim in Norway where Elder John A. Widtsoe lived and\nplayed as a boy, and who later said that the day would come when many of the people of that\nland would accept the gospel, and we are witnessing the continuing of this prophecy in that\nland. We are seeing again the surge of conversions in Great Britain&mdash;a land that has seen\nmore than 160,000 converts to the Church. Why would it be incredible that under the\ninspiration of God there could be more of these wonderful people accept the gospel and come\ninto the Church?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd in all of the lands of Europe there have been men and women of great strength and\ncharacter that have added to the stability of this Church, and how grateful now to be there in\nthe midst of this new time of awakening that will see more than ten thousand converts come\ninto the Church in these lands this year; and in consultation with my brethren, these mission\npresidents, we feel that there is no end to where we can go under the impetus of the power of\nGod as he reaches and touches the hearts of the people.\n<\/p><p>\nThese new converts are telling their neighbors about the gospel. They are letting their friends\nknow about it. Let me tell you of one typical case. When I was in Denmark, I shook hands\nwith a good sister by the name of Dagmar Petersen, who had been baptized a month\npreviously. She had heard the gospel, but she said, \"I am too old. All of my family would\nturn against me. I know Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God, but I do not think I'd better take\nthe step.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBut thank the Lord for a missionary who had the courage to go to her one day when there\nwas a baptismal service and say to her, \"Sister Petersen, today is the day of your baptism. The\nfont is filled. Will you come with me?\" She hesitated for a moment, then went with the\nmissionaries, walking the six or seven blocks to our beautiful little chapel and was there\nbaptized.\n<\/p><p>\nIn this conference meeting she sat with one neighbor on one side and two neighbors on the\nother side of her. The one on the one side already had been baptized, and the other two were\nto be baptized the following Saturday, and she said, \"I will never be happy until all my\nfriends and all my neighbors have been baptized,\" and this wonderful soul left the chapel and\nthen came back. She said, after entering the chapel again, \"I cannot leave, the spirit is so great\nin this building. I must shake hands again,\" and then she went off down the street with her\nfriends.\n<\/p><p>\nEvery Latter-day Saint desires to be a missionary. I think that this is in the heart of almost\nevery member; but why is it, my brethren and my sisters, that we are so afraid to bear our\ntestimonies to our neighbors? I think it was the Apostle Paul who said this:\n<\/p><p>\n\"For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me;\nyea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"325\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 325)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(325)\">1 Cor. 9:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen another great prophet of Israel has said this: \"So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a\nwatchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn\nthem from me.\n<\/p><p>\n\"When I say unto the wicked . . . thou shalt surely die; and if thou dost not speak to warn the\nwicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at\nthy hand.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his\nway, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23120\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23120)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23120)\">Ezek. 33:7-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI have often said to the Latter-day Saints, \"If you cannot be a missionary, then at least be a\nLatter-day Saint, that you will not stand in the way by your manner of living, of those who\nwill want to come into the Church.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow there are many wonderful things going on in Europe. Under the inspiration of the Lord\nwe have called thirty-four translators in the various countries. I wish I could tell you the story\nof each one, like Sister Charrier down in a little village in France. She heard the gospel,\naccepted it. We learned that she had a class of pupils whom she was teaching English. Her\npreparations have enabled her to help us with the translations into the French language. And\nshe now is working diligently.\n<\/p><p>\nI am thinking of Immo Luschin Ebengreuth of Graz, Austria, a man who\nheard the gospel message from two missionaries, and said to them before they got into a\nlengthy discussion on the gospel, \"I would ask you only five questions before you go further.\"\nHe was a confirmed member of the Catholic Church, and these are his questions:\n<\/p><p>\n\"1. Does this Church believe in marriage for all eternity?<br \/>\n\"2. Does this Church believe in the punishment for infants who are not baptized?<br \/>\n\"3. Do, in this Church, the rich and the poor have equal opportunity?<br \/>\n\"4. In this Church, do you baptize by immersion for the remission of sin?<br \/>\n\"5. In this Church do you lay on hands for the receiving of the Holy Ghost?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis man had never met the missionaries before, and we inquired as to where he got such\nquestions. His answer was, \"We have not been satisfied with our faith. My wife and I\ndetermined that through prayer and the desire to know that we would find out the true\nChurch.\" The missionaries said, \"Why, these are our teachings,\" and thus Brother Ebengreuth\nwas baptized with his wife. This brother is a skilled interpreter. He speaks English, I am\nconfident, better than I do, and he now will become a translator for the Church of the German\nlanguage.\n<\/p><p>\nThis has been how the Lord has opened the way for us, so that by the end of this year nearly\none hundred textbooks and manuals combined in six languages will have been translated. This\nhas been a tremendous task and could not have been done without the help of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a wide program of micro-filming going on in Europe. This is better known by others\nthan myself, although I have kept an eye on it, and have had some indirect connection with it.\nI have seen the advantages to this work from heeding the counsel of the brethren. They\ninstructed me to meet the ambassadors, the leaders of nations, and this has been my purpose,\nand in each and every country have I taken the time to meet these men when I could.\n<\/p><p>\nIn Norway when the head bishop of the state church carried a personal campaign to the press\nand elsewhere to prevent us from microfilming in that land, and succeeded also in getting it\nbefore the Parliament and when it appeared as though we might lose these privileges, the\nMinister of Education of the country of Norway, who is also the Minister of Religious\nInstruction, rose to his feet and said, \"You cannot stop the Mormon people from doing this\nwork.\" He said, \"I have been to Salt Lake City. I have met these people. I know what they do\nwith these films,\" and he made a defense for us largely because of the association that had\nbeen had with him here and in the land of Norway, and even the head bishop of the state\nchurch had to acknowledge defeat in his effort to prevent us from continuing with this work.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so the Lord is watching over the things that are being done. I am most grateful, my\nbrethren and sisters, to report to you that these wonderful members in the lands of Europe are\nsubstantially true to the gospel of Jesus Christ. I have witnessed in their youth conferences\ntheir adherence to our Church customs and patterns and how they revere the ideals and the\nstandards which have been set for them by our general youth organizations. I have been near\nto their Relief Society meetings and have seen how the influence of our Relief Society\norganization finds its way into their thinking, and they have a desire to do the will of the\nLord. I do not know to what extent we may go in these lands when they have the\ninstrumentation and the facility of proper buildings which they do not have now.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to say to President McKay and President Clark and President Moyle and the brethren\nhow grateful these people are for the coming building program that will see many chapels go\nup in places where they are so sorely needed to further the Church program and which also\nwill provide greater tools of missionary work to carry on this great responsibility given to us\nas a Church to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ unto the people.\n<\/p><p>\nLet me tell you just briefly of my two visits behind the Iron Curtain to be in attendance with\nthe Saints at Leipzig where other of our brethren have been. These members live under\nhardened conditions. I said to one brother, \"How do you stand it here?\" He said, \"We\nlearn to follow the paths and the trails that are laid out for us. We\nlearn to do what we are told, then we have no difficulty. Our children are picked up in the\nmorning by bus at 8 a.m. and are delivered home at night. We have no control over their\nschooling nor over what is taught them: referred to by Brother Buehner in the morning\nsession. I was greatly moved to hear the testimonies of our members there.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the district presidents testified what to me is the greatest testimony I have heard in\nEurope: Under such conditions \"no man,\" said he, \"can tell me how to worship God in my\nown heart. Although there are nearly five thousand members in some thirty-nine branches we\nkeep in contact with them as much as we can.\" I thought as we enjoyed this wonderful\npresentation of music here today, that but a few weeks ago, I listened to a combined chorus of\nthe Leipzig and Dresden districts sing, \"Shall the Youth of Zion Falter.\" The look on the faces\nof these young people was most stirring. All that day in our priesthood and leadership\nmeetings, we gave encouragement to safeguard to the fullest extent possible our youth to\ncause them to remain true to the gospel because there are inroads being made.\n<\/p><p>\nHow grateful Sister Dyer and I have been to be associated with these people and with our\nwonderful missionaries, who with clear faces are bearing their testimonies to the peoples of\nEurope, and who are receiving these wonderful responses, and I know with all my heart that\nall this is but the fulfilment of prophecy.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear you my testimony in all humility that this is the work of God. I have seen it in the\nlives of people. I have witnessed it as it causes men and women to change their lives, I have\nseen it become a motivating force for good, and I bear record that Jesus Christ is the Son of\nGod, the Redeemer of the world, the Mediator&mdash;not as it is preached by these predominant\ncountries of the lands of Europe. And do you know that this is the message we declare when\nwe go to the doors of the people the first time? It is through the testimony of our missionaries\nthat the veneer of false concepts and the antiquities of these people are being laid aside for\nthe acceptance of the gospel. It is more powerful than all other things that we do in our\nmissionary work as we look into their faces and bear record that God has raised up a prophet,\nand they are listening to this message.\n<\/p><p>\nWe had a family of seven visited recently by the missionaries where the woman was about to\nclose the door when the elder said, \"I can see you are going to close the door. I am very\nsorry. We have such a wonderful message,\" and we have told them, \"Before any door is\nclosed, you bear your testimony.\" He said, \"Before you close that door I want to bear my\ntestimony to you of these brief things we have stated today,\"  and he bore his testimony. The\ndoor closed, and the missionaries started for their home to their room, and it was raining.\nThey had reached about a half a block when they heard a voice, it was the young boy of the\nhome, fourteen-years-old, who said, \"Dad wants you to come back,\" and they went back and\nthe father said, \"I listened to your message at the door on the other side as you spoke to my\nwife, and I did not think much of it until that young man bore his testimony, and then\nsomething came over me that I have never experienced before, and now I have to know what\nthis is.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI had the privilege of shaking hands with this family of seven and hearing them testify that\nGod had made known to them that these things are true. This is the reason why so many are\naccepting the gospel in the lands of Europe. We are proclaiming the message by testimony\nand through the Spirit.\n<\/p><p>\nI ask the blessings of our Heavenly Father upon the great missionary work and upon our\nbeloved brethren who lead us, without whose inspiration and direction we could not go\nforward in these lands and throughout the world, I pray in Jesus' name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
