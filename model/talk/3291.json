On the threshold of an organizing age he established the most nearly perfect social mechanism in the modern world, and developed a religious philosophy that challenges anything of the kind in history, for completeness and cohesion. And he set up the machinery for an economic system that would take the brood of Fears out of the heart of man\u2014the fear of want through sickness, old age, unemployment, and poverty\u201d (New York: MacMillan, 1946, p. 4).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/the-contributions-of-the-prophet-joseph-smith.p34\" class=\"\">Of what great significance to the world are the contributions of Joseph Smith, the Prophet? Let us consider some of them. Perhaps most important is the concept of the Godhead. The New Testament clearly established that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are three separate and distinct beings, yet there are many in the Christian world who do not accept this or believe in a personal God in whose image we were created. The Father and the Son actually appeared personally to Joseph Smith to establish their personality and image. When the boy came out of that grove he knew the facts\u2014that God is in form like a man. He speaks, he is considerate and kind, he answers prayer. He is a personal God for he called Joseph by name. His Son is a like and distinct person and is the Mediator between God and man.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/the-contributions-of-the-prophet-joseph-smith.p35\" class=\"\">The occurrence in the grove was a flat contradiction that revelation had ceased, that God no longer communicated with man. Old and New Testament scriptures repeatedly affirm the need for continuous revelation. Consider the words of Amos:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/the-contributions-of-the-prophet-joseph-smith.p36\" class=\"\">\u201cSurely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10473\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10473)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10473)\">Amos 3:7<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/the-contributions-of-the-prophet-joseph-smith.p37\" class=\"\">Following the revelations he received, Joseph Smith taught with authority many truths recorded in the Bible which previously had not been understood. Some of these are: that we are spirit children of God, that we had a premortal existence, that we are in mortality to prove ourselves, and that if we are faithful we can return to live eternally in the presence of God and through eternal progression become Godlike.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/the-contributions-of-the-prophet-joseph-smith.p38\" class=\"\">Another teaching closely related with the fatherhood of God and the sonship of man is the actuality of Satan, the devil.

A man\u2019s body is sacred and is not to be violated. Any willful impairment is an affront to God, and therefore care of the body is of spiritual significance. To assist us in keeping our bodies as proper abodes for our spirits, Joseph Smith received a revelation known as the Word of Wisdom, which if followed will bring great blessings to body and mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/the-contributions-of-the-prophet-joseph-smith.p44\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph taught of salvation for the dead, which, though taught in the New Testament, had not been understood nor practiced since the days of the Apostles.
