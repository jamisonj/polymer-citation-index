McKay<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">David O. McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i> April 1957,  pp. 4-9<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy beloved brethren and sisters, this is one of the most humbling experiences of my life. In\nanticipation of this moment I have spent many hours of thought and many hours of prayer. I\nthink there is no experience in the world that makes one of the General Authorities, or any\nman who holds the priesthood, feel so dependent upon inspiration, as standing before a vast\naudience of members of the Church. I do pray for your sympathetic attention, and for the\nguidance of the Holy Spirit. It is a joy to meet with you, notwithstanding the sense of\nresponsibility.\n<\/p><p>\nI have chosen as a text, to indicate a line of thought: \"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord,\nLord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is\nin heaven\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34824\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34824)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34824)\">Matt. 7:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe thought is, as expressed by James: \"But be ye <i>doers<\/i> of the word, and not hearers only.\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26126\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26126)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26126)\">James 1:22<\/a><\/span>, italics added). That applies\nparticularly to each individual. Salvation is an\nindividual affair. We are not saved as congregations, nor as groups, but we are saved as we\ncome into the world as individuals, and the Lord's purpose is to save the individual, each\nbeing precious in his sight.\n<\/p><p>\nBefore commenting further upon the theme, I desire to express commendation for the progress\nmade by the Church and individual groups during the last six months and during the past\nyear.\n<\/p><p>\nThis has been another prosperous year for the Church. Increased faith and \nmore active participation in Church activity are evidenced almost weekly by the reports of the\nGeneral Authorities of their assigned visits throughout the stakes and missions. Some\nillustrative facts follow:\n<\/p><p>\n1. <i>Regarding Sacrament Meetings<\/i>: Attendance at Sacrament meetings during 1956 is the\nhighest yet attained in the Church&mdash;15,000 more people attended last year than in 1955, and\nthat was the highest percentage of attendance to date. From 1945 to 1955 there has been a\ngradual increase of attendance at Sacrament meetings of eleven percent.\n<\/p><p>\n2. <i>Regarding Tithes and Offerings<\/i>: Greater devotion is evident, also, in the increase of tithes\nand offerings. It appears that a larger proportion of the members are contributing a larger\nproportion of their incomes, the result being that tithes and offerings have increased during\nrecent years substantially more than the growth in membership and the indicated increase in\naverage incomes of the Saints. Those two items point to increased spirituality, the very object\nof our organization.\n<\/p><p>\n3. <i>Regarding the Welfare Plan<\/i>: We are grateful for the progress that has been made in the\nwelfare plan. Hundreds of projects have been established, and bishops' storehouses equipped\nto supply in a helpful and dignified manner the needs of the poor. The priesthood generally\nand the Relief Society sisters have responded to this important work. We are especially\ngrateful to the members of the general Church welfare committee, who have given direct\nsupervision to this program for a period of over twenty years. The basic concepts of the\nwelfare program have been tested and proved to be sound.\n<\/p><p>\nNevertheless, we must constantly remind ourselves of the primary purpose of the plan, which\nis&mdash;<i>First<\/i>, to supply in a helpful and dignified manner food, clothing, and shelter to every\nperson so in need.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Second<\/i>, to assist men and women who, through misfortune, ill-luck, or disaster, find\nthemselves without gainful employment, to become once again self-supporting.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Third<\/i>, to increase among the members of the Church the true spirit of the brotherhood of\nChrist, having in mind in all their service the divine saying, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it\nunto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34836\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34836)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34836)\">Matt. 25:40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n4. <i>Missionary Work<\/i>: In 1956 there were 23,923 baptisms performed in foreign and stake\nmissions, which is an increase of nine percent over the previous year.\n<\/p><p>\n5. <i>Schools in Polynesia<\/i>: I am sure you will be interested in the progress of the schools in\nPolynesia. The New Zealand College will be finished and ready for opening in February\n1958. It is composed of an administration building, a student center building, which is made\nup of two full-scale gymnasiums, cafeteria, kitchen, student center, lounge, swimming pool,\nlocker rooms, and an auditorium combined with the gymnasium which will seat 4500 people.\nThere are five classroom wings which will accommodate 1000 day students, three girls'\ndormitories and three boys' dormitories, accommodating 600 students. I will not go into\nfurther detail, but I do wish to express a word of commendation to those who are working\ndown there. I should name them, but there is one man and his wife, particularly, who deserve\ncommendation, and that is Brother George R. Biesinger and his sweet wife. He has left his\nbusiness here and devoted years to this project, and will continue to do so until the\ncompletion of the temple and the completion of these schools.\n<\/p><p>\nIn Samoa, there are new additions to the Pesega School in Western Samoa. The school is\ncompleted also at Vaiola, Savaii, Samoa, and one at Sauniatu, Samoa. Another is now under\nconstruction at Mapusago, Samoa.\n<\/p><p>\nIn Tonga at the Liahona College, two large wings to the boys' and girls' dormitories, a new\nclassroom wing, a new dining hall with kitchen facilities combined, and dormitories for the\nmen and women teachers are under construction.\n<\/p><p>\nIn Hawaii, the new Junior College now being built at Laie, Oahu, will accommodate not\nfewer than 750 students. The large shop building and the main building are already nearing\ncompletion.\n<\/p><p>\nAll of these school buildings of the South Pacific are being built by labor\nmissionaries called from America, and local labor missionaries called from their\nrespective homelands. The work is going forward in a completely satisfactory manner, and in\nall areas is on schedule. Commendation and appreciation are extended to the local labor\nmissionaries and to the Saints who contribute to the sustenance of these labor missionaries in\nthis vast building program, as well as to our labor missionary supervisors called from\nAmerica.\n<\/p><p>\n6. <i>Regarding Our Temples<\/i>: Near Auckland, New Zealand, on December 22, 1956, another\nmilestone in Church history was passed. Elder Hugh B. Brown, Assistant to the Council of\nthe Twelve, under appointment from the First Presidency, conducted the services and\nofficiated at the cornerstone laying ceremonies for the New Zealand Temple.\n<\/p><p>\nCornerstone laying ceremonies for the London Temple will be held at Newchapel, Surrey\nCounty, England, May 11, 1957. Elder Richard L. Evans of the Council of the Twelve will\nofficiate at the ceremonies. The ground for this temple was broken August 27, 1955.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren and sisters, to partake of the spirit of faith and activity in the Church is inspiring.\nMembership therein is at once a privilege and a blessing.\n<\/p><p>\nLooking around us, we are convinced that we are living in an era of great progress,\nembracing wonderful inventions and scientific discoveries. Man's search for the unknown has\nled him out of the world of matter literally into the realm of space. He splits the atom, sets\noff horrifying hydrogen explosions, flies through space at a speed faster than sound, is taking\nsteps to build satellites to accompany the earth in its revolutions. Many of the imaginations of\nJules Verne are now commonplace realities. Flying to the moon is an achievement now\nconsidered possible.\n<\/p><p>\nThe earth itself, figuratively speaking, is shrinking. The railroad, automobiles, airplanes, have\nmade New York and San Francisco next-door neighbors, and Greenland and the South Pole\nonly a few days apart!\n<\/p><p>\nBut with all these things comes increased responsibility to every individual, man, woman, and\nchild. New inventions bring greater opportunities, but demand more activity, more strength of\ncharacter. Many years ago you and I read the following comment by Roger W. Babson, the\ngreat statistician:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Although the airplane opens up boundless opportunities, it also threatens limitless perils. All\ndepends upon whether we can match this flood of new material powers with an equal gain in\nspiritual forces. The coming generation can see in a minute more than the former generation\ncould see in a week. The coming generation can outhear and outtravel the former generation.\nHorsepower has expanded beyond all dreams. But what about manpower? What about\nspiritual power, and the power of judgment, discretion, and self-control? Unless there is a\ndevelopment of character equal to this enlargement of physical forces there is sure trouble\nahead. Twenty-five years ago an intoxicated man might tip the buggy over, but commonly the\nold horse would bring him home. Today a driver under the influence of liquor maims and\nkills. Tomorrow, therefore, is something to ponder over. Without moral progress in pace with\nphysical progress the airplane will merely make dissipation more disastrous, immorality more\nwidespread, and crime more efficient. One result of the automobile has been to put hell on\nwheels; the airplane will put hell on wings unless righteousness, too, is speeded up. On the\ndevelopment of character depends whether the airplane shall bring prosperity or calamity.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAlong this same line also are the comments of Mr. A. Cressy Morrison, eminent scientist\nwho, fearing \"a period of regression for true civilization,\" says: \"If we have read the signs of\nthe times correctly, or even if we have exaggerated some of the symptoms, the only salvation\nfor mankind will be found in religion. However, it must be a sound Christian religion,\nvitalized by its own primitive ideals; aware of the progress of science, rid of prejudice against\nfair speculative intelligence, and soaring high above frontiers. Never in her two thousand\nyears has the Church had a more urgent call and a nobler opportunity to fulfill her obligations\nas the comforter and guide of humanity.\" That is from <i>Man Does Not Stand Alone<\/i> (p.\n264), a book I commend to all earnest seekers after truth.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, as our text says, \"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the\nkingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34825\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34825)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34825)\">Matt. 7:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nToo many people in the world are sitting and giving only lip service to God; too many have\nforgotten him; too many are denying him; too many are crying, \"Lord, Lord,\" but fail to\nfollow his principles. Many of us through selfishness are lingering near the edge of the animal\njungle where Nature's law demands us to do everything with self in view. Self-preservation is\nthe first law of mortal life, but Jesus says, \"He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that\nloseth his life for my sake shall find it\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34827\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34827)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34827)\">Matt. 10:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe first experience of our Savior after his baptism, and after having been acknowledged by\nhis Father as his Only Begotten Son, was to triumph over selfishness on the Mount of\nTemptation.\n<\/p><p>\nApplicable today is Paul's admonition to the Philippians, given over nineteen hundred years\nago:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore, my beloved . . . [and that branch in Philippi was the first branch in Europe] work\nout your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to\nwill and to do of his good pleasure.<br \/>\n\"Do all things without murmurings and disputings:<br \/>\n\"That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a\ncrooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41246\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41246)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41246)\">Philip. 2:12-15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAn outstanding doctrine of the Church is that each individual carries the responsibility to\nwork out his own salvation, and salvation is a process of gradual development. The Church\ndoes not accept the doctrine that a mere murmured belief in Jesus Christ is all that is\nnecessary. A man may say he believes, but if he does nothing to make that belief or faith a\nmoving power to do, to accomplish, to produce soul growth, his professing will avail him\nnothing. \"Work out your own salvation\" is an exhortation to demonstrate by activity, by\nthoughtful, obedient effort the reality of faith. But this must be done with a consciousness that\nabsolute dependence upon self may produce pride and weakness that will bring failure. With\n\"fear and trembling\" we should seek the strength and grace of God for inspiration to obtain\nthe final victory.\n<\/p><p>\nTo work out one's salvation is not to sit idly by dreaming and yearning for God miraculously\nto thrust bounteous blessings into our laps. It is to perform daily, hourly, momentarily, if\nnecessary, the immediate task or duty at hand, and to continue happily in such performance as\nthe years come and go, leaving the fruits of such labors either for self or for others to be\nbestowed as a just and beneficent Father may determine.\n<\/p><p>\nI am not unmindful of the scripture that declares: \"by grace are ye saved through faith; and\nthat not of yourselves: it is the gift of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21693\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21693)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21693)\">Eph. 2:8<\/a><\/span>).\nThat is absolutely true, for man\nin his taking upon himself mortality was impotent to save himself. When left to grope in a\nnatural state, he would have become, and did become, so we are told in modern scripture,\n\"carnal, sensual, and devilish, by nature\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8983\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8983)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8983)\">Alma 42:10<\/a><\/span>).\nBut the Lord, through his grace,\nappeared to man, gave him the gospel or eternal plan whereby he might rise above the carnal\nand selfish things of life and obtain spiritual perfection. But he must rise by his own efforts\nand he must walk by faith.\n<\/p><p>\n\"He who would ascend the stairway leading upward to eternal life must tread it step by step\nfrom the base stone to the summit of its flight. Not a single stair can be missed, not one duty\nneglected, if the climber would avoid danger and delay and arrive with all safety and\nexpedition at the topmost landing of the celestial exaltation.\" The responsibility is upon each\nindividual to choose the path of righteousness, of faithfulness and duty to fellow men. If he\nchoose otherwise and as a result meets failure, misery, and death, he alone is to blame.\nPresident Brigham Young, speaking on this thought, once said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"If Brother Brigham should take a wrong track and be shut out of the kingdom of heaven, no\nperson will be to blame but Brother Brigham. I am the only being in\nheaven, earth, or hell, that can be blamed. This will equally apply to every Latter-day Saint.\nSalvation is an individual operation. I am the only person that can possibly save myself.\nWhen salvation is sent to me, I can reject or receive it. In receiving it, I yield implicit\nobedience and submission to its great Author throughout my life, and to those whom he shall\nappoint to instruct me; in rejecting it, I follow the dictates of my own will in preference to\nthe will of my Creator.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn thus emphasizing individual effort, I am not unmindful of the necessity of cooperation.\n<\/p><p>\n\"There is a destiny which makes us brothers,<br \/>\nNone lives to self alone;<br \/>\nAll that we send into the lives of others<br \/>\nComes back into our own.\"\n<\/p><p>\n                    &mdash;Edwin Markham\n<\/p><p>\nA single, struggling individual may be stalled with his heavy lead even as he begins to climb\nthe hill before him. To reach the top unaided is an impossibility. With a little help from\nfellow travelers, quorums, or wards, he makes the grade and goes on his way in gratitude and\nrejoicing.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is in harmony with the teachings of Jesus, \"who sought to perfect society, not by popular\nagitation or by reorganization, but by perfecting the individual. He recognized the fatal fallacy\nin the dream of those who hoped to make a perfect state out of imperfect individuals. The\nideal social state, which he described as the kingdom of God, is a commonwealth in which all\nmen are united and governed by a commanding love both for God and for their neighbors.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe present-day turmoil and bitter strivings threaten to undermine basic foundations of\nChristian relationship. Liberty, freedom of speech, self-government, faith in God, and\nparticularly faith in the efficacy of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, are facing a\nbombardment from the ranks of error such as the world has seldom if ever witnessed.\n<\/p><p>\nToo many men quail under the impending onslaught, and cry vainly, \"What can we do?\" To\nmembers of the Church, to men everywhere, the Church answers, \"Keep the commandments\nof God,\" as named specifically, for example, by the Prophet Nephi:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . God hath given a commandment that all men should have charity, which charity is love.\nAnd except they should have charity they were nothing . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And again, the Lord God hath commanded that men should not murder; that they should not\nlie; that they should not steal; that they should not take the name of the Lord their God in\nvain; that they should not envy; that they should not have malice; that they should not\ncontend one with another; that they should not commit whoredoms; and that they should do\nnone of these things; for whoso doeth them shall perish\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3619\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3619)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3619)\">2 Ne. 26:30,32<\/a><\/span>).\nI commend this chapter to you.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Avoidance of Intoxicating Liquor<\/i>: In this dispensation the Lord has warned mankind against\nthe use of intoxicating liquors. In violation of that warning alcoholism is now a national\nproblem. Americans spend the staggering sum of more than nine billion dollars every year for\nalcoholic beverages. In addition, lost wages, crime, and accidents traced to alcoholism cost\nAmericans another $667,000,000 a year. (Facts given by Dr. Chester A. Winyard in \"Alcohol\nand Human Tissues.\" See <i>Deseret News<\/i>, February 10, 1954.)\n<\/p><p>\n\"Alcoholism has become a major public health problem, for it is 155 times more prevalent\nthan polio, 11 times more prevalent than tuberculosis, and 6 times more prevalent than cancer.\nIf the number of alcoholics continues to increase during the next ten years as it has during the\npast ten years, alcoholism will soon affect every family in the United States.\" So says a\npamphlet published by the National Committee for the Prevention of Alcoholism, Washington,\nD. C., July 22 - August 2, 1956.\n<\/p><p>\nOver a hundred years ago the Lord said through the Prophet Joseph Smith that \"tobacco . . . is\nnot good for man\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13570\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13570)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13570)\">D&amp;C 89:8<\/a><\/span>).\nLuther Burbank in the \"Dearborn <i>Independent<\/i>\" says:\n<\/p><p>\n\"How much would you know about tobacco if, upon the tombstone of everyone killed by it\nwere inscribed, 'Killed by tobacco'?\n<\/p><p>\n\"You would know a lot more about it than you do now, but you would not\nknow all, because tobacco does more than kill. It half-kills. It has its victims in the\ncemeteries and in the streets. It is bad enough to be dead, but it is a question if it is not\nsometimes worse to be half-dead&mdash;to be nervous, irritable, unable to sleep well, with\nefficiency cut in two and vitality ready to snap at the first great strain. This seems like\nexaggeration. It isn't! It is well within the truth.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Let me tell you how tobacco kills. Smokers do not all drop dead around the cigar lighters in\ntobacco stores. They go away and, years later, die of something else. From the tobacco trust's\npoint of view, that is one of the finest things about tobacco. The victims do not die on the\npremises, even when sold the worst cigars. They go away, and when they die, the doctors\ncertify that they died of something else&mdash;pneumonia, heart disease, typhoid fever, or what\nnot.\n<\/p><p>\n\"In other words, tobacco kills indirectly and escapes the blame,\" confirming what the Prophet\nJoseph said before, \"tobacco . . . is not good for man\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13571\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13571)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13571)\">D&amp;C 89:8<\/a><\/span>).\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Approximately 38,000,000 Americans are regular cigarette smokers, although a million and a\nhalf have quit smoking entirely in the last eighteen months, according to estimates based on a\nsurvey made by the US Bureau of the Census for the National Cancer Institute of the Public\nHealth Service, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The 38,000,000 cigarette\nsmokers include 25,000,000 men and 13,000,000 women.\" (See \"America's Smoking Habits,\"\n<i>The Improvement Era<\/i>, April 1957.)\n<\/p><p>\nIn the Church no teacher who indulges in smoking should be permitted to teach our children\nin Primary and Sunday School. Through the Prophet Joseph the Lord gave the Word of\nWisdom to all. It is time, in the light of revelation and the discoveries of science, that this\nChurch upholds its principles regarding these things.\n<\/p><p>\nThe best way to prevent indulgence in these harmful habits is to refuse to tamper with them.\nLet each youth decline the first invitation to indulge, remembering that \"The soul that is\nworth the honor of earth, is the soul that resists desire.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is\nappointed, in all diligence.<br \/>\n\"He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he that learns not his duty and\nshows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13587\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13587)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13587)\">D&amp;C 107:99-100<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church is thriving, as indicated in my opening remarks. Let us rejoice in her progress. To\nsee the discoveries of science and to be the recipients of inventions and new appliances as\nthey relieve daily life of former drudgery give hope and encouragement; but to overcome\ndifficulties, to control temper, to subdue and conquer passion, in whatever form, to feel in\none's heart a growing love for truth and for one's fellow men, to sense a nearness to God our\nFather, and to recognize the whisperings of his voice through the Holy Spirit, fill the soul\nwith joy and make life worth living.\n<\/p><p>\nThat obedience to the principles of the restored gospel gives to man these blessings, I testify\nin the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
