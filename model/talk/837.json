Ivins, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1956, pp. 100-102<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy beloved brethren and sisters: It is a sobering thought to face you wonderful people and\nhope to say some encouraging word.  My own ministry has been one of an effort to\nencourage myself and others to do better the things we have to do as members of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is almost twenty-five years since I first faced a congregation in this capacity. I have\nenjoyed those twenty-five years very much.  There have been a few echoes come back that\nhelp has been rendered to people.  When it comes, it is always satisfying.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe that without reserve I can bear testimony to every thought which\nhas been delivered in this conference. My hope is that the testimony I undertake to bear to\nyou today may be consonant with the spirit of those to which we have listened and that\nperchance some help may come from it.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have heard several times the testimony that Jesus Christ actually is the Son of God, that\nhe was tabernacled in the flesh, that he was resurrected from the dead to open up the privilege\nfor all of us to return to the presence of God and stand judgment for our deeds. We have\nheard a humble prayer the Prophet Joseph Smith succeeded in opening the gates of heaven\nand having appear to him God the Father and Jesus Christ, through which a renewed\ntestimony as to the individuality of the Father and the Son has come back to the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have heard also that the heavens were reopened; the Angel Moroni appeared to the\nProphet Joseph Smith and instructed him over many occasions in his duties and\nresponsibilities, and further than that that the priesthood was restored through the\ninstrumentality of heavenly beings.\n<\/p><p>\nEvery one of those questions is a vital question to every member of the Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nI think that all of us here without doubt would testify as to the truth of all of these things.  It\nis that testimony on which the vitality of the Church rests.\n<\/p><p>\nNot the least important of all of these events was the restoration of the priesthood, because the\npriesthood is the order in which the ordinances essential to exaltation in the kingdom of God,\nwhen properly observed and when our action justifies it, are performed. Without that\npriesthood the Church could not function.  There is a difference between the gospel and the\nChurch and the priesthood.  Each has its function in our lives. The priesthood then becomes\nas important to us perhaps as any other phase of our existence.\n<\/p><p>\nWe were told last night of the tremendous priesthood there is in the Church as compared with\nthat of other religious groups. My experience and the checking that I have made over the last\ntwo or three years indicates to me that there would be on an average in the stakes of Zion\nabout ten percent of the members of the stakes who bear the Melchizedek Priesthood.  That\nis, when united with simple, pure faith, the greatest power that there is among men.\n<\/p><p>\nI represent one group of that priesthood, twenty odd thousand of them.  It has been my effort,\nalong with my colleagues over these twenty-five years, to stimulate that group to greater\nservice and greater activity.  Now, if it is real, and we testify that it is, that that priesthood\nhas come back and that priesthood is a right to function on behalf of God, our Heavenly\nFather, in the ordinances essential to man's blessing and happiness, then we who accept it\nhave a tremendous responsibility, and our problem is to magnify that calling.\n<\/p><p>\nI take it that every man who allows me to place my hands upon his head and ordain him to\nan office in that priesthood, promises actually or impliedly that he will do what may be within\nhis power to magnify that calling.  It is interesting indeed when we contemplate the\npossibilities of it.\n<\/p><p>\nTo show you how near some of us are to the actual restoration of that Priesthood, let me tell\nyou this: Joseph Smith received the Melchizedek Priesthood from Peter, James, and John.\nJoseph Smith ordained Joseph Young a seventy in the Melchizedek Priesthood. Joseph Young\nordained my father at the age of seventeen as a seventy in the Melchizedek Priesthood. And\nmy father ordained me an elder. There are others who are closer to it than that.  But when we\nthink that we are actually only a step or two away from an ordination by Peter, James, and\nJohn to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and when we think that that ordination makes us emissaries\nand representatives of God our Heavenly Father; when we further think that without the\nfunctioning of that priesthood we would never gain an exaltation in the kingdom of God, it is\nalmost overwhelming, is it not?\n<\/p><p>\nNow, what do we do about it? I am as much interested in what we are going to do with it as\nthe fact that we have it, and it means that we must work with ourselves and work with those\npeople over whom we can have an influence. We cannot dream ourselves into exaltation.\nDreams have no value unless they prove to be incentives for greater activity.\nIt is fine to dream about the possibilities of life, but until we do something about it, those\ndreams are useless.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we scan the statistics of the Church, we discover that there are too many, far too many\nof the people who have accepted this responsibility who do little or nothing about it.  There is\nthe group which should have our especial attention.  The seventies of the Church are\nmissionaries.  Their field of labor is worldwide.  Being worldwide, it includes their own\nhouseholds.  It is the responsibility of every seventy, of every elder, and every high priest in\nthe Church, first, to purify his own life, bringing it into harmony with the teachings of the\ngospel, that thereby he may gain the peace of mind and the happiness of which you have just\nheard, and then after doing that, he has the responsibility of extending his influence and his\nefforts beyond his own.\n<\/p><p>\nI feel that the primary responsibility of us individually is to bring into harmony himself and\nhis household to the teachings of the principles of the gospel. Could we do that, what a\nwonderful power there would be in the priesthood which we bear.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we understand our responsibilities, this priesthood is a thing of great power. We have been\ntold today that Satan and his emissaries are rampant in the earth, walking up and down trying\nto deceive people.  God knew that would happen when he placed man on the earth and when\nhe expelled Satan from the heavens, but he, it seems to me, prepared a way to meet it, and\nthat preparation is the life that justifies the receipt of the priesthood and the actual receipt of\nthat priesthood through proper channels.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe that it is within the power of every man who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood to\nsay, \"Get thee behind me, Satan\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31427\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31427)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31427)\">Luke 4:8<\/a><\/span>).\nWhenever a man holding that priesthood yields to the\ntemptations of the flesh and does the evil that is rampant in the earth, it is an admission on\nhis part that he does not appreciate his priesthood, that he does not accompany the gift of that\npriesthood with a faith that makes it powerful.\n<\/p><p>\nYou know and I know, you have had many illustrations of the effective use of the priesthood\nwhen it is combined with faith.  Besides the healing of the sick, the gift which is not given to\nall people I admit but which comes only through the union of faith and priesthood, there are\nmany other gracious and wonderful gifts that come to us through the exercise of this\npriesthood.  It is such a tremendous power that if every one of the men who hold the\nMelchizedek Priesthood would fully magnify his calling, united with a perfect faith, we could\nalmost control the activities of the society in which we live, nation-wide and international. \nThe trouble is that we just do not do it.  We do not do what we know we ought to do, and it\nis saddening to study our statistics and find how many people fail to appreciate this wonderful\nthing which came back to us in the most miraculous way.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren, what are we going to do about it?  We have it.  It is our privilege to use it.\nWill we use it wisely or will we let it lie idle and rust out? I hope that we will be conscious\nof this tremendous responsibility because it is just that, that we will go away from this\nconference with a conscious responsibility of the priesthood, that when we go back we will\nbear testimony to our own and to others of the wonderful things that we have heard today,\nthat we will bring our own lives as nearly as possible into complete harmony with the gospel\nof Jesus Christ, for we have been told today that to attain to the highest exaltation in the\nkingdom of God, to sit with God in the councils of heaven, enjoying the privileges of eternal\nprogress and eternal increase, that eventually at least we will have to learn to obey all of the\ncommandments of God.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us start about it now, brethren and sisters; let us do better tomorrow than we did\nyesterday or than we have done today, with all of our wonderful resolutions.  Let us make\ntomorrow a better day.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us in the effort, I pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
