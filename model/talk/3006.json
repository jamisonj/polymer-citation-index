Proper observance of this law includes a number of important elements, such as fasting with purpose, prayer, commitment to action, and consecration. In its fulness, the law of the fast benefits both those who fast and those who stand in need.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/a-vision-of-the-law-of-the-fast.p5\" class=\"\">The importance of this relationship cannot be overemphasized. The one who consecrates his fast by a generous offering is in fact providing food, clothing, and shelter for the poor and is sanctified by his sacrifice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/a-vision-of-the-law-of-the-fast.p6\" class=\"\">President Spencer W.

These sacred funds have blessed many Church members in all parts of the world. Those who received were certainly blessed, but those who gave were even more so. When we give generously to the Lord, we receive from him that which is of greater value than our offering. When we keep his commandments, \u201cHe doth immediately bless\u201d us.

Mason, who was associated with us in the Welfare Services Department, was visiting one of the developing countries of the world. A teenage boy asked him if he would please bring a gift to President Kimball. The gift was a sketch he had drawn of a peacock with its tail feather in full fan. It was done so carefully\u2014each feather in place\u2014in such beautiful color. As we saw it, we marveled at the artistry of the boy and asked further about him. In response, Dr. Mason handed us a picture of this lad. He had no arms. A birth defect had left him crippled, and yet he had developed his artistic talent so as to draw this beautiful, intricate rendering by holding his pencils between his toes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/a-vision-of-the-law-of-the-fast.p11\" class=\"\">We were asked if the Church had funds that could be used to fit him with artificial limbs. We assured the mission president there were funds, but only after his family had done all they could. When we had the assurance that the family had complied with Welfare Services principles, funds were made available.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/a-vision-of-the-law-of-the-fast.p12\" class=\"\">We later received another picture, showing his newly acquired arms and hands, with a report of how proud he was to be able to dress himself now. He had been greatly blessed by those who lived the law of the fast and were generous in their offerings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/a-vision-of-the-law-of-the-fast.p13\" class=\"\">We reaffirm the principle of making a generous offering as an integral part of the regular monthly fast, and encourage everyone to take full opportunity to be in total harmony with this principle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/a-vision-of-the-law-of-the-fast.p14\" class=\"\">In addition to providing the means for taking care of the poor among us, fasting is a principle of power which helps us to individually achieve righteous purposes in our lives. The scriptures contain many accounts of the power of fasting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/a-vision-of-the-law-of-the-fast.p15\" class=\"\">Consider the great lesson of fasting taught by Alma, who gave up the judgment seat to do the Lord\u2019s work. After great spiritual success in various cities, Alma traveled to the city of Ammonihah, where, the scriptures report, \u201cSatan had gotten great hold upon the hearts of the people,\u201d and \u201cthey would not hearken unto the words of Alma.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9260\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9260)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9260)\">Alma 8:9<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/a-vision-of-the-law-of-the-fast.p16\" class=\"\">Alma labored much in the spirit and wrestled with God in mighty prayer.

Alma followed the angel\u2019s instructions. He reports that this time he fasted many days before re-entering the city.

He found that righteous forces had been at work, preparing the way before him. When he entered the city again, he met a man, apparently a stranger, of whom he asked, \u201cWill ye give to an humble servant of God something to eat?\u201d The stranger\u2019s response was, \u201cI know that thou art a holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an angel said in a vision: Thou shalt receive. Therefore, go with me into my house and I will impart unto thee of my food.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9262\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9262)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9262)\">Alma 8:19\u201320<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/a-vision-of-the-law-of-the-fast.p19\" class=\"\">This was Amulek, who had been specially prepared to receive a prophet of God and who would share in his work. As a result of his fast, Alma was assured by the Lord through the witness of Amulek that heavenly forces were prospering his efforts, and he was filled with the spirit of the Lord\u2019s work. Alma ended his fast, and then he and Amulek did a marvelous work which resulted in the righteous being called out of Ammonihah. The remainder of the city, being left without excuse, was found in the full ripeness of iniquity and destroyed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/a-vision-of-the-law-of-the-fast.p20\" class=\"\">The greatest lesson ever taught with regard to fasting was taught by the Savior himself.

First, there needs to be a purpose associated with fasting. The Savior himself used the fast to gain inner strength and spiritual power during a crucial part of his ministry. The law of the fast can likewise bless us in times of temptation and stress if we are willing to live it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/a-vision-of-the-law-of-the-fast.p28\" class=\"\">Alma fasted to gain the strength and wisdom to accomplish a mission in which he had just failed. He knew he must have divine help if he were to succeed. After Alma had fasted for the purpose of accomplishing his mission, the Lord intervened and great power was given him. This same blessing is available to us if we will but take advantage of it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">Praying with a purpose is very important to the living of the law.
