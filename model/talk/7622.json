The Central America Mission then included Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, and Honduras. The closest temple was the Mesa Arizona Temple. The trip required us to travel five days each way, crossing six borders. The financial sacrifice for most of those who went was great. They sold their television sets, bikes, skates, and anything else they could sell. We traveled in two uncomfortable buses day and night. Some of the members had used all their money to pay for the bus fare and had taken only crackers and margarine to eat on the way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/holy-temples-sacred-covenants.p10\" class=\"\">Why do members of the Church so willingly and happily make such great sacrifices to go to the temple?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/holy-temples-sacred-covenants.p11\" class=\"\">I have never forgotten the great outpouring of the Spirit we experienced during the three days we spent at the Mesa Temple.
