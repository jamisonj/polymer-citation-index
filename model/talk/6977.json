A half hour later, the driver stopped for two missionaries. When they got on, we asked them where in the world they were going so early. Zone conference! And they were determined to do whatever it took to get there. At 2:00 <span class=\"small\">A.M.<\/span> two more elders boarded the bus and enthusiastically hugged their fellow missionaries. This scene repeated itself every half hour as the bus climbed the remote mountain road. By 5:00 <span class=\"small\">A.M.<\/span> we had 16 of the Lord\u2019s finest as fellow passengers and were basking in the Spirit they brought on board.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/standing-spotless-before-the-lord.p5\" class=\"\">Suddenly, we screeched to a halt. A massive mud slide had buried the road. Jeff said, \u201cWhat do we do now, Dad?\u201d Our friends Stan, Eric, and Allan had the same concern. Just then, the zone leader shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s go, elders. Nothing is going to stop us!\u201d And they scrambled off the bus! We looked at each other and said, \u201cFollow the elders,\u201d and we all sloshed through the mud slide, trying to keep up with the missionaries. There happened to be a truck on the other side, so we all hopped aboard. After a mile, we were stopped by yet another mud slide. Once again the elders plowed through, with the rest of us close behind. But this time there was no truck. Boldly, the zone leader said, \u201cWe will be where we are supposed to be even if we have to walk the rest of the way.\u201d Years later, Jeff told me how those missionaries and this photo inspired and motivated him tremendously as he served the Lord in Argentina.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/standing-spotless-before-the-lord.p6\" class=\"\">Although we overcame the mud slides, we were all spotted with mud.
