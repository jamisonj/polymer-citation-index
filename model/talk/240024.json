And this spirit of murder and persecution still exists. It was exhibited in the mobbing and drivings of our people from Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, and other places, in the martyrdom of Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum in Carthage jail, more recently in the assassination of Elder Joseph Standing, and again only a few days ago in an attempt to murder Brother John T. Alexander, one of our Elders in Georgia, the particulars of which you have doubtless read in the newspapers. In the face of such diabolical outrages as these, there is not much room to boast about our liberties. But I merely refer to these things to show that the spirit that actuated men in former times is at work today; irrespective of times, forms of government, places or circumstances. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v24n552\"> Nevertheless, as I have said, it is necessary that we pass through certain ordeals, and that we be tried. But why is it that we should be tried? There is just the same necessity for it now that there was in former times. I heard the Prophet Joseph say, in speaking to the Twelve on one occasion: &#x201C;You will have all kinds of trials to pass through.

It is the crowns, principalities, the powers, the thrones, the dominions, and the associations with the Gods that we are after, and we are here to prepare ourselves for these things. We are after eternal exaltation in the Celestial Kingdom of God. And we want to feel that this is the main object of existence, that this is why we were born, and that God has revealed Himself from the heavens, restored the Holy Priesthood and gathered us together in order that we might form a nucleus through whom He could communicate His will; through whom He could accomplish His work upon the earth and introduce the Gospel of the Son of God to the nations of the earth and gather together His elect from the four quarters of the globe;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"84924\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 84924)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(84924)\">D&amp;C 33:6<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"93152\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 93152)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(93152)\">Moses 7:62<\/a><\/span> through whom He could introduce upon the earth the principles that exist in the heavens, that we might be taught to do the will of God on the earth as it is done in the heavens,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"63437\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 63437)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(63437)\">Matt. 6:10<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"67520\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 67520)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(67520)\">Luke 11:2<\/a><\/span> that we might be a pure people, a virtuous people, a holy people, free from the vices and corruptions of the world, and that we might learn the laws of light, truth and intelligence from the fountain of all intelligence, for we are told the glory of God is intelligence.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"89096\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 89096)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(89096)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span> This is why we have been gathered together.

We had just been driven out of the State of Missouri, and were in the midst of very hard times. You sometimes think you have hard times now. Why, you do not know anything about it. They tell us they persecute us for polygamy now. What did they persecute us for when we had no polygamy? Yet we were driven from our homes, and many of our people&#x2014;some of them old revolutionary soldiers&#x2014;were shot down like dogs in many instances. We were driven from pillar to post, from one place to another, robbed, pillaged and despoiled of everything we had. There are many of the brethren and sisters here, I presume, who are acquainted with these things. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v24n555\"> Well, the Twelve were told to go to the Far West, some 200 miles distant from Quincy, Illinois, where many of the Saints were then staying. We did not have railroads then whereby we could travel as we do now. We had to go with our teams, and we had to go among a people that would kill everyone of us as quick as they would rattlesnakes. We were told to go and lay the foundation stone of the Temple, and thus fulfill the revelation that had been given on the subject.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"90721\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 90721)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(90721)\">D&amp;C 118:5-6<\/a><\/span> Arrived at the spot we prayed and sang hymns.

Why, men that held the Priesthood of the Son of God had, among other things, been instructed to teach this principle, that it was a gathering dispensation, the keys of which had been conferred upon Joseph Smith, he in turn had conferred the power upon others, and the Elders went forth and preached this Gospel with the power associated therewith. That is the great secret why people gather here. We have come here in order that we may fulfill the will of God, and the word of God, and the law of God. We have come out of Babylon.
