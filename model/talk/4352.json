It is a source of great truth. It teaches us about the life and ministry of the Master. From its pages we learn of the hand of God in directing the affairs of His people from the very beginning of the earth\u2019s history. It would be difficult to underestimate the impact the Bible has had on the history of the world. Its pages have blessed the lives of generations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-gift-of-modern-revelation.p5\" class=\"\">But as generation followed generation, no additional scripture came forth to the children of men. Without additional revelation to guide them, men began to interpret the Bible differently. Numerous churches and creeds developed, each using the Bible as its authoritative source.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-gift-of-modern-revelation.p6\" class=\"\">But this in no way lessens the worth of the Bible. That sacred and holy book has been of inestimable worth to the children of men. In fact, it was a passage from the Bible that inspired the Prophet Joseph Smith to go to a grove of trees near his home and kneel in prayer. What followed was the glorious vision that commenced the restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth. That vision also began the process of bringing forth new scripture to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Bible in bearing witness to a wicked world that Jesus is the Christ and that God lives and loves His children and is still intimately involved in their salvation and exaltation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-gift-of-modern-revelation.p7\" class=\"\">Through the prophet Nephi, the Lord warned against those who might say that the Bible was all the scripture the world would need.

I love all of these sacred volumes. This afternoon I would like to speak particularly about the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants. These two great books of latter-day scripture are bound together as revelations from Israel\u2019s God for the purpose of gathering and preparing His people for the second coming of the Lord. As President John Taylor wrote, the bringing forth of these two sacred volumes \u201ccost the best blood of the nineteenth century\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18529\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18529)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18529)\">D&amp;C 135:6<\/a><\/span>), namely the lives of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-gift-of-modern-revelation.p12\" class=\"\">To the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord said, \u201cThis generation shall have my word through you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18391\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18391)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18391)\">D&amp;C 5:10<\/a><\/span>). The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants are part of the fulfillment of that promise.

The Book of Mormon title page declares its purpose is threefold: to show what great things the Lord has done, to teach of the covenants of the Lord, and to convince both Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-gift-of-modern-revelation.p14\" class=\"\">Section 1 of the Doctrine and Covenants is the Lord\u2019s preface to the book. The Doctrine and Covenants is the only book in the world that has a preface written by the Lord Himself. In that preface He declares to the world that His voice is unto all men (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18384\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18384)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18384)\">D&amp;C 1:2<\/a><\/span>), that the coming of the Lord is nigh (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18386\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18386)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18386)\">D&amp;C 1:12<\/a><\/span>), and that the truths found in the Doctrine and Covenants will all be fulfilled (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"18390\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18390)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18390)\">D&amp;C 1:37\u201338<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-gift-of-modern-revelation.p15\" class=\"\">Each of these two great latter-day scriptures bears powerful and eloquent witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. Virtually every page of both the Doctrine and Covenants and the Book of Mormon teaches about the Master\u2014His great love for His children and His atoning sacrifice\u2014and teaches us how to live so that we can return to Him and our Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-gift-of-modern-revelation.p16\" class=\"\">Each of these two great latter-day books of scripture contains the knowledge and the power to help us live better lives in a time of great wickedness and evil.

We have seen the marvelous fulfillment of that prophecy in our generation. The Book of Mormon has come forth out of the earth, filled with truth, serving as the very \u201ckeystone of our religion\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43167\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43167)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43167)\">Introduction to the Book of Mormon<\/a><\/span>). God has also sent down righteousness from heaven. The Father Himself appeared with His Son to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The angel Moroni, John the Baptist, Peter, James, and numerous other angels were directed by heaven to restore the necessary powers to the kingdom. Further, the Prophet Joseph Smith received revelation after revelation from the heavens during those first critical years of the Church\u2019s growth. These revelations have been preserved for us in the Doctrine and Covenants.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-gift-of-modern-revelation.p24\" class=\"\">These two great works of scripture, then, become a major tool in the Lord\u2019s hand for preserving His people in the latter days: the Book of Mormon, written under the hand of inspiration for our day, preserved through the centuries to come forth in our time, translated by the gift and power of God. It is the keystone of our religion. It is the keystone of our doctrine. It is the keystone of our testimony. It is a keystone in the witness of Jesus Christ. It is a keystone in helping us avoid the deceptions of the evil one in these latter days.
