We have been reminded again of the life, death, and resurrection of Christ the\nLord, the Redeemer of mankind. We are again reminded of his charge to the apostles of old\nwhen he appeared to them the third time after his resurrection, and speaking directly to Peter:\n<\/p><p>\nHe saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved\nbecause he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou\nknowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27345\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27345)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27345)\">John 21:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is generally understood that the Lord here enjoined those engaged in his work to teach the\ngospel, to impart spiritual strength to those who may be spiritually weak. As those who\nprofess to follow the Savior, none of us can escape that serious responsibility. \n<\/p><p>\nAnd yet, is there not another requirement in that injunction, which, though temporal in nature,\nmay not be disregarded? Can we satisfy the concern of the resurrected Lord&mdash;\"Feed my\nsheep\"&mdash;when we leave his children as we find them, \"an hungred,\" \"thirsty,\" \"a stranger,\"\n\"naked,\" \"sick,\" and \"in prison\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34235\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34235)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34235)\">Matt. 25:35-36<\/a><\/span>),\nwithout satisfying their need?\n<\/p><p>\nCHRISTIAN ATTRIBUTE OF CHARITY\n<\/p><p>\nSo important is the literal fulfilment of this sacred requirement made of all disciples of Christ\nthat he taught this fundamental principle:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least\nof these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34236\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34236)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34236)\">Matt. 25:40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nCan our prayers ascend to the throne of mercy and be heard and answered, as we humbly\ndesire, unless we practice charity in our lives? Must we not give of ourselves and of our\nmeans in helping others? Good intentions alone are not enough. Charity is not a virtue to\nexpect in others only. It is the all-important Christian attribute to be found in ourselves.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Apostle Paul placed it in its proper position when he wrote:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest\nof these is charity (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"166\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 166)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(166)\">1 Cor. 13:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn one way or another all sincere Christian people have recognized and have endeavored to\nput into effect this fundamental principle of the gospel. Miserable as the world is, it would be\nvery much poorer without the efforts of those who have tried sincerely to follow this\ninjunction of the Master. \n<\/p><p>\nAnd yet, have we not been remiss? Have we not been prone to think that we have done our\nfull duty when we have given a few dollars to organized relief and felt satisfied that the\nhungry would be fed and the naked clothed? Have we not lost sight of the timeless axiom that\n\"the gift without the giver is bare\"? \n<\/p><p>\nHave we not been guilty of preaching work and industry on the one hand, while destroying\nindependence and promoting idleness on the other?\n<\/p><p>\nHave not many of us broken the law given ancient Israel&mdash;\"Honor thy father and thy\nmother\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22588\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22588)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22588)\">Ex. 20:12<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;in\npassing to others the care of those who in our younger years cared for us?\n<\/p><p>\nCARE OF THE POOR\n<\/p><p>\nThese matters are of the very essence of the gospel. We of the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints so believe. We have accepted as divine pronouncements:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . ye must visit the poor and the needy and administer to their relief\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12450\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12450)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12450)\">D&amp;C 44:6<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . thou wilt remember the poor, and consecrate of thy properties\nfor their support that which thou hast to impart unto them, with a covenant and a\ndeed which cannot be broken (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12445\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12445)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12445)\">D&amp;C 42:30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nUnder what we call our Church welfare program we have endeavored out of the consecrations\nof the people to meet our obligation as we have seen it. Because this is a problem common to\nall men of good will, I think you may be interested in a brief, general explanation of the\nprinciples on which we have sought to build.\n<\/p><p>\nESTABLISHMENT OF WELFARE PROGRAM\n<\/p><p>\nWhen this program was established President Heber J. then said its\n<\/p><p>\n. . . primary purpose was to set up insofar as it might be possible, a system under\nwhich the curse of idleness might be done away with, the evils of the dole\nabolished, and independence, industry, thrift, and self-respect established among\nour people. The aim of the Church is to help people to help themselves. Work...\n[should become] the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership.\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe that it is the mandate of Almighty God, binding now as when given anciently, that\n<\/p><p>\nIn the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for\nout of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23531\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23531)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23531)\">Gen. 3:19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nRESPONSIBILITY OF ABLE-BODIED\n<\/p><p>\nWe also accept as the word of the Lord:\n<\/p><p>\nThou shalt not be idle for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the\ngarments of the laborer (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12447\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12447)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12447)\">D&amp;C 42:42<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis great principle does not deny to the needy nor to the poor the assistance they should\nhave. The wholly incapacitated, the aged, the sickly are cared for with all tenderness, but\nevery able-bodied person is enjoined to do his utmost for himself to avoid dependence, if his\nown efforts can make such a course possible; to look upon adversity as temporary; to combine\nhis faith in his own ability with honest toil; to rehabilitate himself and his family to a position\nof independence; in every case to minimize the need for help and to supplement any help\ngiven with his own best efforts.\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe it is seldom when men of rigorous faith, genuine courage, and unfaltering\ndetermination, with the love of independence burning in their hearts, and pride in their own\naccomplishments, cannot surmount the obstacles that lie in their paths.\n<\/p><p>\nWe know that through humble, prayerful, industrious, God-fearing lives, a faith can be\ndeveloped within us by the strength of which we can call down the blessings of a kind and\nmerciful Heavenly Father and literally see our handicaps vanish and our independence and\nfreedom established and maintained.\n<\/p><p>\nOf course, those in unfortunate circumstances need help. They need food and clothing and\nwarmth ministered by a friendly hand. And they also need opportunity and encouragement\nand direction.\n<\/p><p>\nNEEDS MET THROUGH CONSECRATED EFFORTS\n<\/p><p>\nThrough the consecrated efforts of the membership of the Church both needs may effectively\nbe met. The care of the needy is the concern of every member. Carefully planned programs of\nproduction and conservation are designed to meet the first need. It is a common sight among\nus to see men of various vocations and economic stations working together early of a morning\nor late of an evening in the field, or in the cannery without thought of material recompense.\n<\/p><p>\nThe products of their labors are gathered into local bishops' storehouses, and there, under\nwise, inspired leadership, the best possible use is made of these supplies without the usual\ncosts of distribution.\n<\/p><p>\nWe seek constantly to be on hand, day in and day out, to meet promptly and efficiently any\nemergency among our people. We hope never to have on hand too little or be too late in its\ndistribution.\n<\/p><p>\nThe cardinal commandment is \"Love thy neighbour as thyself\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34222\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34222)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34222)\">Matt. 22:39<\/a><\/span>). Our welfare work has been\ncharacterized by one of our leaders, as a \"neighbor to neighbor plan.\" I quote his words:\n<\/p><p>\nAll welfare work is carried out with fairness and justice, and without\ndiscrimination, fear, or favor. There are no politics, church or otherwise, in the\nadministration of the Church plan. No one has anything to gain or lose in a\nmaterial way by any relief which he may extend under the plan. Those carrying\nit out have neither friends to reward nor enemies to punish.\n<\/p><p>\nThis puts into the relief a personal sympathy that is wholesome for all, and tends\nto prevent imposition and overreaching There is an infinity of difference between\nthe sack of flour that comes over the back fence from your next door neighbor and\na sack that is sent to you from Washington. The one hallows the giver, and raises\nand inspires, with the human love and sympathy behind it, him who thankfully\neats it; the other debauches the hand which doles out that which is not his, and\nembitters and enslaves him who with maledictions devours it. (President J. Reuben\nClark, Jr., Estes Park Discussion.)\n<\/p><p>\nGUIDING PRINCIPLES IN WELFARE WORK\n<\/p><p>\nIn all phases of the work we seek to give to those who receive assistance the opportunity to\nhelp, to manage, and to distribute among the needy that which is theirs. The crowning\nprinciple is that each man shall give to the Church that of which he is capable and in return\nbe assured of the assistance that he needs.\n<\/p><p>\nThe second need, that for encouragement and opportunity, and direction, poses another\nproblem. But usually there is in each Church group, training, experience, and education\nsufficient to encourage and direct toward a more permanent solution than that afforded by\nsupplying only food, clothing, and housing on an emergency basis.\n<\/p><p>\nWe can never get away from the fundamental differences that exist in the dispositions and\nneeds of people. And because all cases are handled by local ecclesiastical officers on a\nsympathetic basis, a permanent solution to the ills which caused the need can often be\neffected.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is ordinarily a very fine margin between success and failure. Frequently a friendly\nhand, a kind suggestion, a charitable deed avoids the worst and produces the best. No one\nthus helped loses his self-respect or his desire to progress. He retains his ambition and is soon\non the way to assist others, even as he was helped.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is another important problem in this connection, a problem of deep religious\nsignificance. It can be truthfully said of both men and women in the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints that they do not do their full duty, so long as all means are not shared with\nmother or father, brother or sister, son or daughter in need.\n<\/p><p>\nCARE OF AGING PARENTS\n<\/p><p>\nMuch could and should be said upon this subject in a day when it appears to be popular\nthroughout the nation to do what can be done by sons and daughters to qualify aging parents\nfor public relief. Some go to the extent of encouraging parents to deed to their children the\nproperty which they acquired in their productive years for protection and security in their old\nage&mdash;all to better prepare the parents to meet the requirements of law for maximum old age\npensions and assistance.\n<\/p><p>\nChildren are not always conscious that in this they have been guilty of a double error: first, in\nunjustly enriching themselves out of the lifetime savings of their parents; and secondly, in\nshirking a sacred obligation to care for their parents. The magnitude of the offense increases\nwhen the fact is appreciated that we have received from the Lord a divine command to take\ncare of our own. Paul said:\n<\/p><p>\nBut if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own\nhouse, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2802\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2802)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2802)\">1 Tim. 5:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nCHARITY BEGINS AT HOME\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe that charity must begin at home. Can we hope to be charitable to the stranger if\nlove does not abound in the family? A sure step in the direction of improvement and progress\nin our own lives comes when we share with mother or father in their dependence as they\nshared with us in their productive years.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus, in his life, did not overlook this true principle. Practically his last act in mortal\nexistence was to provide for his mother:\n<\/p><p>\nNow there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister,\nMary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom\nhe loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!\n<\/p><p>\nThen saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that\ndisciple took her unto his own home\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27341\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27341)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27341)\">John 19:25-27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe cannot as children ignore our obligations to our parents by passing responsibility for their\ncare to others. Inherent in the welfare program of the Church is this fundamental teaching.\nAnd through its facilities provision is made so that no child need ignore his or her sacred\nobligation, and no aged parent need be shunted or put on public assistance.\n<\/p><p>\nWe seek to avoid the need for public charity for those whom we love, and to whom we are\ndeeply obligated. We endeavor to refrain from indebtedness and obligations we cannot meet.\nWe aim to meet fully every commitment made. Through consecration of our labors, through\nindividual initiative and effort, through mutual consideration and helpfulness, motivated by the\nspirit of the Christ, we have sought to assist one another. The fruits have been faith,\nindependence, self-reliance, pride in self-accomplishment, family solidarity, love, and\nappreciation one for another.\n<\/p><p>\nSurely there is need for this in the world today. Surely its necessity is enjoined in the\nMaster's direction, \"Feed my sheep\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27348\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27348)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27348)\">John 21:17<\/a><\/span>).\nIn no other way can we hope to bring to pass God's\npurposes here upon earth and to usher in a reign of peace and good will among men.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
