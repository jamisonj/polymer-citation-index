It is quite customary for faithful members of the Church to testify to their faith and knowledge of the truth of this work wherever and whenever opportunity occurs. It is desirable and expected that before one joins the Church he will have an individual assurance of the truth of the doctrines we teach, that the gospel we proclaim is the restored plan of life and salvation, that it is not a new religion but the eternal gospel, the keys, principles, and doctrines of which were restored to men on earth by heavenly messengers who held these keys and this authority in previous dispensations and when the Lord and his apostles were upon the earth in the meridian of time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-matter-of-personal-testimony.p4\" class=\"\">People who are inclined to rely entirely upon reason in reaching conclusions find it difficult to accept as reliable those things that cannot be proved by the five senses.

In the same way we may know and bear testimony also to the truth of the restored gospel, that that same Jesus lives today and is our Redeemer and Savior. It may be revealed to man by God through the gift and power of the Holy Ghost, for by that means can we know all things that it is expedient for us to know. The source of that testimony is the rock of revelation upon which the church of Christ is built, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

That testimony must be firm and true. It must be built upon the rock of revelation. It must be such as to withstand the winds of criticism and the storms of persecution that may be hurled against the Church. It must be made firm by a righteous life. As we grow in understanding of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, our understanding of the purpose of life increases and our faith in God\u2019s representatives is magnified in our minds.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-matter-of-personal-testimony.p31\" class=\"\">Our missionaries as they go into the world with the message of the restoration bear testimony to the truth of this latter-day work.

The strength of this church is in the testimony and faith of its members, and every member may have that testimony if he will seek it through study and sincere prayer and if he will keep the commandments the Lord has given us. That testimony will become a knowledge of the truth of this work.

These people have testified that the Holy Ghost has made manifest unto them that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God, chosen before the foundation of the earth was laid to be the instrument in the hands of the Lord in preparing the way for the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in this dispensation, the dispensation of the fulness of times. Further, that those who have succeeded the Prophet Joseph Smith as prophets of the Lord\u2019s church, including Spencer W. Kimball, our present prophet and president, have held and do hold the keys to the kingdom of God upon the earth, which, among other things, give authority for and the responsibility of carrying the message of the restored gospel to all mankind that no one may be left without an excuse. The Prophet Joseph sealed his testimony with his blood, as many others have done since the gospel was restored to earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-matter-of-personal-testimony.p39\" class=\"\">After an association of more than fifty years with the leaders of the Church here upon the earth\u2014prophets, seers, and revelators of this dispensation\u2014during which period of time I have witnessed the inspiration and revelation of the Lord to his servants, I add my testimony that the Spirit of the Lord has borne witness to my soul that these things are true.
