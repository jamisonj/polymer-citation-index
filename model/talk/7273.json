Rather, he pressed forward by rallying the more experienced members of the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood quorums to help prepare new converts from Africa and Latin America for their priesthood responsibilities. The newer brethren were taught how to hold the trays while passing the sacrament, how to kneel and reverently bless the bread and water. Their more seasoned, often younger brethren, practiced along with them the words of the sacramental prayers so they would feel confident in giving them. Then, together, all the brethren discussed the sacred nature of this important priesthood ordinance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/to-grow-up-unto-the-lord.p20\" class=\"\">We\u2019ve all had experiences where we\u2019ve had to demonstrate our determination to serve others and our willingness to press forward in faith.
