If I correctly interpreted his argument, his answer was,\n\"No&mdash;a man cannot truly be a Christian without belonging to a Christian church.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI do not propose on this occasion either to support or oppose the conclusion reached by the\nreverend gentleman. The reasons he presented seemed plausible to me, and I have no doubt\nthey seemed so to many of his listeners. I should like to use the theme of his arresting address\nto bring forward some thoughts and concepts I have on the nature and vitality of the Christian\nreligion.\n<\/p><p>\nJust what is Christianity, and what does it mean to be a Christian? In assuming to make\ncomment on these important questions, I wish it to be understood that I make no pretention to\nscholarship or academic learning on the subject matter involved. I believe\nthat academic learning is not itself essential for me or any other man to reach some important\nconclusions. We are told that things of the Spirit in divine revelation are so plain and simple\nto those of faith and understanding that he \"who runs may read.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSurely most, if not all, Christians will agree that any adequate concept of the Master must\ninvolve a spiritual interpretation. When the Savior uttered those great words, \"I am the way,\nthe truth, and the life,\" it is entirely clear that he had no intention of defining merely a moral\ncode of which he was the exemplar, for following these words he declared a great spiritual\ntruth which lies at the basis of the whole Christian faith when he said: \". . . no man cometh\nunto the Father but by me\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27856\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27856)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27856)\">John 14:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHerein lies the very crux of the question which the minister proposed: Can a man be a\nChristian without allying himself with a Christian church? Is it sufficient that one adopt the\nChristian virtues in his life&mdash;be unselfish kind, considerate, long-suffering, patient, gentle,\nserving his fellow man after the pattern set by the Savior? Is this alone sufficient? There is no\nquestion that a man so living commands the utmost respect and esteem of good people. There\nis no question but that such a life is filled with happiness and satisfactions&mdash;satisfactions that\nendure. Is all this good living of itself enough?\n<\/p><p>\nAt this point I must introduce to my friends&mdash;my fellow members of the Church are well\nacquainted with it&mdash;a scripture from modern revelation, which brings clarity to our thinking.\nThese are the words of the Lord to his Prophet: \"And verily, verily, I say unto you, he that\nreceiveth my gospel receiveth me; and he that receiveth not my gospel receiveth not me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13729\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13729)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13729)\">D&amp;C 39:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow if it is essential to receive the gospel in order to receive the Christ, what follows? To\nanswer this we must understand and define the gospel. Is the gospel itself anything more than\nthe sum total of the Savior's divine attributes and qualities? I think that all who give careful\nconsideration to the scriptures and the works of the Master will agree that it is. Perhaps the\nmost famous of all definitions of the gospel is that given by Paul when he said: \". . . I am not\nashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that\nbelieveth\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42739\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42739)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42739)\">Rom. 1:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is certainly not difficult to gather from the words, \"power of God unto salvation,\" a\nmeaning beyond that of a moral code for living based upon the attributes of the Savior. The\ngospel as a power unto salvation must embrace not only all the Christlike characteristics of\nliving, but also the means essential to salvation. These indispensable means or essentials for\nsalvation have been clearly set forth by the Savior on numerous occasions and in\nunmistakable terms. He prescribed ordinances and proclaimed their indispensable nature. He\ndeclared to John the Baptist who protested his application for baptism that baptism \"becometh\nus to fulfil all righteousness\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34918\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34918)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34918)\">Matt. 3:13-16<\/a><\/span>).\nTime and again he and his apostles after him\nexhorted all to repentance and baptism and to faith, firm and abiding faith in him and the\nholy gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Paul, his apostle, certified that there was but one authentic gospel. These are his words:\n\"But though we or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which\nwe have preached unto you, let him be accursed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23255\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23255)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23255)\">Gal. 1:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd further he declares: \"But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of\nme is not after man.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For I neither received it of man neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23256\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23256)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23256)\">Gal. 1:11-12<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd the Christian scriptures are replete with the injunction that the gospel of\nour Lord is to be preached \". . . to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42290\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42290)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42290)\">Rev. 14:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf there should be any uncertainty in the mind of anyone professing to be Christian as to the\nessentiality of the gospel and its ordinances, it seems to me it should be completely resolved\nby the final charge to his disciples, given in almost the closing hours of his mortal life, when\nhe uttered these portentous words: \"And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power\nis given unto me in heaven and in earth.<br \/>\n\"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the\nFather, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<br \/>\n\"Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with\nyou alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34995\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34995)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34995)\">Matt. 28:18-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow if gospel ordinances are essential they must be administered, and in logical sequence it\nfollows that they must be administered by those having a delegation of authority to do so. So\nit follows also that the delegation of authority must come from one source only&mdash;the Author\nof the gospel plan, the Christ, who derived his authority from the Eternal Father. Those who\nheld and exercised such authority in ancient Israel, as in the Meridian of Time, were endowed\nwith what is called \"priesthood,\" being a divinely bestowed commission to represent the\nFather and the Son and perform the ordinances of the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nThis divine authority is a special kind of power, differing widely in many respects from other\nforms of delegated authority. I am indebted for a description of its nature and constituency to\na modern revelation, unique so far as I know in the whole field of theological learning. This\nis the revelation: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and\n. . . the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of\nrighteousness.<br \/>\n\"That they may be conferred upon us it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or\nto gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon\nthe souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens\nwithdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to\nthe priesthood or the authority of that man\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13797\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13797)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13797)\">D&amp;C 121:36-37<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHere is a divine endowment, a marvelous gift to man, which may be lost by failure to\nexercise the power in its true meaning and spirit. It has been lost, my brothers and sisters and\nfriends, to men of old as in modern times by failure both to understand its true nature and to\nexercise its functions in a manner compatible with the spirit and essence of the power itself.\n<\/p><p>\nListen to these lovely words further defining the nature of this holy power:\n<\/p><p>\n\"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by\nlong-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;<br \/>\n\"By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy,\nand without guile&mdash;<br \/>\n\"Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let\nvirtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence\nof God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from\nheaven\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13801\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13801)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13801)\">D&amp;C 121:41-42,45<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe priesthood which the revelations so define was lost to those following his apostles when\nthey failed to preserve the spirit and essentials of this divine power, just as the Lord said in\nthe revelation it would be: \"Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13798\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13798)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13798)\">D&amp;C 121:37<\/a><\/span>),\nare the words of the Lord. When it was lost, it had to be restored, and it had to be restored\nauthentically.\n<\/p><p>\nThe powers of the priesthood may never be assumed. They must always be conferred, and of\ncourse by someone having the power to confer. My friends I wish you to know&mdash;and I hope\nyou will not regard it as presumptuous in me to inform you&mdash;that the powers of the Holy\nPriesthood have been conferred authentically in modern times. Time will not permit me to\ndetail all the circumstances attendant upon this bestowal of divine power, but I give it to you\nas my considered judgment and my firm conviction that there is evidence&mdash;credible and\nreliable evidence&mdash;to support and verify the account of such bestowal as contained in the\nrecords of the Restored Church of our Lord. And in addition to such credible evidence I\nbelieve that an open-minded investigator will discover from the operations of this divine\npower results, benefits, and blessings corroborative of the divine authenticity of the Holy\nPriesthood as it exists today in this sorry world which so much needs it.\n<\/p><p>\nNow we return to the specific theme with which we began&mdash;the relationship\nof a Christian to a church. Perhaps I had better begin with a few statements which may seem\nrather trite. The kingdom of God is a kingdom, not a democracy. The king is the author and\nsource of the law, the judge, and the omnipotent administrator. He and he only prescribes the\nrules governing eligibility for membership in his kingdom. I grant that this may sound\narbitrary and dogmatic. In organizations formed by men no such autocratic power would be\ntolerated. But the kingdom of our Lord is not an organization formed by men. Liberty loving\nmen can accept such omnipotent power only because they have faith and complete confidence\nin the beneficence of such power.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat then is the standing of a so-called Christian with reference to the kingdom of God? Is\nhe rightly classified as Christian unless he has taken the steps necessary to receive the gospel\nof our Lord and enter into his kingdom? I believe, my friends, that a careful survey of all\npertinent scriptures, as well as the whole history of Christ's work among men, will\ndemonstrate that only by the complete acceptance of the Christ as our Lord, and subscribing\nto all the conditions and requirements of his holy gospel, including its sacred ordinances\ngoverning induction into his kingdom, can a man fully justify a claim to the honorable\ndistinction of being a Christian. So it seems to me that the crucial question is not so much\nwhether a man must belong to a church to be a Christian, but whether he has prepared\nhimself and taken the necessary steps to enter into the kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nIt would seem beyond question that there could not be more than one kingdom of the Lord.\nSo the concern of all who seek Christian salvation must be: Where is that kingdom? Where is\nit set up in the earth that men may come to it and receive its transcendent blessings? This is a\ndelicate question because the feelings of people about religion are deep and sensitive. No one\nlikes to offend. I assure you I do not, but I would be untrue to my calling if I did not\nundertake to the best of my ability to give to all men the revelations of the Lord about this\nquestion: Where is the kingdom of God set up in the earth?\n<\/p><p>\nFirst I must take you back to an ancient prophecy with which many are familiar. You will\nremember that when Daniel was asked to interpret the king's dream of the great image whose\nhead was of gold, whose breast and arms were of silver, whose belly and thighs were of\nbrass, with legs of iron and feet of clay, he uttered these portentous words: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet\nthat were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.<br \/>\n\"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and\nbecame like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10644\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10644)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10644)\">Dan. 2:34-35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen follows a description of the kingdoms represented by parts of the image which the king\nsaw, and finally following a description of the kingdoms of the world, these words: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never\nbe destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces\nand consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10645\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10645)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10645)\">Dan. 2:44<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis and other prophecies of ancient days predict with certainty the setting up of a kingdom\nof God in the earth. In the mind and heart of the prophets no mere mystical kingdom is\npredicted, but an actual institutional power which shall not only have sway among men, but\namong the kingdoms and establishments of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nIn a later day, after the Savior had completed his ministry on the earth, to his beloved apostle,\nJohn, came the following revelation: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach\nunto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,<br \/>\n\"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is\ncome: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of\nwaters\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42292\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42292)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42292)\">Rev. 14:6-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is true that times are not set in these revelations for the fulfillment of the\nprophecies therein contained, but all will agree that they contemplated a time of fulfillment.\nThat time came, my friends, more than a century ago in the free land of America with\nguarantees of liberty sufficient to protect men in the free expression of religious convictions. I\nthink in no other land at the time of fulfillment could the great spiritual experiences lying at\nthe foundation of a great cause have been tolerated sufficiently to come to fruition.\n<\/p><p>\nIn this land of liberty fulfillment came. The predictions of old came to pass. The prophets\nwere vindicated. Through the instrumentality of an intelligent, unsophisticated young man of\ngreat faith, through men of humility the Lord's kingdom was set up in the earth, his own true\nChurch established with the power of the Holy Priesthood to administer the ordinances of the\ngospel, and with the same organization that the Christ himself gave to men when he\nministered in flesh among them.\n<\/p><p>\nI hope you will realize, my friends, that it is impossible in this short period of time to present\nin any detail and with any sufficient measure of adequacy the circumstances which justify the\nstatement which I have made in your hearing. All I can do in these few minutes is to give\nyou assurance that proof is available, proof not only for mental assurance but soul conviction\nas well, which in my humble judgment is sufficient to satisfy the searcher after the truth.\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, if you would be truly Christian, if you would be classified as a disciple of our dear\nSavior, I hold out to you the one sure way of achieving that great distinction. Come into his\nkingdom through the door which is open to all who will abide his law and his gospel. Come\nto participate in blessings and high privileges which surpass even the vision of your highest\nhopes and ambitions.\n<\/p><p>\nI have one more thought to give you, fearing that some may appraise my remarks as too\nfanatical and visionary. I remember years ago reading a book written by Walter Lippman,\nwho I think has the reputation of being a rather keen analyst of human affairs. Writing of\nman and religion, he said in substance that they who give serious thought to religion are of\ntwo classes&mdash;the humanists and the authoritarians. Either one must interpret the spiritual and\nreligious in terms of human origin, attributes, and characteristics, or in terms of a God of\nrevelation, power, and authority.\n<\/p><p>\nWell, I am of the latter class. I believe in God implicitly. I believe in the divinity of our Lord\nand Savior as the Son of God. I believe that the Lord has revealed himself to men in days\npast, and that he has not denied to his children of later generations the blessing and benefit of\nhis revelations. I am convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt that his gospel has been\nrestored in its fulness with all its ordinances, and the powers authentically to administer them\nin these last days. I give you my solemn witness that his kingdom is set up in the earth, and\nthat it is established forever; that they whom he has chosen to be his special representatives\nfrom period to period have not been pretenders. I have lived long enough to have known\npersonally four, and two more at a distance, of the nine Presidents who have presided over the\nChurch since its beginning, and I have had intimate association with our leader who guides\nthe Church today for more than fifty years. Of my own knowledge I testify that these revered\nleaders and their associates in the Presiding Councils of the Church, acting under the authority\nof the Holy Priesthood, have administered the affairs of the kingdom with the fear of God in\ntheir hearts, fearing to offend him in any degree, and seeking to serve him and his children\nwith humility and complete dedication.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I must ask all of you, my friends, not to forget that truth is not determined by numbers,\nnor the number of its adherents. Christ began alone. Then as always, as the old saying goes,\n\"God and one man are a majority.\" With him we are safe.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray for spiritual understanding to come to all our dear brethren and sisters in this world,\nthat men may know in their hearts what it truly means to be a Christian, a disciple of Christ.\nThe Lord bless us all, I ask humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
