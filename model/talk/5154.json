And what about the worries the shepherd must have had as he thought about the flock left behind without a shepherd\u2019s care to safeguard its members from predators, accidents, acts of nature, and so on? After all, anyone who knows anything about sheep understands just how prone they are to get into trouble spontaneously, without anyone having to help them.
