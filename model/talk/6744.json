Soon after His intercessory plea that we might become \u201cperfect in one,\u201d Jesus suffered and gave His life to atone for sin. The power of His Atonement can erase the effects of sin in us. When we repent, His atoning grace justifies and cleanses us (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"5418\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5418)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5418)\">3 Ne. 27:16\u201320<\/a><\/span>).
