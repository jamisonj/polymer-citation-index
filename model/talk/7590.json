There are cycles of good and bad times, ups and downs, periods of joy and sadness, and times of plenty as well as scarcity. When our lives turn in an unanticipated and undesirable direction, sometimes we experience stress and anxiety. One of the challenges of this mortal experience is to not allow the stresses and strains of life to get the better of us\u2014to endure the varied seasons of life while remaining positive, even optimistic. Perhaps when difficulties and challenges strike, we should have these hopeful words of Robert Browning etched in our minds: \u201cThe best is yet to be\u201d (\u201cRabbi Ben Ezra,\u201d in Charles\u00a0W. Eliot, ed., <span class=\"emphasis\">The Harvard Classics,<\/span> 50\u00a0vols. [1909\u201310], 42:1103). We can\u2019t predict all the struggles and storms in life, not even the ones just around the next corner, but as persons of faith and hope, we know beyond the shadow of any doubt that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true and the best is yet to come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/let-him-do-it-with-simplicity.p6\" class=\"\">I remember a particular period of my life when I was under unusual stress. There were troubles with my employment, and at the same time, my wife was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. This was one of those times when it felt like the adversary had mounted a frontal assault against me and my family. On days when the stresses and anxieties of our tumultuous life were about to get the best of us, my wife and I found a way to relieve them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/let-him-do-it-with-simplicity.p7\" class=\"\">We drove to a place just a few miles from our home to get away for a few moments of relief from our troubles, talk, and give emotional comfort to each other. Our place was Walden Pond. It was a beautiful little pond surrounded by forests of trees. When my wife was feeling strong enough, we\u2019d go for a walk around the pond. Other days, when she did not feel up to the exertion of walking, we\u2019d just sit in the car and talk. Walden Pond was our special place to pause, reflect, and heal. Perhaps it was partly due to its history\u2014its connection to the efforts of Henry David Thoreau to separate himself from worldliness for a period of years\u2014that Walden Pond offered us so much hope for simplicity and provided such a renewing escape from our overly complex lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/let-him-do-it-with-simplicity.p8\" class=\"\">It was in March of 1845 that Thoreau decided to move out on the banks of Walden Pond and spend two years trying to figure out what life was all about. He settled on a piece of property owned by his good friend Ralph Waldo Emerson. He purchased an old shanty from a railroad worker, and tore it down. From the lumber from the shanty and the lumber from the woods, he constructed his own cabin. He kept meticulous financial records, and he concluded that for a home and freedom he spent a mere $28.12. He planted a garden, where he sowed peas, potatoes, corn, beans, and turnips to help sustain his simple life. He planted two and a half acres of beans with the intent of using the small profit to cover his needs. Small profit indeed: $8.71.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/let-him-do-it-with-simplicity.p9\" class=\"\">Thoreau lived quite independent of time. He had neither a clock nor a calendar in his little cabin. He spent his time writing and studying the beauties and wonder of nature that surrounded him, including local plants, birds, and animals. He did not live the life of a hermit\u2014he visited the town of Concord most days, and he invited others to come into his cabin for enlightening conversations. When the two years ended, he left his cabin behind without regret. He considered the time he had spent there a proper amount of time to accomplish his purpose\u2014to experience the spiritual benefits of a simplified lifestyle. He also felt he had other life experiences ahead of him. It was time to move on and explore other opportunities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/let-him-do-it-with-simplicity.p10\" class=\"\">From his experiences at Walden Pond, Thoreau determined that there were only four things that a man really needed: food, clothing, shelter, and fuel. I would like to expand on each of these four basic needs of life, as well as the spiritual benefits of a simplified lifestyle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/let-him-do-it-with-simplicity.p11\" class=\"\"><span class=\"strong\">\n\t  <span class=\"emphasis\">The first requirement is food. <\/span>\n\t<\/span>As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we possess sacred knowledge from revealed truth about the relationship between the body and the spirit. <span class=\"citation\" id=\"117634\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117634)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117634)\">Doctrine and Covenants 88:15<\/a><\/span> states, \u201cThe spirit and the body are the soul of man.\u201d To bless us both physically and spiritually, the Lord also revealed to us a law of health, telling us which foods and substances are good for the body and which are not.

With their latest styles many fashion designers appear to be trying to make two or three dresses out of the amount of fabric necessary for one. Mostly, they are taking too much off the top and too much off the bottom of women\u2019s clothing, and occasionally they scrimp in the middle too. Men\u2019s fashions are also adopting extreme styles. In my day they would be called sloppy and inappropriate. I believe very casual dress is almost always followed by very casual manners.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/let-him-do-it-with-simplicity.p22\" class=\"\">Many of you are trying too hard to be unique in your dress and grooming to attract what the Lord would consider the wrong kind of attention. In the Book of Mormon story of the tree of life, it was the people whose \u201cmanner of dress was exceedingly fine\u201d who mocked those who partook of the fruit of the tree. It is sobering to realize that the fashion-conscious mockers in the great and spacious building were responsible for embarrassing many, and those who were ashamed \u201cfell away into forbidden paths and were lost\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117398\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117398)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117398)\">1\u00a0Nephi 8:27\u201328<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/let-him-do-it-with-simplicity.p23\" class=\"\">President N.\u00a0Eldon Tanner once cautioned us with these words: \u201cModesty in dress is a quality of mind and heart, born of respect for oneself, one\u2019s fellowmen, and the Creator of us all.

Consistent with these principles and guided by the Holy Spirit, let parents, teachers, and youth discuss the particulars of dress, grooming, and personal appearance, and with free agency accept responsibility and choose the right\u201d (\u201cFriend to Friend,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Friend,<\/span> June 1971, 3).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/let-him-do-it-with-simplicity.p24\" class=\"\"><span class=\"strong\">\n\t  <span class=\"emphasis\">Now let us turn to Thoreau\u2019s third requirement, that of shelter. <\/span>\n\t<\/span>Newspapers are filled with reports of the current housing crisis. We have been encouraged at almost every general conference of the Church I can remember not to live beyond our means. Our income should determine the kind of housing we can afford, not the neighbor\u2019s big home across the street.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/let-him-do-it-with-simplicity.p25\" class=\"\">President Heber\u00a0J.

We should practice and increase our habits of thrift, industry, economy, and frugality. Members of a well-managed family do not pay interest; they earn it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/let-him-do-it-with-simplicity.p27\" class=\"\"><span class=\"strong\">\n\t  <span class=\"emphasis\">Thoreau\u2019s final necessity was fuel. <\/span>\n\t<\/span>We have been hearing a lot about fuel and energy\u2014about their high cost and limited supply, our unsafe and unpredictable dependence on their suppliers, and the need for new and sustainable sources of energy. I leave the discussion of these complicated issues to leaders of government and industry.

What is required to maintain a sufficient store of spiritual fuel? We must acquire knowledge of God\u2019s eternal plan and our role in it, and then by living righteously, surrendering our will to the will of the Lord, we receive the promised blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/let-him-do-it-with-simplicity.p29\" class=\"\">As Elder William\u00a0R.
