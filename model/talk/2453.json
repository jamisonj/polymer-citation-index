As he spoke, I thought in my mind that if all the world would heed this counsel, most all of its problems would be resolved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p4\" class=\"\">One of the basic tenets of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that we believe in continuous revelation. It is our testimony to the world that God communicates to prophets today the same as he did in ancient times. God\u2019s revelations in times past have been sustained and revered in holy scripture. New revelation is the mind and will of the Lord through current prophets, and when they speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost, it is \u201cthe <span class=\"emphasis\">will<\/span> of the Lord, \u2026 the <span class=\"emphasis\">mind<\/span> of the Lord, \u2026 the <span class=\"emphasis\">word<\/span> of the Lord, \u2026 the <span class=\"emphasis\">voice<\/span> of the Lord, and the <span class=\"emphasis\">power<\/span> of God unto salvation.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16322\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16322)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16322)\">D&amp;C 68:4<\/a><\/span>. Italics added.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p5\" class=\"\">This morning we heard from a prophet of God, and he communicated the mind and will of the Lord to all who would listen and receive counsel. Concerning the importance of such an occasion as this, it was President Kimball some years ago who made this observation:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cSunday night, April 7, the great Tabernacle was closed, the lights turned out, and the record machines stopped, the door locked, and another historical conference became history. It will have been lost motion\u2014a waste of time, energy, and money\u2014if its messages <span class=\"emphasis\">are not heeded.<\/span> In the seven two-hour sessions and in the several satellite meetings, truths were taught, doctrines expounded, exhortations given, enough to save the whole world from all its ills\u2014and [he concluded] I mean from <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> its ills. \u2026\u201d (Spencer W. Kimball, \u201cIn the World But Not of It,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Speeches of the Year,<\/span> Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1968, pp. 2\u20133.) He reaffirmed that in our hearts and minds this morning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p7\" class=\"\">I remember hearing President Kimball just the other day quote from Samuel:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the Lord said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2599\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2599)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2599)\">1 Sam. 3:11<\/a><\/span>.) Today our president has caused our ears to tingle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p9\" class=\"\">Now for a few moments I would like to direct some remarks to parents everywhere in this great listening audience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p10\" class=\"\">An oft-quoted passage of scripture and revelation of the Latter-day Saints is one referred to a few moments ago by President Kimball. It\u2019s contained in the Doctrine and Covenants:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the Living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16326\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16326)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16326)\">D&amp;C 68:25<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p12\" class=\"\">I don\u2019t know how many times you have heard this passage of scripture, and appropriately so, but certainly no counsel could be more timely or pertinent to the problems besetting families throughout the world. How many times have parents said to themselves after hearing this message, \u201cI know it\u2019s true and I know what the Lord expects, but how do I <span class=\"emphasis\">do<\/span> it?\u201d In other words, how do I become an effective teacher of the gospel to my own children?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p13\" class=\"\">As I have thought about this, it has been my observation that most parents really want to be good parents. Most want to do a better job.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p14\" class=\"\">May we consider this morning four things that parents can do that will help them to better achieve success in rearing their children in righteousness?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p15\" class=\"\">First, I would itemize the power of parental precept. Parents teach two ways. The first is by precept\u2014or what we say by way of teaching correct principles to our children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p16\" class=\"\">I am reminded of the father who, in gathering his children together one morning, asked, \u201cWhat would you learn of me?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p17\" class=\"\">The reply came, \u201cHow shall we care for our bodies? How shall we play? How shall we work together? How shall we live with our fellowmen? How shall we pray? How shall we know God? For what ends shall we live?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p18\" class=\"\">And the father pondered these words and sorrow was in his heart, for his own life and teaching touched not these things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p19\" class=\"\">You may recall the old farmer who had quite a reputation for being a philosopher. He said, \u201cYou can no more teach what you ain\u2019t got than you can go back to where you ain\u2019t been.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p20\" class=\"\">I recall as a young man when I first heard our text quoted from the Doctrine and Covenants, I went to my own mother and exclaimed, \u201cWell, Mom, how does it feel to have all my sins on your head?\u201d Then she taught me the lesson of that passage. She said, \u201cAh, Paul, you forgot to read carefully what the Lord said. He said that the sin be upon the head of parents if they do not teach their children the principles of the gospel [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"16327\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16327)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16327)\">D&amp;C 68:25<\/a><\/span>]. And you\u2019ve been taught!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p21\" class=\"\">And I had been taught! Thank the Lord for parents who realize their responsibility to instill in their children the principles of the gospel and who follow the counsel of the Lord\u2019s prophets. Parents in the Church today have been counseled to regularly, consistently, and inspiringly hold family home evenings and to take advantage of other great teaching moments to so acquaint their children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p22\" class=\"\">The second way would be the power of parental example. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \u201cWhat you do thunders so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say.\u201d Will you remember this little couplet:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">Parents can tell but never teach<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">Until they practice what they preach.<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p25\" class=\"\">I\u2019m grateful for the example of a father who, as a busy executive of a great supermarket chain, still found the time to demonstrate by his concern that groceries were less important than his boy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p26\" class=\"\">Like many young men, I once had a paper route; and I had to get up early in the morning to deliver them. One morning I woke up and looked outdoors to see one of those torrential Arkansas downpours. I thought we were in for another flood! As I prepared to go out in that rain, my father came into the room dressed in his business suit. \u201cGet in the car, Paul,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you around your route this morning.\u201d This meant that he would have to go without his own breakfast.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p27\" class=\"\">On that morning, in addition to the heavy rain, the papers came late. By the time we had them delivered, it was considerably past the hour that my father had to be to work. And on this particular morning he had scheduled a very important board meeting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p28\" class=\"\">He arrived at the meeting late, walked into the board room, and announced, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late, gentlemen, but I had to deliver my papers this morning.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p29\" class=\"\">Do you think that there was ever any doubt in my mind as to my father\u2019s greatest concern? Interestingly, I don\u2019t recall too many lessons my parents verbally taught, but their example is still a part of me till this day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p30\" class=\"\">Third, the power of parental love. Recently I came across a little article by Doris Jehnke, entitled \u201cSaturday with a Teenage Daughter.\u201d It seems all too typical of parent-daughter relationships these days. Let me share it with you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cAre you going to sleep all day? \u2026 Who said you could use my hairspray? \u2026 Clean the dishes off the table. \u2026 Turn down the radio. \u2026 Have you made your bed? \u2026 That skirt is much too short. \u2026 Your closet is a mess. \u2026 Stand up straight. \u2026 Somebody has to go to the store. \u2026 Quit chewing your gum like that. \u2026 Your hair is too bushy. \u2026 I don\u2019t care if everybody else does have one. \u2026 Turn down the radio. \u2026 Have you done your homework? \u2026 Don\u2019t slouch. \u2026 You didn\u2019t make your bed. \u2026 Quit banging on the piano. \u2026 Why don\u2019t you iron it yourself? \u2026 Your fingernails are too long. \u2026 Look it up in the dictionary. \u2026 Sit up straight. \u2026 Get off the phone now. \u2026 Why did you ever buy that record? \u2026 Take the dog out. \u2026 You forgot to dust that table. \u2026 You\u2019ve been in the bathroom long enough. \u2026 Turn off the radio and get to sleep now.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cAnother day gone, and not once did I say, \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d (Stanley E. Miller, comp., <span class=\"emphasis\">Especially for Mormons,<\/span> Kellirae Arts, Provo, Utah, 1971, vol. 1, p. 141.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p33\" class=\"\">Too often it is easier to criticize, to point out the faults, than to praise or give love. Mothers and dads, when was the last time you told your children \u201cI love you\u201d?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p34\" class=\"\">A good friend of mine makes it a point every day to find something positive that he can compliment in his children so that he can truly say, \u201cI love you.\u201d Will you make the opportunity soon?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p35\" class=\"\">Finally, the power of parental prayer. The Book of Mormon provides a great example of a father who recovered a lost son by the power of personal prayer. The conditions of his time are akin to our own day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p36\" class=\"\">\u201cNow it came to pass that there were many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of king Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p37\" class=\"\">\u201cThey did not believe what had been said concerning the resurrection of the dead, neither did they believe concerning the coming of Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p38\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now because of their unbelief they could not understand the word of God; and their hearts were hardened.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40409\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40409)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40409)\">Mosiah 26:1\u20133<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p39\" class=\"\">One of these of the \u201crising generation\u201d was Alma the Younger.

What was it that caused that great change to occur? The angel testified to Alma the following: \u201c\u2026 Behold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father. \u2026\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40413\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40413)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40413)\">Mosiah 27:14<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p42\" class=\"\">Think of it! The power of parental prayer! As we consider the challenge of rearing children in a world fraught with temptations, false ideologies, and materialistic enticements, do you not feel the need for guidance and inspiration beyond your human capacity? There is no greater help or strength that a father or mother can obtain than through securing that help from the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/parents-teach-your-children.p43\" class=\"\">Just the other day I had a sweet experience. I stood in the presence of a mother and a father who had just greeted their long-lost son home from the wars\u2014I mean the worldly wars. What a tender moment!
