The Lord did not suffer the Book of Mormon to be sent forth to the nations to be published to all people, until he gave a testimony to certain individual witnesses. How many? Four persons at least&#x2014;the translator of the book, Joseph Smith, and three other persons, Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer.

Let me ask, Was there any possibility of their being deceived? If there was, then we might say all men of ancient times who professed to have seen angels were deceived themselves. But I do not see that anything could be more positive. The promise had been given that there should be three witnesses raised up to bear testimony of the truth of these records,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"81492\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 81492)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(81492)\">2 Ne. 27:12<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"83458\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 83458)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(83458)\">Ether 5:2-5<\/a><\/span> which purport to be a history of the aborigines, or the ancient Israelites, that inhabited this country.

Here, then, are twelve witnesses. Is not this external evidence sufficient to satisfy every inquiring soul whose heart is honest before the Lord? But, I will refer you to still more. When this work was first published, the Lord called upon these men to go forth among the people, proclaiming the Gospel which they themselves had received, promising that all who would yield obedience thereto should receive the Holy Ghost, which should confirm, to the entire satisfaction of the believer, the testimony of these Elders.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"85246\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 85246)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(85246)\">D&amp;C 39:6<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"85258\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 85258)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(85258)\">D&amp;C 39:23<\/a><\/span> And when this Holy Spirit descended upon such people, they knew for themselves that these men were servants of the living God, and that the power that rested upon them was indeed the Holy Ghost, of which they had read in the Scriptures. How did they know this? Because it manifested divers gifts. It enabled them to lay their hands upon the sick, rebuking in the name of Jesus the disease, and the sick were restored to health. You may say imagination had something to do with this; the sick imagined themselves better, and consequently they got better.
