Throughout my life I have been blessed with good friends who have enriched and strengthened me. To some six hundred plus missionaries that were assigned to us as we presided over the Arizona Tempe Mission: we can never forget the lessons learned in that great mission experience. To my good wife, Gwen, who is one of our Heavenly Father\u2019s most noble handmaidens: she has sustained me with an unfailing devotion; she is full of love and faith and possesses a great love of the gospel. She has been an inspiration to me, and I love her with all of my heart. I appreciate and love each of our six children, a son-in-law, and our first grandchild. Their righteous lives have brought nothing but joy and happiness to us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/never-be-weary-of-good-works.p7\" class=\"\">May I extend a special love and greeting to my son who is in the Language Training Mission and who will leave Tuesday for Padova, Italy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/never-be-weary-of-good-works.p8\" class=\"\">I bear to you today, my brothers and sisters, my testimony\u2014for which I am grateful\u2014that the Lord Jesus Christ lives, that this is his work, that President Spencer Woolley Kimball is indeed the Lord\u2019s prophet upon the earth, and I love him. I pledge to him, to my Brethren of the General Authorities, and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I will serve with all of my heart, might, mind, and strength.
