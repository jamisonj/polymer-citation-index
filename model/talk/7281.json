The few that remained were old and spent and had been bought by a company that would salvage them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/the-abundant-life.p5\" class=\"\">Harry, the riding master at a girls\u2019 school in New York, was about to leave when one of these horses\u2014an uncared-for, gray gelding with ugly-looking wounds on its legs\u2014caught his eye. The animal still bore the marks that had been made by a heavy work harness, evidence to the hard life he had led. But something about him captured Harry\u2019s attention, so he offered $80 for him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/the-abundant-life.p6\" class=\"\">It was snowing when Harry\u2019s children saw the horse for the first time, and because of the coat of snow on the horse\u2019s back, the children named him \u201cSnowman.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/the-abundant-life.p7\" class=\"\">Harry took good care of the horse, which turned out to be a gentle and reliable friend\u2014a horse the girls liked to ride because he was steady and didn\u2019t startle like some of the others. In fact, Snowman made such rapid improvement that a neighbor purchased him for twice what Harry had originally paid.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/the-abundant-life.p8\" class=\"\">But Snowman kept disappearing from the neighbor\u2019s pasture\u2014sometimes ending up in adjoining potato fields, other times back at Harry\u2019s. It appeared that the horse must have jumped over the fences between the properties, but that seemed impossible\u2014Harry had never seen Snowman jump over anything much higher than a fallen log.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/the-abundant-life.p9\" class=\"\">But eventually, the neighbor\u2019s patience came to an end, and he insisted Harry take back the horse.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/the-abundant-life.p10\" class=\"\">For years, Harry\u2019s great dream had been to produce a champion jumping horse.

And that kind of pedigree would cost far more than he could afford.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/the-abundant-life.p11\" class=\"\">Snowman was already getting old\u2014he was eight when Harry had purchased him\u2014and he had been badly treated.
