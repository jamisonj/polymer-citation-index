I mean\nreally believe. And there is often a wide distinction between what men say they believe&mdash;the\nprofessions they make&mdash;and the reality of their convictions. I want to talk a little today about\nthe significance of belief.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF BELIEF\n<\/p><p>\nJesus seems to have attached supreme importance to it. His concern was that men should\nbelieve him, accept his message. Conscious that this shaping of thought and establishment of\nconviction would be a slow process, extending far out beyond the span of his earth life, he\nspent a good portion of the years of his ministry in training a few disciples, whom he had\ngathered about him, to carry on after he himself should be gone.\n<\/p><p>\nHe had no temporary or ephemeral communication to impart; it was a world-shaking doctrine\nand was intended for perpetuity. Neither was it provincial in its scope. Though his whole life\nhad been spent in a small subject province, apparently more tempestuous and troublesome\nthan important, his vision ranged out over the whole earth wherever men are. Accordingly, he\ngave those disciples he had taught, a commission accompanied by a promise. The commission\nwas to go into all the world and teach his message to every creature\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32988\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32988)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32988)\">Mark 16:15<\/a><\/span>).\nThe promise is: \"He that\nbelieveth . . . shall be saved\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32989\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32989)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32989)\">Mark 16:16<\/a><\/span>).\nThus is belief made the starting point of all\nprogress. It is true that certain other things were required to be done as a condition to the\nfulfilment of the promise, but these of necessity must come as a consequence of belief.\nWithout that there is no chance that compliance with requirements would follow. There is no\npromise except to him who believes. Belief here signifies a complete acceptance which in its\nturn compels conformance to the teaching espoused. The condition is not satisfied by a mere\nlip service. Professions of belief, no matter how vehemently protested, amount to nothing\nunless they eventuate in conforming deeds.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus had ample demonstration of this during his own ministry. The multitudes followed so\nlong as they were recipients of his material benefactions. It is said that his fame went\nthroughout all Syria, and they brought their sick, and he healed them. They came from\nGalilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from beyond Jordan. They sat at his\nfeet on the mountainside where he fed them because whereof they would forcibly have\ncrowned him king (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27187\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27187)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27187)\">John 6:15<\/a><\/span>),\nbut he escaped from them and went by night to the other side of the lake\nwhere the crowds next day clamorously sought him out. Then when he began to unfold to\nthem the personal requirements devolving upon recipients of his teaching they melted rapidly\naway, and the record says, \"They walked no more with him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27191\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27191)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27191)\">John 6:66<\/a><\/span>). They had no belief. They were\nseekers after personal gain without appetite for reformation from practices which centered in\nthemselves.\n<\/p><p>\nContrast with that his belief in his own message. It cost him his life, but he carried through.\nAnd what about those disciples he had picked and taught? The message was just as\nunwelcome coming from them as it had been coming from their master. They too were\nhounded and scourged and hunted down. As believers multiplied, persecution intensified until\nfinally extermination was decreed. Then came the supreme test of their sincerity of belief.\nBelievers were ferreted out, confined to dungeons, and condemned to die. They were thrown\nto wild beasts for the entertainment of the populace at the arena. They suffered themselves to\nbe torn limb from limb because their belief had settled into convictions so deep seated that\nthey would die rather than recant. They did not have to die. They could have saved\nthemselves by a very simple act. They had only to renounce and they could have gone free\nbut that was not their kind of belief. It was more precious to them than life itself. It was the\nkind of which Jesus spoke when he promised that \"He that believeth . . . shall be saved\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32990\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32990)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32990)\">Mark 16:16<\/a><\/span>). That\nis to say, a saving belief must be one that persists in all extremities. Where is it to be found\nin the earth today? It does not deal in expediencies. It does not inquire about the trend of\npopular favor. With principle-sacrificing compromises it has no commerce.\n<\/p><p>\nLIVING FAITH INVINCIBLE\n<\/p><p>\nIt may be thought or said that this quality of faith is exemplified in the armed conflict just\nclosed. Our soldiers and sailors and airmen sacrificed their lives for a cause. That, however,\nwas in resistance to a physical assault. It was meeting physical force with physical force. We\nbelieved that we were in danger of physical subjugation with consequent penalties. Our\ncountrymen went out to repel that danger and keep us free from physical domination with a\nconsequent train of other ills. The test comes now. Have we a set of principles believed by us\nto be right which we are willing to preserve at any sacrifice and at any cost&mdash;principles\naffecting our internal integrity founded in righteous law and justice? That question is not\nanswered yet. So far as the signs indicate, the outlook is not promising. The indications seem\nto point to the rule of expediency and battering with evil for the best bargain we can get. But\nI do not now want to talk about that.\n<\/p><p>\nWas the course taken by the early Christians justified?\nMight there not have been some other way, some expedient, some give-and-take\naccommodation to reconcile antagonisms without going to the extremity of death? Was it\nprudent to flout the power of the great Roman empire and persist in a course which it\ncondemned? It would seem indeed presumptuous that a little handful of despised people,\ndestitute of wealth or influence, should resist the edicts of the greatest secular power of the\nworld. But such is the force of doctrine, the power of unwavering belief, the strength of\nsincere men with resolute conviction that their teachings flourished in the face of the direst\npersecution. The might of the empire could not crush that kind of faith living in the human\nheart. It did not extinguish Christianity. And to that circumstance is owed the perpetuation of\nChristian teaching in the world. If we want to know how great that debt is, we have only to\nask what kind of void would be left if the effect of nearly two thousand years of that teaching\nwere blotted out. We should lose substantially all that distinguishes the Christian nations from\nthe non-Christian nations. We should lose the sense of distinction which has led us in this day\nso heartily to condemn barbarities which have shocked humanity. The very freedom of which\nthe western world boasts, reaching its greatest perfection in the United States of America,\nowes its existence to the Christian teaching about human brotherhood and the worth and\ndignity of the human soul. These are fruits of that message which Jesus commissioned his\ndisciples to bear to all the world. The very progress of invention and scientific discovery\nitself, which has done so much for the material emancipation of man, is born of that freedom,\nas comparison with the backward nations of the world will disclose. It is to Christ's\nmessage&mdash;not to scholastic research&mdash;that we turn for what we know about the meaning and\npurpose of life and the controlling power of spiritual and moral law. No one may conceive the\ndegree in which the world would be impoverished if that little band of disciples had not\ndevoutly believed and through their belief perpetuated the teaching.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE TEACHINGS OF CHRIST A STANDARD FOR ALL AGES\n<\/p><p>\nIts doctrine has been so thoroughly absorbed into the life of Christian nations, particularly our\nown, that quite unconsciously men resort to it as furnishing the standard for measuring the\nvalidity of the acts of their fellows. When we call some things good and others bad, some\ncourses right and others wrong, we are evaluating them by comparison with the standards set\nin the teachings of the Master. When the politician condemns the practices of his adversary in\nmatters of human behavior, he resorts to Christ's teachings, perhaps unknowingly, for the\nideal by comparison with which the criticized acts are revealed as wrong. His own promises\nof betterment likewise are in the pattern of ideals drawn from the same source. All that we\nhave that is best in our individual lives and in our national life we draw from what was\npreserved to the world by those sacrificing early Christians who through suffering and death\nperpetuated the teachings that had been committed to them. It is fresh in the memory of all of\nus, growing out of recent and earlier example, that tyrants seeking to impose their evil\ndespotisms have to begin by a crusade intended to root out and destroy the doctrines ingrained\nin their peoples through centuries of absorption of Christian thought. In these considerations\nlies the answer to the question whether the sacrifices made were justified and whether by\ncompromise, accommodation, and the practice of expediency those early sufferers might have\navoided persecution and conflict with the empire. Over and beyond all these, those doctrines\ntaught the achievement of immortality through the Lord's death and the plan for achieving\neternal life, which is exaltation in the celestial kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nCONVICTION MAKES A PEOPLE STRONG UNDER TRIAL\n<\/p><p>\nLet us take another example out of our own history. Our people began the building of their\ncity at Nauvoo stripped bare. They had been pillaged, despoiled, and driven. In a scant six\nyears they had established a flourishing city. Many of their houses still stand, respectable\ndwellings in this modern day. They were driven out in winter. From the Iowa shores of the\nriver they could see the lights in their comfortable homes while babes were born in wind and\nsleet with no other protection than that afforded by their canvas-covered wagons. From there\nthey made their weary journey across prairies, through rivers, and over mountains to these\ndesolate valleys. The line of their march was marked by the graves of their dead. Here they\nendured privation, hardship, hunger. They didn't have to do any of that. They would have had\nonly to renounce their belief to be let alone where they were. This is demonstrated by the fact\nthat some did just that and remained unmolested. They chose rather to endure the want and\nmisery and suffering that became their portion because they believed. That is the quality of\nbelief that saves. There is no lip service in that. It transcends the bounds of pretense and sham\nand self-seeking, and anchors itself in unyielding conviction.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is possible to say that they were wrong&mdash;mistaken in their belief. It is possible to say that\nthey were imprudent and unwise. But it is not possible to deny the depth of their conviction\nnor the integrity of their manhood. Neither may the power of their belief be gainsaid. Their\nachievement stands revealed to the world. Men do not gather grapes from thorns nor figs from\nthistles (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33965\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33965)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33965)\">Matt. 7:16<\/a><\/span>).\nThose who do not accept their beliefs may feel themselves justified. But we who\nprofess their faith may not escape its high demands. Are we willing to endure what they\nendured for our beliefs? Do those beliefs mean so much to us? Are they that important in our\nappraisals? Either those beliefs are founded in truth or they are not. If not, then the system\nreared upon them should in the nature of things have fallen apart long ago. If they are so\nfounded, then those who profess them may not temporize. We today may not meet the same\ntests they did, but we shall have to face tests just as searching and perhaps harder to be borne.\n<\/p><p>\nWe still have to carry the banner. The doctrines by which they lived still require to be\nperpetuated and spread. Their perpetuation exacts of us the same unwavering steadfastness of\nconviction as actuated those who established us here. We may not be dispossessed, or driven\nout, or find a wilderness to reclaim. But we shall be engaged by counter influences perhaps\nmore insidious and therefore more difficult to discern, less easy to understand or to sense the\ndanger of, for we live in a world seething in a welter of confusion.\n<\/p><p>\nBELIEF IN AND PRACTICE OF TRUE RELIGION THE SAFETY OF THE WORLD\n<\/p><p>\nWhether we recognize it or not, it is beliefs&mdash;the beliefs that get themselves accepted&mdash;that rule\nthe world. Those beliefs may exalt a nation or drag it down to degeneracy and degradation\ndepending upon their inherent quality. Ships and tanks and airplanes and guns, while\nnecessary implements for waging physical warfare, are not the real source of a nation's\nstrength. Its strength lies in the basic integrity of its people and that depends upon the beliefs\nthey cherish which fashion their lives. The shooting war is over, but peace in its accurate\nsense is not here. It will not be until it is set up in the hearts of men. The war of ideas is still\nraging in the world. Opposing beliefs are contending for supremacy. All are clamorously\nrecruiting converts. The business of shaping thought, establishing beliefs, getting ideas\naccepted, is the most important as well as the most active and flourishing business in the\nworld today.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is with ideas, beliefs, that we are concerned, for the very safety of the world and of\nmankind depends upon the nature of the beliefs that get themselves adopted. Our message is\nthe same message Jesus gave to his disciples, namely that men should believe in him, a belief\nwith a conviction that eventuates in living his doctrines. The commission to spread it in the\nworld still stands. The means remains the same, teaching by those who believe. It cannot be\ndone by unbelievers. The doctrines still possess saving power. \"He that believeth . . . shall be\nsaved\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32991\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32991)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32991)\">Mark 16:16<\/a><\/span>).\nBut there can be no compromise of principles.\n<\/p><p>\nThere will be scoffers and deriders. Can we stand derision and still stand unmoved? There\nwill be those in and out of our own membership who will deplore as trivial the differences of\nbelief which set us apart by ourselves, who will recommend that for the sake of easy\nfraternization we relax in our distinguishing doctrines enough to extinguish apparent\ndifferences. It is so much easier and more comfortable to conform to the customs and ideas\nabout us. A little dilution of our beliefs, it will be said, can do no harm.\n<\/p><p>\nProbably the disciples of Jesus could have escaped persecution if they had been willing to\nyield a little and had contended themselves with proclaiming him as a great teacher. If they\nhad just refrained from declaring that he was the Son of God, they probably would have had\nlittle difficulty. That would have made their teaching palatable and improved the social and\nfraternal relations between them and their neighbors. But his Messiahship was the essence of\nhis message. It is the thing that gave it authority. It was that which gave it saving power.\nDelete that, for purposes of courting favor and being agreeable, and you have robbed it of its\nwhole value. It is to his doctrines, including his achieving for us immortality, that we must\nturn for understanding of the meaning and purpose of life out of which understanding must\nultimately come the peace for which the world longs. Those doctrines embrace a whole course\nof living as a preparation for eternity of life in God's kingdom. And if political persuasions or\neconomic prejudices or social theories or fraternal felicity collide with those teachings, the\nteachings must still stand. Unfortunate indeed is any man who has exalted any of these above\nor on a plane of equality with the teachings of his religious faith.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we really believe in our souls in the doctrines of our faith, then they must take precedence\nover all other philosophies or enticements. They cannot take second place to any persuasion.\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure that no one will suppose that I am advocating aloofness or presuming to suggest\nthat we regard ourselves as being above or better than others. I do not wish to incite any\nantagonisms nor to invite unfriendliness of intercourse. I am only trying to say that having as\nwe profess God-given, saving principles, we must hold them sacred, for on them the hope of\neternal happiness as well as earthly peace hangs. We should poorly serve humanity if for\nconvenience we gave them a stone when their crying need is for bread\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33963\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33963)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33963)\">Matt. 7:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay God give us the sincerity of conviction to meet every test, I pray, in the name of Jesus.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
