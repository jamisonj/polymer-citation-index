I presume the thought that he intended to convey to\nhis subjects was that they should humble themselves and in supplication and in faith approach\ntheir Heavenly Father for divine guidance and His protection. And it was well that they be so\ncounseled, for our Heavenly Father is concerned about all His children and desires that they \".\n. . believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24206\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24206)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24206)\">Heb. 11:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHE VOICE OF THE SHEPHERD\n<\/p><p>\nTo the Latter-day Saints in this troublous day, when the perils of the earth are round about us,\nit is well that we take stock as to how we may approach Him and what may be our blessings.\nThe Savior Himself spoke of the Comforter, which He said would guide into all truth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27104\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27104)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27104)\">John 16:13<\/a><\/span>), would\nbring all things to our remembrance\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27099\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27099)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27099)\">John 14:26<\/a><\/span>),\nwould show us things to come, and would teach us all\nthings whatsoever the Lord our God had commanded. But there was another thing that has\nbeen spoken of by the scriptures, another guiding light that I should like to call to the\nattention of the Latter-day Saints at this time. The Savior enunciated this principle in the\nbeautiful parable in which He spoke of Himself as the shepherd, the sheepfold as His\nkingdom, and the sheep as His people. These were His words:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and he leadeth them\nout.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him:\nfor they know his voice (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27097\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27097)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27097)\">John 10:3-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Apostle Paul said:\n<\/p><p>\nThere are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, . . .\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a\nbarbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"103\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 103)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(103)\">1 Cor. 14:10-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSo we may in this day distinguish among the babble of voices that are to be heard on every\nside, the voice of the true shepherd, that we be not found to be barbarians in the day of our\nneed for direction and guidance. The Apostle Peter declared that way when he said:\n<\/p><p>\nPROPHECY CONTINUES IN PRESENT GENERATION\n<\/p><p>\nWe have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto\na light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:\n<\/p><p>\nKnowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.\n<\/p><p>\nFor the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as\nthey were moved by the Holy Ghost\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4793\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4793)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4793)\">2 Pet. 1:19-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis thought agrees in substance with that declared by the Prophet Amos, when he said:\n<\/p><p>\nSurely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the\nprophets (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10384\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10384)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10384)\">Amos 3:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThose secrets have been revealed in this day, when in our generation the Lord to the Prophet\nJoseph Smith said:\n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the\nearth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave\nhim commandments (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11836\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11836)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11836)\">D&amp;C 1:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJust as the Prophet Joseph was called, so have been called Brigham Young, and every one\nwho has presided in the Presidency of this Church, down to President Grant, President Clark,\nand President McKay, who today occupy the high place as the mouthpieces of God in\ndirecting this people.\n<\/p><p>\nWe as a people seem to be willing to accept many of the ancient prophecies as having been\nliterally fulfilled but when we see prophecies fulfilled in our own day we are prone to\nquestion and to express some doubts. As the Master said, \". . . A prophet is not without\nhonor, but in his own country\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32971\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32971)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32971)\">Mark 6:4<\/a><\/span>)\nand he might have added, \"Save in his own time.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNEED FOR CHURCH WELFARE PLAN\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to bring to you some observations for just a few moments. Today I am in a \nreflective mood because we at this conference are celebrating the seventh anniversary of the\ninauguration of what has been styled the Church Welfare program. Coming on a train from\nthe east last fall, I read from an editorial in the Chicago <i>Tribune<\/i> wherein editors were \ncommenting upon an article that had been written by a prominent educator in the <i>School Review<\/i>,\na publication of the Department of Education of the University of Chicago. This\neducator's statement in that <i>Review<\/i> was a very doleful picture of what was to happen to us\nafter the present World War had finished. He spoke of the loss of world markets, the\ndifficulties in finding adjustments for the millions who had been thrown out into war\nindustries, and for the returning millions of our boys from the armed services. He spoke of\nthe desperation, the frustration, and the futility of many of those thus found in the toils of\nthat readjustment period. And then he said, \"The only vocational group which will not\nimmediately suffer are the farmers; they can raise what they need.\" Then he suggested that\nwe need prepare for what was in store by teaching farming as a compulsory subject, to get\nhold of a piece of land, that those provided with farming skill should be able thereby to keep\nthe \"wolf\" from the door. And so he goes on.\n<\/p><p>\nThat set me thinking, because the voice of the Lord was declared back in 1894, in October of\nthat year, by that man whom we sustained then as the prophet, seer, and revelator unto this\nChurch. He said:\n<\/p><p>\nSo far as temporal matters are concerned we must go to work to provide for ourselves. The\nday will come, as we have all been told, that we shall see the necessity of making our own\nshoes and our own clothing, and providing our own foodstuffs, and uniting together to carry\nout the purposes of the Lord. We will be preserved in the mountains of Israel in the days of\nGod's judgments. I therefore say unto you, my brethren and sisters, prepare for that which is\nto come. (Wilford Woodruff&mdash;Weber Stake, October 8, 1894)\n<\/p><p>\nThe voice of the Lord was again heard in 1936, when again we were told by our leaders that\nthere should be a production of all the things needed by those who would otherwise be unable\nto provide for themselves. For seven years the Church has been schooled in the methods of\nproduction and distribution. Storehouses have been established&mdash;eighty-six of them\ntoday&mdash;grain elevators have been erected and yet in the face of all that anxious, feverish\nactivity that has been directed by the Presidency of this Church, there have been contrary\nvoices, there have been contrary philosophies of spending ourselves into prosperity; we have\nhad a subversive economic program; we have had subsidies and controls of every kind that\nseemed to work at cross purposes with that which the prophets of the Lord were guiding us to\ndo.\n<\/p><p>\nThe spirit of all this Welfare activity throughout the Church and the meaning of all this\npreparation seemed to have found expression in a dedicatory prayer offered by one of the\nPresidency of the Church in August of 1940 when the elevator down on Welfare Square was\ndedicated. Here was a statement from that beautiful and inspired dedicatory prayer:\n<\/p><p>\nMay this be an edifice of service, a contribution of love, and as such we dedicate it to thee\nand ask thy blessings to attend all who may have contributed to its erection, and all who may\ncontribute to the keeping of these bins filled with the wheat <i>which is considered necessary to<\/i>\n<i>be preserved preparatory for the judgments that await the nations of the earth<\/i>. (David O.\nMcKay, August, 1940)\n<\/p><p>\nTHE SAINTS INSTRUCTED TO PRODUCE AND STORE\n<\/p><p>\nThen came 1937. The voice of the Lord again spoke through His mouthpiece from this place\nto Israel. Individuals were told to go beyond Welfare production, putting storage in their own\nplaces sufficient for a needed supply. Oh, there were some who sat back in that day, just like\nthe scorners who sat in the house of Lehi's dreams, and pointed fingers of scorn at the\nLatter-day Saints who heeded that call, and came to a point after the declaration of war when\nall such were dubbed as hoarders, and were accused of being unpatriotic to the great urge that\nwas being made of this great American nation. But shortly after that finger of scorn was\npointed and those epithets were thus hurled, we had a letter from a state consumer officer in\nconnection with the O.P.A. office who asked the Church to stimulate its membership to\nproduce and to store, to do the very thing that for five and six years the Church had actually\nbeen doing under the direction and by the counsel of the leadership of this Church.\n<\/p><p>\nAgain there came counsel in 1942, a change was made.\n<\/p><p>\nWe renew our counsel, said the leaders of the Church, and repeat our instructions: Let every\nLatter-day Saint that has land, produce some valuable essential foodstuff thereon and then\npreserve it; or if he cannot produce an essential foodstuff, let him produce some other kind\nand exchange it for an essential foodstuff; let them who have no land of their own, and who\nhave knowledge of farming and gardening, try to rent some, either by themselves or with\nothers, and produce foodstuff thereon, and preserve it. Let those who have land produce\nenough extra to help their less fortunate brethren. (Message of First Presidency, April, 1942) \n<\/p><p>\nIt was as though they knew fully a year before the present rationing program was inaugurated\nthat there had to be a change from the previous activity if we would be sustained in this time.\nLet me ask you leaders who are here today: In 1937 did you store in your own basements and\nin your own private storehouses and granaries sufficient for a year's supply? You city\ndwellers, did you in 1942 heed what was said from this stand? Did you go out and procure\nthat land a year ago in preparation for that which came last fall in the way of a rationing\nprogram? If you didn't, you find yourselves now rather anxious about the present situation,\nbecause land this year is much more difficult and much more costly to obtain.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember something else that was said. It was declared also from this pulpit that the\ninterpretation of the vision of Pharaoh by the boy Joseph when he saw the seven lean and the\nseven fat kine&mdash;or the reverse, the seven fat and the seven lean kine\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23474\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23474)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23474)\">Gen. 41:2-3<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;coming up out of the\nwater, was not without parallel in our own day. Of this parallel our leaders reminded us in\nthese words: \"We have had seven fat years,\" (and this marks the end of the seventh year since\nthe inauguration of the Welfare plan). \"We are warned that scanty days lie ahead.\" As I have\nthought of that statement of the brethren, I have wondered if we may see a shadow also in the\nfact that the eleven brothers who were unguided by the spirit of the Lord were forced to\ncome to the one provident brother who listened to the word of God. I wonder if we are\nlikewise to see that parallel in Israel today. \n<\/p><p>\nWISDOM SHOWN IN INSTRUCTIONS AS TO TRAVEL\n<\/p><p>\nYes, there were some other things. May I just speak of one more? On January 17, 1942, a\nletter was sent out to all the Church urging and instructing that they discontinue stake\nmeetings; to restrict the travel by stake board members, to cut down on other activities where\notherwise they would not be able to conserve. And when you remember that all this happened\nfrom eight months to nearly a year before the tire and gas rationing took place, you may well\nunderstand if you will only take thought that here again was the voice of the Lord to this\npeople, trying to prepare them for the conservation program that within a year was forced\nupon them. No one at that time could surely foresee that the countries that had been\nproducing certain essential commodities were to be overrun and we thereby be forced into a\nshortage.\n<\/p><p>\nCALLING OUT OF MISSIONARIES\n<\/p><p>\nYes, you remember when the missionaries were taken out of Europe a few years ago, there\nwere many who sat in the scorners' seats who said: \"Why, that is silly. During the last World\nWar we did not have all the missionaries taken out.\" But those who thus spoke forgot that\nBrigham Young had voiced the word of the Lord some years ago when he said:\n<\/p><p>\nDo you think there is calamity abroad now among the people? All we have yet heard, and all\nwe have experienced is scarcely a preface to the sermon that is going to be preached.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, mark you this:\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the testimony of the Elders ceases to be given and the Lord says to them, \"Come home;\nI will now preach my own sermons to the nations of the earth.\" All you now know can\nscarcely be called a preface to the sermon that will be preached with fire and sword, tempests,\nearthquake, hail, rain, thunders and lightnings, and fearful destruction.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it is a matter of record that hardly had the last missionary been called home until all hell\nseemed to break loose in Europe, in veritable fulfillment of the prophecy that had been given.\nWhen likewise the missionaries were called from the island missions of the sea, we heard the\nsame clamor, criticizing these brethren because they were doing things that seemed to some\nmembers of the Church to be not necessary, and yet we see the great wisdom displayed in\nwhat already has been done.\n<\/p><p>\nLESSON FROM LIFE OF MOSES\n<\/p><p>\nI think we could learn a lesson from the story that we read in the book of Exodus\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22519\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22519)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22519)\">Ex. 17:8-13<\/a><\/span>),\nin the life of Moses the prophet. You will recall that Amalek had come upon Israel, and\nJoshua was commanded by Moses to go out with his army. He said to Joshua, \"I will stand\nupon the mount with the rod of the Lord in my hand, and you go fight the battles of Israel.\"\nAnd as long as he stood with his hands upraised Israel prevailed against the enemy, but his\nhands became heavy and he could not hold them up, and when he would drop his hands, the\nenemy prevailed over Israel. And so they sat him upon a rock upon the Mount, and Aaron\nand Hur stood holding his hands upraised, that Israel would prevail in that terrible day.\n<\/p><p>\nThat also is not without its shadow today and its lesson to Israel. Here sits today on this stand\nthe man as President of this Church who holds in his hand the rod of the Lord; he is sitting\nupon the mount, and as long as his hands are upheld by obedience to his direction and his\ncounsel, Israel will prevail against her enemies. But whenever we come to a time when we\nallow his hands to fall, and we as the Priesthood of the living God fail to uphold his hands,\njust in that day we may expect our enemies to come upon us and to destroy us.\n<\/p><p>\nSECURITY IN FOLLOWING ADVICE OF LEADERS\n<\/p><p>\nI was down in Kelsey, Texas, last November, and I heard a group of anxious people asking,\n\"Is now the day for us to come up to Zion, where we can come to the mountain of the Lord,\nwhere we can be protected from our enemies?\" I pondered that question, I prayed about it.\nWhat should we say to those people who were in their anxiety? I have studied it a bit, I have\nlearned something of what the Spirit has taught, and I know now that the place of safety in\nthis world is not in any given place; it doesn't make so much difference where we live; but\nthe all-important thing is how we live, and I have found that security can come to Israel only\nwhen they keep the commandments, when they live so that they can enjoy the companionship,\nthe direction, the comfort, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit of the Lord, when they are\nwilling to listen to these men whom God has set here to preside as His mouthpieces, and\nwhen we obey the counsels of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen a decision has been reached by the presiding councils of the Church and a majority in\nthese councils has decided on a certain policy, and then there comes a minority voice contrary\nto that majority decision one may know with a surety that that minority voice is not speaking\nthe will of the Lord. I tremble when I think of the truth of that statement. I am greatly\nconcerned when I now sit in one of the presiding councils of the Church, and remember that\nin days gone by there have been those who have fallen by the way because they went out in\ncontradiction of the majority decision of that body. And so that places before you a safe\nguide. Should there be those, even though in high places, who may come among you not\nspeaking the policy of the Church as declared by these men whom we sustain as the prophets\nof the living God, the Church may know that those who thus speak are not speaking the mind\nof the Lord and the voice of the Lord and the power of God unto salvation\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11872\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11872)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11872)\">D&amp;C 68:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to follow the light. May we be guided unerringly through this day of grave\nuncertainty, that we may be kept upon Zion's hill and be not strangers and barbarians to the\nwork of the Lord, but may be ones to listen to him who is our shepherd, whose voice we\nknow (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27098\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27098)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27098)\">John 10:4<\/a><\/span>),\nI humbly pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
