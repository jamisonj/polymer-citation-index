Our most holy places are our sacred temples. Within them is a feeling of sacred comfort. We should seek to be worthy to take our families to the temple to be sealed together for eternity. We should also search for the records of our kindred dead so that they too can be sealed to us in one of the temples.

It comes by faith and through obedience to God\u2019s laws and ordinances. God then purifies the heart by faith, and the heart becomes purged from that which is profane and unworthy.

I quote: \u201cThirty years\u2019 experience has taught me that every moment of my life must be holiness to the Lord, resulting from equity, justice, mercy and uprightness in all my actions, which is the only course by which I can preserve the Spirit of the Almighty to myself.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-25905_000_024\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News,<\/span> Apr. 2, 1862, 313.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/standing-in-holy-places.p10\" class=\"\">Last year one of my grandsons took his wife to New York City with their parents to attend the beautiful new Manhattan temple.

He has trod its sacred aisles, solitary and alone from mankind, long before the king of day has gilded the eastern horizon; and he has uttered his aspirations within its walls, when nature has been asleep.

Those golden words were often a central adornment for most important buildings, such as the co-op store and the bishops\u2019 storehouse. I have in my possession some stock certificates of ZCMI, a pioneer mercantile institution. They bear the signatures of John Taylor, Brigham Young, Wilford Woodruff, Joseph F. Smith, Lorenzo Snow, Heber J. Grant, George Albert Smith, and David O. McKay. Printed on every stock certificate are the words \u201cHoliness to the Lord.\u201d I wonder what has become of these mottoes of holiness?

We need to try harder to be found standing in holy places. Temple ceremonial covenants and observances are means to help secure holiness of character. In our desire to create in our people more commitment to the holy work of the temples, we must urge them to look deeper to the profound spiritual meaning to be found there.

There would be a greater measure of peace and love and happiness in our homes. There would be fewer weeping wives and weeping children.

The feelings of holiness in my home prepared me for feelings of holiness in the temple. Before I went on my first mission to Brazil, my mother lovingly hand made a piece of temple clothing for me to wear when I went to the temple.

We did not always succeed. Of course not. But we tried. When I was overwhelmed as a young father with the responsibility of providing temporally for my family, taking care of my Church callings and many other civic duties, Ruth would lovingly and gently bring me back to my parental responsibility in our home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/standing-in-holy-places.p20\" class=\"\">For example, she would remind me when it was time for home evening and then tenderly suggest what we might appropriately study in our home evenings.

We are the beneficiaries, guardians, and caretakers of these responsibilities under the delegation, authority, and direction of President Hinckley, who holds all the keys. As children of the Lord we should strive every day to rise to a higher level of personal righteousness in all of our actions.

That is where we will find the spiritual protection we need for ourselves and our families. That is the source of help to carry forth the word of the Lord in our time. Standing in holy places will help us rise above the evil influences of our time and draw us closer to our Savior.
