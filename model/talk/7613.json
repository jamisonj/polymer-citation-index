Some changes are welcome; some are not. There are changes in our lives which are sudden, such as the unexpected passing of a loved one, an unforeseen illness, the loss of a possession we treasure. But most of the changes take place subtly and slowly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/finding-joy-in-the-journey.p7\" class=\"\">This conference marks 45 years since I was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. As the junior member of the Twelve then, I looked up to 14 exceptional men, who were senior to me in the Twelve and the First Presidency. One by one, each of these men has returned home. When President Hinckley passed away eight months ago, I realized that I had become the senior Apostle. The changes over a period of 45 years that were incremental now seem monumental.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/finding-joy-in-the-journey.p8\" class=\"\">This coming week Sister Monson and I will celebrate our 60th wedding anniversary. As I look back to our beginnings, I realize just how much our lives have changed since then. Our beloved parents, who stood beside us as we commenced our journey together, have passed on. Our three children, who filled our lives so completely for many years, are grown and have families of their own. Most of our grandchildren are grown, and we now have four great-grandchildren.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/finding-joy-in-the-journey.p9\" class=\"\">Day by day, minute by minute, second by second we went from where we were to where we are now. The lives of all of us, of course, go through similar alterations and changes. The difference between the changes in my life and the changes in yours is only in the details. Time never stands still; it must steadily march on, and with the marching come the changes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/finding-joy-in-the-journey.p10\" class=\"\">This is our one and only chance at mortal life\u2014here and now. The longer we live, the greater is our realization that it is brief. Opportunities come, and then they are gone. I believe that among the greatest lessons we are to learn in this short sojourn upon the earth are lessons that help us distinguish between what is important and what is not. I plead with you not to let those most important things pass you by as you plan for that illusive and nonexistent future when you will have time to do all that you want to do. Instead, find joy in the journey\u2014now.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/finding-joy-in-the-journey.p11\" class=\"\">I am what my wife, Frances, calls a \u201cshow-a-holic.\u201d I thoroughly enjoy many musicals, and one of my favorites was written by the American composer Meredith Willson and is entitled <span class=\"emphasis\">The Music Man.<\/span> Professor Harold Hill, one of the principal characters in the show, voices a caution that I share with you.
