McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1945, pp. 111-114<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nTruly, as sung so impressively by the male chorus, we \"Need Thee Every Hour\"&mdash;especially\nthe men who lead this Church, not only the General Authorities, but those in stakes and\nwards, in quorums, in organizations, and in the missions&mdash;all who in any way have the\nresponsibility of guiding the people.\n<\/p><p>\nSOURCE OF POWER IN PRIESTHOOD\n<\/p><p>\nJesus the Christ is the source of the power of the priesthood. Yesterday morning when the\nquorums voted as groups, there radiated a power which I am sure was felt by everyone. We\nfelt it tonight when the thousands here assembled sang: \"Do What Is Right.\" You sang with a\nforce which indicated your intention to do just that thing. As long as the priesthood merits the\nguidance of Christ by honest and conscientious dealing with their fellow men, by resisting\nevil in any of its forms, by the faithful performance of duty, there is no opposing power in\nthis world which can stay the progress of the Church of Christ. I am happy to be numbered\nwith you. I am grateful to have the privilege of laboring with this group of men and\nthousands of fathers in the promulgation of the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nI've been instructed and gratified by the instructions of the brethren who have spoken here\ntonight.\n<\/p><p>\nWARD TEACHING\n<\/p><p>\nWithout further comment I wish to mention one phase of ward teaching discussed so\neloquently and impressively by Bishop Wirthlin. You noted that he mentioned two teachers,\neach accompanying the other in the performance of their duty. There is a growing tendency\nfor teachers to go alone. We decry this practice. We commend those men who, when they fail\nto have a partner, are willing to assume the responsibility of visiting the Saints without a\ncompanion, but for seventy-five years, and probably longer, it has been the practice of the\nChurch that teachers should go two by two. And Bishop Wirthlin very eloquently told us\nwhy. It is not sufficient for a teacher to say, \"I cannot get anybody to go with me.\" There are\ntoo many young men in the Aaronic Priesthood who hold the office of teacher or priest, and\nwho will accept an appointment as ward teacher to justify any teacher's going alone. Call a\nyoung man to go with you. Kneel down with him, as we have been instructed, and then go\ntwo by two.\n<\/p><p>\nDo this for three reasons: first, because we are instructed so to do; second, because it's for\nyour own protection. You think about that. And third, because you need mutual strength,\nmutual guidance in giving correction, where it is necessary, and in teaching the doctrines of\nthe Church.\n<\/p><p>\nINSTRUCTIONS REGARDING CALLING OF MISSIONARIES\n<\/p><p>\nI wish to say a word also about the calling of missionaries.\n<\/p><p>\nGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the\nSon, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have\ncommanded you: and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34020\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34020)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34020)\">Matt. 28:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat commission given by the Savior to the ancient apostles is applicable today. I need not\nelaborate upon the magnitude of missionary work. That has been done most eloquently today\nby Elder Stephen L Richards and others of the General Authorities who have emphasized this\ntheme. I have just two thoughts to express tonight. I have just two further suggestions\nregarding it. To the question whether returning soldiers or others, who because of some\nphysical defect, have been excused from military service, could be called as missionaries, the\nanswer is yes. The presidents of missions are calling for young men. Missions in Europe, in\nSouth America, and the Islands are waiting for messengers to come to them, so please\nrecommend these young men who are worthy of a call to service. Presidents of missions are\npleading for young men capable of assisting in office work. If presidents of stakes and\nbishops of wards can find a dozen such within the next month we shall appreciate it greatly.\n<\/p><p>\nIn making your selection, however, please choose only young men and young women, who\nare worthy to represent the Church. The missionary field is <i>not a reform school<\/i>. True, it does\nbring about a reformation in those who need reforming. Missionary experience develops\ncharacter, and brings the sincere laborer into spiritual contact with his Father in heaven, but\nno young man and no young woman should be sent out to be reformed. Stake and ward\norganizations of the Church are established for that purpose. We have been rather embarrassed\neven within the last few months, because of the insistence on the part of parents or, as in one\ncase, of a bishop, that a young girl should go on a mission when she did not want to go; and,\nin another case, a young man who was unworthy.\n<\/p><p>\nMargaret Johnston Graflin, in a poem entitled \"To My Son,\" said:\n<\/p><p>\nRemember the world will be quick with its blame. <br \/>\nIf shadow or stain ever darken your name,<br \/>\n\"Like mother like son\" is a saying so true<br \/>\nThe world will judge largely of Mother by you.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to apply that thought to the sons and daughters of the Church, particularly to the\nrepresentatives who go into the missionary field. The Church will be judged largely by your\nactions and by what you say. \"Remember the world will be quick with its blame. If shadow\nor stain ever darken your name. . . . \"It is a great responsibility to represent this Church, and\nevery missionary is a representative. You men in business would not think of choosing a\nrepresentative unless you could trust him or her. Make that your ideal, bishop, ask yourself.\n\"Can this man be trusted as a representative of this Church? Will this young lady reflect credit\nupon this great organization?\"\n<\/p><p>\nCall young men, yes; but see to it that they are worthy of the trust thus placed in them. These\nboys who have been out in conditions and in environments that have upset their whole\nnature&mdash;God bless them&mdash;they have been true, many of them, but they have been under a\nstrain, they are changed. Now as they come home, put them in an environment where they\nwill become normal, where, above all things, they can render the service of love instead of\nhate, of salvation instead of death. Many of them have been missionaries while they have\nbeen out fighting, but see to it that they are worthy. Talk to them, be kind to them, and when\nthey are worthy, give them the opportunity to go out and preach the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nThe world is hungry to hear the truth as never before in its history. We have it. Are we equal\nto the task&mdash;to the responsibility God has placed upon us? I am sure with the power we have\nseen in this priesthood meeting we can answer \"yes.\"\n<\/p><p>\nGod qualify our youth and our men in the priesthood everywhere to supply the present crying\nneed of the nations for the truth of the restored gospel, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
