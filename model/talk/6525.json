This law is based upon a primary yet profound principle\u2014a simple practice\u2014that, if observed with the proper spirit, will help us draw closer to our Heavenly Father and strengthen our faith, while at the same time help us ease the burdens of others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/the-law-of-the-fast.p12\" class=\"\">In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, members are encouraged to fast whenever their faith needs special fortification and to fast regularly once each month on fast day. On that day, we go without eating or drinking for two consecutive meals, commune with our Heavenly Father, and contribute a fast offering to help the poor. The offering should be at least equal to the value of the food that would have been eaten. Typically, the first Sunday of each month is designated as fast Sunday. On that day, members who are physically able are encouraged to fast, pray, bear witness to the truthfulness of the gospel, and pay a generous fast offering. \u201cThe law of the fast,\u201d taught Elder Milton R. Hunter, \u201cis probably as old as the human family. \u2026 In ancient times, prophet-leaders repeatedly gave to church members the commandment to observe the law of fasting and praying.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-21905_000_031\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Will a Man Rob God?<\/span> (1952), 207\u20138.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/the-law-of-the-fast.p13\" class=\"\">We observe that in the scriptures, fasting almost always is linked with prayer. Without prayer, fasting is not complete fasting; it\u2019s simply going hungry. If we want our fasting to be more than just going without eating, we must lift our hearts, our minds, and our voices in communion with our Heavenly Father. Fasting, coupled with mighty prayer, is powerful. It can fill our minds with the revelations of the Spirit. It can strengthen us against times of temptation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/the-law-of-the-fast.p14\" class=\"\">Fasting and prayer can help develop within us courage and confidence. It can strengthen our character and build self-restraint and discipline. Often when we fast, our righteous prayers and petitions have greater power. Testimonies grow. We mature spiritually and emotionally and sanctify our souls. Each time we fast, we gain a little more control over our worldly appetites and passions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/the-law-of-the-fast.p15\" class=\"\">Fasting and prayer can help us in our families and in our daily work. They can help us magnify our callings in the Church. President Ezra Taft Benson taught: \u201cIf you want to get the spirit of your office and calling as a new president of a quorum, a new high [councilor], a new bishop [or, I might say, a Relief Society president]\u2014try fasting for a period. I don\u2019t mean just missing one meal, then eating twice as much the next meal. I mean really fasting, and praying during that period. It will do more to give you the real spirit of your office and calling and permit the Spirit to operate through you than anything I know.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-21905_000_031\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson<\/span> (1988), 331\u201332.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/the-law-of-the-fast.p16\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph Smith taught: \u201cLet this be an [example] to all saints, and there will never be any lack for bread: When the poor are starving, let those who have, fast one day and give what they otherwise would have eaten to the bishops for the poor, and every one will abound for a long time. \u2026 And so long as the saints will all live to this principle with glad hearts and cheerful countenances they will always have an abundance.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-21905_000_031\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 7:413.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/the-law-of-the-fast.p17\" class=\"\">Book of Mormon prophets taught the law of the fast: \u201cBehold, now it came to pass that the people of Nephi were exceedingly rejoiced, because the Lord had again delivered them out of the hands of their enemies; therefore they gave thanks unto the Lord their God; yea, and they did fast much and pray much, and they did worship God with exceedingly great joy.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-21905_000_031\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8689\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8689)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8689)\">Alma 45:1<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/the-law-of-the-fast.p18\" class=\"\">The powerful combination of fasting and prayer is exemplified by the four sons of Mosiah.
