Dilworth Young<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Of the First Council of the Seventy<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">S. Dilworth Young, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1969, pp. 40-42<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nFifty years ago my father was approached by our bishop as to the prospect of one of his sons\ngoing on a mission. After a dignified period of conversation, my father agreed to the\nproposition, and I was duly called.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember that I wondered how my father could support a missionary. We were poor,\nincome from his business was spotty and inadequate to meet the ordinary expenses, yet he did\nnot hesitate to tell the bishop that he would support me.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Financing of mission<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe first seven months went smoothly enough. I was working without purse or scrip\nfor the first four months and required no more than $5.00 per month for incidentals. The next\nthree months cost me about $40.00 per month. And then Father, caught in\nthe inflation of 1920, was unable further to meet the cost of the mission. The fact that I\nstayed on the mission for 26 more months without help from home has been miraculous to\nme&mdash;not that I found money from miraculous sources or, like my maternal great-grandfather,\nopened my purse and there it was as needed&mdash;none of that. The way opened by perfectly\nnatural means, and there was barely sufficient to meet the needs of the moment.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring that time, none of my family expected nor received any help or encouragement from\nthe ward officials, stake officials, or from the Church.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Quorum assistance<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI was ordained a seventy just before departing, but I didn't receive even a Christmas\ncard from my new quorum for the 33 months I was away. The elders quorum to which I had\nbelonged showed no interest in me either, although I had been quite active in the quorum. I\ndidn't expect any attention from either quorum, and I suspect the quorum did not expect to do\nanything for me. My quorum in those days did not seem to recognize the importance of being\nof help to its members. To them it was not what can the quorum do for you, but what can\nyou do for the quorum. We lived for the organization and not for the members.\n<\/p><p>\nNot so today. Every quorum of the priesthood is alert to the needs of its members. Children\nof these members may go on missions. They know that they will be supported. No worthy\nmember in the stakes of North America when ready for a mission will be refused. In their\nprosperity the quorums can easily take up the slack for those unable to bear the complete cost\nof the mission. They will be helped by their united brethren, and the burden is light.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Missionaries outside United States<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt has not been so in the full-time missions outside of the United States. There, general\neconomic depressions and the ravages of two great wars have taken an immense toll on the\neconomic life of the people. Men and women of the Church in those nations have been unable\nto earn sufficient to send their children, with but few exceptions. The result has been that the\nyoung men and women of these nations, while worthy and anxious to go, have been unable to\ndo so.\n<\/p><p>\nThis has caused a good deal of envy of their more affluent American missionaries, and it has\ncaused some discouragement among them. To many of them it has appeared that the choice\nfruits of the gospel are not to be enjoyed, because of where they live. More serious has been\nthe fact that these young people are the best possible missionary prospects for their countries.\nThey know the language, the traditions, the mores of the people. They are the potential\nleaders of the Church in their lands.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a tendency on the part of people of other nations to think of us as an American\nchurch. When the missionaries are native born, people can better understand the universal\nnature of the Church. Our members then see that the responsibility becomes theirs as much as\nours, and this will result in greater effort on their part.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Seventies assistance to missionaries<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSeveral years ago, the body of seventies of the Church undertook to assist the young\nmen and women in foreign lands. From among the seventies was raised a sum of money to\nassist these prospective missionaries. On the basis of the missionary and his family's doing all\nthey are able to do, the seventies give assistance for the remainder.\n<\/p><p>\nI am happy to report to the seventies this afternoon that to date the number of missionaries\nassisted has been more than 600 in number. Currently the number in the field is 275. In no\nmission has a worthy applicant been refused. We have had assistance from elders quorums,\nhigh priests quorums, and from individuals not attached to any quorum. One of the large\ncontributions comes from a man not a Church member. We should like to let all these people\nknow that their contributions are of material assistance in the project.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Discharging responsibility<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt is difficult for many seventies to personally go on full-time missions. They are\nrearing families and must support them. By supporting these young men and women in the\nmissions, they in a sense project themselves into the mission field and thus discharge a part of\ntheir responsibility.\n<\/p><p>\nNow in lands all over the earth our young men and women look forward to being able to\nbecome missionaries. On their return home they become the leaders in branches and districts.\nThey are our future investment in stake presidents and bishops for stakes yet unborn.\n<\/p><p>\nThe quorums of seventy with a comparatively small membership of 23,000 may know that\nthey are not laboring in vain. They are building a house to the Lord, and the fruits of their\neffort will continue to rain down blessings on their heads.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The calling of the Seventy<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe constantly remember, as charged in the Doctrine and Covenants, that \"the Seventy\nare also called to preach the gospel, and to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all\nthe world&mdash;thus differing from other officers in the church in the duties of their calling\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15437\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15437)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15437)\">D&amp;C 107:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, to further missionary work is what we should be doing. We must enlarge our\nefforts to the end that the whole world will hear the gospel and that those who are to come\nout of the world into the fold of the Lord Jesus Christ will come.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Stake missions<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe realize too that the \"whole world\" is here as well as in the remote corners of the\nland mass of Eurasia. The stake missions are our most fertile sources of converts. Where our\npeople are gathered, where we have wards and stakes, where we have buildings and facilities,\nis our best opportunity&mdash;there also is the world. By our merely living the principles of the\ngospel, people cannot help seeing the light shining on the hilltop, and seeing will want to\npartake of the good fruit of the gospel that it illuminates. For those whose heads are down, if\nwe live as we should, all we need to do is to say to them, \"Look up, see! The light shines for\nyou.\" Earnest effort to this end will bring greater results.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Large field to be harvested<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe seventies quorums are aware that the field to be harvested is very large and that\nthe work must be pursued with great vigor while the day lasts. Our constant prayer is to be\nanxiously engaged in carrying forth the missionary work and to stand true to the First\nPresidency and the Twelve as they direct us and point the way we should go.\n<\/p><p>\nThis great work is under the divine guidance of God the Eternal Father, who is a living,\nexalted being of flesh and bone&mdash;not the flesh and bone that you and I know, but\nresurrected, glorified flesh and bone filled with light. Indescribable is his person. There are\nnot words to picture that glory; it is not earthly&mdash;it is heavenly.\n<\/p><p>\nHis Son is like him. Through the Son of God, Jesus Christ, we have hope that eventually we\ncan become like them. We must learn to know them, and knowing them we may share the\ntruth announced by the Lord himself that to know them is to have eternal life\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28549\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28549)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28549)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>). This church is\ntheir earthly kingdom, and President David O. McKay is the prophet through whom they\nspeak in our day. This I witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. \n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
