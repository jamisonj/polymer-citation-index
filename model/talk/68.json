Reuben Clark, Jr.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">First Counselor in the First Presidency<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">J. Reuben Clark, Jr., <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1943, pp. 94-100<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brethren: I believe perhaps I have never had a more trying time than that which confronts\nme now. We have been hearing about the war, its purposes, and our part therein. I have the\nmisfortune of remembering a little history; the most of my mature life has been spent dealing\nwith the relationships of nations. I wish the picture were as clear and certain to me as it has\nbeen drawn, either as to its issues or its outcome.\n<\/p><p>\nI am not going to preach a sermon tonight, brethren. There are some things that I thought it\nmight be well to run over with you. They deal largely with our temporal affairs, though not\nwholly so. I come to you in deep humility. I do not think I ever felt weaker.\n<\/p><p>\nHELPS FOR MEN IN THE SERVICE\n<\/p><p>\nWe have over on State Street, as all you presidents of stakes and you bishops know, a\nmissionary home, or a home for the L.D.S. service men. We have housed therein a committee\nwhich is trying to act as a liaison group between the soldiers and you brethren. I want to\nspeak briefly about the work of that committee and ask your further help.\n<\/p><p>\nBefore doing that, I should like to get a few facts. Will all those who saw service in the\nuniform of their country during World War No. I stand on their feet. (Several hundred arose.)\n<\/p><p>\nThank you, brethren. If I might say so, I also was then in the service.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like all those who have sons now in the army to stand on their feet. (As many as a\nthird of the audience arose.) Please remain standing. I should like to add to that number all\nthose who have grandsons in the service, and add to that all those who have sons or\ngrandsons who are subject to be called into service. Will you all stand, please.\n<\/p><p>\n(About two-thirds or three-fourths of the audience came to their feet.) Thank you, brethren.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Grant has now in the service, or due for induction into the service, including his\ngrandsons-in-law, eighteen men.\n<\/p><p>\nThis war business is going to be felt very keenly by us.\n<\/p><p>\nAway back in October we sent out word to the presidents of stakes telling them that we were\ngoing to print some literature to be distributed to the boys. We have had printed the Book of\nMormon, this is one of them (holding it up to view), which they can carry here in their breast\npockets. We have also had printed a little book we call Principles of the Gospel, that is\nfounded on the Compendium. It will not be quite so large as this Book of Mormon. We have\nprinted enough so that they can be distributed to every one of our boys who is in the service.\n<\/p><p>\nWe asked each of you presidents of stakes to send in the names and addresses of the men in\nthe service from your stakes, securing the same from the parents, through the bishops. That\nwas in October. Ten stakes have not even acknowledged the receipt of the instructions. We\nhave no word from them. All told, 239 wards and 42 branches have made no return whatever.\nThe returns that have been made have been, frequently, so imperfectly made out that it is\nalmost impossible to work out just what the names are, but more particularly just what the\naddresses are. Now, we are going to send to you brethren, you presidents of stakes, as many\ncopies of this Book of Mormon and of the Principles of the Gospel as you have indicated you\nhave boys in the service from your stakes.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are going to ask you to see that they are mailed out to those boys to those addresses. We\nshall probably send along a form and ask you to write out a new statement regarding the\nboys, showing their addresses, their names, and so on. It is very difficult for those who are\ncompiling these names to be sure that you have correctly stated the facts about them; the\ndifference between \"sen,\" and \"son,\" is not always observed, and other like inaccuracies are\nthere.\n<\/p><p>\nNow we have also prepared a directory, giving the locations of all of our chapels and\nchurches throughout the United States, in England, and in Australia. We would like you\npresidents of stakes to call at the L.D.S. Home for Service Men, 41 North State Street, just\nabove Eagle Gate, before you go home, and get enough copies of those directories so that you\ncan give one to each of your boys in the service, and we ask you to distribute them through\nthe bishops, so that the bishops can give one to each parent who has a son in the service.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen you send us these names, we send them out to the mission fields, and out in the\nmission fields where the camps are located, the mission presidents have districted the areas, to\naid them in getting in touch with your boys. The directory will help the boys to get in touch\nwith their Church.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, I do not believe it is necessary, after what has been said tonight, to urge upon you\nthe importance of sending us these names, to urge upon you the importance of seeing that\nevery boy&mdash;your boy and everybody's else&mdash;has a copy of these books. They will need will\nneed all they can get from these books, to help them live righteously.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have all sorts of letters from the boys in the fields telling us of the work which they are\ndoing. We have asked them to organize themselves into Mutual Improvement groups, and\ncarry on their religious activities. We have had two or three letters from a boy in North\nAfrica &mdash;that is all we know about him as to his location&mdash;but he tells us that they hold\nsacrament meetings, administer the sacrament, that they preach, that they try to sustain one\nanother, build up the faith the one of the other.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren, please pay attention to this. Get your directories before you go home. We will\nsend you copies of the books with instructions. Then will you please send back to us the new\nlists corrected, so that we can forward them to the missions.\n<\/p><p>\nSend out your books to your boys; give them all the help that you can, and that act plus your\nletters and your prayers, will be about all you can do.\n<\/p><p>\nTITHING\n<\/p><p>\nNow I want to thank the brethren of the Church, for their response in the matter of tithing.\nBrother Grant thanked you in his opening message. I would like to tell you two or three facts\nabout tithing. One is that 95 percent of all the tithepayers in the Church pay less than $200\nper person, which is 67 percent of the total tithing. Thus the tithing is paid by the moderately\ncircumstanced and poor of the Church. And while unnecessary, I can add to the assurance\ngiven you by President Grant, that he regards these funds as trust funds of the highest\ncharacter, that he is authorizing their expenditure for nothing but Church purposes, and while\nat the moment we seem to have plenty of money, we are trying to guard it as carefully as we\nknow how, because it is expected that the time will come when we shall have use for it, if it\nshall then be worth anything.\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Marion G. Romney read to us yesterday from some of the early instructions sent out\nby the First Presidency covering the question of so-called pensions, doles, or gratuities. you\nremember on one occasion the Savior talked about the duty running between parents and\nchildren, and based it upon that statement in the Decalogue, \"Honor thy father and thy\nmother\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22524\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22524)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22524)\">Ex. 20:12<\/a><\/span>).\nIt would be a grievous thing, brethren, if any of you, or if any of us, were to cast\noff our parents on the State.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church is prepared, with your help and assistance, to take care of those who need such\nassistance, and if any of the Saints have cast their parents off, see if you can not get them to\ntake them back and administer to their wants themselves, and if they need help in this, let\nthem go to the bishop and get it in the right way.\n<\/p><p>\nThink of it, brethren, casting off the mother that bore and nursed you, the father that begot\nyou, letting the State care for them&mdash;and there are such cases.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we shall hold ourselves together, if we shall work shoulder to shoulder, if we shall rise to\nthe dignity of our Priesthood, and assume the obligations which God has given to us, we will\ncare for our own; and we can do it. Do not be lulled to sleep by any such false religious, or\ngovernmental, or social slogan as that the State owes to every man a subsistence. \"In the\nsweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23467\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23467)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23467)\">Gen. 3:19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWELFARE FUNDAMENTALS\n<\/p><p>\nNow about the Welfare. We have always regarded the Welfare as being set up for the needy;\nand when we have spoken of the needy we have thought of those who did not have enough to\neat or to wear; but there is a new group of needy coming now&mdash;those who will need help to\ncarry on their work&mdash;whether they be farmers or merchants, or industrialists. In the good old\ndays when I was a boy we used to change work. You men out in the country know all about\nthat, and those who are as gray as I am have been through it.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, the man who has a crop that needs harvesting is just as much in need as anyone\nelse. See to it that your Priesthood quorums are so organized that that need may be cared for,\nand do not push off this work upon the Chamber of Commerce. It is your responsibility.\n<\/p><p>\nFor several years we have been talking about Welfare gardens. Remember, we began that\nsome time ago, long before Victory gardens were thought of, and we urged you that if you\ncould not get a garden spot for yourself, that you get together in groups, that you raise what\nyou needed, and having raised it, that you then \"process\" it, as it is now called. Now, with all\nthe earnestness that I possess, I urge this course upon you again. I do not know how serious\nthis food shortage is, but I do know this: We cannot feed the world, feed ourselves, fight the\nworld, and furnish arms and ammunition for the world, and still live. I know what the\nsituation is around here, because I am in a position where I have to know.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to say something more: Up to this time your home-processed foods have not been\ntouched. You have not had to count them. Of course in principle it is a little difficult to see\nthe difference, on the one hand, between the man who, foreseeing and trying to forestall a\nfuture shortage, went out into the market a year or two or three years ago and bought and\nstored foodstuffs, and, on the other hand, the man who for the same purposes went out and\nraised his food and then did his own processing. If they can ration what is yours that you\nbought, by the same token they can ration what is yours that you raise. Now, you might have\nthat in mind, too. Your own processed foods will probably be the last thing that will be\ntouched, but you had better have it in mind that it may be rationed if not actually taken.\n<\/p><p>\nHowever, I can see no other wise course but to raise all that you can. Waste nothing. Try to\nhelp others who cannot raise their own. Process enough to keep your family, and then if you\nhave to surrender it, you have done your part, and the judgment and responsibility for the\nresult will rest upon somebody else.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to say something about another point. Ever since the Welfare Plan began, we\nhave been urged to try to do a great number of things. Times such as these make men prolific\nin theories; they are filled with wild ideas. One of the most difficult things that we have had\nto do is to stick to our knitting, to see that we did not get off into lines of activity which we\ncould not successfully carry on, because the Church&mdash;do not forget this, brethren&mdash;the Church\nmust not fail!\n<\/p><p>\nSome of the brethren are anxious to begin cooperatives. We are quite willing that they shall\ngo forward in any plan of that kind that they themselves determine, but we ask you to\nremember that it takes a merchant to run a cooperative; just anybody cannot do it. It involves\ngreat and difficult problems in credit&mdash;credit to friends and credit to neighbors, who may be\ngood or bad risks. But go ahead with your cooperatives if you wish, if you feel you are set up\nfor it. But please remember cooperatives are not part of the Welfare Plan. That plan has to do\nwith the caring for the wants of those who are in need and distress, not in saving money or\nmaking money for groups.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like you to give most careful consideration to these things which I have named. There\nare one or two other points that I want to mention.\n<\/p><p>\nSOCIAL PROBLEMS\n<\/p><p>\nFrom the foundation of this Church, almost, we have regarded marriage as one of the holiest\nrelationships into which we enter, marriage for time and eternity, a home here and a home\nhereafter. Now, you can only be married that way in the temple, and only those who are\nworthy members of the Church may go into the temple. No one else enters there. The rite is\nperformed for no one else but worthy members.\n<\/p><p>\nLong experience has shown that marriages between our young people and young people not\nmembers of the Church do not, as a rule, work out happily. In the great bulk of cases, the\nopposite is the result. These mixed marriages cannot be performed in the temple.\n<\/p><p>\nFurthermore, we stand for a single standard of chastity for boys and the girls. We look upon\nunchastity as a sin next to murder\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8820\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8820)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8820)\">Alma 39:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFor these reasons we have from the very beginning discouraged indiscriminate social\nminglings between our young people and young people who, as we have coined the phrase,\n\"are not of us.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe are now called to sacrifice our sons. I did not ask you to rise, but I am sure there are\nmany men here who have lost sons. I lost a son-in-law, as dear to me as my own son. Almost\nthe first explosion at Pearl Harbor took him. But the point I wish to make is that because we\nhave to sacrifice our sons is no reason why we should sacrifice our daughters.\n<\/p><p>\nEvery consideration of faith, principles of right living, Church doctrine, and Church standards,\nrequire that we should guard, as we would guard our lives, the chastity of our girls. There are\nall kinds of influences at work to break down these standards. I was told the other day that\nwe have a new phrase, that young girls who smoke and drink and may be doing other things,\ntalk about \"new Mormons\" as distinguished from the \"old Mormons.\" I wish to say to them\nthat those who abandon the standards and principles of the Church are not Mormons at all.\n<\/p><p>\nBut we must all be \"old Mormons.\" We are all a little bit too sensitive to the praise of others.\nWe are too eager that people shall say sweet things about us. We must go forward, whether\npeople praise us or censure us. We must guard the chastity of our girls no matter what anyone\nsays about it.\n<\/p><p>\nTO THE YOUNG WOMEN OF THE CHURCH\n<\/p><p>\nI want to say something to the young girls of the Church, and as it is a difficult subject, I\nhave written down what I wish to say.\n<\/p><p>\nYour brothers, your sweethearts, your young husbands are in the armed service of their\ncountry. They went away with pledges of devotion and loyalty to you, pledges that they\nwould keep themselves sexually clean. You are hoping, praying, and expecting that they will\nkeep their pledges to the letter. You made counter pledges orally or in your hearts. You\nexpect them to keep their pledges: they expect you to keep yours. Either violating the pledge,\nhas no right to expect its observance by the other.\n<\/p><p>\nFurthermore, you young women and girls, whose loved ones are in the service, expect them to\nkeep themselves pure in mind and heart as well as in body. You expect them to remember\nthat the Lord said: \"Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery\nwith her already in his heart\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33831\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33831)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33831)\">Matt. 5:28<\/a><\/span>);\nand that in our day He has added: \"If any shall\ncommit adultery in their hearts, they shall not have the Spirit, but shall deny the faith and\nshall fear\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11868\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11868)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11868)\">D&amp;C 63:16<\/a><\/span>).\nThat they may be free from this sin of the heart, you expect\nthem to keep wholly clear from social associations with bad companions, men or women. You\nexpect them to forego those light or frivolous amusements or recreations that might lead to\nthis sin,&mdash;you expect this notwithstanding they are subject over repeated periods of time to the\nhazard of immediate death itself, periods which give rise to the imperative need for intervals\nof relaxation and diversion so that reason may retain her throne and insanity be kept off.\n<\/p><p>\nAll this you expect of them.\n<\/p><p>\nMay they not rightfully expect as much of you? May they not justly expect that you too will\nremain free from bodily sin not only, but from this sin of the heart as well? May they not\nexpect that if they who are subject to the horrors and misery of war, subject to the stress and\nstrain of mortal combat, often hand to hand, that if they, to remain pure and clean, shall stay\nin camp away from the social diversions that bring temptation, that then you who are living in\nthe peace and quiet and security of home and parents and friends will give up the frivolities\nof social relaxation in order that you may surely keep yourselves clean and pure for them?\nSurely your sacrifice is as the molehill against theirs as the mountain. Putting it at the lowest\nprice, just good sportsmanship would require this much of you. Memory of the plighted faith\nwould demand it.\n<\/p><p>\nI urge you young women and girls to remember that in the schedule of crimes, unchastity\ncomes next to murder (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8821\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8821)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8821)\">Alma 39:5<\/a><\/span>).\nDo not subject yourselves to its penalty. The Lord has said: \"Blessed\nare the pure in heart: for they shall see God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33824\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33824)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33824)\">Matt. 5:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHE GREAT PARADOX\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a tragic spectacle man is showing to his God today. We have rightly boasted for nearly\na hundred years that in this, the Last Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, the Lord was\npouring out His inspiration and His blessings upon all the world, unlocking to His children\nsecrets that never were dreamed of by the ancients, giving them powers and dominions over\nthe forces of nature, bringing under subjection almost the universe. Look at what the last\ncentury has given us in art, literature, science, discoveries, for our blessing and advancement.\nGod gave all this to us to bless us. And then consider that now, in this terrible hour, every\ndevice, every invention, every discovery God gave us to bless us is being used to destroy one\nanother in one of the most barbarous wars of all time. God will not hold guiltless those\nresponsible for this holocaust.\n<\/p><p>\nGod give us strength and power to resist evil. You brethren here, the governing authority of\nthe Church, have almost infinite power in your hands, if you will but reach out and magnify\nyour calling and live righteously. The brethren today have time and again told you of your\nresponsibilities. Personally I always think of the responsibility I have; it helps to keep me at\nleast reasonably humble. But think also of the power that you have, the power to bless, the\npower to heal, the power to do all the things that the Lord wants done. The Lord will hold us\nresponsible for the exercise of that power. May He help you, I repeat, to magnify your\ncalling. May you be able to bring to the people in the times that are to come, comfort, and\nconsolation. May He help you to build up their faith, increase their testimonies, develop their\nknowledge, so that you may really honor His Priesthood, exercising the full functions thereof.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless us always, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
