I am certain there is nothing to compare with it&mdash;the thrill of\nparticipating in the greatest priesthood assemblage in the history of the world. These are\nsignificant times, brethren, and we should all be grateful to be taking part in this historic\npriesthood meeting.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I take just a brief moment to express personal greeting to those leaders from distant\nlands who have been called by a prophet to represent their people at this great conference.\nMay I express a special, warm <i>Kia Ora<\/i> to those from New Zealand who have done so much\nfor me in my life.\n<\/p><p>\nWe extend the arm of fellowship to every man and boy sitting in distant places. You too are\nparticipants in this meeting. Though miles away, your presence is a reality, and we feel your\nspirit in this historic Tabernacle in spite of the distance that separates us.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, have you ever heard the beautiful song, \"No Man Is an Island\"? Seclusion is\nincompatible with the spirit of the priesthood, and when you really analyze it, what can a man\ndo for himself with the priesthood? You young men administer the Sacrament for others. You\nusher and do things around the chapel for the convenience and comfort of others. The priests\nadminister the Sacrament that others might partake.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren of the Melchizedek Priesthood, you bless the sick. We do not bless ourselves with\nthe priesthood. We call in others who have the priesthood to bless us. We are always thinking\nin terms of someone else when we use the priesthood. To wilfully hide ourselves and live as\nhermits would be to allow our priesthood to wither and die. The Savior showed us the way;\nhe set the pattern. His was a life of thinking and doing for others. This was the sum and\nsubstance of his entire existence in mortality.\n<\/p><p>\nOur great challenge here in mortality, then, is in the overcoming&mdash;the overcoming of things\nin mortality, these obstacles of the flesh; and in due course all appetites and habits must be\nbrought under control that we may feel comfortable in the presence of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\n\"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame,\nand am set down with my Father in his throne\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42321\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42321)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42321)\">Rev. 3:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIs there a priesthood holder within range of my voice that does not have as the foremost\ndesire of his heart the great possibility of one day regaining the presence of his Heavenly\nFather? This is the sum and substance of it all. To aspire to this great blessing supersedes all\nelse in the mind and heart of the priesthood holder.\n<\/p><p>\nAll of us need help in this important process of overcoming. The man doesn't live that is\ncapable of doing it on his own. \"No man is an island\"; no being can stand alone.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the wisest things that we can do is to benefit from others who have passed this way.\nOur first loyal band of pioneers who entered this beautiful valley nearly 115 years ago had\nscouts exploring many dead-end canyons and impossible mountain passes in selecting the best\npossible route for covered wagons. Subsequent companies found it much easier. The mistakes\nhad already been made. Why make them again?\n<\/p><p>\nIt would be foolish for us to waste time in remaking all of the mistakes of\nour predecessors. In the first place, we would not live long enough to make all the mistakes,\nso we must do the wise thing. We must take advantage of mistakes that have already been\nmade. Perhaps the Lord had this in mind when he gave us the thought that \"the glory of God\nis intelligence\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14194\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14194)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14194)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span>).\nCertainly that man is intelligent who would take advantage of a path that has\nalready been clearly marked.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, the intelligence to benefit from those who know is really the key to our success. And\nnow we ask the question, \"Who are those who know? Whom can we trust as we seek counsel\non vital matters?\" And I would like to direct the thinking at this point to our young men of\nthe Aaronic Priesthood, these young men who have many problems, many questions, always\nwondering who would be the logical person.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is easy to be misled. It is so simple to seek our information from the improper source. I\nonce heard a story about a jeweler. This jeweler kept a fine-looking chronometer in his store\nwindow to attract attention and as a suggestion of accurate time keeping. Early each morning\nhe noticed a man through the window. He would stop, look at the chronometer, and then\ncarefully adjust his watch accordingly.\n<\/p><p>\nOne day the jeweler was outside sweeping the walk in preparation for his day's business when\nthe usual passerby stopped for his usual watch-setting ceremony, and the jeweler asked the\nman why he always stopped to set his watch at the same time every morning.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well, you see,\" said the man proudly, \"I happen to be the timekeeper at the plant. One of my\njobs is to blow the whistle at precisely 8:00 am and at 4:30 pm. They all depend on my\nwhistle to be accurate.\" The jeweler smiled and said, \"Well, do you know, for over a year\nnow I have been setting my chronometer by your whistle!\"\n<\/p><p>\nSo you see, young men, sometimes we are misled, uncertain as to where the real authoritative\nsource might be. Sometimes we see a fine-looking chronometer, but it has to be working\nproperly and it has to be set properly. Sometimes we see men who are esteemed men in the\ncommunity, but they may not always be the best source for the question that we have.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung men, you have three main authoritative sources for your information. The first is your\nHeavenly Father, and just as surely as the Prophet Joseph received an answer to his humble\nquestion 142 years ago, so you may expect guidance from a loving Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nThe second authoritative source of correct counsel and guidance is available from the one you\naffectionately refer to as \"Dad.\" Dad, I hope the door is open for your boy. I hope the door is\nopen wide that he may seek counsel when it is required. I hope he can come to his dad and\ntalk about vital matters without being embarrassed. I hope we dads are living closely enough\nto our family situations that we may sense the appropriate time and place for a few minutes of\nkindly talk, and, incidentally dads, lots of listening, lots of listening! I think this is the key to\neffective counseling with our young people. We have to do lots of listening. We have to have\nthe full story before we can counsel properly.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd boys, I want to tell you that you will never\nhave a better friend in all your lives than your dad, and don't you ever forget it.\n<\/p><p>\nThe third authoritative source is your wonderful bishop&mdash;one who has been ordained and set\napart to be the father of his ward, and especially a friend to the Aaronic Priesthood boys and\nto girls of corresponding age.\n<\/p><p>\nBishop, are you too busy to counsel with your young people? If you are too busy, then the\nwork load must be reorganized. How about assigning additional jobs to your counselors? How\nabout letting them carry some of the other loads so you can free yourself for the all-important\njob of counseling with your young people at convenient and frequent intervals?\n<\/p><p>\nWhen to interview? Always before a boy is ordained or advanced in the priesthood. Always at\nthe end of every year as we evaluate the boy for another Aaronic Priesthood award. And\ncertainly whenever needed as may be directed by the Spirit of our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nHow do we interview, bishops? We interview with the spirit of love, and this should be the\nentire purpose of every interview&mdash;love. This should be the underlying factor. There should\nbe no other source but love as we talk to our young people and seek to guide them in the\nproper direction. And like dad, the bishop should be a good listener, too, with the wisdom of\nSolomon.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, young men, we have just talked about three good sources of counsel, and I hope we do\nnot go to the gang to get our counsel. I hope we do not go to boys of our age who have not\nbeen over the trail, boys who have just heard, but really don't know what to advise. Oh, they\nwill always be quick to give advice, but it is not always the right source. You may even find\na boy who is older than the rest, who may have set himself up as somewhat of a chronometer.\nHe may look impressive, but, boys, let's depend on our Heavenly Father. Let's depend on\ndad, and let's look to the bishop for the counsel that will be most effective in our lives.\n<\/p><p>\nCommunication&mdash;heart-to-heart communication! I wonder how much better off the world\nwould be today if proper communication, not just words, but proper communication were\ntaking place where we feel the spirit of what is being said and receive the true interpretation?\nThen counseling could go on properly. Men's minds would come to a common understanding,\nand there would be peace.\n<\/p><p>\nWe read in Proverbs: \"Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of\ncounsellors there is safety\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41443\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41443)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41443)\">Prov. 11:14<\/a><\/span>).\nI am certain that the Lord meant exactly what we\nare talking about tonight when he refers to the multitude of counselors&mdash;thousands of dads,\nhundreds of bishops.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, young men of the Aaronic Priesthood, it takes determination&mdash;determination to do the\nright thing at the right time. And so we as a Presiding Bishopric would admonish you tonight\nto seek out your dad and your bishop at the appropriate time and let them listen to your story,\nand I want to tell you that you will be guided in the right path.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd, young men, as you have this determination to live your lives right and prepare\nyourselves for Melchizedek Priesthood opportunities tomorrow, I would quickly like to tell\nyou a story. It comes from far-off New Zealand, and it is one of the finest stories that I have\nheard in a long time. It concerns a world champion.\n<\/p><p>\nThis world champion is Peter Snell, who holds several world records, including the mile run.\nHe set this record just a few months ago. Do you know how Peter Snell trains? Do you know\nwhat he goes through? He was telling a group of LDS people down in New Zealand just a\nfew weeks ago that when he goes out to run, he does all of his running uphill, and then when\nhe meets his competition on a flat track it seems like running downhill. Then he will go out\nand run in the sand, in the deep sand, and when he gets on a flat cinder track, he feels just as\nif his feet have wings on them. You will see Peter Snell out running on the wettest, most\nblustery, wintry day, and when you ask Peter Snell why he is out running on such a day as\nthis, his answer is, \"The opposition is all home by the fire. Now I can get the edge on them.\"\nThese are the thoughts of a champion.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung men of the priesthood, tomorrow's challenge is\ngreat. Why don't you exert the effort to do some running in the sand? Do a little plugging\nuphill, and work when it is not always convenient, when it might be a little stormy out; and I\nwant to tell you young men, you will be headed in the direction of a champion in the\npriesthood of your Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren of the priesthood, I bear you my testimony that the gospel is true. I know with all\nmy heart it is true, and I know for a surety that the boy Prophet went into the grove; there he\nsaw God the Father and his Son. I know this just as surely as I stand here, because it has been\nrevealed to me in my heart, and I am grateful for that.\n<\/p><p>\nI leave this testimony with you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
