The Constitution tells us what\n  shall not be a lawful tender. Article I, Section 10 declares that nothing else except gold and silver\n  shall be lawful tender, this not saying that gold and silver shall be lawful tender. It only provides that\n  the state may make a law to make gold and silver lawful tender. I know of no state in the Union that\n  has passed such a law; and I am sure that Illinois has not. The legislature has ceded up to us the\n  privilege of enacting such laws as are not inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States and\n  the state of Illinois; and we stand in the same relation to the state as the state does to the Union. The\n  clause referred to in the Constitution is for the legislature&mdash;it is not a law for the people. The\n  different states, and even Congress itself, have passed many laws diametrically contrary to the\n  Constitution of the United States.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">The state of Illinois has passed a stay law making property a lawful tender for the payment of\n  debts; and if we have no law on the subject we must be governed by it. Shall we be such fools as to\n  be governed by its laws, which are unconstitutional? No!  We will make a law for gold and silver;\n  and then the state law ceases and we can collect our debts. Powers not delegated to the states or\n  reserved from the states are constitutional. The Constitution acknowledges that the people have all\n  power not reserved to itself. I am a lawyer; I am a big lawyer and comprehend heaven, earth and\n  hell, to bring forth knowledge that shall cover up all lawyers, doctors and other big bodies. This is\n  the doctrine of the Constitution, so help me God. The Constitution is not law to us, but it makes\n  provision for us whereby we can make laws. Where it provides that no one shall be hindered from\n  worshiping God according to his own conscience,<span class=\"footRef\">1<\/span> is a law.<span class=\"footRef\">2<\/span> No legislature can enact a law to\n  prohibit it. The Constitution provides to regulate bodies of men and not individuals.
