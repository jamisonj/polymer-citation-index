May I share some of what I have learned by way of personal reflection and testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/our-duty-to-god-the-mission-of-parents-and-leaders-to-the-rising-generation.p7\" class=\"\">For all of us, doing our duty to God as parents and leaders begins with leading by example\u2014consistently and diligently living gospel principles at home. This takes daily determination and diligence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/our-duty-to-god-the-mission-of-parents-and-leaders-to-the-rising-generation.p8\" class=\"\">For youth, there is no substitute for seeing the gospel lived in our daily lives. The stripling warriors did not have to wonder what their parents believed. They said, \u201cWe do not doubt our mothers knew it\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120398\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120398)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120398)\">Alma 56:47\u201348<\/a><\/span>).

I told him I wasn\u2019t old enough to see that film. He was puzzled until his grandmother explained to him that the rating system by age didn\u2019t apply to Grandpa. He came back to me and said, \u201cI get it now, Grandpa. You\u2019re never going to be old enough to see that movie, are you?\u201d And he was right!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/our-duty-to-god-the-mission-of-parents-and-leaders-to-the-rising-generation.p10\" class=\"\">Besides showing youth the way by example, we lead them by understanding their hearts and walking alongside them on the gospel path. To truly understand their hearts, we must do more than just be in the same room or attend the same family and Church activities. We must plan and take advantage of teaching moments that make a deep and lasting impression upon their minds and hearts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/our-duty-to-god-the-mission-of-parents-and-leaders-to-the-rising-generation.p11\" class=\"\">For example, Church leaders regularly plan priesthood activities and Scouting pow wows and encampments\u2014but do those activities always accomplish their most important purpose? I have learned that what makes a priesthood or Scout activity most meaningful to a boy is not just getting a merit badge but having the opportunity to sit and talk with a leader who is interested in him and his life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/our-duty-to-god-the-mission-of-parents-and-leaders-to-the-rising-generation.p12\" class=\"\">Similarly, mothers and fathers, as you drive or walk children to school or their various activities, do you use the time to talk with them about their hopes and dreams and fears and joys? Do you take the time to have them take the earplugs from their MP3 players and all the other devices so that they can hear you and feel of your love? The more I live, the more I recognize that the teaching moments in my youth, especially those provided by my parents, have shaped my life and made me who I am.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/our-duty-to-god-the-mission-of-parents-and-leaders-to-the-rising-generation.p13\" class=\"\">It is impossible to overestimate the influence of parents who understand the hearts of their children. Research shows that during the most important transitions of life\u2014including those periods when youth are most likely to drift away from the Church\u2014the greatest influence does not come from an interview with the bishop or some other leader but from the regular, warm, friendly, caring interaction with parents.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/our-duty-to-god-the-mission-of-parents-and-leaders-to-the-rising-generation.p14\" class=\"\">With that in mind, when we sit down at the dinner table, is our whole family there? I remember as a young man asking permission to play baseball through dinnertime. \u201cJust put my meal in the oven,\u201d I said to my mother. She responded, \u201cRobert, I really want you to take a break, come home, be with the family for dinner, and then you can go out and play baseball until dark.\u201d She taught all of us that where family meals are concerned, it\u2019s not the food but the family interaction that nourishes the soul. My mother taught that the greatest love we give is within our homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/our-duty-to-god-the-mission-of-parents-and-leaders-to-the-rising-generation.p15\" class=\"\">For our interactions with youth to truly touch their hearts, we have to pay attention to them just as we would pay attention to a trusted adult colleague or close friend. Most important is asking them questions, letting them talk, and then being willing to listen\u2014yes, listen and listen some more\u2014even hearken with spiritual ears! Several years ago I was reading the newspaper when one of my young grandsons snuggled up to me. As I read, I was delighted to hear his sweet voice chattering on in the background. Imagine my surprise when, a few moments later, he pushed himself between me and the paper. Taking my face in his hands and pressing his nose up to mine, he asked, \u201cGrandpa! Are you in there?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/our-duty-to-god-the-mission-of-parents-and-leaders-to-the-rising-generation.p16\" class=\"\">Mother, Father, are you in there? Grandpa, Grandma, are you there? Being <span class=\"emphasis\">there<\/span> means understanding the hearts of our youth and connecting with them.

Then she tenderly explained, tears flowing down her cheek, \u201cRecently I have been working with my fourth daughter by actually doing her projects with her. It has made all the difference in our lives and our relationship. But oh, what sadness I feel when I realize what I lost by not doing this with my other three daughters.\u201d The saddest words of tongue and pen are those that say, \u201cIt might have been!\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-09205_000_037\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See \u201cMaud Muller,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">The Complete Poetical Works of John Greenleaf Whittier<\/span> (1876), 206.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/our-duty-to-god-the-mission-of-parents-and-leaders-to-the-rising-generation.p18\" class=\"\">Adult members of the Church should understand that Personal Progress and Duty to God requirements are not just lengthy lists of items to check off.

We can teach them to walk in the light, but that light cannot be borrowed. They must earn it for themselves.

In these sacred settings, we can also help them understand, deep in their hearts, who they are and how fortunate they are to have come to this earth and to our home and to participate in the covenants we have taken in the temple to be a family forever. In every interaction we share, we demonstrate the principles and blessings of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/our-duty-to-god-the-mission-of-parents-and-leaders-to-the-rising-generation.p23\" class=\"\">In these perilous times it is not enough for our youth to merely <span class=\"emphasis\">know.<\/span> They must <span class=\"emphasis\">do.<\/span> Wholehearted participation in ordinances, quorums and auxiliaries, inspired programs, and fortifying activities helps youth put on the whole armor of God. Will we help them put on that armor so they can withstand the fiery darts of the adversary? To truly choose the Lord\u2019s way, they must know His way.
