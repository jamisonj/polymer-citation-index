When I became fully aware of the immense effort required to prepare a single course of study, I was overwhelmed. I now have much greater appreciation for the approved teaching materials of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/teaching-no-greater-call.p4\" class=\"\">Let me give you an example. The present <span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Doctrine Teacher\u2019s Supplement,<\/span> which was prepared to help teachers teach the New Testament, was written by a committee of faithful and knowledgeable Church-service writers, who were called and set apart for that service by one of the General Authorities. Their work commenced in the spring of 1980, following General Authority approval of the outline. Writing committee members spent thousands of hours researching, writing, and attending biweekly committee meetings, where the entire committee critiqued each lesson carefully and suggested improvements. The work of the writing committee then was reviewed by General Authority Managing Directors of the Priesthood and Curriculum departments, the General Presidency and the General Board of the Sunday School, Church Editing, and Church Correlation Review. This manual received careful scrutiny at many levels before it was approved for use in Sunday School this year. All teaching materials for the Church follow this same basic procedure in their preparation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/teaching-no-greater-call.p5\" class=\"\">Teachers would be well advised to study carefully the scriptures and their manuals before reaching out for supplemental materials. Far too many teachers seem to stray from the approved curriculum materials without fully reviewing them. If teachers feel a need to use some good supplemental resources beyond the scriptures and manuals in presenting a lesson, they should first consider the use of the Church magazines.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/teaching-no-greater-call.p6\" class=\"\">Teachers can stay on safe ground when they use the standard works, the approved manuals, and the writings of the General Authorities. Elder Hyrum M. Smith of the Council of the Twelve said, \u201cThere is more to be learned in five minutes reading in the Holy Scriptures, more that is worthy of retention in the memory, more that will be helpful if we remember and obey them, than we can find in reading all of the six best sellers in every month in the year.\u201d (In Conference Report, Oct. 1917, p. 38.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/teaching-no-greater-call.p7\" class=\"\">I believe there is no greater call in the Church than to be an effective teacher.
