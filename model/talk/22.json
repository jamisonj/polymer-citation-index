Grant, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, p. 97<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nYou have heard the message of the First Presidency. I think that it is unnecessary for me to\nadd anything further.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I said yesterday at the marvelous meeting that we had in the temple, I feel that it is not\nwisdom for me to stay longer on account of my ill health. I appreciate the fact that you all\nknow as I have said so often I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the\nliving God, the Redeemer of the world, and that Joseph Smith was His Prophet.\n<\/p><p>\nI can say nothing more than is said in this message from the presidency of the Church. I can\nonly hope that the people of the world may realize the fact that we are in very deed the\nChurch of Jesus Christ and not the Church of any man, and that there is no ambition in our\nhearts for personal power or prestige in the world. All that we desire is the salvation of\nmankind. May God help us.\n<\/p><p>\nI never forget one little statement, I think it is in the eighteenth section of the Doctrine and\nCovenants: \"And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this\npeople, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the\nkingdom of my Father!\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50085\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50085)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50085)\">D&amp;C 18:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you all. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
