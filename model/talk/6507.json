My greatest hope is that as I speak, the Holy Ghost will touch hearts, and somewhere a spouse or two will quietly nudge his or her companion, and a moment of truth will occur.

What is the most important way to set our families, both immediate and extended, in order? Is it possible that in spiritual matters our example speaks louder than our words? Temple marriage, family prayer, scripture study, and family home evening are all vitally important. But there is another dimension\u2014the dimension of service. If we are willing to leave our loved ones for service in the mission field, we will bless them with a heritage that will teach and inspire them for generations to come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p8\" class=\"\">It is significant to me that after commanding the Brethren to teach their children light and truth and set their families in order, the Lord immediately called them on missions. \u201cNow, I say unto you, my friends, let my servant Sidney Rigdon go on his journey, and make haste, and also proclaim \u2026 the gospel of salvation\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11181\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11181)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11181)\">D&amp;C 93:51<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p9\" class=\"\">As we serve in the mission field, our children and grandchildren will be blessed in ways that would not have been possible had we stayed at home. Talk to couples who have served missions and they will tell you of blessings poured out: inactive children activated, family members baptized, and testimonies strengthened because of their service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p10\" class=\"\">One missionary couple left a farm at home for their son to manage. During the somewhat dry year that followed, their farm had two hay cuttings while the neighbor\u2019s had only one. The neighbor asked their son why he had two cuttings compared to their one. The young man replied, \u201cYou need to send your folks on a mission.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p11\" class=\"\">If the blessings for missionary couples and their families are so plentiful, why are only a few thousand serving instead of the tens of thousands that are so desperately needed? I believe the four F\u2019s often stand in their way: <span class=\"emphasis\">Fear, Family concerns, Finances,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">Finding the right mission opportunity.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p12\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">First, fear.<\/span> Fear of the unknown or fear that we don\u2019t have the scriptural skills or language required can cause reluctance to serve. But the Lord has said, \u201cIf ye are prepared ye shall not fear\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11111\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11111)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11111)\">D&amp;C 38:30<\/a><\/span>). Your life is your preparation. You have valuable experience. You have raised a family and served in the Church. Just go and be yourselves. The Lord has promised that angels will go before you (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"11192\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11192)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11192)\">D&amp;C 103:19\u201320<\/a><\/span>). You will be told by the Spirit what to say and when to say it in a very natural process as you strengthen young missionaries, testify to investigators and new members, teach leadership skills, and friendship and fellowship less-active members, helping them return to full activity. <span class=\"emphasis\">You<\/span> are the testimony, and you will touch the lives of those with whom you come in contact. Couples normally do not tract and are not expected to memorize discussions or maintain the same schedule as young elders and sisters. Simply be yourself. Serve to the best of your ability, and the Lord will bless you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p13\" class=\"\">Missionary couples provide stability with their friendshipping and leadership skills in areas where the Church is in its infancy. I learned this firsthand while serving as a mission president in England. I assigned a couple who had been serving in the visitors\u2019 center to work in a small, struggling unit. They were somewhat fearful of having to leave the \u201csafe haven\u201d of the visitors\u2019 center. But with faith they went to work. Within six months, a unit which had 15 to 20 people coming to sacrament meeting had over 100 attending because of this couple\u2019s fellowshipping, working with the priesthood. To this day, they and their children refer to that time as the greatest experience of their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p14\" class=\"\">Another couple recently served in a small village south of Santiago, Chile. They had no Spanish skills and were apprehensive about being in a different country so far from the comforts of home. But they plunged in with total dedication, loving and serving the people. Before long, the small branch grew from 12 to 75 members. When it came time for them to leave, the entire branch rented a bus so they could go to the airport, four hours away, and say good-bye to their special friends.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p15\" class=\"\">The service that couples provide is essential to the work of the Lord. Couples can make a difference. Couples can accomplish remarkable things no one else can do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p16\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Second, family concerns.<\/span> The Savior called upon fishermen, entreating them, \u201cFollow me\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33589\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33589)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33589)\">Matt. 4:19<\/a><\/span>). He beseeched them to leave their familiar settings behind and become fishers of men. What is asked of couple missionaries is less than half a tithe of the time they will spend on earth. In the eternal perspective, a mission is but a few moments away from familiar settings, family, and having retirement fun with old friends.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p17\" class=\"\">The Lord will send special blessings to your family as you serve. \u201cI, the Lord, give unto them a promise that I will provide for their families\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11206\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11206)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11206)\">D&amp;C 118:3<\/a><\/span>). Couples are sometimes concerned that in their absence they will miss weddings, births, family reunions, and other family events. We have learned that the impact on families while grandparents are on missions is worth a thousand sermons. Families are greatly strengthened as they pray for their parents and grandparents and read letters sent home which share their testimonies and the contribution they are making in the mission field.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p18\" class=\"\">A son wrote a tender letter to his parents in the mission field: \u201cYour service sets an example for our children. As a result, they are more willing to serve in their callings in the Church. It teaches us all to be more charitable as we exchange letters and send packages. When we receive letters and news from you, it strengthens our testimonies. Even though you retired from your profession and should have been happy by all the world\u2019s standards, by going on your mission you have shown us a new way to be happy. You have found happiness money can\u2019t buy. We have seen you overcome medical and other types of adversities and have seen you blessed for your willingness to go and leave your children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. We love you dearly!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p19\" class=\"\">Another couple reports: \u201cOne of our grandsons wrote to us while we were in Thailand and told us that he hadn\u2019t decided for sure that he wanted to fill a mission, but we had set the example for him and now he knew he wanted to serve. He is now serving a mission.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p20\" class=\"\">My own father and mother served a mission in England. As I visited them one day in their small flat, I watched my mother, with a shawl wrapped snugly around her shoulders, putting shillings in the gas meter to keep warm. I asked, \u201cWhy did you come on a mission, Mother?\u201d Mother said simply, \u201cBecause I have 11 grandsons. I want them to know that Grandma and Grandpa served.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p21\" class=\"\">In 1830 the Lord called Thomas B. Marsh to leave his family and go into the mission field. Brother Marsh was greatly concerned about leaving his family at that time. In a tender revelation, the Lord told him, \u201cI will bless you and your family, yea, your little ones. \u2026 Lift up your heart and rejoice, for the hour of your mission is come. \u2026 Wherefore, your family shall live. \u2026 Go from them only for a little time, and declare my word, and I will prepare a place for them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11108\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11108)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11108)\">D&amp;C 31:2\u20133, 5\u20136<\/a><\/span>). It is just possible that these are the blessings that are needed most for your children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and future posterity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p22\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Third, finances.<\/span> Some couples who would willingly serve are not able to do so because of age, health, finances, or family circumstances. Perhaps those who are not able to serve could assist another couple to go on a mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p23\" class=\"\">Missionary work has always involved sacrifice. If some sacrifices are necessary, then the blessings will be all the more abundant. Children, encourage your parents to serve and assist them with financial support if necessary. You may lose a baby-sitter for a short time, but the eternal rewards you and your family receive will more than compensate for the brief sacrifice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p24\" class=\"\">To younger couples with children still at home, I urge you now to decide to serve in your later years and to plan and prepare so you are financially, physically, and spiritually able. Make certain that the great example of missionary service is a heritage you will leave your posterity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p25\" class=\"\">There are two unique times in our lives when we can truly live the law of consecration and devote ourselves in full-time service to the Lord. One is as a young man or woman serving a full-time mission. The other is the unique time you are given after having fulfilled the requirements of earning a living. The latter could be called the \u201cpatriarchal years,\u201d when you can draw upon the rich experiences of a lifetime, go out as a couple, and consecrate yourselves fully as servants of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p26\" class=\"\">The blessings of serving with your eternal companion are priceless and can only be understood by those who have experienced it. My wife and I have had that privilege in the mission field. Each day is a special day with daily rewards that cause personal growth and development in the Lord\u2019s time and in the Lord\u2019s way. The fulfillment that comes from this kind of service will bless you, your marriage, and your family for eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p27\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Finally, finding the right mission opportunity.<\/span> The ways in which couples can serve are virtually limitless. From mission office support and leadership training to family history, temple work, and humanitarian service\u2014there is an opportunity to use almost any skill or talent with which the Lord has blessed you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p28\" class=\"\">Sit down with your companion, make an inventory of your health, financial resources, and unique gifts and talents. Then, if all is in order, go to your bishop and say, \u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d You may feel it is improper to approach your bishop or branch president about your desires to serve a mission. But it is proper for a mature sister or couple to let their priesthood leaders know that they are willing and able to serve a mission. I urge you to do so.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p29\" class=\"\">Bishops, there should be no hesitation on your part to initiate a Recommend for Missionary Service interview to discuss and encourage missionary couples to serve a mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/couple-missionaries-a-time-to-serve.p30\" class=\"\">Elder Clarence R. Bishop, director of the Mormon Handcart Visitors\u2019 Center, has served five missions. The first one he served as a young man. The last four missions, he was interviewed to serve by inspired priesthood leaders.
