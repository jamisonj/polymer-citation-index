The record says that \u201cthey were men of a sound understanding,\u201d who \u201chad searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God. But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9168\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9168)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9168)\">Alma 17:2\u20133<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/upon-judeas-plains.p30\" class=\"\">Now this gives us two premises. On the one hand we are obligated and required to know the doctrines of the Church. We are to treasure up the words of eternal life. We are to reason as intelligently as we are able. We are to use every faculty and capacity with which we are endowed to proclaim the message of salvation and to make it intelligent to ourselves and to our Father\u2019s other children. But after we have done that, and also in the process of doing it, we are obligated to bear testimony\u2014to let the world know and our associate members of the Church know\u2014that in our hearts, by the revelation of the Holy Spirit to our souls, we know of the truth and divinity of the work and of the doctrines that we teach.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/upon-judeas-plains.p31\" class=\"\">Now let me, if I may, take a classical illustration from the ancient records of how this is done. Peter and his associates had the same obligation for their day that we have for ours: to carry the message of salvation to the ends of the earth. I suppose Peter read and taught the revelations that Isaiah and the prophets gave about Christ and his gospel. He reasoned with the people about them. He followed the divine counsel, \u201cCome now, and let us reason together. \u2026\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25420\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25420)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25420)\">Isa. 1:18<\/a><\/span>.)

After he had taught the doctrines and after he had reasoned, he bore a personal witness of the truth and divinity of what he was presenting to his fellowmen; and the Lord prepared him to do just that by giving him spiritual experiences, by letting the power of the Holy Spirit rest upon him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/upon-judeas-plains.p33\" class=\"\">You will recall, for instance, that Peter and some others of the Twelve and a small group of saints were assembled in an upper room; that the Lord Jesus appeared; that the people there assembled were terrified and affrighted; and that the Lord said to them: \u201cWhy are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?

It was the Lord\u2019s way of giving to Peter and his associates a witness of the truth and divinity of his divine Sonship. If he rose from the dead, he was the Son of God; if he was the Son of God, then the gospel of salvation they were proclaiming was true; and so their obligation was to establish in the minds of men that Jesus rose from the dead. Now as I say, they might have attempted to do this by quoting Isaiah, or reasoning out of the revelations, which of course they did; but having so done, they then had to bear a personal witness; and I now read a sample of such a witness that Peter bore.

The Lord Jesus came through the wall. He appeared to us. I recognized him. He was the same person with whom I had labored and traveled for three and a half years.
