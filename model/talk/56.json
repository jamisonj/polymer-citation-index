Widtsoe, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1943, pp. 37-39<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nDear brethren, fellow-workers in the cause of Christ, I pray that I may be guided by the good\nspirit that has been with us throughout this day in the few words I may say.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to comment on the theme which was placed before us by President Clawson.\nThis conference coincides, so it happens, with the fiftieth anniversary of the dedication of the\ngreat Salt Lake Temple. That beautiful edifice, made of granite and lifting its spires\nheavenward, is an evidence of the willingness of the Latter-day Saints to yield obedience to\nthe will of God, and to sacrifice in behalf of His cause.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF TEMPLE WORK\n<\/p><p>\nThe work done in the temples of the Lord represents the culmination of the obligations,\nprivileges and blessings of the Priesthood. No man has completed&mdash;nor a woman with\nhim&mdash;the Priesthood cycle until he has received the blessings that the temple has to offer.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is sometimes thought that the work done in the temples is for the aged, and decrepit.\nTemple work is, primarily I was about to say, for those engaged in the active affairs of life,\nfor those who are in the midst of life's battle, the young and the middle-aged. Perhaps they\nneed it most. Certainly, it is quite as much for these as for those who seek refuge in their old\nage in the blessings of the temple.\n<\/p><p>\nWork in the temples is also for the dead. That we all know. Imbedded in the temple\nceremonies and endowment is one of the most glorious of all the principles of truth given in\nthis day&mdash;the principle of universal salvation. We are all the children of God, His very\nchildren; and He desires to bring all of us back into His presence, into His kingdom. He has\nprovided means by which this may be done. He has no favorites, except as we ourselves by\nour imperfect living may defeat His desire. That is one of the great doctrines of the Church;\nunique and peculiar to this people. It is a challenging doctrine, that though a man may fail to\nbear the gospel upon earth, though he may fail, when he hears it, to comprehend it, he may\nyet have the opportunity after the grave, after this life is over, to participate in the blessings\nof the gospel, and to win his place in the kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a marvelous and comforting thought that there is hope beyond the grave. Millions have\ndied in sorrow, and those who have been left behind have sorrowed and suffered, because\nthey have failed to understand this law, one of the fundamental, basic principles of the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nTemple work is very important. The Prophet Joseph Smith is reported to have said&mdash;it is so\nrecorded and printed&mdash;that there is no more important duty resting upon the Latter-day Saints\nthan to do the work for which we have erected temples. It is interesting to remember that in\nthe D&amp;C, the collection of some of the revelations given by the Lord to the Prophet Joseph\nSmith, the oldest revelation, therefore really the first, deals almost wholly with the subject of\nsalvation for the dead (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11842\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11842)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11842)\">D&amp;C 2:1-3<\/a><\/span>).\nIt is a significant fact of history, also, that Brigham Young had been in\nthis valley only four days when he came to a spot a few feet from where we are meeting\ntoday, in the midst of the sagebrush, and placed his cane in the ground, saying: \"Here we\nshall build a temple to the Most High.\" The pioneers were hungry and weary; they needed\nfood and rest; a hostile desert looked them in the face; yet in the midst of such physical\nrequirements they turned first to the building of temples and to the spiritual food and strength\nthat the temples provide.\n<\/p><p>\nSometimes we forget the greatness of this work. It is a glorious thought that you and I,\nordinary men, may do work upon earth that will be, is, recognized in heaven; that we may be\nas saviors to those who have gone before us into the unseen world. The Lord came upon earth\nand, in our behalf, in behalf of the whole race of God's children, did work which will bring\nus eternal life and joy and blessings. So, in a humbler manner may we, each one of us, do\nwork for the dead that will bless them eternally, if they accept our service. We, also, may\nbecome saviors &mdash;\"saviors on Mount Zion\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41158\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41158)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41158)\">Obad. 1:21<\/a><\/span>).\nThat is a glorious thought that should remain in\nthe minds of Latter-day Saints. It certifies to the claim that mankind are equally the children\nof God. It extends the doctrine of brotherhood to the whole human race.\n<\/p><p>\nLOVE IS SHOWN BY SACRIFICE\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior gave of Himself, gave His very life that we might live. To sacrifice that others\nmight be blessed was His word, His work, His life. Sacrifice is the evidence of true love.\nWithout sacrifice love is not manifest. Without sacrifice there is no real love, or kindness, the\nkindness suggested in the splendid theme discussed by Bishop Ashton. We love no one unless\nwe sacrifice for him. We can measure the degree of love that we possess for any man or\ncause, by the sacrifice we make for him or it.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the Lord gave His life to prove His love for His brethren and sisters, the human race, we\nmay show the spirit of love more vigorously than we have done if we will make the small\nsacrifices necessary to seek out our genealogies, to spend time and money for the work, to\ntake time to go to the temple ourselves for the dead. All such service may entail sacrifice, but\nsacrifice lifts us toward the likeness of God, the likeness of our Elder Brother Jesus Christ. If\nwe Latter-day Saints have any great ideal, it is that of our Elder Brother. All that we strive\nfor, and all that we have fought for, and all that we pray for, is to become more and more\nlike Him as our days and years increase. As He gave His life, unselfishly for us, so each of\nus, extending the open door of salvation to the dead, most of whom are but names to us, may\nthen by our unselfishness claim in very deed to be followers of Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nPOWER AND STRENGTH CAN COME FROM UNSEEN WORLD\n<\/p><p>\nTemple work, in form and substance, reflects the fundamental principles and thoughts\nbelonging to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. We must dig deeply to taste the sweetness of\nthe gospel. We cannot merely move about on the surface to secure the full gift of the Lord's\nplan of salvation. Deep down in the eternal realities, of which temple work is one, lies the\nreal meaning, message, and blessing of the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nThese are trying days, in which Satan rages, at home and abroad, hard days, evil and ugly\ndays. We stand helpless as it seems before them. We need help. We need strength. We need\nguidance. Perhaps if we would do our work in behalf of those of the unseen world who\nhunger and pray for the work we can do for them, the unseen world would in return give us\nhelp in this day of our urgent need. There are more in that other world than there are here.\nThere is more power and strength there than we have here upon this earth. We have but a\ntrifle, and that trifle is taken from the immeasurable power of God. We shall make no mistake\nin becoming collaborators in the Lord's mighty work for human redemption.\n<\/p><p>\nSo my message to you, my brethren, the leaders of Israel, is that in performing our many\nduties, we remember to give a good share of our time and thought and energy to the work for\nwhich this great Salt Lake Temple, and the other temples, were erected.\n<\/p><p>\nThe story of the rising of the Salt Lake Temple, round by round, in the midst of poverty and\nhardship, and under the unspeakable persecution of our people, is one that will never be\nforgotten by the Latter-day Saints. It will rise to become an epic of man's devotion to truth. It\nshould be a great inspiration for us in our day. We do not want easy days; we want days, no\nmatter how hard they may be, that lead us into the likeness of our Brother, Jesus Christ, and\ninto His presence, and His Father's.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us and prosper us in our work, and make us capable to do the work which has been\nplaced upon us, I pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
