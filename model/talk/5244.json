This building has a spirit, a quality unique and wonderful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/building-your-tabernacle.p17\" class=\"\">Four days after the 1847 arrival of the pioneers in this valley, Brigham Young touched his cane to the parched earth and said, \u201cHere we will build a temple to our God.\u201d The ten acres on which the temple stands have come to be known as Temple Square. The first structure erected here was a bowery. It was a temporary, makeshift place of assembly. It consisted essentially of poles to support a flimsy roof of brush which afforded some shelter from the blistering sun. Then there was built just to the south of us what came to be known as the \u201cTabernacle,\u201d and later as the \u201cOld Tabernacle.\u201d It was a structure with a gabled roof and walls that could provide a measure of comfort both winter and summer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/building-your-tabernacle.p18\" class=\"\">But these people, in this wilderness outpost, were driven by a tremendous vision. They believed without a doubt that they were building the Kingdom of God on earth. Their faith matched their vision. They determined to build a larger hall that would accommodate thousands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/building-your-tabernacle.p19\" class=\"\">The dimensions were established\u2014150 feet wide by 250 feet long. How could this be done in their circumstances? They had no steel with which to make girders. They had neither bolts nor nails nor screws in any significant quantity. That was 1864, and the railroad would not arrive in this territory until five years later.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/building-your-tabernacle.p20\" class=\"\">Bridges had been built in the East and here, using what was known as the Remington design. But to think of using this for a roof structure must have seemed preposterous to many. Nonetheless, the work went forward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/building-your-tabernacle.p21\" class=\"\">The location was determined\u2014immediately west of the temple then under construction. The design as it was worked out called for forty-four sandstone buttresses, or pillars. They were erected in an oval configuration. They were anchored on substantial footings. With the addition of doors and skirting, these buttresses became the walls of the building.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/building-your-tabernacle.p22\" class=\"\">Sandstone was brought from the mountains to the east, dressed and shaped to exact and rigid patterns. Limestone was likewise brought from the mountains and burned to be used for plaster and mortar. The great challenge was to create a roof resting on and sprung from these sandstone piers. Wooden scaffolding was erected. Great quantities of lumber were brought from the mountains and sawed into timbers. These were assembled in such a way as to form a great lattice work of triangles which would grow stronger under the stress of weight. Where the timbers crossed, holes were bored and wooden dowels inserted. The holes were tight, and as the dowels were driven in, a timber would split now and then. Strips of green rawhide were bound about the timber. The builders knew that when rawhide dries it shrinks and the split would be tightened. The timber bridgework occupies nine feet of space between the ceiling and the roof covering. I suppose no one had seen anything like this before. It made possible this great hall without interior pillars to support the roof.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/building-your-tabernacle.p23\" class=\"\">Skeptics\u2014of which there are always many\u2014said that when the interior scaffolding was taken down the roof would come with it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/building-your-tabernacle.p24\" class=\"\">But the scaffolding was removed and the roof remained intact. It has so remained now for 125 years. Engineers periodically check it. They marvel and find no deterioration or weakening.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/building-your-tabernacle.p25\" class=\"\">It was built in this remote area thirteen hundred miles from the frontier towns along the Mississippi and eight hundred miles from the settlements on the Pacific coast. To me it is a miracle building. I think of the skill of those who designed it and know that there must have been great inspiration behind that skill. I think of <span class=\"emphasis\">faith<\/span> as I reflect on the time and circumstance of its construction. It is truly a tabernacle, built in the wilderness from which the voice of the servants of the Lord should go forth to the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/building-your-tabernacle.p26\" class=\"\">It is <span class=\"emphasis\">the<\/span> Tabernacle.

His was an awesome undertaking\u2014to sail west across the unknown seas farther than any before him of his generation. He it was who, in spite of the terror of the unknown and the complaints and near mutiny of his crew, sailed on with frequent prayers to the Almighty for guidance. In his reports to the sovereigns of Spain, Columbus repeatedly asserted that his voyage was for the glory of God and the spread of the Christian faith.

He is the chief cornerstone of this great work. Of His divinity and reality I bear solemn witness. He is the Lamb without blemish who was offered for the sins of the world. Through His pain and because of His suffering I find reconciliation and eternal life. He is my Teacher, my Exemplar, my Friend, and my Savior whom I love and worship as the Redeemer of the world. In His holy name, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
