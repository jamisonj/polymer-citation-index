We have come a very long way in realizing the fulfillment of the vision set forth in the book of Revelation: \u201cAnd I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42143\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42143)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42143)\">Rev. 14:6<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p8\" class=\"\">What a tremendous occasion this is, my brothers and sisters.

It was a great and marvelous occasion, one to be long remembered. We not only dedicated a magnificent building, a house of the Lord, but we also dedicated a beautiful memorial to the Prophet Joseph Smith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p11\" class=\"\">In 1841, two years after he came to Nauvoo, he broke ground for a house of the Lord that should stand as a crowning jewel to the work of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p12\" class=\"\">It is difficult to believe that in those conditions and under those circumstances a structure of such magnificence was designed to stand on what was then the frontier of America.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p13\" class=\"\">I doubt, I seriously doubt, that there was another structure of such design and magnificence in all the state of Illinois.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p14\" class=\"\">It was to be dedicated to the work of the Almighty, to accomplish His eternal purposes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p15\" class=\"\">No effort was spared. No sacrifice was too great. Through the next five years men chiseled stone and laid footings and foundation, walls and ornamentation. Hundreds went to the north, there to live for a time to cut lumber, vast quantities of it, and then bind it together to form rafts which were floated down the river to Nauvoo. Beautiful moldings were cut from that lumber. Pennies were gathered to buy nails. Unimaginable sacrifice was made to procure glass. They were building a temple to God, and it had to be the very best of which they were capable.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p16\" class=\"\">In the midst of all of this activity, the Prophet and his brother Hyrum were killed in Carthage on the 27th of June 1844.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p17\" class=\"\">None of us living today can comprehend what a disastrous blow that was to the Saints. Their leader was gone\u2014he, the man of visions and revelations. He was not only their leader. He was their prophet. Great was their sorrow, terrible their distress.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p18\" class=\"\">But Brigham Young, President of the Quorum of the Twelve, picked up the reins. Joseph had placed his authority upon the shoulders of the Apostles. Brigham determined to finish the temple, and the work went on. By day and by night they pursued their objective, notwithstanding all of the threats hurled against them by lawless mobs. In 1845 they knew they could not stay in the city they had built from the swamplands of the river. They knew they must leave. It became a time of feverish activity: first, to complete the temple, and secondly, to build wagons and gather supplies to move into the wilderness of the West.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p19\" class=\"\">Ordinance work was begun before the temple was entirely completed. It went on feverishly until, in the cold of the winter of 1846, the people began to close the doors of their homes and wagons moved slowly down Parley Street to the water\u2019s edge, then across the river and up the banks on the Iowa side.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p20\" class=\"\">Movement continued. The river froze over, it was so bitter cold. But it made it possible for them to move on the ice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p21\" class=\"\">Back to the east they looked for the last time to the city of their dreams and the temple of their God. Then they looked to the west to a destiny they did not know.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p22\" class=\"\">The temple was subsequently dedicated, and those who dedicated it said \u201camen\u201d and moved on. The building was later burned by an arsonist who almost lost his life in the evil process. A tornado finally toppled most of what was left. The house of the Lord, the great objective of their labors, was gone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p23\" class=\"\">Nauvoo became almost a ghost city. It faded until it almost died. The site of the temple was plowed and planted. The years passed, and there slowly followed an awakening. Our people, descendants of those who once lived there, had stir within them the memories of their forebears, with a desire to honor those who had paid so terrible a price. Gradually the city came alive again, and there was a restoration of parts of Nauvoo.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p24\" class=\"\">Under the prompting of the Spirit, and motivated by the desires of my father, who had served as mission president in that area and who wished to rebuild the temple for the centennial of Nauvoo but was never able to do so, we announced in the April conference of 1999 that we would rebuild that historic edifice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p25\" class=\"\">Excitement filled the air. Men and women came forth with a desire to be helpful. Large contributions of money and skills were offered. Again, no expense was spared. We were to rebuild the house of the Lord as a memorial to the Prophet Joseph and as an offering to our God. On the recent 27th of June, in the afternoon at about the same time Joseph and Hyrum were shot in Carthage 158 years earlier, we held the dedication of the magnificent new structure. It is a place of great beauty. It stands on exactly the same site where the original temple stood. Its outside dimensions are those of the original. It is a fitting and appropriate memorial to the great Prophet of this dispensation, Joseph the Seer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p26\" class=\"\">How grateful I am, how profoundly grateful for what has happened. Today, facing west, on the high bluff overlooking the city of Nauvoo, thence across the Mississippi, and over the plains of Iowa, there stands Joseph\u2019s temple, a magnificent house of God. Here in the Salt Lake Valley, facing east to that beautiful temple in Nauvoo, stands Brigham\u2019s temple, the Salt Lake Temple. They look toward one another as bookends between which there are volumes that speak of the suffering, the sorrow, the sacrifice, even the deaths of thousands who made the long journey from the Mississippi River to the valley of the Great Salt Lake.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/o-that-i-were-an-angel-and-could-have-the-wish-of-mine-heart.p27\" class=\"\">Nauvoo became the 113th working temple. We have since dedicated another in The Hague, Netherlands, making 114 in all. These wonderful buildings of various sizes and architectural designs are now scattered through the nations of the earth.
