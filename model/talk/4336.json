When rubbed across the touchstone, the gold produced a streak or mark on its surface. The goldsmith matched this mark to a color on his chart of graded colors. The mark was redder as the amount of copper or alloy increased or yellower as the percentage of gold increased. This process showed quite accurately the purity of the gold.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-lords-touchstone.p4\" class=\"\">The touchstone method of testing the purity of gold was quick and was satisfactory for most practical purposes. But the goldsmith who still questioned the purity completed a more accurate test by using a process that involved fire.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-lords-touchstone.p5\" class=\"\">I suggest to you that the Lord has prepared a touchstone for you and me, an outward measurement of inward discipleship that marks our faithfulness and will survive the fires yet to come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-lords-touchstone.p6\" class=\"\">On one occasion while Jesus was teaching the people, a certain lawyer approached him and posed this question: \u201cMaster, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-lords-touchstone.p7\" class=\"\">Jesus, the master teacher, replied to the man, who obviously was well-versed in the law, with a counter-question, \u201cWhat is written in the law? how readest thou?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-lords-touchstone.p8\" class=\"\">The man replied with resolute summary the two great commandments: \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-lords-touchstone.p9\" class=\"\">With approval Christ responded, \u201cThis do, and thou shalt live\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32272\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32272)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32272)\">Luke 10:25\u201328<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/the-lords-touchstone.p10\" class=\"\">Eternal life, God\u2019s life, the life we are seeking, is rooted in two commandments.

Strengthening our faith by adding every good quality that adorns the children of the blessed Jesus, we can pray in the season of prayer; we can love our neighbor as ourselves, and be faithful in tribulation, knowing that the reward of such is greater in the kingdom of heaven.
