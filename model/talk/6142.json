We walked through countless fields in search of pheasants but only saw a few, and these we missed. Dad then said to me, \u2018Clark, let\u2019s unload our guns, and we\u2019ll place them in this ditch. Then we\u2019ll kneel down to pray.\u2019 I thought Dad would pray for more pheasants, but I was wrong. He explained to me that Elder Richard L. Evans was gravely ill and that at 12 noon on that particular Monday the members of the Quorum of the Twelve\u2014wherever they may be at the time\u2014were to kneel and, in a way, together unite in a fervent prayer of faith for Elder Evans.

We have an awesome responsibility to guide and inspire these young men on the priesthood trail, that no avalanche of sin or error will deter their progress or sweep them away from their eternal goals.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/today-determines-tomorrow.p13\" class=\"\">Bishops and bishops\u2019 counselors, will you undertake a study of the activity levels of each Aaronic Priesthood young man and outline your own plan to ensure the progress and activity of each one?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/today-determines-tomorrow.p14\" class=\"\">One newly called bishop, in his first meeting with his counselors, declared, \u201cThe Aaronic Priesthood is a prime responsibility of ours.\u201d To the second counselor, he directed, \u201cI ask you to be personally responsible to ensure that every deacon, at the appropriate age, be worthy and be ordained a teacher.\u201d To the other counselor, he said, \u201cWill you please do the same as pertains to the teachers, that they may, on schedule, be worthy and be ordained priests.\u201d Then the bishop continued: \u201cI will take the same responsibility for the priests to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and be ordained elders. Together, and with God\u2019s help, we can do it.\u201d And they did.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/today-determines-tomorrow.p15\" class=\"\">Our youth need less criticism and more models to follow.
