As I walked along the beach, I was enthralled by the magnificence of the large crashing waves breaking just outside the bay and the smaller waves rolling in closer to shore.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/blessed-and-happy-are-those-who-keep-the-commandments-of-god.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">As I continued my stroll, I encountered a group of American surfers. They were obviously upset about something, talking loudly and gesturing toward the sea. When I asked them what was wrong, they pointed to just outside the bay where the big waves were breaking.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/blessed-and-happy-are-those-who-keep-the-commandments-of-god.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">\u201cLook out there,\u201d one of them angrily told me. \u201cCan you see the barrier?\u201d Looking more closely now, I could indeed see a barrier stretching across the entire mouth of the bay, right where the large, enticing waves were breaking. The barrier appeared to be made of a heavy mesh and was supported by floats on top of the water. According to the surfers, it dropped all the way down to the ocean floor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/blessed-and-happy-are-those-who-keep-the-commandments-of-god.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">The American surfer continued, \u201cWe are here on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to surf these big waves. We can surf the smaller ones\u00a0breaking within the bay itself, but the barrier makes it impossible for us to surf the big ones. We have no idea why the barrier is there. All we know is that it has totally spoiled our trip.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/blessed-and-happy-are-those-who-keep-the-commandments-of-god.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">As the American surfers became more animated, my attention was drawn to another nearby surfer\u2014an older man and obviously a local. He seemed to be growing impatient as he listened to the ever-increasing complaints about the barrier.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/blessed-and-happy-are-those-who-keep-the-commandments-of-god.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">Finally he rose and walked over to the group. Without saying anything, he pulled a pair of binoculars from his backpack and handed them to one of the surfers, pointing out toward the barrier. Each of the surfers looked through the binoculars. When my turn came, with the help of magnification, I could see something that I had not been able to see before: dorsal fins\u2014large sharks feeding near the reef on the other side of the barrier.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/blessed-and-happy-are-those-who-keep-the-commandments-of-god.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">The group quickly became subdued. The old surfer retrieved his binoculars and turned to walk away. As he did, he said words I will never forget: \u201cDon\u2019t be too critical of the barrier,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s keeping you from being devoured.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/blessed-and-happy-are-those-who-keep-the-commandments-of-god.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">As we stood\u00a0on that beautiful beach, our perspective had suddenly changed. A barrier that had seemed rigid and restrictive\u2014that seemed to curtail the fun and excitement of riding the really big waves\u2014had become something very different. With our new understanding of the danger that lurked just below the surface, the barrier now offered protection, safety, and peace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/blessed-and-happy-are-those-who-keep-the-commandments-of-god.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">As you and I walk the paths of life and pursue our dreams, God\u2019s commands and standards\u2014like the barrier\u2014can sometimes be difficult to understand. They may appear rigid and unyielding, blocking a path that looks fun and exciting and that is being followed by so many others.

It is relatively easy to follow a course inside the barrier once we know there are sharp-toothed predators swarming just outside of it. It is more difficult to keep our course within the barrier when all we can see are thrilling and tantalizing waves on the other side.

It was a path that led through Gethsemane and Golgotha, where He endured unimaginable agony and suffering and where He was totally forsaken as His Father\u2019s Spirit withdrew.
