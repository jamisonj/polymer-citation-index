Hope is reborn and a\nvision of a new world is in the making. For the most destructive war of history is ended.\nCountless millions dream and hope again.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE PRICE OF PEACE\n<\/p><p>\nWhat is this for which they pray? The hope of humanity, peace.\n<\/p><p>\nPeace is obtainable, but what is the price of peace? Let the Lord himself answer:\n<\/p><p>\nIf ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; . . . I will give peace in\nthe land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid. . . . And I will walk among\nyou, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30882\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30882)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30882)\">Lev. 26:3-12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn a word, then, the foundation for peace is righteousness.\n<\/p><p>\nThe efforts of peace conferences, and the prayers of suffering humanity, may bring an\narmistice of uncertain length, but peace with totality and permanence can come only when\nmen repent and turn to the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat have we learned by this war? We have learned nothing if hatred, bigotry, and\nintolerance have not diminished; if covetousness, selfishness, and adultery are unabated; if\nparents are less dear and the Sabbath of the Lord less holy. In short, if righteousness has not\nincreased, then is our fighting vain, the sacrifices of our sons to no avail, and our tears\nwasted.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE HISTORY OF THE RISE AND FALL OF NATIONS\n<\/p><p>\nWe have come far in material progress in these centuries. But the sins of the ancients still\nafflict the hearts of men.\n<\/p><p>\nCan we not learn by the experiences of others? Must we also defile our bodies, corrupt our\nsouls, and reap destruction as have peoples and nations before us?\n<\/p><p>\nBoth sacred scripture and profane history give us the tragic stories of young nations rising in\npower, then in the luxurious and degenerate years of their glory being replaced by vigorous\npeoples yet unspoiled by the decay of self-indulgence, political intrigue, and immoral\nshamelessness.\n<\/p><p>\nLong centuries ago the Lord commanded the Prophet Jonah:\n<\/p><p>\nArise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up\nbefore me (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29999\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29999)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29999)\">Jonah 1:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat \"great city\" was the envy of the ancient world in its magnificence and power. Historians\ndescribe it as surrounded by walls one hundred feet high and broad enough that three chariots\ncould drive abreast. Fifteen hundred towers held watchmen to note the approach of enemies.\n<\/p><p>\nJonah arrived, and so powerfully preached repentance that the people reformed their lives, and\nthe promised destruction was averted. But Nineveh turned again to sin.\n<\/p><p>\nThrough the Prophet Nahum, the Lord calls them again to repentance. He indicts them for\ntheir debauchery and gives them an ultimatum: repentance or destruction, saying:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41061\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41061)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41061)\">Nahum 1:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41063\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41063)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41063)\">Nahum 2:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn fulfilment, the river overflowed, inundated the walls for miles, the gates were burned, the\nking and his concubines and his wealth were consumed with the palaces, and the\nunconquerable city, now made vulnerable by flood and fire, was taken by the invaders while\nits boasted defenders lay in drunken stupor and lolled in licentiousness. Today the canals of\nNineveh are gone, leaving the country a desolate waste. Sheep and cattle seek scanty pasture\namong the mounds of the once greatest city.\n<\/p><p>\nGod cannot be mocked! (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23221\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23221)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23221)\">Gal. 6:7<\/a><\/span>)\nHis laws are immutable. True repentance is rewarded by forgiveness\nbut sin brings the sting of death\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"133\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 133)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(133)\">1 Cor. 15:56<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNineveh is not the only instance. Historians are still puzzled regarding the annihilation of the\ninfamous cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Whatever happened to these peoples, this we know,\nthat swift destruction came to them. Perhaps the Japanese of Hiroshima were no more\ncompletely nor quickly destroyed. At least students agree that there was a devastating\nholocaust which enveloped the cities, leaving the monuments and the people in utter\ndesolation, never to be rediscovered nor rebuilt.\n<\/p><p>\nWhy were these ancient cities destroyed? The scriptures make it clear:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is\nvery grievous; I will go down now. . . . And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also\ndestroy the righteous with the wicked? Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city . . .\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the Lord said, if I find in Sodom fifty righteous, . . . then I will spare all the\nplace for their sakes (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23505\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23505)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23505)\">Gen. 18:20-26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Abraham continued to plead with the Lord for a few faithful whom he hoped to find in\nthe city. He asked if it could be spared for forty, then thirty, and twenty, and finally ten. But\nwhen ten righteous were not found, Lot and his daughters alone escaped\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23507\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23507)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23507)\">Gen. 18:27-33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire. . . . And he\noverthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which\ngrew upon the ground. . . .\n<\/p><p>\nAnd Abraham gat up early in the morning . . . and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, .\n. . and, beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23509\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23509)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23509)\">Gen. 19:24-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHistorians say the area has remained in \"deathlike solitude and unmitigated and supreme\ndesolation.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn the famed city of Babylon we find again unrestrained wickedness of a dissolute people. We\nhear the prophets calling to repentance, and in the end, dire threats. Again we see a people\ndisappear into oblivion as they fail to follow the commands of God.\n<\/p><p>\nBabylon the Great is fallen! Its temple of Bel and the royal palace were magnificent\nstructures, sumptuously adorned. Its hanging gardens were regarded anciently as one of the\nseven wonders of the world. The river Euphrates ran through the center of the city. The\ndefense walls rose to three hundred feet in height. The gates, a hundred in number, were of\nbrass.\n<\/p><p>\nBut King Nebuchadnezzar forgot the foundations for peace. His people sank in sensuous\nindulgence.\n<\/p><p>\nThe prophets pleaded for repentance. But why should Babylon worry? Was not Babylon the\nruler of nations? Was not Nebuchadnezzar king of kings?\n<\/p><p>\n. . . all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he\nslew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would\nhe put down (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10585\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10585)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10585)\">Dan. 5:19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWas not this city impregnable? Who could scale its walls? Who could crash its gates? But the\nmonster of sin came. Though impenetrable the walls, and numerous the armed defenders, yet\nall must fall and crumble as sin makes impotent, weak, and fat the people who become slaves\nto it.\n<\/p><p>\nSome years ago we visited Rome, the Eternal City, but what we saw was not the Rome which\nruled the world, but a nation long since relegated to an inferior place. We found its imposing\nmonuments in ruins, its extravagant arches obelisks, and gateways grim reminders of glorious\ndays. The Coliseum skeleton bore witness of beasts torn, human blood spilt, Christians\nmartyred in the arenas, while lecherous humans betrayed their sadistic depravity. Imperial\nRome adorned with masterpieces of art, and priceless treasures stolen from the courts of the\nconquered was now in ruins. The fountains of Rome, its theaters and sumptuous villas all\nbrought to our minds the magnificence of that Rome of world supremacy.\n<\/p><p>\nWe saw the picture of Roman profligacy in excavated Pompeii, the Mediterranean resort,\nwhere the idle rich of Rome reveled in riotous living. The eruption of Vesuvius buried the\ncity with its vomit of dust and stones and ashes.\n<\/p><p>\nWe walked the streets of Pompeii where chariots had worn tracks in the stone. We saw the\nhomes of the people, their bakeries, hospitals, and circuses. We saw their laundries,\ndrugstores, and baths; their liquor houses and brothels. The latter were padlocked, too\nrevolting to open to general public gaze, as the walls carried pictures in colors, still preserved,\ndepicting the depth of their degradation.\n<\/p><p>\nWill history repeat itself again? What of our world of today? Are we not forgetting in our\nown great America the high and lofty principles which can preserve the nation? It is\nrefreshing to note that our military men too sense the spiritual needs of the hour. The\nfollowing are the Words of General Douglas MacArthur on the occasion of the Japanese\nsurrender:\n<\/p><p>\nMilitary alliance, balances of power, League of Nations all in turn failed, . . . we have had\nour last chance. If we do not now devise some greater and more equitable system,\nArmageddon will be at our door. The problem basically is theological and involves . . .\nimprovement of human character. It must be of the spirit if we are to save the flesh. (Genesis\nDouglas MacArthur, \"Last Chance,\" under \"Religion,\" Sept 10, 1945. <i>Time<\/i>.)\n<\/p><p>\nCONDITIONS IN OUR OWN NATION\n<\/p><p>\nHow can we save the flesh when our nation is drinking one hundred sixty-five million gallons\nof liquor a year; when we spend seven billion dollars in a year for intoxicants, or more than\ntwice our education budget (<i>World Almanac<\/i>, New York <i>World Telegram; The Foundation Says<\/i>,\nDec. 1944, Jan. 1945); and when our films present drinking as the smart and proper\nthing for youth and adults? Are we not aping the fallen empires with the disintegration of\nhomes, desecration of marriage, making divorce too common? The unbelievable increase in\ndivorces of five hundred percent since the Civil War and the prediction that in twenty years,\nhalf of all marriages will be legally dissolved, certainly should arrest our attention. (<i>Life<\/i>\nMagazine, Sept. 3, 1945.) God will not tolerate an unvirtuous people. A current magazine\nindicates that ninety percent of all the mounting divorces are caused by the sin of adultery.\n<\/p><p>\nAre we not inviting eventual destruction as we desecrate all things holy and sacred, even to\nthe common and irreverent use in our daily talk of the names of Deity and making his holy\nday, the Sabbath, a day of work and of pleasure?\n<\/p><p>\nHow then can we hope for peace? The answer came thundering down from Mt. Sinai and\nremains the answer today:\n<\/p><p>\nThou shalt have no other gods before me.<br \/>\nThou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain . . . <br \/>\nRemember the sabbath day to keep it holy . . .<br \/>\nHonour thy father and thy mother . . .<br \/>\nThou shalt not kill.<br \/>\nThou shalt not commit adultery.<br \/>\nThou shalt not steal.<br \/>\nThou shalt not bear false witness.<br \/>\nThou shalt not covet (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22555\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22555)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22555)\">Ex. 20:3-18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe impregnable wall of wicked Nineveh was unconquerable till God reached the limit of his\nendurance and permitted the elements to undermine the wall and fire to consume the gates so\nthat swift destruction followed.\n<\/p><p>\nThe three-hundred-foot wall of drunken Babylon, impenetrable as it was by ladder or\nbattering ram, was violated when the dissolute inhabitants stupefied in sin, permitted the river\nto be diverted and the nation perished.\n<\/p><p>\nIsrael suffered captivity for its adultery, the loss of its treasures for its idolatry, and was\nscattered to the four winds for its corruption. God's laws cannot be broken with impunity!\n<\/p><p>\nProfligate and sensual Rome decayed and died as it ignored the foundations of peace and set\nat naught the principles of righteousness.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now in the year of our Lord 1945, there are among us those same vices which we have\nseen wreck empires, and we see them becoming flagrant in our own beloved nation.

Shall we permit the home to\ndeteriorate, and marriage to become a mockery? Shall we continue to curse God, hate our\nenemies and defile our bodies in adulterous practices? And when the patience of the Lord\nwith us is exhausted shall we stand trembling while destruction comes upon us? Or shall we\nwisely see the handwriting on the wall\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10584\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10584)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10584)\">Dan. 5:5<\/a><\/span>)\nand profit by the sad experience of the past and return\nunto the Lord and serve him?\n<\/p><p>\nTHE WORD OF THE LORD\n<\/p><p>\nTo our own land, the Americas, the land of Zion, the burial ground of decadent empires, there\nis a divine promise Would that all Americans knew of it! It was spoken by the Lord to the\nancient inhabitants of this country and brought forth by Joseph Smith, the prophet of the latter\ndays. This is the promise: Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it\nshall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if\nthey will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22166\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22166)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22166)\">Ether 2:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI testify that he is the God of this land and I know that we can achieve our destiny and build\nenduring peace only upon the foundation of his righteousness.\n<\/p><p>\nWe call upon the nations and our fellow men everywhere to repent, to cleanse their lives, and\nto place themselves in harmony with the Lord our God.\n<\/p><p>\nMay our hearts go out in praise and thanksgiving that the earth which did tremble is now still.\nMay the precious blood of our young sons, their agonies and sacrifices and the deep sorrow of\nall of us commend us to the Father and may he help us as we strive to live his laws and to\nachieve a permanent peace on earth, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
