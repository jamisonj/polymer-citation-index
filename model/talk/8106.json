One common factor that I have often found in these faithful members is the perspective that they have of eternity. The eternal perspective of the gospel leads us to understand the place that we occupy in God\u2019s plan, to accept difficulties and progress through them, to make decisions, and to center our lives on our divine potential.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-eternal-perspective-of-the-gospel.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">Perspective is the way we see things when we look at them from a certain distance, and it allows us to appreciate their true value.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-eternal-perspective-of-the-gospel.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">It is like being in a forest and having a tree in front of us. Unless we step back a little, we will not be able to appreciate what a forest really is. I once visited the Amazon jungle in Leticia, Colombia, near the borders of Brazil and Peru. I was not able to appreciate its magnitude until I flew over it and gained perspective.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-eternal-perspective-of-the-gospel.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">When our children were little, they used to watch a children\u2019s television channel that featured a program called <span class=\"emphasis\">What Do You See?<\/span> The screen would zoom in very closely on something, and the children had to guess what it was as the image gradually widened. Once the entire object was visible, you could easily tell that it was a cat, a plant, a piece of fruit, and so on.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-eternal-perspective-of-the-gospel.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">I remember that on one occasion they were watching that program and it showed something very close up that looked very ugly to them, even repulsive; but as the image widened, they realized that it was a very appetizing pizza. Then they said to me, \u201cDaddy, buy us one just like that!\u201d After they understood what it was, something that at first had looked unpleasant to them ended up being something very attractive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-eternal-perspective-of-the-gospel.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">Let me share another experience. In our home our children liked to do jigsaw puzzles. We have probably all had the opportunity to do a puzzle. Some are made up of many small pieces. I remember that one of our children (I won\u2019t give his name in order to protect his identity) used to focus on the individual pieces, and when one did not fit in the place where he thought it should, he would become angry and assume it was no good and want to throw it away. He finally learned to do the puzzle when he understood that each small piece had its place in the final picture, even when he did not know where it fit at a given moment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-eternal-perspective-of-the-gospel.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">This is one way of contemplating the Lord\u2019s plan. We do not have to concern ourselves with each of its parts separately but rather to try to bring the entire picture into focus, keeping in mind what the final result will be. The Lord knows where each piece belongs so that it fits into the plan. All the commandments are of eternal importance in the context of the great plan of happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-eternal-perspective-of-the-gospel.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">It is extremely important that we do not make decisions of eternal value from the perspective of mortality.

They had all suffered much difficulty and numerous afflictions; however, their attitudes toward them were very different. Nephi said, \u201cAnd so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without murmurings.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-12455_000_044\">4<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130851\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130851)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130851)\">1\u00a0Nephi 17:2<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-afternoon-session\/the-eternal-perspective-of-the-gospel.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">Laman and Lemuel, on the other hand, complained bitterly. \u201cAnd thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did murmur against their father.
