John gave it to his wife, Rhoda Young, who then passed it on to her brothers, Phineas Young and Brigham Young. I remember that John was the marshal in Nauvoo, and I rejoice in the heritage of faithful Latter-day Saints down through the years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/05\/youth-of-the-noble-birthright.p6\" class=\"\">I am grateful to my father and my mother, who, before passing on, wrote in their last will and testament not what you would expect\u2014of material things, for they had few\u2014rather, they left with us in their last will and testament a statement of their testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ, their most precious possession.

Mothers, stand firm; and fathers, have courage to be strong. Leaders, support those great parents.
