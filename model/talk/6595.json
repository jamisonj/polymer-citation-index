Suddenly, without warning, devastating destruction left death in its wake and snuffed out the lives of enormous numbers of men, women, and children. Evaporated were well-laid plans for pleasant futures. Substituted, therefore, were tears of sorrow and cries of pain from wounded souls.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/now-is-the-time.p12\" class=\"\">Countless are the reports we have heard during the past three and a half weeks of those who were touched in some way\u2014either directly or indirectly\u2014by the events of that day. I should like to share with you the comments of a Church member, Rebecca Sindar, who was on a flight from Salt Lake City to Dallas on the morning of Tuesday, September 11. The flight was interrupted, as were all flights in the air at the time of the tragedies, and the plane grounded in Amarillo, Texas. Sister Sindar reports: \u201cWe all left the plane and found televisions in the airport, where we crowded around to see the broadcast of what had happened. People were lined up to call loved ones to assure them we were safely on the ground. I shall always remember the 12 or so missionaries who were on their way to the mission field on our flight. They made phone calls, and then we saw them huddled in a circle in a corner of the airport, kneeling in prayer together. How I wish I could have captured that moment to share with the mothers and fathers of those sweet young men as they saw the need for prayer right away.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/now-is-the-time.p13\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, death eventually comes to all mankind.

Some time ago I read a tender story written by Louise Dickinson Rich which vividly illustrates this truth. She wrote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/now-is-the-time.p43\" class=\"\">\u201cMy grandmother had an enemy named Mrs. Wilcox. Grandma and Mrs. Wilcox moved, as brides, into next-door houses on the main street of the tiny town in which they were to live out their lives. I don\u2019t know what started the war between them\u2014and I don\u2019t think that by the time I came along, over thirty years later, they themselves remembered what started it. This was no polite sparring match; this was total war. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/now-is-the-time.p44\" class=\"\">\u201cNothing in town escaped repercussion. The 300-year-old church, which had lived through the Revolution, the Civil War, and the Spanish-American War, almost went down when Grandma and Mrs. Wilcox fought the Battle of the Ladies\u2019 Aid. Grandma won that engagement, but it was a hollow victory. Mrs. Wilcox, since she couldn\u2019t be president, resigned in a huff. What\u2019s the fun of running a thing if you can\u2019t force your enemy to eat crow? Mrs. Wilcox won the Battle of the Public Library by getting her niece, Gertrude, appointed librarian instead of Aunt Phyllis. The day Gertrude took over was the day Grandma stopped reading library books. They became \u2018filthy germy things\u2019 overnight. The Battle of the High School was a draw. The principal got a better job and left before Mrs. Wilcox succeeded in having him ousted or Grandma in having him given life tenure of office.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/now-is-the-time.p45\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen as children we visited my grandmother, part of the fun was making faces at Mrs. Wilcox\u2019s grandchildren. One banner day we put a snake into the Wilcox rain barrel. My grandmother made token protests, but we sensed tacit sympathy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/now-is-the-time.p46\" class=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t think for a minute that this was a one-sided campaign. Mrs. Wilcox had grandchildren, too. Grandma didn\u2019t get off scot free. Never a windy washday went by that the clothesline didn\u2019t mysteriously break, with the clothes falling in the dirt.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/now-is-the-time.p47\" class=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know how Grandma could have borne her troubles so long if it hadn\u2019t been for the household page of her daily Boston newspaper. This household page was a wonderful institution. Besides the usual cooking hints and cleaning advice, it had a department composed of letters from readers to each other. The idea was that if you had a problem\u2014or even only some steam to blow off\u2014you wrote a letter to the paper, signing some fancy name like Arbutus. That was Grandma\u2019s pen name. Then some of the other ladies who had the same problem wrote back and told you what they had done about it, signing themselves One Who Knows or Xanthippe or whatever. Very often, the problem disposed of, you kept on for years writing to each other through the column of the paper, telling each other about your children and your canning and your new dining-room suite. That\u2019s what happened to Grandma. She and a woman called Sea Gull corresponded for a quarter of a century. Sea Gull was Grandma\u2019s true friend.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/now-is-the-time.p48\" class=\"\">\u201cWhen I was about sixteen, Mrs. Wilcox died. In a small town, no matter how much you have hated your next-door neighbor, it is only common decency to run over and see what practical service you can do the bereaved. Grandma, neat in a percale apron to show that she meant what she said about being put to work, crossed the lawn to the Wilcox house, where the Wilcox daughters set her to cleaning the already-immaculate front parlor for the funeral. And there on the parlor table in the place of honor was a huge scrapbook; and in the scrapbook, pasted neatly in parallel columns were Grandma\u2019s letters to Sea Gull over the years and Sea Gull\u2019s letters to her. Though neither woman had known it, Grandma\u2019s worst enemy had been her [very] best friend. That was the only time I remember seeing my grandmother cry. I didn\u2019t know then exactly what she was crying about, but I do now. She was crying for all the wasted years which could never be salvaged.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/now-is-the-time.p49\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, may we resolve from this day forward to fill our hearts with love.
