We have been called to use divine power to serve the children of our Heavenly Father. How well we meet that obligation will have eternal consequences for those we are called to serve and for us and for generations yet unborn.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p6\" class=\"\">I hold in sacred memory two priesthood bearers who had qualified for the Spirit of God to go with them on the errand to which the Lord called them. They had found the restored gospel themselves in America. They were the Lord\u2019s servants who first spoke of that gospel to two of my European ancestors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p7\" class=\"\">One of those ancestors was a young girl living on a small farm in Switzerland. Another was a young man, an orphan and an immigrant to the United States from Germany, living in St. Louis, Missouri.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p8\" class=\"\">Both of them heard a priesthood holder testify of the restored gospel\u2014for the girl by the fireplace of her little home in Switzerland, and for the boy it was sitting in the balcony of a rented hall in America. Both of them knew by the Spirit that the message those elders brought to them was true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p9\" class=\"\">The boy and the girl chose to be baptized. The two of them met for the first time on the dusty trail years later, walking hundreds of miles to the mountains of western America. They talked as they walked. What they talked about was the miraculous blessing that in all the world, the servants of God had found them and even more miraculous, that they knew their message was true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p10\" class=\"\">They fell in love and were married. And because of a testimony of the Spirit, which began as they heard the words of priesthood holders under the influence of the Holy Ghost, they were sealed for eternity by priesthood power. I am among the tens of thousands of descendants of that boy and that girl who bless the names of two priesthood holders who brought the ministrations of the Spirit of God with them as they climbed the hill in Switzerland and rose to speak in that meeting in St. Louis.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p11\" class=\"\">That happy story and millions more like it are repeated across the world and will be over generations. For some it will be the story of a young home teacher who said words that sparked a desire in your grandfather to come back to the Church. For some it will be the words of comfort and blessing from a patriarch that sustained your mother when tragedy nearly overwhelmed her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p12\" class=\"\">There will be a common theme in all those stories. It will be the power of the priesthood in a holder whose power to serve was magnified by the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p13\" class=\"\">And so my message for us tonight is this: let us do whatever is required to qualify for the Holy Ghost as our companion, and then let us go forward fearlessly so that we will be given the powers to do whatever the Lord calls us to do. That growth in power to serve may come slowly, it may come in small steps that are difficult for you to see, but it will come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p14\" class=\"\">Tonight I will make a few suggestions for the qualification of receiving the Holy Ghost as a companion in your priesthood service. Then I will give a few examples of priesthood service in which you can expect to see your powers to serve strengthened by the influence of the Spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p15\" class=\"\">Now, we all know that confirmation into the Church gave us the gift of the Holy Ghost. But the companionship of the Holy Ghost, the manifestations of it in our life and service, requires us to put our lives in order to qualify.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p16\" class=\"\">We cultivate spiritual gifts by keeping the commandments and trying to live a blameless life. That requires faith in Jesus Christ to repent and be cleansed through His Atonement. So as priesthood holders we should never miss an opportunity to participate with all our hearts in the promise offered in every sacrament meeting for members of the restored Church to \u201ctake upon them the name of [God\u2019s] Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-09211_000_025\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120830\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120830)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120830)\">Doctrine and Covenants 20:77<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p17\" class=\"\">Just as we must be cleansed of sin to have the Spirit with us, we must be humble enough before God to recognize our need for it. The disciples of the resurrected Savior demonstrated that humility, as recorded in the Book of Mormon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p18\" class=\"\">The Savior was preparing them for their ministry. They knelt on the ground to pray. Here is the account: \u201cAnd they did pray for that which they most desired; and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-09211_000_025\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120831\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120831)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120831)\">3\u00a0Nephi 19:9<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> They were baptized as you have been.

And then the Savior prayed for a spiritual blessing for those they were serving. The Lord pled with His Father: \u201cI pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all them that shall believe in their words.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-09211_000_025\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120832\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120832)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120832)\">3\u00a0Nephi 19:21<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p20\" class=\"\">As the humble servants of the Savior, we should pray for the manifestations of the Holy Ghost to come to us in our service and to those we serve. Humble prayer to our Heavenly Father, in deep faith in Jesus Christ, is essential to qualify us for the companionship of the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p21\" class=\"\">Our humility and our faith that invite spiritual gifts are increased by our reading, studying, and pondering the scriptures. We have all heard those words. Yet we may read a few lines or pages of scripture every day and hope that will be enough.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p22\" class=\"\">But reading, studying, and pondering are not the same. We read words and we may get ideas. We study and we may discover patterns and connections in scripture. But when we ponder, we invite revelation by the Spirit. Pondering, to me, is the thinking and the praying I do after reading and studying in the scriptures carefully.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p23\" class=\"\">For me, President Joseph\u00a0F. Smith set an example of how pondering can invite light from God. It is recorded in the 138th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. He had been reading and studying many scriptures, trying to understand how the effects of the Savior\u2019s Atonement would reach those who had died never having heard His message. Here is his account of how revelation came: \u201cAs I pondered over these things which are written, the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw the hosts of the dead, both small and great.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-09211_000_025\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120833\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120833)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120833)\">Doctrine and Covenants 138:11<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p24\" class=\"\">Repentance, prayer, and pondering over the scriptures are essential parts of our qualifying for the gifts of the Spirit in our priesthood service. Further magnification of our power to serve will come as we respond with faith to go forward in our callings with the Holy Ghost to help us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p25\" class=\"\">President Thomas\u00a0S.

It means to build it up in dignity\u00a0\u2026\u00a0, to enlarge and strengthen it to let the light of heaven shine through it to the view of other men. And how does one magnify a calling?

The Lord included the youngest and the least experienced of the Aaronic Priesthood holders in that call to serve.

The 13-year-old president is not likely to use the words \u201cwarn, exhort, and teach,\u201d but that is what the Lord expects of the deacon assigned to go to the rescue.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p31\" class=\"\">To the deacon who receives the call to go to his quorum member, I will make three promises. First, as you pray for help, the Spirit will calm your fears. Second, you will be surprised that you know what to say when you get to his home and during the walk with him back to the church. What you say may seem jumbled to you. But you will feel that words were given to you at the moment you needed them. And third, you will feel the approval of the Lord, who called you through your president, whatever the outcome.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p32\" class=\"\">I cannot promise what success will come since every person is free to choose how he or she responds to a servant of God. But the deacon you speak to for the Lord will remember you came to him. I know of one boy, now a man still far away from Church activity, whom a deacon was sent to find, and he told his grandfather of that visit 20 years earlier. And it seemed to have no effect, and yet he even named the deacon who came. The grandfather asked me to find and thank the deacon who was called to invite, to exhort, and to teach. It had been only one day in the life of a boy, but a grandfather and the Lord remember the words the boy was inspired to speak and the boy\u2019s name.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p33\" class=\"\">I urge all of us, young and old, who are called to speak in a meeting in the name of the Lord to dismiss our feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy. We don\u2019t have to use soaring language or convey deep insights. Simple words of testimony will do. The Spirit will give you the words for you to speak and will carry them down into the hearts of humble people who look for truth from God. If we keep trying to speak for the Lord, we will be surprised someday to learn that we have warned, exhorted, taught, and invited with the help of the Spirit to bless lives, with power far beyond our own.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p34\" class=\"\">In addition to the call to teach, all of us will be sent by the Lord to succor those in need. That is another priesthood service in which we will feel the influence of the Spirit increase our power to serve. You will find yourself more able to recognize pain and worry in the faces of people. Names or the faces of people in your quorum will come into your mind with the impression that they are in need.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p35\" class=\"\">Bishops have that feeling come to them during the night and each time they sit on the stand looking at the members of their ward or thinking of those who are not there. It can happen to them when they find themselves near a hospital or a care center. More than once I have heard the words when I walked in the door of a hospital: \u201cI knew you would come.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/serve-with-the-spirit.p36\" class=\"\">We need not worry about knowing the right thing to say or do when we get there.

I heard a commotion among the nurses in the hallway. Suddenly, President Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball walked into the room and sat in a chair on the opposite side of the bed from me.
