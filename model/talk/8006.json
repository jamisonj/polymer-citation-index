I owe much of my happiness in life to a man I never met in mortal life. He was an orphan who became one of my great-grandparents. He left me a priceless heritage of hope. Let me tell you some of the part he played in creating that inheritance for me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p10\" class=\"\">His name was Heinrich Eyring. He was born into great wealth. His father, Edward, had a large estate in Coburg, in what is now Germany. His mother was Viscountess Charlotte Von Blomberg. Her father was the keeper of the lands of the king of Prussia.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p11\" class=\"\">Heinrich was Charlotte and Edward\u2019s first son. Charlotte died at the age of 31, after the birth of her third child. Edward died soon thereafter, having lost all his property and wealth in a failed investment. He was only 40 years of age. He left three orphaned children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p12\" class=\"\">Heinrich, my great-grandfather, had lost both of his parents and a great worldly inheritance. He was penniless. He recorded in his history that he felt his best hope lay in going to America. Although he had neither family nor friends there, he had a feeling of hope about going to America. He first went to New York City. Later he moved to St. Louis, Missouri.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p13\" class=\"\">In St. Louis one of his co-workers was a Latter-day Saint. From him he obtained a copy of a pamphlet written by Elder Parley\u00a0P. Pratt. He read it and then studied every word he could obtain about the Latter-day Saints. He prayed to know if there really were angels that appeared to men, whether there was a living prophet, and whether he had found a true and revealed religion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p14\" class=\"\">After two months of careful study and prayer, Heinrich had a dream in which he was told he was to be baptized. A man whose name and priesthood I hold in sacred memory, Elder William Brown, was to perform the ordinance. Heinrich was baptized in a pool of rainwater on March\u00a011, 1855, at 7:30 in the morning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p15\" class=\"\">I believe that Heinrich Eyring knew then that what I am teaching you today is true. He knew that the happiness of eternal life comes through family bonds which continue forever. Even when he had so recently found the Lord\u2019s plan of happiness, he knew that his hope for eternal joy depended on the free choices of others to follow his example. His hope of eternal happiness depended on people not yet born.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p16\" class=\"\">As a part of our family\u2019s inheritance of hope, he left a history to his descendants.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p17\" class=\"\">In that history I can feel his love for those of us who would follow him. In his words I feel his hope that his descendants might choose to follow him on the path back to our heavenly home. He knew it would not be one great choice to make to do so but many small choices. I quote from his history:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cFrom the time I first heard Elder Andrus speak\u00a0\u2026 I have always attended the meeting of the Latter day Saints and the instances are very rare indeed, when I [have] failed to go to meeting, it being at the same time my duty to do so.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cI name this in my history that my children may imitate my example and never neglect this \u2026 important duty [to assemble] with the Saints.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-10905_000_17eyring\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See Henry Eyring reminiscences, 1896, typescript, Church History Library, 16\u201321.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p20\" class=\"\">Heinrich knew that in sacrament meetings we could renew our promise to always remember the Savior and have His Spirit to be with us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p21\" class=\"\">It was that Spirit that sustained him on the mission to which he was called only a few months after accepting the baptismal covenant. He left as his heritage his example of staying faithful to his mission for six years in what was then called the Indian Territories. To receive his release from his mission, he walked from Oklahoma to Salt Lake City, a distance of approximately 1,100 miles (1,770 km).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p22\" class=\"\">Soon thereafter he was called by the prophet of God to move to southern Utah. From there he answered another call to serve a mission in his native Germany. He then accepted the invitation of an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ to help build up the Latter-day Saint colonies in northern Mexico. From there he was called to Mexico City as a full-time missionary again. He honored those calls. He lies buried in a small cemetery in Colonia Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua, Mexico.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p23\" class=\"\">I recite these facts not to claim greatness for him or for what he did or for his descendants.

He accepted them because he had faith that the priesthood keys in the Lord\u2019s Church had been restored with the power to seal families forever, if only they had sufficient faith to keep their covenants.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p25\" class=\"\">Like Heinrich Eyring, my ancestor, you may be the first in your family to lead the way to eternal life along the path of sacred covenants made and kept with diligence and faith. Each covenant brings with it duties and promises. For all of us, as they were for Heinrich, those duties are sometimes simple but are often difficult. But remember, the duties must sometimes be difficult because their purpose is to move us along the path to live forever with Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, in families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p26\" class=\"\">You remember the words from the book of Abraham:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-10905_000_17eyring\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129456\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129456)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129456)\">Abraham 3:24\u201326<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p30\" class=\"\">Keeping our second estate depends on our making covenants with God and faithfully performing the duties they require of us.

However, our loving Heavenly Father gave us the gift of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, as our Savior. That great gift and blessing of the Atonement of Jesus Christ brings a universal inheritance: the promise of the Resurrection and the possibility of eternal life to all who are born.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p32\" class=\"\">The greatest of all the blessings of God, eternal life, will come to us only as we make covenants offered in the true Church of Jesus Christ by His authorized servants. Because of the Fall, we all need the cleansing effects of baptism and the laying on of hands to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. These ordinances must be performed by those who possess the proper priesthood authority. Then, with the help of the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost, we can keep all the covenants we make with God, especially those offered in His temples. Only in that way, and with that help, can anyone claim his or her rightful inheritance as a child of God in a family forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p33\" class=\"\">To some listening to me, that may seem a nearly hopeless dream.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p34\" class=\"\">You have seen faithful parents sorrow over children who have rejected or who have chosen to break their covenants with God.

Alma the Younger saw his son Corianton turn from gross sin to faithful service. The Book of Mormon also records the miracle of the Lamanites putting aside traditions of hating righteousness to covenanting to die to maintain peace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p36\" class=\"\">An angel was sent to the young Alma and the sons of Mosiah. The angel came because of the faith and prayers of their fathers and of God\u2019s people. From those examples of the power of the Atonement working in human hearts, you can receive courage and comfort.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p37\" class=\"\">The Lord has given us all the source of hope as we struggle to help those we love accept their eternal inheritance. He has made promises to us as we keep trying to gather people to Him, even when they resist His invitation to do so. Their resistance saddens Him, but He does not quit, nor should we. He sets the perfect example for us with His persistent love: \u201cAnd again, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, who have fallen; yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, ye that dwell at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen; yea, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would not.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-10905_000_17eyring\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129457\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129457)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129457)\">3\u00a0Nephi 10:5<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p38\" class=\"\">We can depend on that unfailing desire of the Savior to bring all of Heavenly Father\u2019s spirit children back to their home with Him. Every faithful parent, grandparent, and great-grandparent shares in that desire. Heavenly Father and the Savior are our perfect examples of what we can and must do. They never force righteousness because righteousness must be chosen. They make righteousness discernible to us, and They let us see that its fruits are delicious.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p39\" class=\"\">Every person born into the world receives the Light of Christ, which helps us see and feel what is right and what is wrong. God has sent mortal servants who can, by the Holy Ghost, help us recognize what He would have us do and what He forbids. God makes it attractive to choose the right by letting us feel the effects of our choices. If we choose the right, we will find happiness\u2014in time. If we choose evil, there comes sorrow and regret\u2014in time. Those effects are sure. Yet they are often delayed for a purpose. If the blessings were immediate, choosing the right would not build faith. And since sorrow is also sometimes greatly delayed, it takes faith to feel the need to seek forgiveness for sin early rather than after we feel its sorrowful and painful effects.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p40\" class=\"\">Father Lehi sorrowed over the choices made by some of his sons and their families. He was a great and good man\u2014a prophet of God. He often testified of our Savior, Jesus Christ, to them. He was an example of obedience and service when the Lord called him to leave all his worldly possessions to spare his family from destruction. At the very end of his life, he was still testifying to his children. Like the Savior\u2014and despite his power to discern their hearts and to see the future both sad and wonderful\u2014Lehi kept his arms outstretched to draw his family toward salvation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p41\" class=\"\">Today millions of the descendants of Father Lehi are justifying his hope for them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p42\" class=\"\">What can you and I do to draw from Lehi\u2019s example?
