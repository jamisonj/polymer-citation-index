I think it is impossible to know unless you\ngo through it yourself.\n<\/p><p>\nI am most grateful, however, for this tremendous honor that has been bestowed upon me, for\nthe privilege I have of working with these brethren and with you, in the service of the Lord. I\nfeel very humble in this calling I feel entirely inadequate and unqualified. I think that I feel\nsomewhat as Newel K. Whitney did when he was asked by the Prophet Joseph Smith to be\nthe bishop of Kirtland, for he said that he felt that he was not capable, he was unqualified and\njust could not do it. After the Prophet had told him that the Lord had called him and that it\nwas by revelation that this was made known, he still didn't feel that he was able and could\nact. Then the Prophet said, \"Go and ask Father for yourself.\" He went and knelt in humble\nsupplication, and he heard a voice from heaven which said, \"Thy strength is in me.\" He\naccepted and went about his work, and I understand was a bishop of the Church for some 18\nyears. (<i>LDS Biographical Encyclopedia<\/i>, Vol. 1, p. 224.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"He that doeth works of righteousness\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI know that only by virtue of the strength I can receive from the Lord can I be made a\nqualified and capable servant of the Lord in the fulfillment of this responsibility.\n<\/p><p>\nI am so grateful for the heritage that I have, for the teachings of a good mother and capable\nfather who taught me in my youth to love the Lord. I am grateful for the experiences that I\nhave had of living away from Zion&mdash;Utah Zion&mdash;in the far-flung corners of this country and\nin many areas of the country. There are many such circumstances as mine all over the world\nand especially in the United States. I see, as I have made visits to your stakes, that almost\nwithout exception a devoted family has been instrumental in the growth of the Church in that\nparticular area, as family members have seen fit to serve the Lord, to devote themselves to the\nwork, and to build the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are grateful for any part that we may have had in building the Church in the areas where\nwe have lived, and in so doing we have built our testimonies and have felt strong in the\nthings that we have done. I take strength and consolation in the teachings that the Lord gave\nto the Prophet Joseph Smith wherein he said, \"Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye\nare laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is\ngreat\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14805\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14805)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14805)\">D&amp;C 64:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOne of my favorite scriptures and one from which I receive a great deal of consolation is\nfound in the 59th section of the Doctrine and Covenants: \". . . he who doeth the works of\nrighteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world\nto come\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14799\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14799)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14799)\">D&amp;C 59:23<\/a><\/span>). I can think of no greater reward than to have peace in this world, the\nvindication of the Father, feeling that the things you are doing are acceptable unto the Lord\nand that you are serving him to such an extent that you have peace in your life. And, of\ncourse, all that any of us are working for is eternal life in the world to come.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear you my testimony that this is his work and that if we will keep the commandments of\nthe Lord and serve him well, we shall have peace in our souls, we shall have that vindication\nof the Father, the peace that we are searching for and we shall certainly have eternal life,\nwhich is our ultimate goal. I pray for this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
