I love her very much.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/faith-and-good-works.p6\" class=\"\">Children can provide wonderful and often humorous insights into life. We have in our family identical ten-year-old twin sons. In some circumstances they are practically impossible to tell apart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/faith-and-good-works.p7\" class=\"\">Recently we moved and found ourselves in new surroundings. Several days later I was talking to Aaron, one of the twins, and inquired about the big bump he had on his forehead. He described it this way. \u201cWell, Dad, Lincoln [who is his older brother] was chasing me down the hall. I ran around the corner, and I saw my twin brother, Adam. Now, I knew I could outrun Adam, so I just kept running.\u201d It turns out he ran into a full-length mirror!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/faith-and-good-works.p8\" class=\"\">Life provides for each of us a full-length, wide-screen panorama of opportunities to run into ourselves.

A stake president and I took the opportunity to visit a young woman in her home near Atlanta, Georgia. She was twenty-nine years old; her husband had been killed in a car accident; she was living in a modest apartment with her two young children. I suppose we expected to find her upset and discouraged at having received a \u201cbump\u201d not of her own making. On the contrary, she was cheerful; she was calm; she was very gracious. She thanked us for coming and then said, as nearly as I can recall: \u201cBrethren, I want you to know I believe in the plan of redemption. I am grateful to my Savior for the promise of a glorious resurrection with my husband. I am grateful for His redeeming sacrifice.\u201d Then, putting her arms around her two children, she said, \u201cOur faith in Jesus Christ will see us through.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/faith-and-good-works.p12\" class=\"\">We came expecting to comfort and strengthen, and we left humbled, buoyed, and blessed by her wonderful expression of faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/faith-and-good-works.p13\" class=\"\">Indeed we walk by faith\u2014faith in the plan of redemption, faith in the role of Jesus Christ as Savior and Redeemer, faith that as the Son of God, he has the power to save, to forgive, to lift us up. Because of our faith, we repent, we keep his commandments, we seek his restored Church and authorized priesthood. We listen to and follow the words of his prophets and Apostles spoken from this and other pulpits.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/faith-and-good-works.p14\" class=\"\">When we exercise our faith in him, then Christ will help us overcome our weaknesses and the resulting \u201cbumps and bruises.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/faith-and-good-works.p15\" class=\"\">To illustrate the second great stabilizing force, I would relate another experience. Some years ago, I was serving as a young bishop. We were holding a ward social around a swimming pool near the apartment where most of the ward members lived. I was introduced to a new member of the ward\u2014a young woman in her twenties by the name of Carol. Carol had been afflicted with cerebral palsy since infancy. She walked with great difficulty; her hands were crippled. Her kind and dear face was also affected, as was her speech. But as I would come to understand, to know Carol was to love her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/faith-and-good-works.p16\" class=\"\">I had only to wait a few minutes to begin learning the great lesson she would teach. While we were talking, we watched a tall, handsome, dark-haired, very athletic young man dive off the diving board and seem to injure himself slightly. He got out of the pool, holding his neck, and went and sat under a tree. I watched as Carol struggled to prepare a plate of food and with great difficulty delivered it to him\u2014a guileless act of service, of \u201cgood works.\u201d Carol\u2019s good works became a legend. She cared for the sick; she took food to the hungry; she drove people places (an experience that delivered you pale and shaken, but always in one piece); she comforted; she lifted; she blessed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/faith-and-good-works.p17\" class=\"\">I walked with her one day on the sidewalk that passed through the apartment complex where she lived. From the windows, from the balconies, from the porches came cries of \u201cHi, Carol!\u201d \u201cHow are you doing, Carol?\u201d \u201cCome up and see us, Carol.\u201d And occasionally someone would say, \u201cOh, hi, Bishop.\u201d It was clear that Carol was loved and greatly accepted through her wonderful good works.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/faith-and-good-works.p18\" class=\"\">My most vivid recollection of Carol occurred in the spring of that year. The ward had agreed to participate in the stake five-kilometer fun run\u2014an oxymoronic term, to be sure. Carol wanted to be with the rest of the ward members, but we didn\u2019t see how it would be possible. For her, just walking was a great difficulty. Nevertheless, she was determined. She struggled and trained each day to increase her endurance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/faith-and-good-works.p19\" class=\"\">The race finished in the stadium. Two or three hundred of us were in the stands by the finish line, drinking juice and catching our breath. And then we remembered Carol\u2014she was left somewhere back on the course. As we ran out the entrance to the stadium, she came into view, struggling to breathe, barely able to walk, but determined to finish. As she started around the track toward the finish line, a wonderful thing happened. Suddenly the track was lined on both sides with hundreds of cheering friends. Others were running alongside to support and hold her up. Carol \u201cof great good works\u201d had finished the race.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/faith-and-good-works.p20\" class=\"\">One day each of us will cross the finish line. Will it likewise be to the cheers and encouragement of those we have loved and served? Hopefully it will be to the approbation of our Savior, who because of our faith and our good works, will say, \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37479\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37479)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37479)\">Matt. 25:21<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/faith-and-good-works.p21\" class=\"\">I add my witness to the many that have been borne from this pulpit.
