Were a king to extend his\n  dominion over the habitable earth, and send forth his laws which were the most perfect kind, and\n  command his subjects one and all to yield obedience to the same, and add as a reward to those who\n  obeyed them, that at a certain period they should be called to attend the marriage of his son,<span class=\"footRef\">1<\/span> who\n  in due time was to receive the kingdom, and they should be made equal with him<span class=\"footRef\">2<\/span> in the same; and\n  fix as a penalty for disobedience that every individual guilty of it should be cast out at the marriage\n  feast, and have no part nor portion with his government, what rational mind could for a moment\n  accuse the king with injustice for punishing such rebellious subjects?
