We have received light and truth and revelation from him. He has commanded us to proclaim his truths and live his laws. And so now, in harmony with his mind and will, and as guided by his Holy Spirit, we give counsel and direction to the Saints and to the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/counsel-to-the-saints-and-to-the-world.p9\" class=\"\">To the world I say: These are the last days.

They are days when Satan dwells in the hearts of ungodly men, when iniquity abounds, and when the signs of the times are being shown forth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/counsel-to-the-saints-and-to-the-world.p10\" class=\"\">And there is no cure for the ills of the world except the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Our hope for peace, for temporal and spiritual prosperity, and for an eventual inheritance in the kingdom of God is found only in and through the restored gospel. There is no work that any of us can engage in that is as important as preaching the gospel and building up the Church and kingdom of God on earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/counsel-to-the-saints-and-to-the-world.p11\" class=\"\">And so we invite all our Father\u2019s children, everywhere, to believe in Christ, to receive him as he is revealed by living prophets, and to join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We call upon the world to repent, to worship that God who made them, and to believe the words of those whom he hath sent in this day to proclaim his gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/counsel-to-the-saints-and-to-the-world.p12\" class=\"\">To the honest in heart in all nations we say: The Lord loves you.

There is nothing that will ever come into your family life that is as important as the sealing blessings of the temple and then keeping the covenants made in connection with this order of celestial marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/counsel-to-the-saints-and-to-the-world.p15\" class=\"\">To parents in the Church we say: Love each other with all your hearts.

Overcome the world, and do not be led astray by the fashions and practices of those whose interests are centered upon the things of this world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/counsel-to-the-saints-and-to-the-world.p19\" class=\"\">Marry in the temple, and live joyous and righteous lives.
