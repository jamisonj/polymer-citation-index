In the downward course of all this he became a keeper of pigs, one so hungry, so stripped of sustenance and dignity that he \u201cwould fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat.\u201d But even that consolation was not available to him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-other-prodigal.p5\" class=\"\">Then the scripture says encouragingly, \u201cHe came to himself.\u201d He determined to find his way home, hoping to be accepted at least as a servant in his father\u2019s household. The tender image of this boy\u2019s anxious, faithful father running to meet him and showering him with kisses is one of the most moving and compassionate scenes in all of holy writ. It tells every child of God, wayward or otherwise, how much God wants us back in the protection of His arms.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-other-prodigal.p6\" class=\"\">But being caught up in this younger son\u2019s story, we can miss, if we are not careful, the account of an elder son, for the opening line of the Savior\u2019s account reads, \u201cA certain man had <span class=\"emphasis\">two<\/span> sons\u201d\u2014and He might have added, \u201cboth of whom were lost and both of whom needed to come home.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-other-prodigal.p7\" class=\"\">The younger son has returned, a robe has been placed on his shoulders and a ring on his finger, when the older son comes on the scene. He has been dutifully, loyally working in the field, and now he is returning. The language of parallel journeys home, though from very different locations, is central to this story.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-other-prodigal.p8\" class=\"\">As he approaches the house, he hears the sounds of music and laughter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-other-prodigal.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he called one of the servants [note that he has servants], and asked what these things meant.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-other-prodigal.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd [the servant] said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-other-prodigal.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd [the older brother] was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-other-prodigal.p12\" class=\"\">You know the conversation they then had. Surely, for this father, the pain over a wayward child who had run from home and wallowed with swine is now compounded with the realization that this older, wiser brother, the younger boy\u2019s childhood hero as older brothers always are, is angry that his brother has come home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-other-prodigal.p13\" class=\"\">No, I correct myself. This son is not so much angry that the other has come home as he is angry that his parents are so happy about it. Feeling unappreciated and perhaps more than a little self-pity, this dutiful son\u2014and he is <span class=\"emphasis\">wonderfully<\/span> dutiful\u2014forgets for a moment that he has never had to know filth or despair, fear or self-loathing. He forgets for a moment that every calf on the ranch is already his and so are all the robes in the closet and every ring in the drawer. He forgets for a moment that his faithfulness has been and always will be rewarded.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-other-prodigal.p14\" class=\"\">No, he who has virtually everything, and who has in his hardworking, wonderful way earned it, lacks the one thing that might make him the complete man of the Lord he nearly is. He has yet to come to the compassion and mercy, the charitable breadth of vision to see that <span class=\"emphasis\">this is not a rival returning.<\/span> It is his brother. As his father pled with him to see, it is one who was dead and now is alive. It is one who was lost and now is found.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-other-prodigal.p15\" class=\"\">Certainly this younger brother had been a prisoner\u2014a prisoner of sin, stupidity, and a pigsty. But the older brother lives in some confinement, too. He has, as yet, been unable to break out of the prison of himself. He is haunted by the green-eyed monster of jealousy.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-22905_000_024\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See William Shakespeare, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Merchant of Venice,<\/span> act 3, scene 2, line 110.]<\/span><\/sup> He feels taken for granted by his father and disenfranchised by his brother, when neither is the case. He has fallen victim to a fictional affront. As such he is like Tantalus of Greek mythology\u2014he is up to his chin in water, but he remains thirsty nevertheless. One who has heretofore presumably been very happy with his life and content with his good fortune suddenly feels very unhappy simply because another has had some good fortune as well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-other-prodigal.p16\" class=\"\">Who is it that whispers so subtly in our ear that a gift given to another somehow diminishes the blessings we have received?

I think one of the reasons is that every day we see allurements of one kind or another that tell us what we have is not enough. Someone or something is forever telling us we need to be more handsome or more wealthy, more applauded or more admired than we see ourselves as being. We are told we haven\u2019t collected enough possessions or gone to enough fun places.

The father in this story does not tantalize his children. He does not mercilessly measure them against their neighbors. He doesn\u2019t even compare them with each other. His gestures of compassion toward one do not require a withdrawal or denial of love for the other. He is divinely generous to both of these sons. Toward both of his children he extends charity. I believe God is with us the way my precious wife, Pat, is with my singing. She is a gifted musician, something of a musical genius, but I couldn\u2019t capture a musical note with Velcro. And yet I know she loves me in a very special way when I try to sing. I know that because I can see it in her eyes. They are the eyes of love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/the-other-prodigal.p20\" class=\"\">One observer has written: \u201cIn a world that constantly compares people, ranking them as more or less intelligent, more or less attractive, more or less successful, it is not easy to really believe in a [divine] love that does not do the same. When I hear someone praised,\u201d he says, \u201cit is hard not to think of myself as less praiseworthy; when I read about the goodness and kindness of other people, it is hard not to wonder whether I myself am as good and kind as they; and when I see trophies, rewards, and prizes being handed out to special people, I cannot avoid asking myself why that didn\u2019t happen to me.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-22905_000_024\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Henri J.

But finally these will not be enough. When we are lost, we can \u201ccome to ourselves,\u201d but we may not always be able to \u201cfind ourselves,\u201d and, worlds without end, we cannot \u201csave ourselves.\u201d Only the Father and His Only Begotten Son can do that.
