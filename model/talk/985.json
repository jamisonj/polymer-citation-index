Elder Christiansen\nreported his visit to the various branches of the Church in Europe. I made a promise to the\ngood members of the Church in the far Pacific that when I returned I would remember them\nto you and express to you their love and fellowship. It is a glorious thing to go into a country,\none so far away, and find members of the Church who think and act just as we\ndo here, with the same testimony of the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I\nam fulfilling my promise in expressing to you their goodwill and fellowship.\n<\/p><p>\nFor the few minutes that I have I would like to take a text from the words of our Savior,\n\". . . except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27826\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27826)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27826)\">John 3:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI am firmly convinced that nowhere else in the world, outside of the Church of Jesus Christ\nof Latter-day Saints, is there anyone who has the authority to perform the ordinances that\nwould bring the birth of the water and of the Spirit to mankind. That would have to be from\nsomeone who has the authority of the priesthood of God, and that authority was revealed in\nthese latter-days, the Aaronic Priesthood first by John the Baptist to the Prophet Joseph Smith\nand Oliver Cowdery, and then the Melchizedek Priesthood under the hands of Peter, James,\nand John, also to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd from that source we have obtained the priesthood of God by which we act and by which\nwe go forth into the world to preach the gospel to those who sit in darkness\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13736\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13736)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13736)\">D&amp;C 45:28<\/a><\/span>). I know this\nstatement is not pleasing to the great majority of people upon the face of the earth, but\nnevertheless it is true. And I realize that it is impossible for us&mdash;all things are possible, of\ncourse, to the Lord&mdash;but it is impossible for us with all the means that we have at our\ncommand and the means at our command have increased wonderfully in the last few \nyears&mdash;but we cannot reach every soul living upon the face of the earth. They are dying off every\nday. They are being born every day into the world.\n<\/p><p>\nHowever, the Word of the Lord being true, the time must come when the message of\nsalvation will reach every soul. How is that to be done? We do the best we can with all the\nfacilities at our command, through the preaching of the gospel, disseminating the truth by\nword of mouth, by the many facilities that are at our command, through the magazines that\nare published through the press and every other means. But it is impossible for us with the\nfacilities such as they are, to reach every soul.\n<\/p><p>\nFurthermore, there have been millions upon millions of people who have lived in this world\nwho never had the opportunity to hear of Christ, never heard his name; they lived at a time\nand in a place where his name was not known, where the gospel did not reach them not\nbecause of any fault on the part of our Father in heaven nor of his servants to reach the\npeoples of the earth, but because from the beginning of time men have loved Satan more than\nthey loved God (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39121\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39121)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39121)\">Moses 5:13<\/a><\/span>),\nand they have turned away and refused to receive the truth, have raised their\nchildren in darkness, and they have died in darkness, so far as the gospel of Jesus Christ is\nconcerned.\n<\/p><p>\nNevertheless, the promises of the Lord must and will be fulfilled. From the very beginning of\nthis dispensation, just a few months after the organization of the Church, the Lord gave a\nrevelation in which he foreshadowed the salvation of the human family, all of those who\nwould repent and believe. I shall read to you this part of the Lord's Preface to the book of his\ncommandments; the words of Jesus Christ, himself.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose\neyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon\nthe islands of the sea, listen together\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13700\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13700)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13700)\">D&amp;C 1:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, that is to all those who are living. But the Lord goes on to enlarge this thought. And he\nsays: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape, and there is no\neye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be\npenetrated\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13702\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13702)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13702)\">D&amp;C 1:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has not limited that to any dispensation or any age upon the face of the earth. He\nhas made that just as broad as the history of mankind and he adds: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; for their iniquities shall be spoken\nupon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13703\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13703)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13703)\">D&amp;C 1:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems so strange to me that the peoples of this world since the days of the great apostasy,\nwhen the apostles of old were removed and those who held the priesthood were destroyed,\nthat the world could fall into the awful condition which today prevails,\nwhich denies salvation to every soul born into this world who never heard the name of Jesus\nChrist or never had an opportunity to repent and be baptized or receive the gift of the Holy\nGhost. They have held out no hope for all of these people of the nations, pagan or otherwise,\nwho have dwelt upon the face of the earth without the knowledge of the gospel of Jesus\nChrist.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord is just, and he has made it clear that the time will come when every soul shall have\nan opportunity to hear the truth. That does not mean that every soul has the opportunity or\nwill have that opportunity in this mortal world. Millions have died without that opportunity. It\nhas been no fault of theirs, but the fault lies with their fathers before them, who turned away\nfrom the truth which truth was given in the beginning to Adam who was commanded to teach\nthese things to his children. The scriptures say that Adam did teach these things to his\nchildren but that they loved Satan more than they loved God, and Satan came among them\nand said, \"I, too, am a son of God, believe it not, and they believed it not and from that time\nforth men became carnal, sensual and devilish\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39122\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39122)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39122)\">Moses 5:13<\/a><\/span>), and so darkness spread over\nthe face of the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nIn his justice, the Lord has revealed to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, just as\nhe revealed it in the days of the apostles, that there is a salvation even for the dead and the\ntime must come when every soul must have an opportunity to hear it. Those who did not get\nthe opportunity to hear it in this world will have that opportunity in the world of spirits, and\nPeter made that very clear in his Epistles\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2277\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2277)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2277)\">1 Pet. 3:18-19<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2279\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2279)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2279)\">1 Pet. 4:6<\/a><\/span>),\nand it is only fair that those who died without a\nknowledge of the gospel should have the opportunity to hear it, and the Lord revealed that\ngreat truth to the Prophet Joseph Smith\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13807\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13807)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13807)\">D&amp;C 128:19<\/a><\/span>),\nthat the time would come when the gospel of the\nkingdom would be declared to the dead and they who never had the opportunity of hearing it\nshould have that opportunity given to them, and if they would repent in that spirit world then\nwe could go into the temples of the Lord and perform the ordinances for them vicariously,\nbeing saviors upon Mount Zion (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41164\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41164)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41164)\">Obad. 1:21<\/a><\/span>),\nand thus give unto the dead the opportunity to hear the truth,\nto repent of their sins, and if they will repent and turn away from evil and accept the truth,\nwe can go into the temples of the Lord and perform the ordinances for them which will be\nvalid unto them just the same as if they were living upon the face of the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is a vicarious work. Christ came into this world and died for\nmankind. He did not die just for those who repented of their sins and received his gospel. His\ndeath upon the cross brought salvation to every living soul, so far as the resurrection from the\ndead is concerned, and every soul born into this world shall receive the resurrection from the\ndead because he was not guilty of bringing death into the world, and man is not penalized\nbecause death came into the world, but naturally he has to die&mdash;that is part of the mortal\nlife&mdash;but he will be raised again in the resurrection no matter who he is, no matter when he\nlived, no matter what he believed or what he failed to believe. That is a universal gift from\nJesus Christ to every soul.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a different matter, however, so far as the kingdom of God is concerned, and no soul is\ngoing to enter into that kingdom until he has received either in this life in person or by proxy\nbecause he was not here to do it for himself, baptism for the remission of his sins and the\nlaying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. What a wonderful gift it is the Lord has\nplaced into our hands, to bring salvation to the dead, to those who are willing to repent and\nreceive the truth.\n<\/p><p>\nI have no idea in my mind that every soul that has lived upon the face of the earth, who has\ndied and gone to the spirit world, is going to repent and receive the gospel. There will be\nmany that will not do that. Our scriptures point to that fact. They are not going to receive the\ngospel in the spirit world, when their souls are full of bitterness and hate towards the truth,\nbut they have a right to have it taught to them.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord went into the spirit world, himself, turned the key for the salvation of the dead and\nour elders when they pass to the next world, go into that world to continue\ntheir labors of preaching the gospel, bringing to repentance all who are willing to repent and\nreceive the truth, that they might come into the kingdom of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13823\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13823)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13823)\">D&amp;C 138:30-35<\/a><\/span>), or as Paul calls it, \"the\nfamily of God in heaven and on earth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21708\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21708)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21708)\">Eph. 3:15<\/a><\/span>).\nFor it is the family of God. The kingdom of God will\nbe one great family. We call ourselves brothers and sisters. In very deed we become joint\nheirs with Jesus Christ through the gospel of Jesus Christ, sons and daughters of God, and\nentitled to the fullness of the blessings of his kingdom if we will repent and keep these\ncommandments.\n<\/p><p>\nIn conclusion I want to read to you one or two statements dealing with our responsibilities\ntowards the dead. First from the Prophet Joseph Smith: \n<\/p><p>\n\"The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us, is to seek after our dead\"\n(<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>, p. 356).\n<\/p><p>\n\"This doctrine was the burden of the scriptures. Those Saints who neglect it, in behalf of their\ndeceased relatives, do it at the peril of their own salvation\" (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, p. 193).\n<\/p><p>\n\"It is one of the greatest and most important subjects that God has revealed. He should send\nElijah to seal the children to the fathers, and the fathers to the children . . . without us, they\ncould not be made perfect, nor we without them; the fathers without the children, nor the\nchildren without the fathers . . . I wish you to understand this subject, for it is important\"\n(<i>Ibid.<\/i>, p. 337).\n<\/p><p>\n\"We have a work to do just as important in its sphere as the Savior's work was in its sphere.\nOur fathers cannot be made perfect without us; we cannot be made perfect without them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13806\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13806)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13806)\">D&amp;C 128:15<\/a><\/span>).\nThey have done their work and now sleep. We are now called upon to do ours; which is to be\nthe greatest work man ever performed on the earth.\" (Brigham Young, <i>Discourses<\/i>, p. 406).\n<\/p><p>\n\"The ordinance of sealing must be performed here man to man, and woman to man, and\nchildren to parents, etc. until the chain of generation is made perfect in the sealing ordinances\nback to Father Adam\" (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, p. 407).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Brethren and sisters, lay these things to heart. Let us go on with our records . . . I pray God\nthat as a people our eyes may be opened to see, our ears to hear, and our hearts to understand\nthe great and mighty work that rests upon our shoulders, and that the God of heaven requires\nat our hand\" (President Wilford Woodruff, <i>The Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine<\/i>,\nVol. 13, p. 152).\n<\/p><p>\n\"This is the day in which the Lord expects his Church at least to inaugurate the great work of\nturning 'the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers'\"\n(President David O. McKay, <i>The Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine<\/i>, Vol. 25, p. 59,\nor <i>Gospel Ideals<\/i>, p. 19).\n<\/p><p>\n\"What about your great great ancestors who never heard the name of Jesus Christ? . . . You\nmay have the opportunity of gathering the names of your ancestors and, by being baptized for\nby proxy, they may become members of the kingdom of God in the other world as we are\nmembers here\" (President David O. McKay, see <i>Instructor<\/i>, November 1958, p. 322).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren, these are our responsibilities, and the Lord requires this work at our hands.\nThe Church has gone to great expense endeavoring to gather the records of the dead, and I\nwant to say to you, has been very, very successful in that labor to gather in the records of\nyour ancestors so that we could go into the temples of the Lord and perform these labors for\nthem so that all who are willing to repent and receive the gospel of Jesus Christ may be\nbrought into his kingdom and into that great family of God, which is both in heaven and on\nearth.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I humbly pray that this spirit will take hold of the members of the Church, in the name\nof the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
