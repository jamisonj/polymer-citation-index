As we have been celebrating this, the sesquicentennial anniversary of the organization of the Church, I have recalled that ten months prior to that organization the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery had received from Peter, James, and John the Melchizedek Priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-oath-and-covenant-which-belongeth-to-the-priesthood.p4\" class=\"\">Traditionally, God\u2019s people have always been known as a covenant people. The gospel itself is the new and everlasting covenant. The posterity of Abraham through Isaac and Jacob constitute what is known as the covenant race. We come into the Church by covenant, which we enter into when we go into the waters of baptism. The new and everlasting covenant of celestial marriage is the gate to exaltation in the celestial kingdom.

An oath is a sworn attestation to the inviolability of the promises in the agreement. In the covenant of the priesthood the parties are the Father\u2014that\u2019s the Lord\u2014and the receiver of the priesthood. Each party to the covenant undertakes certain obligations. The receiver undertakes to magnify his calling in the priesthood. The Father, by oath and covenant, promises the receiver that if he does so magnify his priesthood he will be sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of his body; that he will become a member of \u201cthe church and kingdom, and the elect of God,\u201d and receive the \u201cFather\u2019s kingdom; therefore,\u201d said the Savior, \u201call that my Father hath shall be given unto him\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17461\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17461)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17461)\">D&amp;C 84:33\u201334, 38<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-oath-and-covenant-which-belongeth-to-the-priesthood.p6\" class=\"\">It is of such\u2014that is, those who receive the priesthood and magnify it\u2014that the following was written:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-oath-and-covenant-which-belongeth-to-the-priesthood.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cThey are they into whose hands the Father has given all things\u2014<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-oath-and-covenant-which-belongeth-to-the-priesthood.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cThey are they who are priests and kings, who have received of his fulness, and of his glory;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-oath-and-covenant-which-belongeth-to-the-priesthood.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd are priests of the Most High, after the order of \u2026 the Only Begotten Son.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-oath-and-covenant-which-belongeth-to-the-priesthood.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17445\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17445)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17445)\">D&amp;C 76:55\u201358<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-oath-and-covenant-which-belongeth-to-the-priesthood.p11\" class=\"\">These transcendent blessings the Father promises the receiver of the Melchizedek Priesthood by an oath and covenant which he says \u201che cannot break, neither can it be moved\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17465\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17465)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17465)\">D&amp;C 84:40<\/a><\/span>). But these blessings, as has already been indicated, do not come by ordination alone. Ordination to the priesthood is a prerequisite to receiving them, but it does not guarantee them. For a man to actually obtain them he must faithfully discharge the obligation which is placed upon him when he received the priesthood. That is, he must magnify his calling.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/the-oath-and-covenant-which-belongeth-to-the-priesthood.p12\" class=\"\">Now let us consider for a moment just what magnifying one\u2019s calling in the priesthood means.

With such a penalty prescribed for breaking it, one might be prompted to question the advisability of accepting the obligations of the covenant; that is, he might question it until he reads the verse which follows the statement of the penalty.
