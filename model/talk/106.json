Before the\ndays of microphones and public address systems, voices such as mine were\nnot so easily heard by audiences such as this, and I am very grateful for the mechanical help\nthat makes it possible for us to be heard by great numbers and in far places.\n<\/p><p>\nA TRIBUTE TO THE LEADING BRETHREN\n<\/p><p>\nI can think of no greater privilege in life, brethren, than to find fellowship with such men as\nyou, and I can think of no greater tragedy or source of unhappiness than, having found such\nfellowship, to be deprived of it. I love my brethren; and I know that I could go to my\nbrethren of the general authorities of the Church, to the last man, in any time of need, and\nfind that I would not depart empty-handed or with empty heart. I hope that the time will\ncome in every priesthood quorum of this Church when every member of every priesthood\nquorum can feel that same assurance concerning his own needs, spiritual and otherwise. It is a\ngreat source of strength and satisfaction and happiness, and assurance in life.\n<\/p><p>\nBefore I proceed with one other thought that I have, I should like to express my personal\nregard for Brother Mark Petersen, who this day has been called to a place in the council of\nthe twelve. It has been my privilege and my responsibility for some time to have business\nwith him in the course of both of our official duties, and I have always found satisfaction in\nmy approaches to him, and have always encountered there a quiet confidence and fairness,\nand safe judgment. And I subscribe to Brother Young's statement concerning him, pertaining\nto his gentlemanly characteristics on all occasions.\n<\/p><p>\nWAR MAKES NO CHANGE IN GOSPEL\n<\/p><p>\nThere has been a thought running through my mind, one or two phases of which I should like\nto mention here today.\n<\/p><p>\nWar, of necessity, changes many things. \"Business as usual,\" is something that cannot be\nexpected. Nor can we expect \"life as usual.\" War may change, necessarily, many of the habits\nof our living, especially of a material nature. \n<\/p><p>\nBut I should like to say this here today, with the best language that I can command: that war\ndoes not, and must not, and cannot, change fundamentals. For one thing, it does not change\nour obligation to be bearers of the message of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Brother\nGeorge F. Richards has already referred to some phases of this, likewise his son, Bishop\nRichards, at this session.\n<\/p><p>\nIf I am not mistaken, I think Brother Ivins of the First Council of the Seventy invited our\nattention some days ago to the fact that since the beginning of the stake missionary\nmovement, within the past seven or eight years, more than 14,000 baptisms have resulted\nfrom stake missionary activity. To state it another way, that would add, perhaps, about three\nfairly good-sized stakes to the total membership of this Church&mdash;a tremendous accomplishment\nin the aggregate, and yet missionary opportunities are very perishable, so far as the individual\nis concerned.\n<\/p><p>\nI am reminded of the great hosts of men and women who have passed through our\ncommunities within the past two or three years, many of whom have now\nleft, and I am wondering with what impressions they have left, or if they have any impression\nof us at all. Some of them who were here last month are gone; some of them who were here\nlast year are gone; some of them who are here now will be gone next month. Missionary\nopportunities on an individual basis are exceedingly perishable and transitory. War does not\nchange our obligations to be bearers of the message of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ,\nwherever we are and trader whatever circumstances we find ourselves.\n<\/p><p>\nRESPONSIBILITIES CONCERNING OUR CHILDREN UNCHANGED\n<\/p><p>\nWar does not change our obligations and responsibilities concerning our children; it cannot\nand it must not.\n<\/p><p>\nI am reminded of the fact that since the early crisis in the present European theatre of war,\nfive or six years ago now, many young men and young women who were then twelve and\nfourteen and fifteen years of age, young men particularly, have since passed through perhaps\nthe most critical years of their lives, and are now out fighting, flying bombers, in the armed\nforces of their respective countries, carrying the brunt, in many instances, of the heaviest\nbattles. Should we have become too busy, because of the actual existence of war, or the\nimminence thereof, to have given these children of ours the foundation in our homes that we\nare obligated to give them and that they are entitled to have, thousands of them would now\nhave left those homes without any foundation on which to place their feet.\n<\/p><p>\nI do not know how long the war will last, and I do not know anyone who does know. There\nare predictions extant, from a few weeks to several years. But regardless of its length, I do\nknow that this is one of the responsibilities that war cannot and must not change&mdash;our\nresponsibilities to our children&mdash;so that when the time comes that they must leave us, for\nany cause whatsoever, they will have that which will give them a fixed standard in life, a\nspiritual and moral foundation on which to rest their feet, no matter where they go or in what\ncompany they find themselves.\n<\/p><p>\nFUNDAMENTALS STILL IN FORCE\n<\/p><p>\nAnother thing that war does not change is moral law, nor the evils and consequences that\nfollow the disregarding of moral law. There is only one set of rules pertaining to the personal\nconduct of the children of our Father in heaven. If a thing was not right at home, it is not\nright away from home. If it was not right where we came from, it isn't right anywhere, in any\ncompany.\n<\/p><p>\nThis spirit of social let-down and personal let-down is as wrong as it ever was or ever will be.\nWar does not change fundamentals, nor the consequences that follow the ignoring of those\nfundamentals, and it must not be allowed to glorify evils. There is a reward for consistency of\nliving, frequently restated by the prophets of God in a variety of language, over a wide period\nof time, but it resolves itself to the conclusion in the oft-quoted phrase: \"He that shall endure\nto the end shall be saved\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33932\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33932)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33932)\">Matt. 24:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay we be enabled as a people, and may our children, wherever they are, be enabled to\ndistinguish between those things which war necessarily does not change, and those things\nwhich it must not be permitted to change, and to cleave to the fundamentals, both of personal\nand social conduct, as well as to all our other fixed obligations and duties as Latter-day\nSaints, and as children of God, our Father in heaven.\n<\/p><p>\nThat we may have the spirit of discernment to distinguish between these things, and the\nstrength, both those of us who are here and those who are on far fronts, the pattern of whose\nlives has been upset and broken, to carry forward and live lives of consistency, and endure to\nthe end, is my prayer, to which I add my testimony of the truthfulness and divinity of this\nwork, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
