He had been crucified and then resurrected. His servants had gone to Galilee. They had fished through the night, catching nothing. When they drew near to shore, in the dawn, they did not at first recognize Him. He called out to them, telling them where to cast their nets, and when they did the nets were filled. They rushed to greet Him on the shore.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p6\" class=\"\">They found a fire of coals with fish cooking and bread. I have often wondered, as you may have done, who laid the fire, who caught the fish, and who cooked the meal, but it was the Master who prepared His disciples to be fed more than fish and bread.

We are blessed to live in a time when a great increase in that capacity to nourish new members of the Church must and therefore will be poured out upon the faithful Saints. That power has been given before among the Lord\u2019s people. This is the description of how the Lord\u2019s people did it once in a time recounted in the Book of Mormon. In a scripture that we\u2019ve heard today, you remember that \u201cthey were numbered \u2026 that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38741\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38741)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38741)\">Moro. 6:4<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p9\" class=\"\">All of us have tried at some time to nourish another person\u2019s faith. Most of us have felt the concern of others for our own faith, and with it we have felt their love. More than a few of us have had a child look up to us and say, \u201cWould you like to go to church with me?\u201d or \u201cWould you pray with me?\u201d And we have had our disappointments. Someone we love may not have accepted our attempts to nourish their faith. We know from painful experience that God respects the choice of His children not to be nourished. Yet this is a time to feel renewed optimism and hope that our power to nourish will be increased.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p10\" class=\"\">The Lord through His living prophet has told us that He will preserve the bounteous harvest of new converts entering the waters of baptism across the earth. And the Lord will do it through us. So we can have confidence that by doing simple things, things that even a child can do, we will be granted soon greater power to nourish tender faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p11\" class=\"\">The place to start is with our own hearts. What we want with all our hearts will determine in large degree whether we can claim our right to the companionship of the Holy Ghost, without which there can be no spiritual nourishing. We can begin today to try to see those we are to nourish as our Heavenly Father sees them and so feel some of what He feels for them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p12\" class=\"\">Those new members of the Church are His children. He has known them and they have known Him in the world before this one. His purpose and that of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is to have them return to Him and to give them eternal life if only they will choose it. He has led and sustained His missionaries by the Holy Spirit to find and teach and baptize them. He allowed His Son to pay the price of their sins. Our Father and the Savior see those converts as tender lambs, purchased with a price we cannot fathom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p13\" class=\"\">A mortal parent may appreciate, in some small way, the feelings of a loving Heavenly Father. When our children come to the age when they must leave our direct care, we feel anxiety for their safety and concern that those who are to help them will not fail them. We can feel at least some of the Father\u2019s and the Savior\u2019s love for the new members of the Church and the trust they place in us to nourish.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p14\" class=\"\">Those feelings in our hearts for the new members will go far to qualify us for the help of the Spirit and thus overcome the fears which may deter us from our sacred responsibility. It is wise to fear that our own skills are inadequate to meet the charge we have to nourish the faith of others. Our own abilities, however great, will not be enough. But that realistic view of our limitations creates a humility which can lead to dependence on the Spirit and thus to power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p15\" class=\"\">Brigham Young told us to have courage despite our weaknesses. He did it in this language that seems so much like him:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cIn addressing a congregation, though the speaker be unable to say more than half a dozen sentences, and those awkwardly constructed, if his heart is pure before God, those few broken sentences are of more value than the greatest eloquence without the Spirit of the Lord and of more real worth in the sight of God, angels, and all good men. In praying, though a person\u2019s words be few and awkwardly expressed, if the heart is pure before God, that prayer will avail more than the eloquence of a Cicero. What does the Lord, the Father of us all, care about our mode of expression? The simple, honest heart is of more avail with the Lord than all the pomp, pride, splendor, and eloquence produced by men. When he looks upon a heart full of sincerity, integrity, and child-like simplicity, he sees a principle that will endure forever\u2014\u2018That is the spirit of my own kingdom\u2014the spirit I have given to my children\u2019\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> sel. John A. Widtsoe [1954], 169).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p17\" class=\"\">A child can do the things which will give us power to nourish the faith of others. Children could invite a recent convert to come with them to a meeting. Children could smile and greet a new member coming into a chapel or into a class. So can we. And as surely as we do, the Holy Ghost will be our companion. The fear of not knowing what to say and of being rejected will be taken from us. The newcomer will not appear to be a stranger to us. And the Holy Ghost will begin nourishing them even before we have spoken of gospel truths.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p18\" class=\"\">It does not require a calling more than being a member to nourish by reaching out in kindness. And even those who have no calling to teach or to preach can nourish with the good word of God if we prepare for it. We can do it every time we speak with a new member and every time we participate in a class discussion. Every word we speak can strengthen or weaken faith. We need help from the Spirit to speak the words which will nourish and which will strengthen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p19\" class=\"\">There are two great keys to inviting the Spirit to guide what words we speak as we feed others. They are the daily study of the scriptures and the prayer of faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p20\" class=\"\">The Holy Ghost will guide what we say if we study and ponder the scriptures every day. The words of the scriptures invite the Holy Spirit. The Lord said it this way: \u201cSeek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20700\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20700)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20700)\">D&amp;C 11:21<\/a><\/span>). With daily study of the scriptures, we can count on this blessing even in casual conversations or in a class when we may be asked by a teacher to respond to a question. We will experience the power the Lord promised: \u201cNeither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20793\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20793)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20793)\">D&amp;C 84:85<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p21\" class=\"\">We treasure the word of God not only by reading the words of the scriptures but by studying them. We may be nourished more by pondering a few words, allowing the Holy Ghost to make them treasures to us, than to pass quickly and superficially over whole chapters of scripture.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p22\" class=\"\">Just as pondering the scriptures invites the Holy Ghost, so does daily pleading in prayer. If we do not ask in prayer, He will rarely come, and without our petition He is not likely to linger. \u201cAnd the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20740\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20740)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20740)\">D&amp;C 42:14<\/a><\/span>). Heartfelt, constant pleading for the companionship of the Holy Ghost, with the pure intent to nourish our Father\u2019s children, will surely bring blessings to us and to those we love and serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p23\" class=\"\">The good word of God with which we must nourish is the simple doctrine of the gospel. We need not fear either simplicity or repetition.

It takes a childlike heart to feel the promptings of the Spirit, to surrender to those commands, and to obey. That is what it takes to be nourished by the good word of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/feed-my-lambs.p29\" class=\"\">And that is why we can be so optimistic in our charge to nourish the new members of the Church. However much or little they knew of the doctrine, they have just submitted humbly to the ordinance of baptism and received the right to the companionship of the Holy Ghost.
