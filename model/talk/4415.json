To some, that may have seemed as a dull exercise in numbers. To me, the information given represents a miracle. At the end of the year, the membership of the Church moved comfortably past the six million mark. What a miraculous and remarkable flowering from that small seed planted April 6, 1830, in the log home of Peter Whitmer where six men formally organized the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-lengthened-shadow-of-the-hand-of-god.p8\" class=\"\">As of the end of 1986, there were 1,622 organized stakes of Zion.

There were 193 organized missions and almost 32,000 missionaries serving therein. What a change from the single effort of Samuel Smith who, even before the Church was organized, put a few copies of the Book of Mormon in his knapsack and tramped the roads of western New York to leave a copy here and a copy there to touch for everlasting good the lives of those who read them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-lengthened-shadow-of-the-hand-of-god.p10\" class=\"\">There were 5,000 copies of that first edition, made possible in their printing by the generosity of Martin Harris, who mortgaged a farm to pay for them. Last year there were 1,643,000 copies of this same book printed and distributed in English alone, with a total distribution in all languages approaching 3,000,000.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-lengthened-shadow-of-the-hand-of-god.p11\" class=\"\">Notwithstanding his problems, I have a great feeling of love for Martin Harris, who pledged the security of his lands to make possible the printing of this sacred record. It was an act of faith which has borne sweet fruit\u2014the fruit of conversion and testimony and love for the Lord\u2014in the lives of many millions over the earth. I am grateful for the repeated urging of our prophet of this day that we read this sacred record with a promise that in doing so we shall draw nearer to the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-lengthened-shadow-of-the-hand-of-god.p12\" class=\"\">Each week the Church Appropriations Committee meets to consider and authorize the expenditure of Church funds for the building of chapels and other purposes.

But to me, it is a constantly renewing miracle. I have picked a short sample from a typical agenda: (1) a new building for the Mikkeli Ward of the Helsinki Finland Stake, (2) another for the Obrajes Ward of the La Paz Bolivia Miraflores Stake, (3) yet another for the Quilmes Oeste Ward of the Buenos Aires Argentina Quilmes Stake, (4) similarly for the Campo Grande First Ward of the Brazil S\u00e3o Paulo North Stake, (5) the Gympie Ward of the Brisbane Australia Stake, (6) the Bu Chon Ward of the Seoul Korea Kang Seo Stake, (7) the Kennedy First Ward of the Bogota Colombia Kennedy Stake, and (8) the Caurimare Ward of the Caracas Venezuela Stake. There were yet others.

I mention in passing one other impressive and remarkable thing. This coming July will be a season of celebration for members of the Church in the British Isles. There will be commemorated the 150th anniversary of the opening of the British Mission. That, too, was an act of faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-lengthened-shadow-of-the-hand-of-god.p27\" class=\"\">The year was 1837. The Latter-day Saints were settled in two locations, most of them in and around Kirtland, Ohio, and others, some eight hundred miles distant in Missouri. It was a season of economic depression. Banks failed, fortunes were lost. Among the failures was the bank in Kirtland. A spirit of criticism and evil speaking threatened the Church. In those circumstances, Joseph Smith said to Heber C. Kimball, \u201cBrother Heber, the Spirit of the Lord has whispered to me. \u2018Let my servant Heber go to England and proclaim my gospel, and open the door of salvation to that nation\u2019\u201d (Orson F.

Such a request from one ordinary man to another would have been incredible. It meant leaving a family destitute. It meant traveling to New York and crossing the sea when he had no money. It meant that a man with very little schooling, who had grown up and lived in frontier communities, would go to the great cities of the British Isles among a people known for their education and enlightenment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-lengthened-shadow-of-the-hand-of-god.p29\" class=\"\">In his mind, Heber C.

Suffice it to say that Heber C. Kimball and his six associates, at the call of Joseph Smith, left their homes, traveled over land and sea, and laid the foundation of a mighty work in the British Isles, from where the cause spread to Europe and subsequently across the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-lengthened-shadow-of-the-hand-of-god.p32\" class=\"\">What is all of this of which I speak? It is the lengthened shadow of the hand of God. It is the lengthened shadow of a mighty prophet, Joseph Smith, who was called and ordained to open this, the dispensation of the fulness of times spoken of in the scriptures. His numerous critics, now as in the past, spend their lives in trying to explain him on some basis other than the one which he gave.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-lengthened-shadow-of-the-hand-of-god.p33\" class=\"\">Of what credibility, I ask, is their estimate in comparison with the opinions of those who were at his side in laying the foundations of this ever-growing, ever-strengthening cause?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-lengthened-shadow-of-the-hand-of-god.p34\" class=\"\">Permit me to give you four or five testimonies of men who knew him, who worked with him, who prayed with him, who suffered with him, who forfeited comfort and wealth and ease because of their conviction that he was the anointed of the Almighty, a prophet in this generation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-lengthened-shadow-of-the-hand-of-god.p35\" class=\"\">I begin with Brigham Young, who investigated for two years before he joined the Church.

I was there and was myself wounded in my body. I have seen him under all these various circumstances, and I testify before God, angels and men that he was a good, honorable, and virtuous man, that his private and public character was irreproachable, and that he lived and died a man of God\u201d (in Ezra C.

I had the great privilege \u2026 of boarding \u2026 at his house, so that I not only knew him as a public teacher, but as a private citizen, and as a husband and father. I witnessed his earnest and humble devotions, both morning and evening in his family. I heard the words of eternal life flow from his lips, nourishing and soothing and comforting his family, neighbors and friends. I saw his countenance lighted up as the inspiration of the Holy Ghost rested upon him, dictating the great and most precious revelations now printed for our guide. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-lengthened-shadow-of-the-hand-of-god.p43\" class=\"\">\u201cI knew that he was a man of God.
