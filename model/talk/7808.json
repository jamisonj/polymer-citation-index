The purpose of the show was to describe and discuss the different religions of the world. Two of us were assigned to represent the Church in responding to questions that might be asked during this type of a program. After several commercial breaks, as they say in radio parlance, the program director made this comment: \u201cWe have with us this evening two elders from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\u201d He paused and then asked, \u201cWhy does the Church have such a long name? Why don\u2019t you use a shorter or more commercial name?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/called-to-be-saints.p11\" class=\"\">My companion and I smiled at such a magnificent question and then proceeded to explain that the name of the Church was not chosen by man. It was given by the Savior through a prophet in these latter days: \u201cFor thus shall my church be called in the last days, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122196\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122196)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122196)\">D&amp;C 115:4<\/a><\/span>). The program director immediately and respectfully responded, \u201cWe will thus repeat it with great pleasure.\u201d Now, I cannot remember how many times he repeated the significant name of the Church, but I do remember the sweet spirit that was present when we explained not only the name of the Church but also how it makes reference to the members of the Church\u2014the Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/called-to-be-saints.p12\" class=\"\">We read in the New Testament that the members of the Church of Jesus Christ were called Christians for the first time in Antioch (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122197\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122197)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122197)\">Acts 11:26<\/a><\/span>), but they called <span class=\"emphasis\">each other<\/span> Saints.

Humble members of the Church who conduct daily family prayer and scripture study, engage in family history, and consecrate their time to worship in the temple frequently, become Saints. They are those who are dedicated to creating eternal families. They are also those who set apart time from their busy lives to rescue those who have become alienated from the Church and encourage them to return and sit at the Lord\u2019s table. They are those elders and sisters and mature couples who respond to a call to serve as the Lord\u2019s missionaries. Yes, my brothers and sisters, they become Saints to the degree that they discover that warm and wonderful feeling that is called charity, or the pure love of Christ (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122200\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122200)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122200)\">Moroni 7:42\u201348<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/called-to-be-saints.p14\" class=\"\">The Saints, or members of the Church, also come to know our Savior through afflictions and trials.
