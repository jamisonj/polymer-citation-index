Sill, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1967, pp. 12-15<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nOne of the outstanding memories carried over from childhood is my recollection of the\nSabbath day. Back in those early times out on the farm, Sunday was a day completely set\napart from the rest of the week. From Monday through Saturday, our attention was centered\nin the heavy labor involved in making a living by the muscle power of men and animals.\n<\/p><p>\nBut Sunday was different&mdash;it was the Sabbath. It was the day of rest. It was the day of the\nLord. On Saturday night the horses were turned out to pasture and all work was suspended.\nSaturday was also a kind of special housecleaning day to get things and people ready for\nSunday. The final act of the work week was concerned with that important ancient rite known\nas the \"Saturday night bath.\" This was supplemented by a parental issue of properly mended,\nclean clothing, all laid out, ready for Sunday.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Sabbath, the crown of the week<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nA thorough physical and spiritual preparation also served as our acknowledgment of the\nCreator's intention that the Sabbath day was supposed to be the high point of the week. It has\nbeen said that our civilization would never have survived for half a century if it had not been\nfor this one day in seven. This is the day when we are expected to live at our best, when we\nput on our best clothes, read our best books, think our best thoughts, and associate with the\npeople who mean the most in our lives. And after we have laid aside the cares that have\nconcerned us during the other six days, we go to the house of prayer and let our minds reach\nup and try to comprehend the things of God.\n<\/p><p>\nThe unit of life is the week, and each week, which was the week of creation. As the scene\nopens on that first day, we feel the brooding, unbroken darkness covering the deep, and that\nthrill at that first forward step when God first said, \"Let there be light\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23740\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23740)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23740)\">Gen. 1:3<\/a><\/span>). We follow\nthe other creative acts to the crowning scene, which took place during the sixth day, when\nGod created man in his own image and endowed him with his own attributes and\npotentialities. Then in summarizing the accomplishments of this period of creation, the holy\nrecord says, \"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host\nof them.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And on the seventh day, God ended his work, which he had made; and he rested on the\nseventh day . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23747\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23747)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23747)\">Gen. 2:1-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen in programming the world's mortal or temporal existence, God gave it a time allotment\nof 7,000 years (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"14979\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14979)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14979)\">D&amp;C 77:6-7<\/a><\/span>), 1,000 years to represent each of the seven days of creation.\nThe first 4,000 years began at the fall of Adam and ended at the birth of Christ. To this have\nbeen added the 1967 years that have passed since that time, so that on the divine calendar we\nare now living in the year of the world 1967, which is the late Saturday evening of the\nworld's history. This divine time table as well as God's signs of the times indicate that the\nearth's Sabbath, which is the seventh 1,000-year period, is about to be ushered in.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter the creation, God looked out upon his handiwork and called it very good\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23744\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23744)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23744)\">Gen. 1:31<\/a><\/span>). The earth was\nthen a paradise of beauty, peace, and plenty. Our first parents were placed in the beautiful\nGarden of Eden, where everything had been provided for their benefit. But at the fall of man\nthe earth also fell. And in announcing the penalty for man's disobedience God said, \". . .\ncursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; \n<\/p><p>\n\"Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23752\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23752)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23752)\">Gen. 3:17-18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe may think of this earth as a pretty wonderful place just as it is, but for nearly 6,000 years\nit has been operating in its fallen condition as a telestial world. Not only has it brought forth\nthorns, thistles, and noxious weeds out of the ground, but lawlessness, corruption, and every\nkind of disobedience have flourished upon its face. Its surface has been made unproductive by\ndeserts and waste places, while enmity and hate have been festering in the hearts of both men\nand beasts; and during all of this long, sad period, sin, suffering, and death have been the\ngeneral portion of all mankind.\n<\/p><p>\nBut the next one-thousand year period will be the earth's sabbath. This will be the period\nwhen the earth will rest and enjoy its sanctified state. For this period the earth will be\nrenewed and regain its former status as a terrestrial sphere, with all of its paradisiacal beauty,\nglory, and righteousness fully restored. But first the earth must be cleansed. During its long\nhistory of sin and trouble our earth has become soiled and dirty. And it must have its\n\"Saturday night bath,\" and be dressed in fresh clean clothing in which it can appropriately live\nits best 1,000 years.\n<\/p><p>\nOn several previous occasions God has attempted to cleanse the earth:\nonce by a flood of waters in the days of Noah, and on other occasions he has used wars,\nfamines, pestilence, and disease, trying to rid the earth of that wickedness that defiled its face.\nBut in preparation for the earth's sabbath, God has indicated that fire will be the cleansing\nagent, and every corrupt thing will be consumed (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15021\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15021)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15021)\">D&amp;C 101:24<\/a><\/span>). Anyone who as a boy\nobjected to having his ears scrubbed might look forward to this coming experience with\nspecial anticipation.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Preparing for the millennium<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThrough Malachi the Lord has said, \"For behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven;\nand all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be as stubble: and the day that cometh\nshall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32801\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32801)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32801)\">Mal. 4:1<\/a><\/span>). Then will follow the long awaited seventh 1,000 years. This will be a millennium\nof peace when Christ will reign personally upon the earth as King of kings and Lord of lords\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42412\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42412)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42412)\">Rev. 19:16<\/a><\/span>).\nThis change in the earth's status will be initiated at the glorious second coming of Jesus\nChrist, and after its purification, the new king will remove the curse from the earth and\nreinstate its former terrestrial magnificence.\n<\/p><p>\nThis great millennial period with its perfect government has been a favorite theme of the\nprophets since time began. It should also be one of the most motivating influences in our\nlives. Over 3,000 years ago the Psalmist looked beyond the apostasy, the dark ages, and the\nwickedness and disbelief of our own day and said, \"Our God shall come, and\nshall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round\nabout him.\n<\/p><p>\n\"He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41867\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41867)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41867)\">Ps. 50:3-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFor this final 1,000-year period many sweeping changes will take place in the earth itself, as\nwell as in the lives of the people who live upon it. The delightful paradisiacal condition of the\nearth with its Garden of Eden beauty will be restored. Its deserts and waste places will\ndisappear; Satan will be bound; and there will be no more corruption, death, or disease, as we\nnow know them.\n<\/p><p>\nAbout this event, John the Revelator said, \"And I saw an angel come down from heaven,\nhaving the key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound\nhim a thousand years.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he\nshould deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years are fulfilled: and after that he must\nbe loosed [for] a little season\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42413\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42413)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42413)\">Rev. 20:1-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The time of good will<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nDuring this millennium, the enmity among men and beasts will cease. Isaiah says, \"The wolf\nalso shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and\nthe young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead \"And the cow and the bear\nshall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his\nhand on the cockatrice' den.\n<\/p><p>\n\"They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the\nknowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25330\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25330)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25330)\">Isa. 11:6-9<\/a><\/span>). Then no one will say that\nGod is dead, or that his revelations have ceased, or that life has no purpose.\n<\/p><p>\nMany years ago Harry Emerson Fosdick wrote an interesting book entitled\n<i>It's a Great Time to Be Alive<\/i>. He pointed out some of the miracles and wonders that have made our age the\nmost exciting since creation. And yet the magnificence of this coming 1,000-year period will\nmake our day of wonders and miracles seem like the dark ages by comparison.\n<\/p><p>\nOf course, the Lord is not coming to the earth alone. As Paul says, \"He will come with his\nmighty angels in flaming fire\" (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"5049\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5049)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5049)\">2 Thes. 1:7-8<\/a><\/span>). And many of the righteous dead will then\nbe resurrected and caught up to join the Lord and his company in the air. In speaking of this\nevent, Paul said to the Thessalonians, \". . . I would not have you . . . ignorant, brethren,\nconcerning them which are asleep . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"For . . . them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, [as] with a voice of the\narchangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to\nmeet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2744\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2744)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2744)\">1 Thes. 4:13-14,16-17<\/a><\/span>).\nWhat a great time this will be to be alive!\n<\/p><p>\nAnd what a great time it will be when peace shall cover the earth, and children will grow up\nwithout sin unto salvation. How meaningful will then be the Lord's promise through\nZechariah, saying, \"Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in\nthe midst of thee, saith the Lord\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43080\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43080)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43080)\">Zech. 2:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIsaiah says, \"And they shall build houses, and inhabit them, and they shall plant vineyards,\nand eat the fruit of them.\n<\/p><p>\n\"They shall not build, and another inhabit, they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the\ndays of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their\nhands.\n<\/p><p>\n\"They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble, for they are the seed of the blessed\nof the Lord, and their offspring with them.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet\nspeaking I will hear.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw with the bullock: and\ndust shall be the serpent's meat.

Suppose that we\nshould find ourselves among that group mentioned by John the Revelator when he said, \"But\nthe rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42415\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42415)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42415)\">Rev. 20:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nA modern-day revelation says, \"For . . . the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven . . . and\nthe earth shall tremble . . . and [he] shall say to the sleeping nations: Ye saints arise and live;\nye sinners stay and sleep until I call again\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14935\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14935)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14935)\">D&amp;C 43:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAt the end of the seventh 1,000 years, Satan will again be loosed for a little season (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14999\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14999)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14999)\">D&amp;C 88:110-115<\/a><\/span>) before\nevil is completely banished forever. After the millennium the status of the earth will again be\nincreased to reach its final destiny as a celestial sphere on which the elect will live forever as\nmembers of that exalted order to which God himself belongs.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God grant us success in this greatest of all of earth's enterprises, I humbly pray in the\nname of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
