Think of the many people who have a difficult time obtaining a job or who are ill, who feel lonely, who even think that they have lost everything. What can you do to help?

They were very young. Our older son was just barely two years old, and the younger son was a year old. The street was crowded with people. While we were shopping, leading our children by the hand, we stopped for a moment to look at something, and without realizing it, we lost our older son! We did not know how, but he was not with us. Without a moment\u2019s delay, we took off running to look for him. We searched and called out for him, feeling great anguish, thinking that we might lose him forever. In our minds we were pleading for Heavenly Father to help us find him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/doing-the-right-thing-at-the-right-time-without-delay.p11\" class=\"\">After a little while we found him. There he was, innocently looking at toys through a store window. We hugged and kissed him, and we made the commitment to watch over our children diligently so that we would never lose one again. We learned that in order to go to our son\u2019s rescue, we did not need planning meetings. We simply acted, going out in search of the one who had been lost. We also learned that our son never even realized that he was lost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/doing-the-right-thing-at-the-right-time-without-delay.p12\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, there may be many who, for some reason, are lost from our sight and who do not know that they are lost.
