Now in her 88th year, she continues to be an example of industry and of steadfastness in the gospel. During my adolescent years, I grew up in a single-parent home. May the Lord bless and sustain you wonderful single parents who have to carry such a heavy burden alone.

Since the beginning, it was designed to bless the lives of everyone, without exception. Regarding this, the Apostle Peter said, \u201cI perceive that God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8460\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8460)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8460)\">Acts 10:34\u201335<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/universal-application-of-the-gospel.p12\" class=\"\">President N. Eldon Tanner, who was a member of the First Presidency, taught: \u201cRegardless of country, clime, or condition, the gospel of Jesus Christ applies to every individual just the same. It is a way of life that each can accept, and if lived, will bring greater joy, success, and happiness than anything else in the world\u201d (\u201cChrist\u2019s Worldwide Church,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> July 1974, 6).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/universal-application-of-the-gospel.p13\" class=\"\">I am grateful that the gospel applies to all people, no matter where they live or what station in life they come from. I served a mission in South America more than 40 years ago, when the work was slow, even discouraging at times. Now as I return to that great continent for my present assignment, I marvel at how the Lord has blessed it and how He is making the gospel readily available to everyone, regardless of their circumstances. South America is rapidly becoming dotted with stakes and temples.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>All Can Understand the Gospel<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/universal-application-of-the-gospel.p15\" class=\"\">Related to the gospel\u2019s universal application is its simplicity. With the help of the Holy Ghost, any earnest person can easily understand the gospel and receive its great personal blessings. The Savior taught, \u201cThe Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29869\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29869)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29869)\">John 14:26<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/universal-application-of-the-gospel.p16\" class=\"\">A few years ago Sister Jolley and I concluded an assignment where I presided over a mission in south Texas. Our missionaries there wholeheartedly embraced the \u201cbalanced effort\u201d concept of missionary work, which includes finding, teaching, baptizing, and doing everything possible to retain new converts, and spending several hours each week working with less-active members. Our missionaries, like all missionaries throughout the world, were great kingdom builders.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/universal-application-of-the-gospel.p17\" class=\"\">When my wife and I returned to our home ward in Idaho, I was determined to practice what I preached in the mission field. I therefore asked the bishop to assign me as a home teacher to some of our wonderful families who were not enjoying the blessings of full activity in the Church. He quickly obliged by assigning me to six of these special families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/universal-application-of-the-gospel.p18\" class=\"\">After several visits to one of these families, I challenged the father, who had been inactive for almost 40 years, to become fully active in the Church and to participate in the temple preparation classes. He responded, \u201cThese kinds of things are more than I can understand; they are way over my head.\u201d I was troubled by his response and felt bad that he did not think he could embrace the gospel because it was too difficult to understand. But I knew that the truths of the gospel are for everyone and that everyone can understand them through earnest prayer and scripture study. So our next few home teaching visits were spent talking about the simple and beautiful things of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/universal-application-of-the-gospel.p19\" class=\"\">With patience and persistence our visits became more enjoyable and more spiritual. We developed a genuine friendship. As time went on, it became apparent that he could and did understand the principles of the gospel. This made his wife very happy. They grew closer in their marriage. They are now attending church regularly, becoming good friends with all members, and preparing to go to the temple. We had similar experiences with other families. The Lord blesses us as well as these wonderful families when we put forth the extra effort to share these simple truths with them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/universal-application-of-the-gospel.p20\" class=\"\">Our own honest study of the gospel will show us how simple, pure, and universal its precepts are. James wrote, \u201cBut the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26410\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26410)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26410)\">James 3:17<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Testimony of the Gospel<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/universal-application-of-the-gospel.p22\" class=\"\">I am grateful for the gospel\u2019s beauty and simplicity, and I bear witness to you that it is true and easy to understand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/universal-application-of-the-gospel.p23\" class=\"\">I bear witness that the gospel applies universally to all people\u2014the learned and the unlearned, the rich and the poor, the old and the young, no matter where they are found on the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/universal-application-of-the-gospel.p24\" class=\"\">I bear solemn witness to you that the gospel brings peace in a troubled world.

He stands at the head of this Church, which is for everyone; none are excluded from it. President Gordon B. Hinckley stands today as the Lord\u2019s prophet to lead us. There is no doubt in my mind about the truthfulness of these things.
