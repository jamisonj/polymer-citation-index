Young, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1955, pp. 72-75<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nDuring the last three months it has been my privilege to visit two of the missions of the\nChurch, and I have been impressed with an important phase of the work in which we are\nengaged, the missionary work of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nYou will recall that the Savior on calling his Apostles said to them: \n<\/p><p>\nYe have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go\nand bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27654\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27654)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27654)\">John 15:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere has been no change in that, my brethren and sisters.  \"Ye have not chosen me, but I\nhave chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go forth.\" There is no change in this truth.\nI read these lines the other night by a poet: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . why abandon a belief\n     Merely because it ceases to be true?\n     Cling to it long enough, and not a doubt\n     It will turn true again, for so it goes.\n     Most of the change we think we see in life\n     Is due to truths being in and out of favor.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so I say, fundamentally there has been no change in the teaching of the Savior to his\ndisciples.  As he met with them in Galilee after his resurrection, he said: \n<\/p><p>\nAll power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.\n<\/p><p>\nGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and\nof the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: \n<\/p><p>\nTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am\nwith you alway, even unto the end of the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34744\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34744)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34744)\">Matt. 28:18-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere has been no change in that. It may have been in and out of favor, but fundamentally\nthere has been no change.  All power was given him, and he conferred it on his disciples; the\nsame power is with us today.\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Moyle referred to the teachings of Peter on the Day of Pentecost, and I quote only\npart of it: \n<\/p><p>\nRepent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission\nof sins . . . (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7736\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7736)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7736)\">Acts 2:38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThese people were pricked in their hearts, and they wondered what they should do, and they\ncried with one accord, \"Men and brethren, what shall we do?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7734\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7734)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7734)\">Acts 2:37<\/a><\/span>). They had been\ntaught the divine mission of Jesus Christ, Jesus and him crucified; and the Holy Ghost rested\nupon them; the gift of tongues was with them; they understood each other and they\nunderstood the Apostle Peter, although there were assembled peoples of many nations, and\nPeter said to them,\n<\/p><p>\nRepent, and be baptized every one of you . . . for the remission of [your] sins . . .\n<\/p><p>\nThen he went on to say, \"For the promise is unto you.\" The promise of what?  That the Holy\nGhost would come to them if they rendered obedience!\n<\/p><p>\nFor the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as\nmany as the lord our God shall call\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7738\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7738)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7738)\">Acts 2:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere has been no change in that, my brethren and sisters.  And in this day the instructions\nare the same.\n<\/p><p>\nSend forth the elders of my church unto the nations which are afar off; unto the\nislands of the sea; send forth unto foreign lands; call upon all nations, first upon the\nGentiles, and then upon the Jews\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13431\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13431)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13431)\">D&amp;C 133:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe same teachings, a truth that may have been in and out of favor, but an eternal truth, just\nthe same. So today we have in the Church the responsibility, and that responsibility is made\nmore apparent as we think of the great missionary system of the Church&mdash;we have the\nresponsibility of preaching the gospel, and an added obligation to that which was given the\ndisciples of the Savior, that of preaching the restored gospel, the same gospel but reaffirmed\nin this day, because in the minds of men it was for a time in and out of favor, but the truth\nhas not changed; it is eternal.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, in harmony with that, in the very beginning of this work, the Prophet Joseph called\nmissionaries who were sent to various parts of the United States and then later to Great\nBritain and other countries. The record of their work and conversions is impressive and ever\nwill be an inspiration to those who read of it and who are engaged in preaching the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nThen there was a lull for a time; the Saints came west; and missionary work was seemingly at\na standstill, but not for long.  Within two years or less after the Saints had settled in these\nvalleys, Elder John Taylor was sent to England as a missionary and then to France. In\naddition to the commission to preach the gospel, he was given the mission of seeking out\nsome industry that could be brought to this country and established among our people in the\nwest that would help them economically. It was through the efforts of Brother Taylor that the\nsugar industry was finally brought here to the West.  That is a story of itself.\n<\/p><p>\nBut incident to this work that Brother Taylor performed, he baptized some very important\npeople.  You know, we are a little inclined to think that our efforts are seemingly of no avail. \nPerhaps some of our missionaries feel that way. I know I came home from my mission\nfeeling that I had not accomplished much, that perhaps I had only baptized one or two.  We\nnever know the extent of the good we have done.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the labors of Brother Taylor he found men like Elias Morris, the father of Elder George Q.\nMorris who sits here on the stand, and President John R. Winder.  He probably little realized\nwhat it would mean to the work of the Lord to bring men into the Church of the stature of\nElias Morris, John R. Winder, and others.\n<\/p><p>\nI was visiting a stake in California not long ago, and the wife of one of the presidents of the\nstakes told me this story.  She labored under President Callis in the Southern States Mission,\nand she said Brother Callis related this incident to them as he visited the stake after he had\nbeen called to the Council of the Twelve.  Brother Callis was converted over in Wales and\nwas baptized as a small boy into the Church.  As he was visiting a stake of Zion, he learned\nthat an old man whom he had known in the mission field was ill.  Brother Callis called on\nhim. He found him cynical.  Brother Callis tried to encourage him.  The man seemed to be\nbeyond encouragement.  Then Brother Callis said, \"John, do you not remember your\nmissionary labors in Wales? Do you not remember the good you did in the mission field?\"\n\"Oh, I didn't do any good,\" he said.  \"Didn't you ever baptize anyone?\" \"No, not that I\nremember.\" Brother Callis said, \"Are you sure?\" \"Oh,\" he said, \"I baptized a little urchin that\nused to bother us in our meetings.\" Then Brother Callis said, \"Brother John, do you know\nthat I was that little urchin?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThink of the importance of that one baptism!  Think of the great work of Brother Callis\nduring his thirty years of service in the Southern States Mission and then his great work as\none of the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nI repeat again, my brethren and sisters, we never know the results of our work.  We never\nknow what we accomplish.  Some of us never will live to see it, to sense it.  But after all is\nsaid and done, we may sow, and we may water, but God gives the increase and that increase\nmounts little by little like a little stone cut out of the mountain without hands, and it rolls\nforth and ultimately will fill the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, the other thought, and then my time is up.  It was my privilege to be down in Honolulu\nat the time President McKay and Sister McKay and Brother Murdock were there, one of the\noutstanding experiences of my life.  As we met in meetings in Honolulu, in the Oahu Stake\nconference, Sunday, we had three assemblies.  At one of them we had nearly four thousand\npeople present. All nations, all people of the Polynesian Islands were represented: Hawaiians,\nSamoans, Maoris, Tahitians.  We had a Samoan choir of a hundred people sing, beautifully,\non Sunday morning and then Sunday afternoon an Hawaiian choir.  I have never heard more\nimpressive music.\n<\/p><p>\nIn that assembly were Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, and I repeat again, people from all\nnations.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren and sisters, as I looked over that assembly I thought, here is an example of the\ngospel being preached to all nations.  The gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is ultimately to\nleaven the lump (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23244\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23244)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23244)\">Gal. 5:9<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Lord promised that an angel should fly through the midst of heaven,\npreaching the everlasting gospel to every nation that dwells upon the earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42250\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42250)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42250)\">Rev. 14:6<\/a><\/span>), and then he said\nthe end should come.  He did not mean the end of peoples, he meant the end of wickedness,\nthe end of unrighteousness.  And I thought I saw reflected in that assembly the purposes of\nthe Almighty being accomplished&mdash;no hatred, no animosities, no class prejudices, no racial\nhatreds, but all assembled under one great banner, of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and\ndedicated to one holy purpose!\n<\/p><p>\nAs you think of that with me, can you not see how ultimately peace will come to the\nworld?  And it will only come through the gospel of the Son of God, his great message of\neternal truth, and it is our responsibility, my brethren and sisters, to proclaim it.\n<\/p><p>\nAs one visits the missions of the Church, he becomes impressed more than ever with the need\nof our fulfilling the purposes for which the Lord has placed us here, bearing witness of the\ngospel as it has been restored in this day, not preaching anything new, not changes, merely\nchanges because men perchance have changed in their own minds, but the eternal truths being\nthe same.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God help us to fulfil our obligation in this great work, I pray in the name of Jesus.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
