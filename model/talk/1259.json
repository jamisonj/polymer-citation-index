Sill<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Sterling W. Sill, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1963, pp. 40-43<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMany years ago someone published a picture Bible in which it was attempted to make the\ngreat scriptural messages more memorable, by presenting them in visual form. Our natural\ntendency is to see things more clearly when they are presented in pictures. Mere ideas are\noften too abstract for the mind to deal with effectively.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the visual portrayals in this interesting Bible was a colored picture of the ascension. It\nshowed the Resurrected Jesus standing in the air above the Mount of Olives as he was\nascending to his Father. And standing slightly below the master were two angels dressed in\nwhite clothing. Over the years I have drawn great strength from the thrilling ideas represented\nby this picture. Christ's ascension to heaven marked the end of an important period. He had\nfinished one part of the work assigned to him in the grand council of heaven. He had\norganized the Church and had left ordained apostles to carry on its work. He had taught them\nthe doctrines of salvation and had given them the priesthood, with the power to bind in\nheaven what they did on earth. He had shed his own blood to pay the penalty of our sins.\nThen in the last words spoken just before his ascension, Jesus said to the Twelve \". . . ye\nshall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the\nuttermost part of the earth\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7909\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7909)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7909)\">Acts 1:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe ascension picture is completed by the interesting scriptural statement which said, \"And\nwhen he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received\nhim out of their sight.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by\nthem in white apparel; \n<\/p><p>\n\"Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus,\nwhich is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go\ninto heaven\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7910\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7910)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7910)\">Acts 1:9-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nDuring World War II, I added another impressive mental picture to my collection. This one\nshows General Douglas MacArthur about to take flight from Corregidor under the military\npressure of Japanese conquest. To those who were forced to remain behind, General\nMacArthur said, \"I shall return.\" I like to imagine the hope that this promise must have\nbrought to the people of the Philippines during those long months in which they awaited their\nliberation from the bondage of the Japanese. They knew that MacArthur would not forget.\nThey knew that just as soon as possible he would come back to set them free and punish their\noppressors. His promise may have had more than ordinary significance to\nme, inasmuch as some of the members of my own family were among those awaiting\nMacArthur's return. They hid in the hills until they were captured and sent to a Japanese\nconcentration camp in Manila.\n<\/p><p>\nThe general's promise to return must have had a disturbing significance for the invaders\nthemselves, for they must have known that MacArthur would never rest until they had been\ndriven from the islands or annihilated during their resistance. This \"I shall return\" picture was\ngiven its happy ending some two years later when the general's promise was finally and fully\nkept.\n<\/p><p>\nHowever, the world still awaits this more significant \"I shall return\" promise that had been\nmade some nineteen hundred years earlier from above the Mount of Olives. It is very\nimportant to remember that the Savior of the world was only bidding the earth and its people\na temporary farewell. Many times before his death, he himself had foretold his own glorious\nsecond coming to judge the world.\n<\/p><p>\nOn that last Tuesday before his death on Friday, Jesus had been teaching his followers about\nhis second coming. Near the end of the day he left the temple and led the Twelve across the\nMount of Olives. As he sat down to rest near the summit, his disciples said to him, \". . . Tell\nus, when shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and the end of the\nworld?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35273\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35273)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35273)\">Matt. 24:3<\/a><\/span>).\nThen Jesus told them of the wars and contentions that should\ncharacterize the last days, and as one of the important signs that should precede his second\ncoming, he said, \"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a\nwitness unto all nations; and then shall the end come\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35277\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35277)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35277)\">Matt. 24:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs the people of the Philippines awaited their liberation, they probably wondered whether or\nnot General MacArthur had the ability to fulfil the conditions involved in his promise to\nreturn. There are also a great many in our world who discount both the possibility and the\nprobability of the second coming of Christ. Yet we may be certain that God's program has\nnever been abandoned and will not be forgotten.\n<\/p><p>\nIn those last sad hours just prior to his death, Jesus said to his disciples, \"Let not your heart\nbe troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.\n<\/p><p>\n\"In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to\nprepare a place for you.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And if I go and prepare a place for you, <i>I will come again<\/i>, and receive you unto myself; that\nwhere I am, there ye may be also\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28081\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28081)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28081)\">John 14:1-3<\/a><\/span>), italics added).\nWhat a thrilling, frightening\nthought when we understand the conditions under which he will come again. And what\ntremendous consequences are involved in the message of ascension day. As the Resurrected\nSon of God stood there between the heavens and the earth, holy angels from God's presence\nmade a firm promise, that he would personally return. The angels said, \". . . this same Jesus .\n. . shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7911\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7911)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7911)\">Acts 1:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSince ascension day,\nsome nineteen wide centuries have come and gone, and many important events have taken\nplace. According to tradition with one exception, the apostles that Jesus appointed to carry on\nhis work, were all subjected to violent deaths. Peter, Philip, Simon, and Andrew were\ncrucified; James and Paul were beheaded; Bartholomew was flayed alive; Thomas was run\nthrough with a lance; James, the son of Alphaeus, was beaten to death; Thaddaeus was shot\nthrough with arrows; Barnabas was stoned; Matthew was slain with a battle axe in Ethiopia;\nand Mark was dragged to death in the streets of Alexandria. Then John, the sole survivor,\nwas banished to the lonely isle of Patmos in the Aegean Sea. Jesus had built his Church upon\nthe foundation of apostles and prophets. When the foundation was destroyed, the building\ncrumbled. In time what had once been a divine organization became merely a human\ninstitution. Many of the Christian doctrines were misinterpreted; the ordinances were changed;\nthe authority was lost; the apostasy grew; and the world slipped gradually into the long black\nnight of the Dark Ages. Then some said that the heavens were forever\nsealed, that the canon of scripture was full, and that no voice from God would ever again be\nheard upon the earth. The spirit of those who crucified Christ, destroyed his organization, and\ndisbelieved his doctrines, still have a numerous following among us.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the most serious problems of our present world is that there are so many people who\ndisbelieve in a Supreme Being. To some, man is the highest authority and the greatest\nintelligence in the universe. Others believe that God has gone out of business and that the last\nwords that we will ever hear from the Savior of the world were spoken at the ninth hour of\nthat awful Friday afternoon, when from Calvary's cross the dying Christ said, \"It is finished\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28091\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28091)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28091)\">John 19:30<\/a><\/span>).\nThe last memory that some have of their Redeemer pictures him hanging upon the cross.\nRecently the world has been flooded with the crucifix, but Jesus did not remain upon the\ncross. Some remember him lying in the garden tomb of Joseph of Arimathaea, but Jesus did\nnot remain in the tomb. Nothing in the scriptures could be plainer than the fact that the life of\nChrist did not begin in Bethlehem, neither did it end on Calvary. He said, \"I came forth from\nthe Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28088\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28088)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28088)\">John 16:28<\/a><\/span>).\nIn his prayer in Gethsemane while contemplating his own death, he said, \"And now,\nO Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the\nworld was\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28090\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28090)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28090)\">John 17:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLong before our earth was created, Jesus lived and ruled with his Father as a part of the\npresidency of the universe. Under the direction of the Father, he was the Creator of the earth.\nIn the first chapter of Genesis, God is recorded as saying, \". . . Let <i>us<\/i> make man in <i>our<\/i>\nimage, after <i>our<\/i> likeness\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23684\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23684)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23684)\">Gen. 1:26<\/a><\/span>, italics added).\nThe use of these plural pronouns\nindicates that the Son also took part in the creation. But even then he was no novice as a\nCreator. In one of the great revelations given to Moses and revealed anew in the latter days,\nGod said, \"And worlds without number have I created; . . . and by the Son I created them,\nwhich is mine Only Begotten\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39175\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39175)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39175)\">Moses 2:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe think of greatness partly in terms of what it has already accomplished and partly in terms\nof what it promises for the future. As I rerun my mental picture of ascension day, I like to\nthink of the Redeemer in terms of his tremendous background. Not only had he created\nworlds without number, but in his pre-mortal existence he was that magnificent personage of\ngreat authority and power known in the scriptures as Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac,\nand Jacob. He was the first Begotten Son of God in the spirit and was chosen to be the Savior\nof the world because he was the best qualified for that important calling. Then as a part of his\nown progression, he took upon himself a body of flesh and bones, and became the Only\nBegotten Son of God in the flesh. There are some who discount the value of a body so far as\neternity is concerned. There are those who in their teachings seek to deprive God of his body.\nMany do not believe in their own resurrection. But next to the human spirit the human body\nis the most marvelous of God's creations. If the body was not necessary, God would never\nhave created it in the first place. If it was not necessary for eternity, God would never have\ninstituted the resurrection. If a body was not necessary for God the Father, certainly there\nwould have been no reason why God the Son should have been resurrected. The spirit and the\nbody inseparably connected constitutes the soul. The spirit can never be perfect without the\nbody. There can never be a fulness of joy until the spirit and the body are inseparably joined\ntogether (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14319\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14319)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14319)\">D&amp;C 93:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Resurrected, Glorified Jesus, like Elohim, his Eternal Father, has a body of flesh and\nbones as tangible as man's (see (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14350\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14350)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14350)\">D&amp;C 130:22<\/a><\/span>).\nWhen Jesus appeared to the eleven after his\nresurrection, they were frightened and supposed that they had seen a spirit. Jesus corrected\nthem by saying, \"Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a\nspirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31611\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31611)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31611)\">Luke 24:39<\/a><\/span>).\nJesus did not lose his body\nafter his resurrection. In some mysterious way it did not evaporate, neither\ndid it expand to fill the immensity of space. Jesus had his body as he ascended to his Father\nfrom the Mount of Olives, and the record is perfectly clear that he will still have that same\nbody when he comes in glory to judge the world.\n<\/p><p>\nIn addition to the information given in the Bible, we now have some new evidence of\nuniversal importance which has been given to the world on this subject in our own day. In the\nearly spring of 1820, in upper New York state, God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ\nreappeared upon the earth to re-establish among men a belief in the God of Genesis, a belief\nin the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and a belief in the God of Mount Olivet. The\nProphet Joseph Smith describes his part of this experience by saying, \". . . I saw two\npersonages whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One\nof them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other&mdash;<i>This is My<\/i>\n<i>Beloved Son. Hear Him!<\/i>\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30435\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30435)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30435)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>).\nThen there followed the great message of the restoration.\n<\/p><p>\nThe same Jesus who healed the sick and walked upon the waves has spoken again in our day\nand has reaffirmed the fact that he is still interested in our success. The same Jesus said to his\ndisciples, \". . . Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\n<\/p><p>\n\"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33166\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33166)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33166)\">Mark 16:15-16<\/a><\/span>).\nThis same Jesus has informed us anew that he has not changed his mind\nabout the importance of this and the other great Christian doctrines.\n<\/p><p>\nThe same Jesus who upon the Mount of Olives said, \"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be\npreached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35278\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35278)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35278)\">Matt. 24:14<\/a><\/span>), has,\nunder the direction of his Father, restored <i>that<\/i> gospel, in preparation for <i>that<\/i> day. He himself\nlooked forward to that day saying, \"For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father\nwith his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35262\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35262)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35262)\">Matt. 16:27<\/a><\/span>).\nWhat a tremendous day that will be. That is also the day foretold by Malachi who said \"For\nbehold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do\nwickedly shall burn as stubble; for they that come shall burn them, saith the Lord of Hosts,\nthat it shall leave them neither root nor branch\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30445\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30445)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30445)\">JS&mdash;H 1:37<\/a><\/span>). That tremendous event\nis fast approaching, and we must work while it is called today, for the night cometh, wherein\nno man can work (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28070\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28070)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28070)\">John 9:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to bear to you my personal witness that God has not gone out of business, that\nthe heavens are not sealed, that the Redeemer of man has not forgotten his promises, nor is he\nany less interested in our welfare now than when in Gethsemane and upon Mount Calvary he\nsuffered for our sins. And to close, I would again like to take you out to the sacred top of the\nMount of Olives, and again hear the angels say, \". . . this same Jesus, which is taken up from\nyou into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7912\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7912)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7912)\">Acts 1:11<\/a><\/span>).\nMay God help us to be ready for that important event I pray in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
