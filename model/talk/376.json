I wonder if when the boy is ordained a\ndeacon the father lets him feel that he has something now that is eternally important.\n<\/p><p>\nCONTRASTING WARD SITUATIONS\n<\/p><p>\nI remember hearing upon one occasion of two wards, side by side, with about an equal\npopulation. One of the bishops made it a point to visit the homes of the members of his flock\nwhen a child was born, and when the time came for it to be blessed in the fast meeting he\nwas on hand to encourage the parents that their child might receive a blessing. As the children\ngrew a little older he taught both the girls and the boys that there would be a blessing come\nto them if they would go to Primary and to Sunday School.\n<\/p><p>\nHe made them want to be baptized when they were eight years of age, both the boys and the\ngirls. When the boys were nearly old enough to be ordained deacons he had talked with them\nand made them feel that they could be ordained deacons. He was another father. He followed\nall those families through life and it was said of the ward that every boy and every girl were\nmarried in the temple and many of them went on missions.\n<\/p><p>\nThe ward that adjoined this one had another kind of bishop. He was busy. He did not have\ntime to follow up. He let his counselors do that. It was proper that his counselors should do\npart of it but the difference was noted by the stake presidency, that in the one ward all of the\nyoung people, almost without exception, were faithful, took advantage of their opportunities,\nwere prepared and taught beforehand the importance of what they were to receive, while in\nthe other ward if the parents did not teach the children they were not taught except in a\nmediocre way, and the result was that the majority of those young people grew up, not\nparticularly interested in the church.\n<\/p><p>\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF A BISHOP\n<\/p><p>\nNow, I mention this because a father of a ward, a bishop, has a great responsibility. I do not\nmean that the father of the child and the mother of the child do not have a responsibility. It is\ntheir duty and their responsibility, but what a wonderful addition to the life of these young\npeople when they feel that the bishop recognizes them on the street, goes out of his way to\nencourage them to do what they ought to do. There is not anything that the children will not\ndo for a bishop of that kind.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember, as if it were yesterday, when John Tingey placed his hands on my head and\nordained me a deacon. I had the matter so presented to me and the importance of it, that I felt\nit was a great honor. The result was, it was a blessing to me, and then after awhile other\nordinations came to me. But in each case the foundation was laid in my mind that here was\nan opportunity for another blessing, and I want to suggest to you fathers who are here tonight,\nthere is no time that you can spend, no way in which you can utilize your time that will be of\ngreater advantage than training your boys and your girls to be worthy of the blessings of our\nHeavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nFAILURE OF PARENTS\n<\/p><p>\nOnly a few weeks ago a good woman came into my office, a daughter of one of the most\nprominent men that ever has been in the church. She said: \"I cannot understand why my\nchildren do not have any interest in the church.\" She continued, \"I have talked to them and\nexplained to them what they ought to do.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI went back in my mind, and I was not unkind enough to say to her, \"What did you do with\nthem when they were younger?\" I did not read to her that scripture, Section 68 of the D&amp;C,\nwhich says:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes, which are organized, that\nteach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living\nGod, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight\nyears old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12471\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12471)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12471)\">D&amp;C 68:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI do not know all the facts in regard to that family but I do know that they spent considerable\nof their time unmindful of their growing children, and I am wondering if by now, (the father\nis gone and the mother is still living), I am wondering now if she looked back and took into\naccount what the father and mother did if it would not explain why these children now do not\nhave much faith.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, brethren, as fathers, as brothers, as associates, as neighbors, why not lay up treasures\nin heaven by going out of our way and encouraging these young people to do what the Lord\nwould have them do, so that as they grow up it will be natural for them to do the things that\nour Heavenly Father would like them to do.\n<\/p><p>\nHISTORY OF JERUSALEM\n<\/p><p>\nReference has been made tonight to Jerusalem. I think the story of Jerusalem is one of the\nmost pathetic of all the stories we hear. A city that had every advantage; a city that had\nwithin its walls those that the Lord himself claimed. They were his children and he still\nclaims them. But a city that was so selfish, and the leadership of which was so careless, that\nthe population of the city grew up in wickedness, not one group, but generation after\ngeneration, and the city was destroyed repeatedly although the Lord did everything he could\nby means of his prophets to train them that they could have been preserved.        \n<\/p><p>\nThere was one time when they were preserved. It showed how the power of the Lord could\nbe made manifest. The city was surrounded and the plans were being made, and the Army\noutside made its threat, but a prophet went to the Lord and said, \"These people need your\nhelp. They are repentant and will you not help them. They are helpless. They are surrounded\nby their enemy,\" and the next morning when daylight came a very large portion of the army\noutside was dead (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3174\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3174)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3174)\">2 Kgs. 19:14-35<\/a><\/span>).\nThe power of the Lord had been made manifest in that case and the city\nwas preserved.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is marvelous what the Lord has done in that regard, but I am thinking of Jerusalem today.\nAfter all these years and experience after experience, it is a battleground, and one of the most\nundesirable places to be living that you can think of in all the world. But there will come a\nchange. Repentance will come and when that repentance comes and is accepted by the Lord,\nJerusalem will be redeemed.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was redeemed once, you will remember, after being in bondage seventy years. The Lord\nhad told the prophet Jeremiah that Jerusalem would be destroyed and its people would be in\nbondage seventy years (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26469\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26469)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26469)\">Jer. 25:11-12<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26470\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26470)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26470)\">Jer. 29:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFREEDOM FROM BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY\n<\/p><p>\nOne hundred years before Cyrus, the general who captured Babylon, was born, the Lord\nrevealed to the Prophet Isaiah that Cyrus should be his servant and say unto Jerusalem that it\nshould be rebuilt (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25077\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25077)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25077)\">Isa. 44:28<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25078\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25078)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25078)\">Isa. 45:1<\/a><\/span>). Babylon at that time was the greatest city in all the world, and was thought\nto be impregnable. Cyrus was not a Jew. Cyrus did not understand the old Testament, nor did\nhe know of the part he was to play in the freeing of the captive Jews and rebuilding\nJerusalem.\n<\/p><p>\nWhile Cyrus was besieging the city of Babylon the great king, Belshazzar of Babylon and his\nassociates were using the sacred vessels that had been taken from the house of the Lord in\nJerusalem to drink from (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10601\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10601)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10601)\">Dan. 5:1-31<\/a><\/span>).\nIt was a great debauch, and suddenly in the midst of it was seen a\nhand writing on the wall these words, \"Me-ne, Me-ne, Tekel, U-phar-sin,\" and they could not\nread it (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10602\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10602)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10602)\">Dan. 5:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Queen said to the King, \"There is a Hebrew prophet among us. He can tell you what it\nmeans.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so they went out and brought Daniel in and when Daniel saw the handwriting on the\nwall he could read it. It was not difficult for him. He was the servant of the Lord. He had the\npriesthood and he had honored it in a most marvelous way all down through his life.\n<\/p><p>\nThe king and others felt perfectly secure, feeling that with food and provisions, and a river of\nwater running through the city, not anything could come in to disturb them, and yet on that\nwall were written the words which, when interpreted, read, \"You have been weighed in the\nbalance and found wanting, and your kingdom will be divided among the Medes and the\nPersians.\" At that very hour \"my servant Cyrus\" had diverted the river that went through the\ncity from its channel and his army entered under the wall, which wall was so high that it\ncould not be scaled or destroyed with any means or weapons that they had, and so wide that\nseveral chariots could ride abreast on the top.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen that gentile, if we may use that term, that alien to those that had had the priesthood and\nthe blessings of the Lord, the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, realized that the Lord\nhad given him Babylon, he issued a proclamation freeing the Jewish captives and returning\nthem to rebuild their city of Jerusalem. He not only took his own army and his own people\nbut he gave them means to use in payment to the workers.\n<\/p><p>\nPRESENT CONDITION OF JEWS\n<\/p><p>\nI mention this because of the predicament Jerusalem is in tonight. Think of the condition the\nJews find themselves in, wherever they are in all the world. I want to say to you that some of\nthe best people that have ever lived were the Hebrew race and they were examples in many\ninstances but they, in some cases, lost their faith and turned away. I want to say that some of\nthe best men and women that we have had in Salt Lake City were Jews. I hope that the\nLatter-day Saints will not forget, will not fall into the habit that people have who hate the\nJews because of their prosperity, and sometimes hate them for other reasons; that they will\nnot fall into the habit of condemning a nation, condemning all those people, without\nremembering a circumstance that happened in the British Parliament.\n<\/p><p>\nDISRAELI'S ANSWER\n<\/p><p>\nThere was an argument going on between a great Hebrew, Benjamin Disraeli, who was the\nPrime Minister of England, and a man who was a noted arguer in the House of Lords, and\nwhen he could no longer answer the Jew, then he began to taunt him with being a Jew. He\nsaid: \"Yes, you are only a Jew anyhow.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then Disraeli arose and said: \"This man has taunted me with being a Jew. I am a Jew and\nI am proud of it. And when the forebears of this man were fighting like wild beasts for their\nmates, my people were laying the foundation for the literature of the world.\" That was his\nanswer.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then one more, and I hope we will all remember it. \"When this man and those he loves\nbow in prayer, everything they ask for, they ask for in the name of Jesus Christ, a Jew.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI am stressing that tonight, although I did not expect to when I got on my feet because of the\nhatred that sometimes grows in men's hearts and we fail to see the virtues of others. Brethren,\nin the midst of these political campaigns such as we are having now, for goodness sake do not\nstoop to criticizing and finding fault unfairly and unjustly with those who do not believe the\nsame as you do in politics. Let us be real Latter-day Saints,&mdash;not make believes&mdash;and see the\nvirtues of the others. There is virtue in both camps.\n<\/p><p>\nThink of Jerusalem, tonight. Think of the predicament of that great people who have\nmaintained their integrity as a nation, as individuals, as a race, as few others in the world\nhave done. It has been marvelous to me, but see how pitiable their situation is now, and if all\nthe people of the world were righteous and they were in transgression, there would be hope\nfor them because our Heavenly Father has insisted, in his advice and counsel to the world,\nthat \"Jerusalem shall be redeemed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25080\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25080)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25080)\">Isa. 52:9<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12527\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12527)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12527)\">D&amp;C 109:62<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBLESSINGS PREDICATED ON RIGHTEOUSNESS\n<\/p><p>\nWe do not have to go so far away. What about America? I was in a meeting, not very long\nago, where a group of Boy Scouts stood and sang, \"God Bless America,\" and they sang it\nbeautifully, and all the time they were singing I asked myself the question, \"How can he bless\nAmerica until America repents?\" Every great blessing that we desire is promised us by our\nHeavenly Father on condition that we honor him and keep his commandments. Praying is not\nsufficient. Not only must we pray but we must live to be worthy of the blessing.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the midst of the upheavals of the world&mdash;I almost hesitate to open the newspaper and see\nthe headlines of all the articles because so many of them are in large type and so often they\nindicate that the danger of another war confronts us.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, why did the Lord gather us out from the nations of the earth? Why did he not leave\nus in all the other lands? Why did he call our forebears to leave the comforts of home and the\nopportunities and blessings of civilization, such as it was, to come way out here into the tops\nof these everlasting hills, to settle these sterile desert plains, in many cases? Why? He knew\nwhat we needed. He knew that his people would have to keep his commandments if they were\nto endure, and like the time when the crickets came and were about to devour the crops, and\nstarvation stared our people in the face, there were those among them who knew there was a\nway out. They did not know what it was, but then they began to pray. They had done\neverything else to destroy the pests, but when they began to pray there came into the western\nsky big flocks of seagulls, and they came in and began to devour the crickets.\n<\/p><p>\nDo you suppose that would have happened if those people had been wicked, if they had been\nimmoral, if they had been drunken, if they had been violators of the commandments of God?\nI cannot believe it would have occurred, but I believe that among those people were some of\nthe finest men and women that have ever lived upon the earth, and for that reason the Lord\npreserved their crops.\n<\/p><p>\nFAITH REWARDED IN BEAR RIVER\n<\/p><p>\nThen there was a circumstance up here on the Bear River. For ten years the frost had taken\ntheir crops every year. People had to go out of the valley for their breadstuffs. They could\nraise hay and cattle but they could not mature their food crops. And the President of the\nChurch and his brethren went up there to hold conference. And when they were coming, O\nhow the people prayed that the President of the Church, the prophet of the Lord, would\nrebuke the curse that seemed to be upon that land, that they might raise their harvest.\n<\/p><p>\nThere may be quite a number of people from that stake here tonight because there are a lot of\nfine people who live there now.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd their conference was held&mdash;two days of conference. And the brethren had all talked. Not\na word was said about their distress; not anything was said to them to encourage them that\nconditions would be better. The benediction was pronounced and the people were going out,\nand all at once the President stood up and he said: \"Call the people back. I have something to\nsay to them.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThey came back and took their seats, and he said: \"Now, you people have been faithful. You\nhave not run away from here. You stayed. You have tilled the ground. You have done your\nbest and every year you have lost your harvest of grain. The Lord knows what you need, and\nI can say to you that from this time forth you shall raise your crop.\"\n<\/p><p>\nImagine after ten years, but they have raised a crop in that valley ever since.  These things are\nnot accidents, my brethren. The authority of the priesthood, properly exercised, brings to our\nminds the fact that we are not very far from the Lord and he is all-powerful and he is\nall-merciful. If we repent of our foolishness and turn to him, he will hear and answer our\nprayers.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, bishops, I was sorry that I could not be with you last night. Bishop Richards, I think\nI owe an apology right from the stand here. I went home last night after the meeting and went\nto bed just as soon as I could get there after the afternoon meeting, because I wanted to come\ndown to your meeting. But when the time came to dress and come down, I got up and I was\nso weak I did not dare to come. I did not dress. I went back to bed, and I missed your fine\nmeeting. But I wanted to be there and I am sure you had a happy time.\n<\/p><p>\nOFFICE OF A BISHOP\n<\/p><p>\nI want to say this to the bishops. There is no position in the Church that will bring a greater\nblessing to any man than the office of a bishop, if he will honor that office and be a real\nfather to the flock over whom he is called to preside. Do not forget that. He can go into the\nhome, not to scold and find fault and criticize, but he can go like a loving grandfather, if I\nmay use that term, and the family will pay attention, if he is wise, and he can gather them\naround him. And if he can only get his ward teachers to help him, there could be a great\nchange in some of the wards of this church.\n<\/p><p>\nI am pleading with you, my brethren. Do not be satisfied with just going to the door and\nsaying: \"We want to know if everything is all right,\" and go your way. That is not the duty.\nThat is not the way a ward teacher should operate, but every bishop should have under his\ndirection men, young men, middle-aged men and old men, who will go into the homes, not\napologizing for breaking into the house, but going as ward teachers.\n<\/p><p>\nWARD TEACHING\n<\/p><p>\nRodney Badger was a teacher in my father's home for years, and a great man. Whenever he\ncame the family met and he sat and asked us questions and told us the things that he thought\nwe ought to understand. And I want to tell you that when he came into our home he brought\nthe spirit of the Lord with him. And when he went  out we felt we had had a visit from a\nservant of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us try and see if we cannot improve our ward teaching, brethren. Surely, in some cases, it\nis pitiable, because the Lord has given us all the power and authority and the ability to go\ninto the homes and draw his sons and daughters nearer to him. But we often feel that we are\nso busy with other things we cannot do it.\n<\/p><p>\nBLESSINGS PROMISED BISHOPS\n<\/p><p>\nI am not complaining. I know what a difficult thing it is to be a bishop. I have been in the\nhomes of many bishops and I have ordained a good many, and I have followed them and seen\nwhat their experiences were; they have a very great responsibility, and it takes a lot of their\ntime. But I want to say to you that there is no bishop, nor has there been a bishop in the\nChurch, who has given the time, that the Lord expected him to give in looking after the flock\nand teaching his people and preparing them to do the work, that has not received one hundred\npercent of the blessings that he labored for, and they will extend to him throughout the ages\nof eternity.          \n<\/p><p>\nHe may not have had wealth, may not have had distinction. He may not have had the honor\nof presiding over clubs and things of that kind, but if he has done his duty as a bishop, he has\nbeen hand in hand with the Father of us all, and everything that he has done to bless his kind\nis laid up as a treasure in heaven and nobody can take the blessing from him.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us see if we cannot improve that, brethren.      \n<\/p><p>\nAs well as some of us have done, let us see if we cannot do better.\n<\/p><p>\nFALSE TEACHERS\n<\/p><p>\nThere is one little item here that has been called to our attention. In some of our wards, in\norder to draw the congregations and bring more people out, our bishops, and in some cases,\nour auxiliary organization leaders, go out and find somebody to come and deliver a lecture in\nthe Sunday night meeting. Sometimes men are invited they do not know anything about and\nsometimes those men say things that are not what should be said in the meeting.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are two Indians that are working now among our people and they are being invited\nfrom ward to ward and they are going in and telling stories, and they dress up with their\nfeathers and costumes that are attractive to young people, and we are informed that they teach\nthings that are foreign to what we believe and what the Lord wants us to have our people\nbelieve.\n<\/p><p>\nBishops, and leaders of organizations, protect your people from those who would teach them\nthings that would be harmful to them. There are some of the finest people in the world that\nare Indians. Those men that I am talking about now may have many good traits of character,\nbut right now they are going among our people and saying and doing things that will do harm\nand will all have to be set aside, because they are not telling that which is true. So, we would\nlike you tonight to pass that on in your wards, and stakes, you stake presidents and the\nbishops that are here, and in whatever you do, protect your people in the ward from those that\nyou do not know anything about and who will seek an opportunity to come in and talk to the\npeople when they should not be permitted to do so, because they are not teaching that which\nwould be helpful to the people.\n<\/p><p>\nHONOR THE SABBATH\n<\/p><p>\nAnother thing, brethren, our bishops and our stake presidents can have a tremendous influence\nin bringing the people of their wards and stakes to feel that they must honor the Sabbath day.\nHonoring the Sabbath day and keeping it holy is a commandment of our Heavenly Father. Six\ndays he has given us to do about as we please, as long as we do not do wrong, but on the\nseventh, he  said, \"The seventh is the Sabbath of the Lord Thy God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22587\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22587)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22587)\">Ex. 20:8-11<\/a><\/span>). He has advised us to do\nno work, neither our animals, nor the stranger within our gates, and he has promised us\nblessings if we will do what we ought to do.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, it is not an insignificant thing to violate the Sabbath day. I want to say that you lose\nevery time you violate the Sabbath day, you lose more than you can gain, no matter what you\nmay think you are going to gain, but your boys and girls sometimes do not understand that.\nTeach it to them. Teach them that their homes may be the abiding place of prayer.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember when I was a child, living right across the street from here and the boys would\ncome over to our place on Sunday after Sunday School, and I was like the boys, I thought it\nwould be lots of fun to play ball and to play other games. But I had a wonderful mother. She\ndid not say, \"You cannot do it,\" but she did say: \"Son, you will be happier if you do not do\nthat. Let the boys go home and read a good book.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHOME TRAINING\n<\/p><p>\nI want to tell you I am grateful for that kind of training in the home, but there are places\nwhere the children are turned loose and they are not guarded and they are not protected and\nthey are not trained, and the result is, not only do they lose the blessing that would be\neternally advantageous to them, but they cross to the devil's side of the line, and the first\nthing you know they do things that they should not do.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to say that just as soon as we go into the devil's territory we are in his power, and our\nsafety is on the Lord's side of the line, and the Lord's side of the line is on the side of the\nTen Commandments and the other commandments that the Lord has given, and we can easily\ntell what they are.\n<\/p><p>\nPROTECTION OF YOUNG WOMEN\n<\/p><p>\nQuite a number of our young people are leaving home in the country settlements and coming\nhere to Salt Lake City. Our young girls are coming, and when they come if they are not in\nhomes that will protect them, not under the supervision of good women, they are in great\ndanger. If I were living in some of the outlying settlements, knowing what I know, if I had a\nprecious daughter I never would let her come to Salt Lake City without a guardian, no matter\nhow good she was. If I let her come at all I would be sure that she was properly safeguarded\nand chaperoned and helped.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, pass that word around. It is such an attractive thing for these girls to come where\nthe bright lights are, and the papers are always telling what is going on here, but their eternal\nhappiness may be destroyed by falling into the hands of some wicked, careless boy or man.\nAnd when they are ruined it is too late then to begin to say, \"I wish we had not done it.\"\nSafeguard them, please, as far as you can, and when they come to the city and you know they\nare coming, you bishops send word here. You can send word or find out what ward they go\ninto and you can write the bishops direct. If there is no other way, write the Young Women's\nMutual Improvement Association and give the addresses of these girls, and they will help to\ntake care of them. They will do a wonderful job for you and help to save those that are more\nprecious than gold.\n<\/p><p>\nWATCHCARE NEEDED\n<\/p><p>\nA great effort is being made right now to break into the ranks of this people. Others who are\nnot members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are building churches,\nbuilding houses of amusement among us, and those who are skillful in attracting young\npeople are gathering them in, and some of our young people have asked to have their names\ntaken from the records of the church. They come out of good homes, but in some cases have\nnot been taught properly and are easily misled by strangers.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, watch your people. You may have cattle and sheep on a thousand hills and all the\nhay and grain and potatoes and other things, you may own stocks and bonds and houses and\nbanks and everything, but if you, by reason of your own carelessness and indifference, lose\none of those young sons or daughters that God has given to you, you will be repenting of it a\nlong time, and your repentance may not accomplish what you desire.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a lot I might say but there is not time. I have talked so long now.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is lovely to be here with you. I am happy to be with a group of men like this, so many\nyoung men and boys here. Remember boys, every one of you, is a child of our Heavenly\nFather. Every one of you is living eternal life. Each of you boys and men, if you live\nproperly, has a right to the priesthood of the living God. Do not lose that blessing and that\nprivilege. And fathers, with your wives, teach your children the beauty of the things that the\nLord has given to us as the gospel of Jesus Christ, and they will be happy and you will be\nhappy, and your families will not be broken up by those who mislead them, many times\nwilfully and maliciously.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE LORD'S HELP NEEDED\n<\/p><p>\nThis is a day and age of the world when we need the Lord's help, every one of us. I am\ngrateful that we have almost everywhere now, in our schools, in our congress, in our stakes in\ndifferent parts of the world, good men and good women that are not only teaching the gospel\nof Jesus Christ but they are living it. Wonderful helps they are in the various places that they\nare in, and we need it all. All those who have faith and live to be worthy of the inspiration of\nthe Lord will be guided and inspired and helped in times of distress. He is not so far away.\nHe is our Father. He loves us and wants us to be worthy to be called his children. This great\nbody of men here tonight, this marvelous group, every one of you is a son of our Heavenly\nFather. This great group of men, every one is living eternal life, and the gospel of Jesus\nChrist was given to our forbears and now to us, to prepare us to live with him eternally on\nthis earth when it becomes the celestial kingdom. Can you think of anything more wonderful?\n<\/p><p>\nBLESSINGS AND TESTIMONY\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord add his blessing. I pray that he will bless every one of you fine men, you\nteachers in the schools, you men in the wards and stakes, those of you who are working in\ncompanionship with men and boys and women in different parts of the world, I pray the Lord\nto bless you that you will not lose an opportunity to help uplift and develop and bring them to\nbe what our Father would have them to be, and they will be your companions, then,\nthroughout the ages of eternity.\n<\/p><p>\nGod lives. Jesus is the Christ. Joseph Smith was a Prophet of the Living God. The Lord gave\nto him the priesthood that we hold and it will continue to be passed on to our descendants as\nit came from our forbears, if we will do our part.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you brethren, I am so grateful to be with you.\n<\/p><p>\nThink of what it means to be a royal priesthood, not a make-believe, but a royal priesthood,\neveryone having contact, if we will, with the power of our Heavenly Father, the great King of\nkings and Lord of lords (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42196\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42196)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42196)\">Rev. 19:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis is his work and I bear my testimony to you that I know it as I know that I live, in the\nname of Jesus Christ our Lord.
