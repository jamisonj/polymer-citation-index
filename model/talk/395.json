And I also hope that the more than a million souls now living that belong\nto the Church are remembering that this was a wonderful event.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I saw the blue sky this morning and the glorious sunshine, I thought of Parley P. Pratt's\nwonderful hymn, \"The morning breaks, the shadows flee; Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled, The\ndawning of a brighter day, Majestic rises on the world.\" And if this group of people, and\nthose who are associated with the Church who have covenanted with the Lord to do so, will\nundertake to fulfill that portion of his prayer where he says: \"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be\ndone in earth, as it is in heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34259\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34259)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34259)\">Matt. 6:10<\/a><\/span>),\nthe coming of that great day will be\nhastened. It remains for us to bring that about, brothers and sisters.\n<\/p><p>\nThe years pass so swiftly! Sixty-six years ago I was attending the same school that these\nyoung men and women are now, then called the Brigham Young Academy. Sixty-six years\nago! When I think of what a wonderful record that school has made and the blessing it has\nbeen to the Church and to the people, I am grateful that their representatives are here this\nmorning to sing for us and to warm our hearts by their presence.\n<\/p><p>\nI don't want to take more time, my brethren and sisters, but I just felt I wanted to greet you\nthis morning and say to everyone of you: God bless you; and let us see that every time we\nhear or read the prayer offered by the Savior as a pattern for all of us to pray, that we keep in\nmind that it is our privilege to be a part of that program when this earth shall be even as\nheaven.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord bless you. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
