Now you catch enough fish to feed this troop for the next three days, and I\u2019ll pick all of you up on Saturday.\u201d He departed. I never questioned his charge. I knew if I did my part I\u2019d catch the fish and feed the troop. And I did. I was a man before I realized it just isn\u2019t proper for the Scoutmaster to bail out on the boys.

The sky is filled with stars, the tousled heads of the boys illumined by the fire\u2019s glow. The Scoutmaster\u2019s countenance reflects his love, his faith, his devotion. The scene recalls the thought, \u201cThe greatest gift a man can give a boy is his willingness to share a part of his life with him.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-upward-reach.p8\" class=\"\">The other painting is of a small lad, clad in the oversized Scout uniform of his older brother.

Abandoned in many instances is the safety net of personal and family prayer. A macho-inspired attitude of \u201cI can go it alone\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t need the help of anyone\u201d dominates the daily philosophy of many. Frequently there is a rebellion against long-established traditions of decency and order, and the temptation to run with the crowd is overwhelming. Such a destructive philosophy, this formula for failure, can lead to ruin unless men of faith, filled with love, step forward to show a faltering boy the right way to go.

A group of friends were trail riding on strong Morgan horses when we came to a clearing which opened on a lush grass meadow with a small, clear stream meandering through it. No mule deer could wish for a better home. However, there was a danger lurking. The wily deer can detect the slightest movement in the surrounding bush; he can hear the crack of a twig and discern the scent of man. He is vulnerable from but one direction\u2014overhead. In a mature tree, hunters had erected a platform high above the enticing spot. Though in many places this is illegal, the hunter can take his prey as it comes to eat and to drink. No twig would break, no movement disturb, no scent reveal the hunter\u2019s whereabouts. Why? The magnificent buck deer, with its highly developed senses to warn of impending danger, does not have the capacity to look directly upward and thus detect his enemy. Man is not so restricted. His greatest safety is found in his ability and his desire to \u201clook to God and live.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote10-93911_000_022\">10<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10034\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10034)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10034)\">Alma 37:47<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-upward-reach.p53\" class=\"\">Wrote the poet:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">But chief of all Thy wondrous works,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Supreme of all Thy plan,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Thou hast put an upward reach<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Into the heart of man.<\/span>\n\t    <sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote11-93911_000_022\">11<\/a>\n\t   <span class=\"footnote\">[Harry Kemp, \u201cGod the Architect,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">The World\u2019s Great Religious Poetry,<\/span> ed.

He had, in his short life, endured multiple surgeries, along with radiation and chemotherapy treatments. His last surgery was August 9, 1992. A month after that, an MRI picked up six new tumors, two of which were already quite large.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-upward-reach.p60\" class=\"\">The radiation and chemotherapy made Jared very ill. The surgeries were difficult, but he always bounced back very quickly. Although he suffered much pain, the Lord blessed and sustained him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-upward-reach.p61\" class=\"\">Jared had a special spirit that drew others to him. He never complained about how he felt or about having to be sick or about the treatments he had to have. When asked how he was doing, he always said, \u201cGood,\u201d no matter how he felt. He was ever known for his contagious smile. The Light of Christ was in his eyes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-upward-reach.p62\" class=\"\">May I quote from Jared\u2019s mother, Olivia, who wrote concerning his last days: \u201cOur many prayers were answered in behalf of our little son. We prayed that he would be able to walk, talk, and see until the end, and then that the Lord would take him quickly. He was able to do all of these things, and we are so thankful to the Lord for answering our prayers. Jared loved life so much, and we wanted him to be able to enjoy it fully until the end.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-upward-reach.p63\" class=\"\">\u201cJared had earned some Cub Scout awards three weeks prior to his passing. He had earned his Bear badge, his Faith in God, a Gold Arrow Point, and two Silver Arrow Points. We know that he loved to get those awards. He was failing quickly, and he wouldn\u2019t even let himself sleep until he could attend the pack meeting held on October 14, 1992, to achieve his awards. At the pack meeting, he raised his hand three times and told everyone how long he had waited for these awards and how happy he was to get them. When we returned home, he asked me to sew his badges on that very night. I did. Then he prayed that Heavenly Father would let him sleep because he was so tired. He said that three times. He went to sleep and never moved all night. From then on he slept most of the time until his passing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-upward-reach.p64\" class=\"\">\u201cWe buried him in his Cub Scout shirt with those long-awaited emblems sewn and pinned on the front. He had a beautiful service. Many were present, for he had made so many friends in the community through his example of courage and faith.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-upward-reach.p65\" class=\"\">Such was the influence of an inspired program in the life of a tiny boy and his family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/the-upward-reach.p66\" class=\"\">To all the Aaronic Priesthood assembled tonight with your fathers and your leaders, the priesthood program of the Church, with its accompanying activities, including Scouting, will help and not hinder you as you journey through life. May each one of us resolve to follow the example of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, keep His commandments, and live His teachings, that we may inherit the greatest of all gifts, eternal life with God.
