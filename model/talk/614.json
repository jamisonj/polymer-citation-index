(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8915\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8915)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8915)\">Alma 29:1<\/a><\/span>),\n<\/p><p>\nwas the statement of the Prophet of old.\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure today in our lives many of us wish that we were something other than we are,\nthinking likely that their lot is preferable to our own. But Alma said further: \n<\/p><p>\nYea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the\nplan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto our God that there might\nnot be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nBut behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish, for I ought to be content with the\nthings which the Lord hath allotted unto me\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8916\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8916)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8916)\">Alma 29:2-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI believe that we, as fellow workers in the priesthood, might well take to heart the admonition\nof Alma and be content with that which God hath allotted us. We might well be assured that\nwe had something to do with our \"allotment\" in our pre-existent state. This would be an\nadditional reason for us to accept our present condition and make the best of it. It is what we\nagreed to do.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are told in the Doctrine and Covenants that:\n<\/p><p>\nHe that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in\ntruth and knoweth all things.\n<\/p><p>\nMan was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not\ncreated or made, neither indeed can be.\n<\/p><p>\nThen the Lord says: \n<\/p><p>\nAll truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as\nall intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13025\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13025)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13025)\">D&amp;C 93:28-30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFor that to be true, we had our own free agency in our pre-mortal existence and whatever we\nare today is likely the result of that which we willed to be heretofore. We unquestionably\nknew before we elected to come to this earth the conditions under which we would here exist,\nand live, and work. So little wonder it is that Alma of old said that we sin in the thought, or\nin the desire or in the wish that we were someone other than ourselves. He said further: \n<\/p><p>\nNow, seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more than to perform the\nwork to which I have been called?\n<\/p><p>\nWhy should I desire that I were an angel, that I could speak unto all the ends of the\nearth?\n<\/p><p>\nFor behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue to\nteach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they should have; therefore we\nsee that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just and true.\n<\/p><p>\nI know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do not glory of\nmyself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my\nglory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to\nrepentance; and this is my joy\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8917\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8917)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8917)\">Alma 29:6-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI have a conviction deep down in my heart that we are exactly what we should be, each one\nof us, except as we may have altered that pattern by deviating from the laws of God here in\nmortality. I have convinced myself that we all have those peculiar attributes, characteristics,\nand abilities which are essential for us to possess in order that we may fulfil the full purpose\nof our creation here upon this earth.\n<\/p><p>\nOnce again, that allotment which has come to us from God is a sacred allotment. It is\nsomething of which we should be proud, each one of us in our own right, and not wish that\nwe had somebody else's allotment. Our greatest success comes from being ourselves.\n<\/p><p>\nI think that we can console ourselves best by believing that whatever is our allotment in life,\nwhatever is our call in the priesthood, the Lord has been wise and just, and I might add,\nmerciful, in giving to us that which we need to accomplish the particular purpose of our call.\n<\/p><p>\nFurthermore, when we are in the full exercise of our faculties, and live in obedience to the\nlaws and commandments of God, that which we do in fulfillment of our call as holders of the\npriesthood or officers in the Church is all that the people who are thus affected deserve.\nOtherwise, God could not be just, and we know he is.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we apply that principle to our lives, practically, does it not mean that when the bishop or\nthe stake president, or the President of the Church, calls upon us to fill an office or to render\na service to our fellow men, we should accept that call with an assurance that we possess the\nessential qualifications given to us of our Heavenly Father in order to properly fulfil that\nmission?\n<\/p><p>\nI think this is peculiarly true of those of us who may be called upon missions to go into the\nworld and preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, the highest calling that can come to man, that\ncall which the Savior of mankind gave to his disciples last of all, preceding his ascension to\nheaven, to go into the world and preach the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and\npeople.\n<\/p><p>\nI wish we could take to heart the admonition of President Joseph Fielding Smith today and\nutilize those faculties which God gave us that have been religiously and sacredly allotted to us\nfor our use in the fulfillment of life's mission, that we might be fully qualified through our\nown efforts, as well as through that endowment which we inherited and received from our\nFather in heaven, to go into the world and preach his gospel to his children, who wait in\ndarkness to have truth and light brought to them by men who have been qualified by\nendowment, and by perseverance, and by their own work, thus to accomplish this purpose.\n<\/p><p>\nWe cannot be satisfied with the fact that we are Latter-day Saints and that we have received\nthe priesthood, and that various calls have come to us. If we have the true perspective of life\nand of our mission, we would qualify ourselves from youth to meet any and every\nresponsibility that might come to us. That is peculiarly necessary for a people to believe and\nto practice when they profess to the world that the men who preside over them in the Church\nand in the priesthood of God have been called of God by those who are in authority to preach\nthe gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we truly believe the Fifth Article of Faith\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6662\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6662)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6662)\">A of F 1:5<\/a><\/span>), if we truly believe that we have such a mission\nupon this earth to fulfil, then indeed will we be diligent in preparing ourselves to meet the\nresponsibilities of life. We shall feel qualified to go anywhere and to listen to any doctrine,\nwhether it be of man or of the devil, and be sure before we go that we will come back firm\nin the knowledge of the eternal truths that God has revealed in these latter days through his\nprophets.\n<\/p><p>\nWe need not fear the philosophies of the world. We will not need any enlightenment or any\ninstruction or any assistance from anyone but the Comforter. For I bear witness to you today\nthat if we accept of the Lord the allotment which he has given to us as our\nbirthright, as our inheritance, and we build upon it as we should, that we will enjoy all\nthrough our lives that Comforter which the Savior promised his disciples.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my name, he\nshall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have\nsaid unto you (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27524\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27524)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27524)\">John 14:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI hope and pray, my brethren and sisters, that we will be diligent in understanding and\nappreciating the eternal truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ, that we will live and not merely\nexist. There can come into our lives no greater thrill than to be conscious of the fact that we\nhave taken those faculties that God has given us and utilized them as our Father in heaven\nintended that we should.\n<\/p><p>\nI was thrilled beyond measure the other day. I have a little grandson three years of age. I\nfound him and myself in front of a show window. He said: \"Granno, buy me something.\" I\nlooked hastily over the articles, and I thought every article in the window was intended for a\nlittle girl, dolls, etc.\n<\/p><p>\nI said, \"There is nothing there for a boy,\" but almost in an instant he looked up at me with his\nbig eyes, and he said, \"Why, Granno, there is a truck there. Men drive trucks.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI was thrilled to think in that mind three years of age that that power to utilize the intellect, to\nthink and to reason existed there so early in life, and brought to that young man, at the\nmoment at least, the desired results.\n<\/p><p>\nNow I hope and pray, my brethren and sisters, that we will all place ourselves in the position\nwhere we can utilize these faculties just as that child did, in every circumstance of life, and\nhave come before us, through our obedience, and through the guidance and direction of the\nHoly Ghost the right answer to all our problems.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God so bless us I humbly pray in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
