They are called to serve an honorable mission and return home with honor. To do that, they know who they are\u2014missionaries of the Lord\u2019s Church. They know their objective\u2014to find and teach those who are ready to receive the gospel of Jesus Christ and to help establish His Church. They develop patience in overcoming trials and tribulations which surely will come. They are humble enough to learn new skills and have a determination to endure to the end. No matter what a missionary sacrifices to go on a mission, he must be obedient on his mission to receive the blessings that are rightfully his.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/behold-we-count-them-happy-which-endure.p30\" class=\"\">Some may say, \u201cHow can I be a missionary and endure to the end?

Everyone has something they must learn to master. Some are just more obvious than others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/behold-we-count-them-happy-which-endure.p31\" class=\"\">When we serve as missionaries and the focus is off ourselves and on doing the Lord\u2019s work and helping others, an opportunity for great growth and maturity occurs.

Giving the best he knows when he arrives will not fulfill the calling. Enduring requires doing better than your best of today by developing additional gifts as granted from the Lord. It takes faith to listen to the Lord and to mission leaders and learn how to accomplish whatever missionaries are called to do. Of course, it is difficult. That\u2019s what makes it such a gift and why it has such great rewards. We must recognize who we are and achieve our ultimate purpose. We must then resolve to overcome all obstacles with great determination to endure to the end.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/behold-we-count-them-happy-which-endure.p33\" class=\"\">When we take an assignment, we have to think, \u201cI will learn how to accomplish this task by all honorable means, by doing it the Lord\u2019s way.
