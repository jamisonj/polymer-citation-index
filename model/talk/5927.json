Alma then had to demonstrate great faith in the words of Abinadi as he sought to bring about a mighty change of heart. This change of heart strengthened his conversion with a desire to forsake his sins. The conversion of each member of the Church is not unlike that of Alma (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"40997\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40997)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40997)\">&gt;Mosiah 17<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/when-thou-art-converted-strengthen-thy-brethren.p9\" class=\"\">We come out of the world into the kingdom of God.

Honoring the priesthood and being obedient in living the commandments are important elements in the conversion process. Adult male members receive the Aaronic Priesthood soon after baptism. After a period of time, if worthy, they should receive the Melchizedek Priesthood, and each individual in the family shares the blessings of the priesthood in the home. Women are welcomed and enjoy the blessings of sisterhood in the Relief Society. Youth develop friendships as they associate in the Young Men and Young Women organizations. The children are blessed as they are taught and feel the love of caring teachers in the Primary.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/when-thou-art-converted-strengthen-thy-brethren.p14\" class=\"\">Our obedience to the commandments leads us to service and sacrifice in accepting callings in the priesthood quorums and the auxiliary organizations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/when-thou-art-converted-strengthen-thy-brethren.p15\" class=\"\">We faithfully progress for at least one year after baptism and prepare ourselves to enter the temple of the Lord.
