He was told to \u201cgo forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-voice-is-still-small.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1306\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1306)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1306)\">1 Kgs. 19:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-voice-is-still-small.p11\" class=\"\">My testimony is that the Lord <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> speaking to you! But with the deafening decibels of today\u2019s environment, all too often we fail to hear him. I remember as a youth having the experience of being in company with an older man who had lost much of his hearing ability. He had no hearing aid and was continually asking that we speak louder so that he could be part of the conversation. He would say, \u201cTalk louder; speak up; I can\u2019t hear you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-voice-is-still-small.p12\" class=\"\">That was before the days of television and CDs and boomers and blasters.

The <span class=\"emphasis\">ability<\/span> to listen. The <span class=\"emphasis\">desire<\/span> to listen. On religious matters, too many of us are saying, \u201cWhat did you say? Speak up; I can\u2019t hear you.\u201d And when he doesn\u2019t <span class=\"emphasis\">shout<\/span> back, or cause the bush to burn, or write us a message in stone with his finger, we are inclined to think he doesn\u2019t listen, doesn\u2019t care about us.

How can we filter out the heavy decibels of darkness that surround us? Let me mention three of the more obvious ones.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-voice-is-still-small.p17\" class=\"\">Number 1: Revitalize your weekly worship. When you sing the hymns, for instance, ponder the meaning of the words, enjoy the spirit of the music. Sing with enthusiasm without regard to your tones. You will have a good feeling, and your spirit will be enlivened; and as you join with the Saints in the songs of the heart, the Lord promises to answer this with blessings upon your head. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"19410\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19410)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19410)\">D&amp;C 25:12<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-voice-is-still-small.p18\" class=\"\">Next, <span class=\"emphasis\">partake<\/span> of the sacrament. Don\u2019t merely <span class=\"emphasis\">take<\/span> the sacrament. Think of the covenants you are remaking. Truly witness unto the Father that you will take upon yourself the name of his Son, even Jesus Christ. Recommit yourself to always remember him, to keep the commandments which he has given you. Your obedience will entitle you to have his Spirit to be with you. If this sacred ordinance has become commonplace in your worship, if you let your mind wander elsewhere during this weekly opportunity for spiritual renewal, if you just <span class=\"emphasis\">take<\/span> the bread and water as it passes, with no thought or recommitment in your life, then you have turned off a significant aid to your hearing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-voice-is-still-small.p19\" class=\"\">Number 2: Pray to know God\u2019s will, not to \u201cget things.\u201d Too often, because of our selfish desires, after a cursory \u201cThank you, Lord,\u201d we consume our prayer time in the listing of things we want, even of things we think we need. We must be willing to release the death grip which we have on things, which have become as a security blanket in our lives. Count the many hundreds of needed missionary couples who would be serving in the field if that firm grip on the familiarities of home and of children and grandchildren could be loosened. The Lord is prepared to perform the miracle that will follow, which miracle is that both they and you will survive, even grow, with an eighteen-month separation. We must learn to pray with meaning, \u201cNot my will, but Thy will be done.\u201d When you are able to do this, his whisperings to you will be loud and clear. The Prophet Joseph Smith, after five months of extreme suffering in the dungeon of Liberty Jail, experienced it, and he said, \u201cWhen the heart is <span class=\"emphasis\">sufficiently contrite,<\/span> then the voice of inspiration steals along and whispers, My son, peace be unto thy soul.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 3:293; italics added.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-voice-is-still-small.p20\" class=\"\">Hearing aid number 3 has to do with the scriptures. In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord tells us that he speaks to us through the scriptures. Of course, just reading words without our minds being centered on the message is not really listening. In section 18 we read:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-voice-is-still-small.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd I, Jesus Christ, your Lord and your God, have spoken it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-voice-is-still-small.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cThese words are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testify they are of me and not of man:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-voice-is-still-small.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cFor it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my Spirit unto you, \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-voice-is-still-small.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19398\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19398)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19398)\">D&amp;C 18:33\u201336<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-voice-is-still-small.p25\" class=\"\">And thus, what to many seems to be the monologue of prayer actually becomes a dialogue with God as we immerse ourselves in the scriptures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-voice-is-still-small.p26\" class=\"\">As it was with Elijah, so it is today. God is not in the earthquake, nor in the winds and fires of war, but he speaks to us in a voice that is small. With President Kimball, I, too, testify that it is this constant flow of revealed communication which continues to direct this church through our prophet, Ezra Taft Benson, and through his counselors, and through the Twelve Apostles. It comes to the Seventy and to the Presiding Bishopric. It comes to the stake presidents, and to the bishops and to the quorum and Church officers throughout the world. It speaks to our missionaries; it comes to heads of families. I further witness that this still, small voice is speaking personally to you. Please be <span class=\"emphasis\">still<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">listen!<\/span> The Psalmist said, \u201cBe still, and know that I am God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42041\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42041)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42041)\">Ps. 46:10<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-voice-is-still-small.p27\" class=\"\">I know that he lives.
