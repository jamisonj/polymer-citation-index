She knew them all. They were like family to her; Marie\u2019s baked goodies found their way into their homes, and they looked after her like a favorite aunt or a grandmother. Home teaching and visiting teaching were only the beginning as the whole neighborhood was caught up in this love affair. Children were welcomed into her home. They always knew there would be fresh-baked cookies. There was a warmth about that little home that was a reflection of Marie\u2019s whole life. Many prayers had been offered here: prayers of gratitude, prayers of thanksgiving.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel-of-love.p24\" class=\"\">The words she taught her pet bird were the words she lived by.

There are those who write about us and study us. But may I suggest that until they take into account this spirit of love, they will never really understand.

They are easily identified by their dress and manner. They come on their missions for many reasons: duty, service, the testimony they have of their message. But after serving honorably for eighteen months or two years, virtually all of them develop a deep and profound love for the people they serve among. One missionary put it this way: \u201cAlthough it was hard, I am thankful for all the experiences I\u2019ve had here. They were right about the mission field; it\u2019s the best place to practice true christianity, and it\u2019s the best time of your life.\u201d Another says: \u201cI thank the Lord with all my heart for giving me the opportunity to serve him.

At the start of the meeting a seven-year-old boy came up on the stand and sat next to him. He was not on the program; he just wanted to be there. When the meeting was nearly over he strode to the pulpit and bore his testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel-of-love.p29\" class=\"\">When he finished, he went back and sat next to the president. The two exchanged glances. The mission president smiled approval. The young boy smiled back. In those dark eyes was a message of love and security. Here was someone who knew he belonged.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel-of-love.p30\" class=\"\">Later it was learned the boy had spent his earlier life as an orphan. A couple in the ward had taken him in and were raising him as their own. The whole ward was his home, and he was blossoming in this atmosphere of acceptance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel-of-love.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37086\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37086)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37086)\">Matt. 25:40<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel-of-love.p32\" class=\"\">A few years ago, when President Kimball was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, he and Sister Kimball were touring missions overseas.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel-of-love.p33\" class=\"\">A change in the airline schedule found them, along with a mission president and his wife, in a cold and drafty airport, late at night, with no place to go but wait for an early morning flight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel-of-love.p34\" class=\"\">Sister Kimball had her coat, but the mission president\u2019s wife did not. President Kimball tried to give her his coat, but she would not take it. As they began to fall asleep on those hard benches, President Kimball got up and gently put his coat over the sleeping wife of the mission president. This kind of selfless concern for others is how President Kimball has lived his life. This is the same leader we sustain today as prophet, seer, and revelator. This is the man whom God has called to lead nearly six million Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel-of-love.p35\" class=\"\">He has literally spent his life in taking off his coat, so to speak, and putting it around the shoulders of those he judged to be in greater need: people of all colors and creeds; men, women, and children.

She then stood in front of Sister Dunn and me and with a broad smile and great sincerity said \u201cI love you.\u201d It seemed a little thing, but it touched our hearts. It was the effort of a humble follower of Christ to express herself. The message could have been said in any language and been understood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/the-gospel-of-love.p40\" class=\"\">The spirit of love reaches across language barriers.
