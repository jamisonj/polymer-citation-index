The love of God for His children is most profoundly expressed in His gift of Jesus as our Redeemer: \u201cGod so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29939\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29939)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29939)\">John 3:16<\/a><\/span>). To partake of the love of God is to partake of Jesus\u2019 Atonement and the emancipations and joys which it can bring.

Once, true, they asked straightforward questions about the meaning of a vision of the tree, the river, and the rod of iron.
