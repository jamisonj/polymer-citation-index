The following day was one of the longest in my young life. I was awaiting my adviser\u2019s return from work an hour before he arrived home. He took me to his pigeon loft, which was in the upper area of a small barn located at the rear of his yard. As I looked at the most beautiful pigeons I had yet seen, he said, \u201cSelect any male, and I will give you a female which is different from any other pigeon in the world.\u201d I made my selection. He then placed in my hand a tiny hen pigeon. I asked what made her so different. He responded, \u201cLook carefully, and you\u2019ll notice that she has but one eye.\u201d Sure enough, one eye was missing, a cat having done the damage. \u201cTake them home to your loft,\u201d he counseled. \u201cKeep them in for about 10 days, and then turn them out to see if they will remain at your place.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/anxiously-engaged.p24\" class=\"\">I followed Harold\u2019s instructions. Upon his release, the male pigeon strutted about the roof of the loft, then returned inside to eat. But the one-eyed female was gone in an instant. I called Harold and asked, \u201cDid that one-eyed pigeon return to your loft?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/anxiously-engaged.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cCome on over,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019ll have a look.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/anxiously-engaged.p26\" class=\"\">As we walked from his kitchen door to the loft, my adviser commented, \u201cTom, you are the president of the teachers quorum.\u201d This, of course, I already knew.

Again the experience: \u201cCome on over, and we\u2019ll see if she returned home.\u201d Came the comment as we walked to the loft: \u201cCongratulations on getting Bob to priesthood meeting.

I was a grown man before I fully realized that indeed Harold, my adviser, had given me a special pigeon, the only pigeon in his loft he knew would return every time she was released. It was his inspired way of having an ideal personal priesthood interview with the president of the teachers quorum every two weeks. I owe a lot to that one-eyed pigeon. I owe more to that quorum adviser.

Shelley was so sorrowful that he retired to a special room at the mortuary where the funeral was being held. We had wired the proceedings to this room so that he might mourn alone and where no one could see him weep with sorrow. As I comforted him in that room before going to the pulpit, he gave me a hug, and I knew a tender chord had been touched.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/anxiously-engaged.p36\" class=\"\">Time passed.

I sort of snuck up on you. There was this home teacher who called on us regularly and taught me the truths of the Church. He was a school crossing guard and helped the small children across the street each morning when they went to school and each afternoon when they went home. He asked me to help him. During the intervals when there was no child crossing, he gave me additional instruction pertaining to the Church.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/11\/anxiously-engaged.p40\" class=\"\">I had the privilege to see this miracle with my own eyes and feel the joy with my heart and soul.

I shall ever see, in memory\u2019s eye, the body of my friend Shelley lying in his casket, dressed in his temple clothing.
