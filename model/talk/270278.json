Many of our eastern and old country friends are altogether\n  unacquainted with the situation of the banks in this region of country; and as they generally bring\n  specie with them, they are perpetually in danger of being gulled by speculators. Besides there is so\n  much uncertainty in the solvency of the best of banks, that I think it much safer to go upon the hard\n  money system altogether. I have examined the Constitution upon this subject and find my doubts\n  removed. The Constitution<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> is not a law, but it empowers the people to make laws.
