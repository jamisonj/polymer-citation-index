He had worked hard, made his choices, and carried them through. The tables were set, the food was in the pot, and the hour was drawing nigh.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-accountability.p5\" class=\"\">His wife came over early to check things out. Everything seemed in order, but it looked mighty colorless to her trained eye.

And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to talk about for a few minutes, agency and accountability. I must add that should we happen to choose butter for the centerpiece, we can\u2019t expect compliments on the decor. We have our free agency, but we also have to accept the consequences of our choices. It isn\u2019t so serious in centerpieces, but in matters of life, and of life after death, it is critical.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-accountability.p8\" class=\"\">Agency is an eternal principle and is implicit in the test of life. We must constantly choose between opposites: good and evil. Satan sought to destroy the free agency of man, and here on earth he\u2019s still working to entangle man in sin.

Our job is to search for the full truth and apply it in our lives. Though we are free to act, we are not free to decide what is right or wrong. That was determined eons ago. We can scoff at sacred things, rationalize our behavior, spout our own ideas, agree or disagree, but it doesn\u2019t change anything. We cannot alter God\u2019s laws, his truth. We can choose to use truth wisely and reach our goal, or we can refuse to learn truth, to live it, and then pay the inevitable penalty.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-accountability.p11\" class=\"\">Accountability is the natural product of agency and is the basis of the plan of life.

Sisters, translated into simple idiom that means that if you pick up one end of a stick, you pick up the other. When you pick a path, you choose the place it leads to.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-accountability.p13\" class=\"\">I well remember a striking scene that gave me a dramatic perspective of agency and accountability. I was in a village hotel in Taiwan, several floors up, looking out the window at great numbers of the beautiful children of Taiwan on their way to school. From my vantage point I could see the school some distance away. The children knew the school was there, though they couldn\u2019t see it yet, and, of course, they were unaware of my presence. They were charming in the official school uniform\u2014short navy skirt or pant; clean, white starched shirt; and, on this rainy day, a canary-yellow slicker. Now, some of the children carelessly dragged their slickers behind them; a few let them fly open; others wore them tightly buttoned, like the whole armor of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-accountability.p14\" class=\"\">The path they were taking through the rice paddy was well trampled, but there were big mud puddles, exciting places to hide between tall rushes, temptations behind a small shop across the way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-accountability.p15\" class=\"\">The children came around the corner of the hotel\u2014wave after wave of these little people of Heavenly Father\u2019s family\u2014and according to their agency, they dawdled along, were detoured by the slightest distraction, or else pressed toward the mark\u2014the school way up ahead. It was up to them now; parents weren\u2019t around.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-accountability.p16\" class=\"\">I was fascinated watching the children deal with their environment. Some deliberately plowed right through the deep mud puddles time and again and came forth filthy. Others automatically marched around the puddle, almost oblivious to it. Many absolutely couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to gingerly touch a toe in the mire. One little girl, afterwards, stooped over and tried to wipe the mud from her shoe, then from her hand; then she brushed the spot on her clothes where she had wiped her hand. <span class=\"emphasis\">Mud is tough to erase.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-accountability.p17\" class=\"\">Interesting, isn\u2019t it? Life from a window. Agency and accountability. They made their choices, and so do we.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-accountability.p18\" class=\"\">We are like children walking a path in the rain. We can walk in or around the mud of life as we desire, but with our choices come the consequences. And we are rapidly becoming what we are choosing to be for all eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-accountability.p19\" class=\"\">Spiritual maturity is understanding that we cannot blame anybody else for our actions. Some factors may make it harder for us to perform according to God\u2019s plan for us, but being accountable for how we use our agency means being answerable for our own behavior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/agency-and-accountability.p20\" class=\"\">It is one of the things that I admire most about mother Eve\u2014her absolute strength in personal accountability.

I wonder if mothers have <span class=\"emphasis\">really<\/span> taught daughters about truth, agency, and accountability. Are daughters sharing with mothers their own learnings?
