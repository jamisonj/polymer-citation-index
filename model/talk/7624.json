All my life I have been surrounded by women who inspired, taught, and encouraged me. I am who I am today in large part because of these singular women. Each time I meet with the sisters of the Church, I sense that I am in the midst of similar remarkable souls. I am grateful to be here, grateful for your talents, compassion, and service. Most of all, I am grateful for who you are: treasured daughters of our Heavenly Father with infinite worth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/happiness-your-heritage.p7\" class=\"\">I\u2019m sure it comes as no surprise, but the differences between men and women can often be quite striking\u2014physically and mentally, as well as emotionally. One of the best ways I can think of to illustrate this is in the way my wife and I cook a meal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/happiness-your-heritage.p8\" class=\"\">When Harriet prepares a meal, it\u2019s a masterpiece. Her cuisine is as wide-ranging as the world, and she frequently prepares dishes from countries we have visited. The presentation of the food is awe inspiring. In fact, it often looks so beautiful that it seems a crime to eat it. It\u2019s as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the sense of taste.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/happiness-your-heritage.p9\" class=\"\">But sure enough, no matter how perfect everything is, looks, and tastes, Harriet will apologize for something she thinks is imperfect. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I used a touch too much ginger,\u201d she will say, or, \u201cNext time, I think it would be better if I used a little more curry and one additional bay leaf.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/happiness-your-heritage.p10\" class=\"\">Let me contrast that with the way I cook.

In this you emulate the Savior, who, though a king, did not seek position, nor was He concerned about whether others noticed Him. He did not bother to compete with others. His thoughts were always tuned to help others. He taught, healed, conversed, and listened to others. He knew that greatness had little to do with outward signs of prosperity or position. He taught and lived by this doctrine: \u201cHe that is greatest among you shall be your servant.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote13-02211_000_039\">13<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117273\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117273)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117273)\">Matthew 23:11<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/happiness-your-heritage.p59\" class=\"\">In the end, the number of prayers we say may contribute to our happiness, but the number of prayers we answer may be of even greater importance.
