That is the only way.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn these words President Smith introduced the theme of this conference at the opening\nsession last Thursday. This statement went down into my heart like fire, because I did not\naccept it as the statement of a man but as the word of God through his living\nprophet to this living generation. I desire to say a few words about this theme. It reminds me\nof the eloquent statement of Alma.\n<\/p><p>\nO that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth\nand speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance\nunto every people!\n<\/p><p>\nYea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder repentance and the\nplan of redemption that they should repent and come unto our God that there might\nnot be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8902\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8902)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8902)\">Alma 29:1-2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHere indeed is a consummation devoutly to be wished.\n<\/p><p>\nFIRST PRINCIPLES\n<\/p><p>\nIn the Prophet's journal under date of March 1, 1842, he made the following entry: \n<\/p><p>\nAt the request of Mr. John Wentworth, Editor and Proprietor of the Chicago\nDemocrat, I have written the following sketch of the rise progress, persecution, and\nfaith of the Latter-day Saints. (<i>History of the Church<\/i>, Vol. IV, p. 535.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe sketch thus introduced, he concluded with the Articles of Faith, the fourth one of which\nreads: \n<\/p><p>\nWe believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: (First) Faith in\nthe Lord Jesus Christ; (Second) Repentance; (Third) Baptism by immersion for the\nremission of sins; (Fourth) Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6646\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6646)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6646)\">A of F 1:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYou will note that in the sequence here followed by the Prophet, repentance as a principle of\nthe gospel is preceded by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. It is clear from the three articles\npreceding the one I have quoted that to have this faith requires first, belief in God as our\nEternal Father, in Jesus Christ as his beloved Son and in the Holy Ghost; and second,\nacceptance of the doctrines that men will be held accountable for their own sins, and that\nthrough the atonement of Christ they may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances\nof the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nREPENTANCE LEADING TO SALVATION\n<\/p><p>\nTo one believing these truths and, in the light of them, having faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,\nrepentance means not only \"a turning with sorrow from a past sinful course of action\"&mdash;as it\nhas been defined&mdash;but, in addition thereto, that through repentance he may bring himself\nwithin the reach of the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, so that thereby he may be cleansed from\nthe effects of his transgressions and obtain forgiveness of them. His repentance is a\npreparation for baptism by immersion for the remission of his sins and reception of the Holy\nGhost.\n<\/p><p>\nWhile turning from a sinful course at any time and for any cause is commendable and\ndesirable, the repentance which \"worketh . . . to salvation\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3020\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3020)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3020)\">2 Cor. 7:10<\/a><\/span>), as Paul puts it,\nis inseparably connected with the other first principles of the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nTRUE REPENTANCE\n<\/p><p>\nMany sober and earnest people are recognizing the need for men to repent of their sinful ways\nand are advocating that they turn to God. This is good as far as it goes, but the only people\nwho can call the inhabitants of the earth to true repentance are the members of the Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The reason this rather sweeping statement is true is because\nsuch a call to repentance cannot be made without a divine commission.\n<\/p><p>\nFor such repentance to be declared under divine commission, as President Smith declared it\nat the opening of this conference, is by no means a new thing. It was not new in the days of\nthe Prophet. It is as old as this world. In the morning of earth's temporal existence, an angel\ncommissioned by the Lord himself declared repentance unto the first mortal man, saying,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the Lord God called upon men by the Holy Ghost everywhere and commanded\nthem that they should repent; \n<\/p><p>\nAnd as many as believed in the Son, and repented of their sins, should be saved; and\nas many as believed not and repented not, should be damned; and the words went\nforth out of the mouth of God in a firm decree\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38979\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38979)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38979)\">Moses 5:8,14-15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNEED OF THE HOUR\n<\/p><p>\nFrom then until now, men have lived upon the earth, and particularly in the land of America,\nunder this firm decree. As it has been in the past, so must it continue to be, for the Lord\nAlmighty has spoken it. It seems to me, therefore, that the most desperate need of this hour is\nrepentance, and that quickly, for it is later than we think. As long ago as 1829 the Lord said: \n<\/p><p>\nBehold, the world is ripening in iniquity: and it must needs be that the children of men\nare stirred up unto repentance\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12770\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12770)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12770)\">D&amp;C 18:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTime and time again in the past, as men and nations have faced destruction, the Lord has sent\nhis commissioned servants to declare unto them repentance as the way of escape. \"Noah\ncalled upon the children of men that they should repent,\" and although ''they hearkened not\nunto his words,\" he \"continued his preaching unto\" them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38985\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38985)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38985)\">Moses 8:20,23<\/a><\/span>), saying,\n<\/p><p>\nBelieve and repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son\nof God, . . . and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost . . . and if ye do not this, the floods\nwill come in upon you; nevertheless they hearkened not\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38986\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38986)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38986)\">Moses 8:24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMelchizedek, king of Salem, was commissioned by the Lord and declared repentance\nunto his people. He. . . having exercised mighty faith, and received\nthe office of the high priesthood according to the holy order of God, did preach\nrepentance unto his people. And behold, they did repent; and Melchizedek did\nestablish peace in the land in his days; therefore he was called the prince of peace\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8900\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8900)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8900)\">Alma 13:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nREPENTANCE IN AMERICA\n<\/p><p>\nUpon our own beloved land of America, God has repeatedly commissioned his servants to call\nthe people to repentance that they might escape destruction. The Prophet Ether \". . . came\nforth in the days of Coriantumr\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22183\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22183)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22183)\">Ether 12:2<\/a><\/span>)\nking of the Jaredite nation, and at the Lord's direction\nsought out Coriantumr personally and prophesied unto him\n<\/p><p>\n. . . that, if he would repent, and all his household, the Lord would give unto him his\nkingdom and spare the people&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nOtherwise they should be destroyed, and all his household save it were himself.\n<\/p><p>\n. . . And it came to pass that Coriantumr repented not, neither his household, neither\nthe people; and the wars ceased not\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22184\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22184)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22184)\">Ether 13:20-22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFifteen and a half centuries ago, because of their unrighteousness, the remnants of the Nephite\nrace were in a death grapple upon this land with their brethren, the Laments. Among them\nstood the mighty prophet-leader Mormon, to whom the Lord said,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . Cry unto this people&mdash;Repent ye, and come unto me, and be ye baptized, and build\nup again my church, and ye shall be spared.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I did cry unto this people, but it was in vain; and they did not realize that it was\nthe Lord that had spared them, and granted unto them a chance for repentance. And\nbehold they did harden their hearts against the Lord their God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37956\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37956)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37956)\">Morm. 3:2-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, they, as well as the Jaredites, were wiped off this land. This was true\nnotwithstanding the glorious promises made in the Book of Mormon, some of which were\nquoted this morning by President Young. All those promises were conditioned upon\nrepentance.\n<\/p><p>\nUNRIGHTEOUSNESS TODAY\n<\/p><p>\nThe world in which we live today is sick nigh unto death. The disease of which it suffers is\nnot a new one. It is as old as history. Its name is unrighteousness. The cure for it is\nrepentance. The Lord foresaw our present extremity long ago and prescribed the remedy. On\nNovember 1, 1831, he said: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the\nearth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven,\nand gave him commandments; \n<\/p><p>\nAnd also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these things unto\nthe world (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12760\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12760)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12760)\">D&amp;C 1:17-18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTwo things which the Lord had done in preparing a way of escape are here referred to. First,\nhe had given commandments, and second, he had commissioned men to proclaim them.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the commandments was this.\n<\/p><p>\nHearken, O ye people of my church, saith the Lord your God . . .\n<\/p><p>\nHearken and hear, O ye inhabitants of the earth. Listen, ye elders of my church\ntogether, and hear the voice of the Lord; for he calleth upon all men, and he\ncommandeth all men everywhere to repent\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12852\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12852)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12852)\">D&amp;C 133:1,16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd surely every man must repent or suffer\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12771\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12771)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12771)\">D&amp;C 19:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd here is the commission: \n<\/p><p>\nHearken, O ye elders of my church . . . hearken and hear and obey: \n<\/p><p>\nBehold, verily I say unto you, I give unto you this first commandment that ye shall\ngo forth in my name . . .\n<\/p><p>\nAnd ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit . . . in my name, lifting up your\nvoices as with the sound of a trump, declaring my word like unto angels of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12784\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12784)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12784)\">D&amp;C 42:1-2,4,6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd what shall we declare?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd ye shall go forth baptizing with water, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, for the\nkingdom of heaven is at hand\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12785\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12785)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12785)\">D&amp;C 42:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOUR RESPONSIBILITY\n<\/p><p>\nWe who today bear the priesthood of God are the legal heirs to this great commission. Ours is\nthe responsibility of officially declaring repentance unto all the inhabitants of the earth. None\nare exempt. We must discharge this responsibility, regardless of the manner in which our\nmessage is received. With respect thereto, we are under the same obligation to this generation\nas was Ezekiel to the house of Israel in his day. You will recall that the Lord said to him,\n<\/p><p>\nSon of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the\nword at my mouth, and give them warning from me.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I say unto the wicked, thou shalt surely die; and thou gives him not warning,\nnor spookiest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, the same\nwicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.\n<\/p><p>\nYet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his\nwicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23107\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23107)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23107)\">Ezek. 3:17-19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI regard this commission to declare the saving principle of repentance as a great blessing. I\nam grateful to my Father in heaven for it, for there are few things more tormenting to me\nthan to be faced with a distressing situation about which I can do nothing. The commission\nwe bear gives us a positive course to follow in meeting the problems we face. It is a\nsustaining and comforting feeling to know that the course we are trying to get people to take\nis the course the Redeemer would have them take if he were here in person.\n<\/p><p>\nNO OTHER WAY\n<\/p><p>\nTo those who contend that the way of repentance is too slow, I can but reply there is no other\nway. Our prophet has so declared in this conference. If we do not come to\nourselves soon and repent, individually and as nations, of our light regard for human life, our\nunchastity, our lying and deception, our pride and boastfulness, our covetousness, envying,\ngreed, and thirst for power, our drunkenness, our lack of humility, reverence, and prayer, our\ndesecration of the Sabbath day, our lack of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and, in short, of all\nour unrighteousness, we shall find it is too late, for other proposed remedies to the world's\npresent predicament will prove futile. There are no armaments, no governmental schemes, no\ninternational organizations, and no mechanisms for the control of weapons which can preserve\nan unrighteous people. \"Wickedness never was happiness\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8906\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8906)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8906)\">Alma 41:10<\/a><\/span>), declared Alma to his wayward son\nCorianton; and Samuel, the Lamanite prophet, said to an unrighteous generation of his day,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and\nye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of\nthat righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24673\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24673)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24673)\">Hel. 13:38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAlma has given us compelling evidence of his conviction that repentance is more effectual\nthan arms in maintaining peace. You will recall that he was the elected chief judge of the\nNephite nation. As such he was the governor of the people of Nephi and commander-in-chief\nof their armies. Seeing many of them dissenting and conniving with the enemy, he,\nnotwithstanding his power to strengthen and command his armies, placed the affairs of state\nin other hands that he himself might cry repentance unto the dissenters. The reasons for his\nunusual actions are given in the following quotation: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do\nthat which was just&mdash;yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the\npeople than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them&mdash;therefore\nAlma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8904\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8904)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8904)\">Alma 31:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMESSAGE OF HOPE\n<\/p><p>\nNow, my brothers and sisters, there is nothing vindictive in the message of repentance which\nwe bear. It is a message of salvation and hope, and not of condemnation. It is our purpose to\ndeclare it to our fellow men in charity and love, but we are in no sense apologetic for it. We\nknow it is of God. We bear it at his command and, we trust, in the power of his spirit.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord help us to keep in mind the place of repentance in the plan of redemption, the\nneed for it in the lives of men and nations, and our commission to proclaim it. May he help\nus to make it a daily practice in our own living that, when we do proclaim it, we may\neffectively hasten the great day envisioned by Alma when there shall be \"no more sorrow\nupon all the face of the earth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8903\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8903)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8903)\">Alma 29:2<\/a><\/span>),\nI humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
