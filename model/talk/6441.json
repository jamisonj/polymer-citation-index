During the Sunday afternoon session of general conference, April 6, 1986, a solemn assembly took place, the purpose of which was to sustain Ezra Taft Benson as prophet, seer, and revelator and 13th President of the Church. All Church members were invited to participate either by being in the Tabernacle or by means of radio or TV. As a family, we accepted the invitation to participate in our home. Except for one son then serving a mission, all were present\u2014one high priest, one priest, one deacon, an 11-year-old son, and my wife, LeAnn. By direction and in turn, each of us who held the priesthood stood; then all of us together as a family stood to sustain President Benson.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/living-prophets-seers-and-revelators.p5\" class=\"\">Why does the Lord call prophets, seers, and revelators? And how do we sustain them?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/11\/living-prophets-seers-and-revelators.p6\" class=\"\">The fundamental responsibility of prophets, seers, and revelators, all of whom bear apostolic authority, is to bear certain testimony of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world. This basic call to be a special witness of His name has remained constant whenever Apostles have been on the earth. This testimony, borne of the Holy Ghost through revelation, was the heart of the New Testament Church and is the heart of the Church today. On the day of Pentecost, Peter bore pure testimony that Jesus of Nazareth was \u201ctaken, \u2026 crucified and slain\u201d and that He was \u201craised up, having loosed the pains of death,\u201d of which they, the Apostles, were all witnesses.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-20911_000_020\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7452\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7452)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7452)\">Acts 2:23\u201324<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"7453\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7453)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7453)\">Acts 2:32<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> So powerful was this testimony of Jesus Christ, spoken by a living Apostle, that hearts were changed and about 3,000 people were baptized for the remission of their sins.
