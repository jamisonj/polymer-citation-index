You\u2019ve no doubt heard about the young girl who complained to her teenage brother about the terrible blows that life had dealt her.

This is part of the plan. Another thing that we can count on is that neither here nor hereafter are we suddenly going to emerge with qualities we haven\u2019t developed or a pattern of living for which we have not prepared ourselves. Adversity is an important part of the preparation for at least three reasons. One, God knows whom he can trust and who, like Job, will stand firm and love him unconditionally. Second, adversity well handled can increase our understanding and compassion. And we will be more effective in helping others when we\u2019ve had a few challenges of our own. We just may need to be an answer to somebody else\u2019s prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/reach-for-joy.p14\" class=\"\">And third, we draw closer to our Heavenly Father when we are in deep need. Our prayers of thanksgiving and joy of course should be part, and are a part, of our worship, but I guess there isn\u2019t anybody here who won\u2019t admit that we pray more fervently when we\u2019re under the press of problems. Attitude in adversity turns hopeless to hopeful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/reach-for-joy.p15\" class=\"\">It is a matter of the lemon and the lemonade, after all. In adversity we can complain bitterly, \u201cWhy me? Why now?\u201d and wallow in self-pity, thus denouncing God. Or we can find our way by asking that all-important question: \u201cWhich of my Heavenly Father\u2019s principles will help me now?\u201d And when we find that appropriate principle, the next step is to live that law, \u201cirrevocably decreed\u201d upon which the particular blessing that we need is predicated.

Each morning over the years she practiced an \u201cexercise in joy\u201d\u2014a kind of fervent blessing-counting session upon awakening. Imagine! An exercise in joy under those circumstances.
