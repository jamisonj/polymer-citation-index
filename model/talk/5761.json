I would like to tell you a story, brethren\u2014a true story about a man named Abinadi. Abinadi was a prophet who preached repentance to a wicked people and a wicked king.

The Aaronic Priesthood is the preparatory priesthood. It prepares you for the higher priesthood\u2014the Melchizedek Priesthood. As bearers of the Aaronic Priesthood, you must learn to obey the Lord\u2019s commandments. Honor your mother and father, keep the Sabbath day holy, do not take the Lord\u2019s name in vain, honor womanhood, be chaste, do not lie or steal, live the Word of Wisdom, and pay an honest tithing and a generous fast offering. If you keep these commandments and others, you will be richly blessed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/if-thou-wilt-enter-into-life-keep-the-commandments.p15\" class=\"\">You young deacons, teachers, and priests: Are you worthy to officiate in the preparation, passing, and blessing of the sacrament?

The sacrament that you administer each week is in remembrance of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The wondrous gift of the Atonement overcomes physical death unconditionally, and it is infinite because it is for all who have lived or will ever live in mortality. Through the Atonement, we are all redeemed from the Fall of Adam and will be resurrected.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/if-thou-wilt-enter-into-life-keep-the-commandments.p17\" class=\"\">However, for the full blessings of the Atonement to take effect in our lives and allow us to return to live with our Heavenly Father, we must repent of our sins and be faithful in obeying the commandments of God. Thus, the redemptive blessings of repentance and forgiveness are an important part of the Atonement, but they are conditional upon our faithfulness in obeying the commandments and the ordinances of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/if-thou-wilt-enter-into-life-keep-the-commandments.p18\" class=\"\">Oh, how the Lord blesses worthy bearers of the Aaronic Priesthood who bless and pass the sacrament to faithful members of the Church in His memory!

The reason is very simple. Upon receiving revelation, prophets have no choice but to proclaim and reaffirm that which God has given them to tell the world. Prophets do this knowing full well the price they may have to pay. Some who choose not to live the commandments make every effort to defame the character of the prophets and demean their personal integrity and reputation. In response, the prophets remain silent and merely turn the other cheek.
