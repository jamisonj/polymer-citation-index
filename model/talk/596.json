McKay<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">David O. McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1952, pp. 127-129<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nElder Harold B. Lee of the Council of the Twelve has just spoken to us. His address marks the last\nof a series of addresses given during this conference by the General Authorities of the\nChurch, all of whom you have heard excepting Elder Stayner Richards who is presiding over\nthe British Mission. Elder Romney, as you know, gave the Church of the Air address this\nmorning. Thus comes to a close a great conference, another glorious opportunity that the\nChurch has had of meeting together, making new resolutions, receiving timely instructions,\nand sustaining the Authorities of the Church. The weather has been most propitious. The\nattitude of the individuals who have assembled in the various gatherings, including the\nPrimary conference, has been hopeful, promising, eager; that of the congregations, most\nresponsive.\n<\/p><p>\nThe messages of the General Authorities have all been timely and inspirational; the\ncooperation of the city officials, ready and efficient. The assistance rendered by the various\nradio stations here in our own city, in Idaho, Colorado, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, and\nMexico, has been the means of permitting tens of thousands of people to hear the proceedings\nof this the 122nd Annual General Conference of the Church. To all we extend words of\nappreciation, heartfelt expressions of gratitude, for all combined to make this a most\nmemorable occasion.\n<\/p><p>\nTo our singers, the Brigham Young University chorus of young people, to our own\nTabernacle Choir, we again express our thanks.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a glorious opportunity we have had in listening to these two great organizations. To our\nchoir, I believe I will express not only your gratitude but also that of the entire city and of the\nstate, for the Salt Lake Tabernacle Choir is now an institution, not just an organization,\nappreciated by every member of the Church, and I think by every fair-minded citizen of our\nglorious state. God bless them, and those young people who came up from the Brigham\nYoung University to sing at the opening sessions of conference.\n<\/p><p>\nI have much in my heart to say to you, but I will conclude by calling your attention to the\nwords of a very practical servant of the Lord who was blessed to labor in the companionship\nand shadow of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Indeed, I think he is his own brother. James\nsaid: \n<\/p><p>\n\"What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can\nfaith save him?\n<\/p><p>\n\"If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, And one of you say unto them,\nDepart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things\nwhich are needful to the body; what doth it profit?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy\nworks, and I will shew thee my faith by my works\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26097\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26097)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26097)\">James 2:14-18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs we depart now to go to our various homes, let us make real the good feelings that have\nbeen aroused in our souls. Let us not permit to evaporate from our minds and feelings the\ngood resolutions we have formed. First, let us resolve that from now on we are going to be\nmen of higher and more sterling character, more conscious of our own weaknesses, more kind\nand charitable towards others' failings.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us resolve that we shall practice more self-control in our homes, control our tempers and\nour tongues, and control our feelings, that they may not wander beyond the bounds of right\nand purity, more seeking the presence of God, realizing how dependent we are upon him for\nsuccess in this life, and particularly for success in the positions we hold in the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nAs we leave this conference, let us not only resolve to be more loyal to our quorums but\nmore devoted to the duties assigned us, one of which is attendance at our quorum meetings, in\norder to strengthen that group and increase the power of fellowship and brotherhood, more\nloyal to our country. This is an election year. Upon you devolves the responsibility of\nchoosing our servants in government, for whoever is elected to preside over this country as\nPresident, as senators, members of the House of Representatives, are your servants, not your\nrulers. And do not be slothful on the day of election, but come out and exercise your right\nand privilege as a citizen of this great republic. What doth it profit though a man say he hath\nfaith not works? Here we should prove ourselves loyal citizens.\n<\/p><p>\nAs we depart, let us be more determined to make beautiful homes, to be kinder husbands,\nmore thoughtful wives, more exemplary to our children, determined that in our homes we are\ngoing to have just a little taste of heaven here on this earth.\n<\/p><p>\nWith these resolves in mind, with all my heart I say, fellow workers, God bless you. Cherish\nin your hearts the testimony of truth, make it as solid and as firm and unwavering as the fixed\nstars in the heavens. May there come into everyone's heart and in all our homes the true spirit\nof Christ our Redeemer, whose reality, whose inspiring guidance I know to be real.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you, keep you, and magnify you in the eyes of your associates. May he make more\npowerful than even before in the history of this Church the influence of this divine\norganization, that its potency may be felt throughout the world, and men's hearts turned to\nserve him as they have never before been influenced, that we may avert the terrible\nthreatening war, and peace be established among the nations of the world, I pray in the name\nof Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
