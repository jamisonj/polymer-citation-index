Because the natural man dwells within each one of us and because we live in a world full of pressure, controlling our temper may become one of the challenges in our lives.

What about when people disagree with your ideas, even though you are absolutely sure that they represent the proper solution to a problem? What is your response when someone offends you, critiques your efforts, or is simply unkind because he or she is in a bad mood? At these moments and in other difficult situations, we must learn to control our temper and convey our feelings with patience and gentle persuasion. This is most important within our homes and within our relationships with our eternal companions.

His conversion began in 1964, when he received a copy of the Book of Mormon. He was fascinated as he read this book, but it was not until the early \u201970s that he saw an LDS Church sign on a building in Johannesburg, South Africa, as he was walking down a street. Brother Mahlangu was intrigued and entered the building to learn more about the Church. He was kindly told that he could not attend the services or be baptized because the country\u2019s laws did not allow it at that time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/be-meek-and-lowly-of-heart.p27\" class=\"\">Brother Mahlangu accepted that decision with meekness, humility, and without resentment, but he continued to have a strong desire to learn more about the Church. He asked the Church leaders if they could leave one of the meetinghouse windows open during the Sunday meetings so he could sit outside and listen to the services. For several years, Brother Mahlangu\u2019s family and friends attended church regularly \u201cthrough the window.\u201d One day in 1980 they were told that they could attend church and also be baptized. What a glorious day it was for Brother Mahlangu.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/be-meek-and-lowly-of-heart.p28\" class=\"\">Later the Church organized a branch in his neighborhood in Soweto.

At the end of our conversation, he gave me a hug. At that moment, brothers and sisters, I felt as if I was encircled in the Savior\u2019s loving arms. Meekness emanated from this good brother\u2019s eyes. With a heart full of goodness and deep gratitude, he asked if I could just tell President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson how grateful and blessed he and many others were for having the true gospel in their lives.
