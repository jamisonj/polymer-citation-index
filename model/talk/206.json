I have been thinking\nwhile sitting here tonight that there is more divine authority, more right to use that divine\nauthority in this building tonight than in all of the rest of the world combined. We have here\nthe President of the Church, who holds the keys of the priesthood, the keys of the kingdom of\nGod; we have here the General Authorities, who have been delegated certain rights, authority,\nand power of that priesthood, and we have many other holders of the priesthood in this\naudience. I trust and pray that we will carry on our work in this priesthood in a desirable way\nbefore our Heavenly Father. I trust that the few words that I say tonight will be inspired by\nthe Spirit of God, because I do feel a weakness in standing before this great assembly.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE CONDITIONS AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR\n<\/p><p>\nWe are all rejoicing during recent days in the fact that the terrible war has come to a close\nand that the ruthless killings and destruction have been replaced by peace. I, with all of you,\nhope and pray that all of God's children throughout the entire world will cooperate with our\nHeavenly Father and his Only Begotten Son in bringing about a permanent peace; but such\nwill be the case only when we all accept and obey the pattern of life established by the\nSavior, which is conducive to peace.\n<\/p><p>\nFor a number of years human life has been regarded by the leaders of many nations of the\nearth as being very cheap. Thousands, yes, millions, of men and women have been ruthlessly\nsacrificed on the fields of battle. The philosophy of some of the major races of people has\ncompletely disregarded the sacredness of human life. Instead of honoring the dignity and\nworth of mankind, these nations referred to have honored and practically worshipped the glory\nof the group that is, the strength, power, and hope of world-dominance by their nation or race. I believe that throughout the world, generally speaking, the\nphilosophies of men have almost completely disregarded the sacredness and purpose of human\nlife; therefore, I feel a definite need today to present a few ideas regarding the Mormons'\nconcept of the sacredness and purpose of life.\n<\/p><p>\nMAN'S EXALTED POSITION IN THE UNIVERSE\n<\/p><p>\nHuman life is sacred to the Latter-day Saints&mdash;as sacred and precious as anything that\nexists&mdash;because of its divine nature. God has revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith and to the\nother holy prophets that we are his children, the divine offspring of heavenly beings. Men and\nwomen in general are the greatest of God's creative work, being made in his own image, and\nendowed through inheritance from our heavenly parents with godly characteristics just as\nmortal children are endowed with the characteristics of their earthly parents. In other words,\nwe are gods in embryo, for, as Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, has said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . [God] hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth,\n. . . For in him we live, and move, and have our being; . . . For we are also his offspring\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7540\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7540)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7540)\">Acts 17:26-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAll the prophets of the Church from Joseph Smith's day to the present time have confirmed\nthe teachings of Paul. The following statement was made by President Joseph F. Smith:\n<\/p><p>\nMan, as a spirit, was begotten and born of heavenly parents, and reared to maturity in the\neternal mansions of the Father prior to coming upon the earth in a temporal body to undergo\nan experience in mortality.\n<\/p><p>\nThis beautiful doctrine of the divinity of man does not detract in the least from the glory and\ngreat exaltation of God the Eternal Father. It merely dignifies and exalts man and makes\nhuman life more sacred and purposeful. It fills the universe with meaning, with design, and\nattaches to life a goal; and an understanding of this doctrine should fill man's heart with love,\ncharity, and good will toward all of the human family.\n<\/p><p>\nIf one accepts that he is a son of God, in contrast to the concept that he is the offspring of an\nanimal, he becomes impressed with the unlimited potential possibilities which are his. His\neyes are turned heavenward instead of toward the ground. His hope is to become\nglorified&mdash;exalted&mdash;even like unto his heavenly parents.\n<\/p><p>\nBecause of the closeness of the relationship between God and man and because of the great\nvalue and sacredness of human life, the Eternal Creator has always shown a special interest in\nthe human family. He revealed to Father Adam the gospel plan of salvation, and has\ncontinued to reveal to his children from that day forward eternal truths to the full amount and\nextent that they were capable of receiving. He has established several gospel dispensations\nupon the earth; and throughout the entire course of human history he has earnestly pleaded\nwith men to live in peace, in love, and in harmony with each other, as advocated in that\ndivine plan. But ruthless and ungodly men from time to time have disregarded the sacredness\nof human life, and have brought wars, suffering, disease, and shame upon the human family.\n<\/p><p>\nHUMAN LIFE PRECIOUS IN THE SIGHT OF GOD\n<\/p><p>\nIn spite of the actions of his children, God has continuously retained his interest in them. He\nsent his Only Begotten Son into the world to teach us that we should love the Lord our God\nwith all our hearts and that we should love our neighbors as ourselves. This divine\nteacher&mdash;the Man of Galilee&mdash;attached a sacredness to human life that has never been fully\nappreciated nor comprehended by mortals. It is true that chosen Israel had known the\nperennial law of \"Thou shalt not kill\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22559\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22559)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22559)\">Ex. 20:13<\/a><\/span>); but the magnificent doctrine declared by the Son of\nGod was that \". . . there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over the sinner that\nrepenteth\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31152\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31152)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31152)\">Luke 15:10<\/a><\/span>).\nIn words of tenderness and power the Master of life and death told\nhis eager listeners the beautiful parables of \"The Lost Sheep,\" of \"The Lost Coin,\" and that\nthe well need no physician, but he who is ill\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33973\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33973)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33973)\">Matt. 9:12<\/a><\/span>).\nWith open arms he cried, \"All ye who are sick\nand weary come unto me, and I will give you rest\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33979\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33979)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33979)\">Matt. 11:28-30<\/a><\/span>).\nNever before had the downtrodden, the\noutcast, and the discouraged of the human family received such a powerful ray of light to heal\nthem of their afflictions and to turn them unto God and unto a better life as when they felt the\npower of the message of the Master. Even the sinner learned that he and life were important,\nand that there was hope for him to receive something more beautiful, more joyous, and more\ngodly than he had hitherto experienced.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter delivering a message of peace and hope to a troubled world, Jesus Christ gave his life\nas a voluntary sacrifice in order that we might live. Human life is so sacred and so valuable\nto the Eternal Father \"that he gave his Only Begotten Son in order the we might gain eternal\nlife\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27180\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27180)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27180)\">John 3:16<\/a><\/span>).\nEven in our day Jesus has again emphasized the importance of a human soul in the\nfollowing declaration:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . if is so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and\nbring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of\nmy Father! And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me\ninto the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls\nunto me! (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12086\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12086)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12086)\">D&amp;C 18:15-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is no wonder that the angels of heaven rejoice when God's children repent and seek after\neternal life (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31153\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31153)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31153)\">Luke 15:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHE RELIGION OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS A PRACTICAL ONE\n<\/p><p>\nAnother reason why Mormons maintain that life is sacred is that God has revealed to them\nthat life is eternal. We believe that we build our own characters through the actions we\ncommit&mdash;whether they be evil or good; and the type of characters we mould for ourselves will\nbe ours throughout the eternities.\n<\/p><p>\nThus, thinking upon the sacredness and eternal nature of life leads us into the doctrine of the\npurpose of life. One of the most clear-cut statements given in the scriptures on the purposes\nof life was a remark made by Father Lehi to his children. In his own words: \"Men are that\nthey might have joy\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3463\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3463)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3463)\">2 Ne. 2:25<\/a><\/span>).\nThat concept is basic in the philosophy of Mormonism. We maintain\nthat life and religion are the same thing: that religion is a seven-day-a-week concern of our\npeople, and that it concerns itself with the temporal as well as the spiritual phases of life. To\nthe Mormons the bread-and-butter problem is as much religion and of interest to our Church\nas is attending meetings or taking care of the other spiritual duties. If men have joy in\nsufficient abundance, they must have a proper amount of economic prosperity. Therefore, one\nof the purposes of life is to arrange, distribute, and equalize wealth in such a manner as to\nbring joy to the largest number of people. If the gospel of Jesus Christ were lived as the\nMaster intends that it should be, all of God's children throughout the world, would enjoy the\nblessings derived from economic security\n<\/p><p>\nA life of joy is a life free from sin. In the words of another Nephite prophet: \"Sin never was\nhappiness\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8843\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8843)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8843)\">Alma 41:10<\/a><\/span>).\nIt should be said, then, that one of the main purposes of life is to have\nopportunities to learn the will of God and choose for ourselves the amount of obedience\nwhich we desire to render. In fact, Mormonism teaches that one of the main purposes of\nmortal existence is to give us the opportunity to partake of all the good experiences of\nmortality, and through the great principle of faith follow the road of progression and\nrighteousness which will eventually bring us back into the presence of our Eternal Father and\nhis Only Begotten Son.\n<\/p><p>\nIn other words, the Mormon concept of the purpose of life is growth&mdash;growth intellectually,\ngrowth physically, growth morally, and growth spiritually. We call that principle of growth,\neternal progression. Mortality marks one short span in the process, but to us today it is the\nmost important period, because God has declared that if we keep this estate in righteousness\nwe shall have glory added upon our heads forever and ever.\n<\/p><p>\nThe immortal beings in the unseen world and the children of men upon the earth are working\nin cooperation to bring about this perpetual growth of human personality. The greatest\nrevelation ever given on this subject was when God informed Moses as follows:\n<\/p><p>\nFor behold, this is my work and my glory&mdash;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of\nman (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38918\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38918)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38918)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf we add to this statement the following pertinent remarks made by the Master of life,\nwherein he said:\n<\/p><p>\nI am come that they [men] might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27195\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27195)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27195)\">John 10:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom\nthou hast sent (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27203\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27203)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27203)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>),\n<\/p><p>\nthen we see more clearly God's purpose of our mortal and eternal existence.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE WAY TO KNOW GOD\n<\/p><p>\nThe only way we can know God is to live as he lives, to think as he thinks, and to experience\nwhat he experiences. Interpreted in this light, we are brought face to face with the powerful\nMormon doctrine which declares that \"As man is God once was, and as God is man may be.\"\nIt is positively true that the growth, the eternal progression, for which life offers opportunities\nreach their culminating point in a life patterned after that of Jesus; therefore, it is the purpose\nof life to live as the Savior taught us to live and as he himself lived.\n<\/p><p>\nI trust in faith to our Heavenly Father that he will help us that we may live that type of life.\nBefore closing I wish to bear testimony that I am sure that we are all engaged in the work of\nGod. I feel thankful to him for the opportunity that I have and that you have in the\npriesthood, in helping in his great cause. I know that the prophets of the Lord from Joseph\nSmith's time, to and including the present President of the Church, are divinely inspired and\ncalled of God our Eternal Father, and I wish to sustain the President of the Church with all\nmy heart in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
