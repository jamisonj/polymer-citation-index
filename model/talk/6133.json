Abraham took Isaac, his son, at the Lord\u2019s direction, to offer him up unto the Lord as a sacrifice. Because of this great love and obedience to the commandments, the Lord stayed Abraham\u2019s hand from offering Isaac and blessed Abraham and said, \u201cI will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24148\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24148)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24148)\">Gen. 22:17<\/a><\/span>). The blessing of Abraham is still upon his seed, and the covenant that was made is theirs to have as Abraham\u2019s seed comes unto Christ. The Apostle Paul taught, \u201cAnd if ye be Christ\u2019s, then are ye Abraham\u2019s seed, and heirs according to the promise\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23374\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23374)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23374)\">Gal. 3:29<\/a><\/span>).

That really means they are all around us. Are we looking? Are we asking? Are our good friends or the people we work with who are nonmembers the seed of Abraham?

Jim belonged to another church, but he found it was hard to obtain transportation to attend meetings. No one picked him up. I had the good fortune to meet Jim. A Book of Mormon was given; a commitment was made to read and pray. Our members provided transportation for Jim to come to the St. Charles Ward. The missionaries taught the discussions, and Jim read and prayed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/pearls-from-the-sand.p13\" class=\"\">At Jim\u2019s baptism, he asked me, his bishop, \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d I took Jim to my office and talked about the Church, teaching him about the priesthood and what the Lord would have him do as a member of the Church. He received the Aaronic Priesthood and was assigned to serve as a home teacher. The elders quorum president assigned a strong, faithful, diligent home teaching companion. Brother Hueston, as the newest member of the St. Charles Ward, made sure that his home teaching was completed. Not only for that first month but for the past 20 years he has completed his home teaching every month. He has served in many different callings, and serving as a stake missionary was one of his favorites.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/pearls-from-the-sand.p14\" class=\"\">Ward members wrapped their arms around Brother Hueston and made sure that he was a fellow citizen \u201cwith the saints, and of the household of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22087\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22087)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22087)\">Eph. 2:19<\/a><\/span>).

Our Father in Heaven wants all of Abraham\u2019s seed to return to Him.
