These directions were clearly communicated to prepare us for our earthly experiences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/search-the-scriptures.p4\" class=\"\">Our Heavenly Father continues to communicate with us through revelation. These revelations are communications of divine directions. They may come to us personally or through the voice of the Lord\u2019s chosen servants, the prophets, seers, and revelators. Those revelations received by prophets are given to us in the form of scripture or by the voice of the living prophets. Thus the scriptures become a road map, a set of divine directions to assist us on our journey through mortality and our return trip home. Just as a road map not read, the scriptures not searched are of little value to us in providing directions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/search-the-scriptures.p5\" class=\"\">Are we studying our divine directions daily? When was the last time we checked our celestial compass to see if we are still on course? The road to the celestial kingdom is one way. When we fail to search the scriptures, we may find ourselves going the wrong way on a one-way highway.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Scriptures<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/search-the-scriptures.p7\" class=\"\">The Savior gave us a clear concept of what constitutes scripture.

Even with the difficulty of the task, Jacob felt it important to use a portion of the plates to express his tender feelings as to how he hoped that we would receive the words he had written. He said: \u201cAnd we labor diligently to engraven these words upon plates, hoping that our beloved brethren and our children will receive them with thankful hearts, and look upon them that they may learn with joy and not with sorrow, neither with contemp.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25974\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25974)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25974)\">Jacob 4:3<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/search-the-scriptures.p14\" class=\"\">Some have suffered death to make it possible for us to have the scriptures today. Historically, the scriptures in the Bible were reserved for the clergy, with the reading of them by others being denounced. At times laws even prohibited the public or private reading of them.

The scriptures teach and testify of Jesus Christ. They teach us much that we need to know and to do to return to the presence of the Savior. John was specific in giving the purpose of the scriptures when he said: \u201cBut these [things] are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29630\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29630)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29630)\">John 20:31<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/search-the-scriptures.p17\" class=\"\">Nephi bore witness as to the reason he had recorded the revelations when he said: \u201cAnd I, Nephi, have written these things unto my people, that perhaps I might persuade them that they would remember the Lord their Redeemer.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2072\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2072)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2072)\">1 Ne. 19:18<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Importance<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/search-the-scriptures.p19\" class=\"\">The scriptures should be of the greatest importance in our lives.

The scriptures are spiritual food for our spirit, which is just as important as physical food for our body. It was so important for Lehi to have the scriptures and records which were engraven on the brass plates that the Lord commanded Nephi to slay Laban in order to obtain them. The Lord knew of their importance for the spiritual nourishment of Lehi and his descendants. He explained: \u201cIt is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2052\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2052)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2052)\">1 Ne. 4:13<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/search-the-scriptures.p21\" class=\"\">In contrast, the Mulekites, who migrated to the American continent shortly after Lehi and his family left Jerusalem, failed to bring with them any sacred scriptures or records.
