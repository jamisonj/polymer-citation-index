This hope\u2014the expectation of enjoying the fruits of our labors\u2014is one of the most powerful sources of motivation. As a reason for service, it necessarily involves faith in God and in the fulfillment of his prophecies. The scriptures are rich in promises of eternal rewards. For example, in a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith in June 1829, the Lord said: \u201cIf you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18074\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18074)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18074)\">D&amp;C 14:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/why-do-we-serve.p38\" class=\"\">The last motive I will discuss is, in my opinion, the highest reason of all.

The Apostle Paul affirmed and illustrated that truth in his great teaching about the reasons for service:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/why-do-we-serve.p40\" class=\"\">\u201cThough I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/why-do-we-serve.p41\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, \u2026 and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"734\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 734)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(734)\">1 Cor. 13:1\u20133<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/why-do-we-serve.p42\" class=\"\">We know from these inspired words that even the most extreme acts of service\u2014such as giving all of our goods to feed the poor\u2014profit us nothing unless our service is motivated by the pure love of Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/why-do-we-serve.p43\" class=\"\">If our service is to be most efficacious, it must be accomplished for the love of God and the love of his children. The Savior applied that principle in the Sermon on the Mount, in which he commanded us to love our enemies, bless them that curse us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them that despitefully use us and persecute us. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"36981\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36981)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36981)\">Matt. 5:44<\/a><\/span>.)

The Savior must have seen it so, since he joined his commandment for selfless and complete love directly with the ideal of perfection. The very next verse of the Sermon on the Mount contains this great commandment: \u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36984\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36984)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36984)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/why-do-we-serve.p47\" class=\"\">This principle of service is reaffirmed in the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/why-do-we-serve.p48\" class=\"\">\u201cTherefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18065\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18065)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18065)\">D&amp;C 4:2<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/why-do-we-serve.p49\" class=\"\">We learn from this command that it is not enough to serve God with all of our <span class=\"emphasis\">might and strength.<\/span> He who looks into our hearts and knows our minds demands more than this.
