Hunter\u2019s grandson attended tithing settlement with his father some time ago. The bishop indicated his pleasure in the young lad\u2019s wanting to pay a full tithing and asked him if he thought the gospel was true. This seven-year-old boy, having paid his full tithe of fourteen cents, said he guessed the gospel was true, \u201cbut it sure costs a lot of money.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/the-responsibility-of-young-aaronic-priesthood-bearers.p73\" class=\"\">We learn in our youth to pay an honest tithing. The Lord requires one-tenth of what we earn. If you work as a bagger in a grocery store, the money you are paid for every tenth bag of groceries you carry out to a car belongs to the Lord. Pay your tithing monthly or weekly as you are paid. Never be in debt to the Lord. Spiritual and temporal blessings will be yours as you carefully honor this commandment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/the-responsibility-of-young-aaronic-priesthood-bearers.p74\" class=\"\">Football came to our country town later than most. The school board had neither the money for equipment nor a coach. Then the great day arrived. Our high school principal was able to buy twelve inexpensive football outfits, except the expensive cleated football shoes (we used our basketball shoes), and our coach was recruited from the faculty because he had witnessed a game.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/the-responsibility-of-young-aaronic-priesthood-bearers.p75\" class=\"\">We learned a few simple plays, how to tackle\u2014or so we thought\u2014and set off for our first game with Twin Falls, the previous year\u2019s Idaho state champions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/the-responsibility-of-young-aaronic-priesthood-bearers.p76\" class=\"\">We dressed and went out on the field to warm up. Their school band started to play (they had more students in the band than we had in our entire high school), and then through the gates came their team.

To say it was a learning experience is rather mild. After two plays we didn\u2019t have any desire to have the ball\u2014so we would kick it, and soon they would score.

Our problem was to get rid of the ball\u2014it was less punishing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/the-responsibility-of-young-aaronic-priesthood-bearers.p78\" class=\"\">In the final minutes of the game they became a little reckless. A wild pass fell into the arms of Clifford Lee, who was playing halfback with me. He was startled, not knowing for sure what to do\u2014until he saw the \u201cDallas Cowboys\u201d thundering after him. Then he knew what to do. He was fast. He wasn\u2019t running for points, but for his life! Clifford made a touchdown; six points went up on the board. The final score\u2014106 to 6! We really didn\u2019t deserve the six points, but with our torn shirts and socks and our bruises, we took them anyway.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/the-responsibility-of-young-aaronic-priesthood-bearers.p79\" class=\"\">A learning experience?

I remember so clearly being ordained a deacon. A new world opened up for me. I was now living on a higher plane. As I would hear people say, \u201cYou hold the priesthood,\u201d it was not easy to fully comprehend. But with humble teachers, we began to understand that as deacons we had been given blessings and authority to do sacred things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/the-responsibility-of-young-aaronic-priesthood-bearers.p81\" class=\"\">As quorum officers we accounted for all of our members and would see that they were all at church. We enjoyed being together. We chopped wood for the elderly and the widows, filled the coal bins at church, cleaned the meetinghouse every Saturday afternoon, swept the steps, raked the gravel yard, saw that the sacrament trays and lace sacrament cloths were clean and fresh, and had real pride in the appearance of our little meetinghouse.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/the-responsibility-of-young-aaronic-priesthood-bearers.p82\" class=\"\">We were part of the Church and the Church was part of us. We knew it; we felt it! We held the priesthood of God! Understanding teachers guided us and helped us broaden our vision and our ever-expanding role as young men; but more important, they helped prepare us to be called in our youth to be servants of our Savior. He needs every one of you young men who hold the priesthood. I testify that this work is true. I do it humbly, in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
