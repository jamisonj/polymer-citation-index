Moyle<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Second Counselor in the First Presidency<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Henry D. Moyle, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1960, pp. 56-59<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy beloved brethren and sisters, I know we were all thrilled at the beginning of this\nconference yesterday morning with the inspired remarks of President David O. McKay.\nAmong other things he said: \"Man holds dominion over earth, sea, and air, and now is intent\nupon conquering space.\" All that man has accomplished, and all further advancement in every\nrealm of human activity made by man will aid in the accomplishment of God's ultimate\npurpose for us here in mortality&mdash;that is to say, the establishment of his Church and kingdom\nhere upon this earth, preparatory to the advent of the second coming of the Savior of mankind.\n<\/p><p>\nThere may be men who still continue to contend that there is a conflict between church and\nreligion on one side, and science on the other, but little do they understand that all truths\npertaining to science as well as to religion emanate from our Father in heaven. He has power\nover his truths. He can withhold them from men when there is a purpose in so doing, and\nlikewise can inspire men to discover and recognize truths, and advocate them to their fellow\nmen. And so, science and religion alike are entirely obligated to God, and so are we all.\nNeither science nor religion can successfully refute the second coming of Christ. The evidence\nis too complete, too convincing, too much a part of the great eternal plan of God, as much a\npart and as real as our mortal earth existence. We might as well deny the one as the other.\n<\/p><p>\nTo me the astonishing fact is, that recently in England we were pointed out as peculiar\nbecause we believe \"that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will\nbe renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6754\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6754)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6754)\">A of F 1:10<\/a><\/span>).\nIn spite of this Tenth Article of Faith of ours,\npublished to the world for now a hundred years, we are characterized as pagan and are said\nnot to be Christians. How can anyone deny the second coming of Christ and be a Christian?\nAnd how can anyone know of his second coming and not be his follower?\n<\/p><p>\nLet me read what the Church of England's great expert on Mormonism recently had to say:\n\"Mormonism is essentially a pagan faith, and not Christian at all.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe London Daily Sketch, on February 1st, entitled an article published therein, written by\nMr. Neville Randall \"Knock, Knock&mdash;It's Those Mormons.\" In part, this article said: \"On a\nthousand doors in Britain during the week-end came a knock. . . . This week it may be your\nturn to open your door to a quiet, soft-spoken American. To hear him say the words: 'Will\nyou become a Mormon?' If you let him he will try to persuade you: \n<\/p><p>\n\"To give up smoking and drinking&mdash;even tea and coffee.\n<\/p><p>\n\"To give a tenth of your income to the Mormon Church.\n<\/p><p>\n\"To accept a religion with no prayer book and no paid clergy.\n<\/p><p>\n\"To put off baptizing your children until they are eight.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Last year 1,404 Britons were converted,\" says the article. \"In Britain now 220 American\nMormon missionaries, most of them young men in their early twenties, are at work. They call\nat 2,000,000 homes a year. In December they baptized 237, more than in any month for a\nhundred years. What harm&mdash;or good&mdash;can the Mormons do to you if you let them convince\nyou? This is what they told me: \n<\/p><p>\n\"You would believe that Christ will come to earth again. More than a million Mormons . . .\nbelieve every word of this. About a third of the male Mormons, and quite a few women,\nbelieve it sincerely enough to give up two years of their lives, usually when they are at\ncollege, to serve on a mission. They are unpaid&mdash;expenses come from their own or their\nfamilies' savings. The Mormons are determined to give you a chance to judge for yourself.\nListen for the knock.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe are grateful to the newspaper for giving to the people of England that challenge&mdash;indeed,\nthat invitation, to listen not alone to the knock, but also inferentially to that which they are\ntold by our elders.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the English Church, as in many others, the Lord's Prayer is an essential\npart of their religious service and is repeated by the congregation. They therefore pray: \"Our\nFather which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35020\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35020)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35020)\">Matt. 6:9-10<\/a><\/span>).\nThus unwittingly do they pray for that which they evidently do not believe will occur.\n<\/p><p>\nThe clergyman was right when he warned his neighbors that our elders would teach them of\nthe second coming of Christ. We will teach them from their own translation of the Bible that\nthe white robed angels spoke to the apostles of old as the resurrected Christ ascended from\ntheir midst on Mount Olivet.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken\nup from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7853\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7853)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7853)\">Acts 1:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe know he will come, even as he ascended, a material being, a living Personage, separate\nand apart from the Father, with an immortalized body of flesh and bones. This is our\nwork&mdash;to prepare for the second coming of Christ. This is the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times,\nspoken of by Paul, the Apostle (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21714\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21714)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21714)\">Eph. 1:10<\/a><\/span>).\nWe have in our hands, with which to work, all that has gone\nbefore in all generations of man. We deny final consummation of his mission here upon the\nearth if we deny his second coming. Thus only can the revealed gospel of Jesus Christ be\npresented in its fulness&mdash;by teaching the world of the second coming of Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nIn our own Doctrine and Covenants we read: \"Unto whom I have committed the keys of my\nkingdom, and a dispensation of the gospel for the last times; and for the fulness of times, in\nthe which I will gather together in one all things, both which are in heaven, and which are on\nearth\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13859\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13859)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13859)\">D&amp;C 27:13<\/a><\/span>).\nThis is part of the second coming.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again: \". . . for it is necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness of\ntimes, which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete and perfect\nunion and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories should take\nplace, and be revealed from the days of Adam even to the present time. And not only this, but\nthose things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the world, but have been\nkept hid from the wise and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this, the\ndispensation of the fulness of times\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13942\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13942)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13942)\">D&amp;C 128:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"For the hour is nigh, and that which was spoken by mine apostles must be fulfilled; for as\nthey spoke so shall it come to pass; \n<\/p><p>\n\"For I will reveal myself from heaven with power and great glory, with all the hosts thereof,\nand dwell in righteousness with men on earth a thousand years, and the wicked shall not\nstand\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13861\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13861)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13861)\">D&amp;C 29:10-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThese are but a sample of numerous declarations found in modern scripture predicting the\ncoming of Christ once again to complete his mission in glory here on the earth. We can\nreadily turn to that which was recorded by the apostles of old and give to you the testimonies\nof Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and again repeated in more modern revelation as in the\nBook of Mormon in Third Nephi, of which President Clark spoke yesterday.\n<\/p><p>\nThe words of Jesus Christ recorded by Matthew: \"For the Son of man shall come in the glory\nof his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35052\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35052)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35052)\">Matt. 16:27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all\nnations; and then shall the end come.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the\ncoming of the Son of man be.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of\nthe earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with\npower and great glory.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together\nhis elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35072\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35072)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35072)\">Matt. 24:14,27,30-31<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he\nsit upon the throne of his glory\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35076\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35076)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35076)\">Matt. 25:31<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMatthew doesn't leave any doubt about this second advent, and the words of\nthe Christ as recorded by Mark goes on to say: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful\ngeneration; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his\nFather with the holy angels\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33125\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33125)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33125)\">Mark 8:38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not\ngive her light,\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds,\nfrom the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33129\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33129)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33129)\">Mark 13:24-27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I can assure you he will not find his elect upon all of those roads of which President\nClark spoke yesterday, supposed to lead to heaven, but it will be in that straight and narrow\npath of which the Savior himself spoke\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35030\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35030)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35030)\">Matt. 7:14<\/a><\/span>), in which the obedient will be found and which\nconstitutes the only way by which we can constitute ourselves his elect and be called up and\nchosen to rule and reign with the Savior of mankind here upon the earth for a thousand years.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the gospel according to Luke is written: \"For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my\nwords, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31524\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31524)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31524)\">Luke 9:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd John, in the Revelation, says: \"And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is\nthe Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon\nthem, and judgment was given unto them; and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for\nthe witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast,\nneither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and\nthey lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.
