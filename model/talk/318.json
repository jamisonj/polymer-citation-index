Since I should like to say what\nI have to say in the best way I can say it, I have written it down and shall read it. I hope that\nwhat I shall say will be in harmony with the spirit of this great conference, I think the\ngreatest I have attended in its high spiritual tone.\n<\/p><p>\nTRIBUTE TO PIONEERS\n<\/p><p>\nAt the near close of this one hundredth year of the entering into these valleys\nof your fathers and your mothers, some of yours and mine, I wish to speak a few further\nwords of humble tribute and thanksgiving to them, and especially to the meekest and lowliest\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34145\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34145)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34145)\">Matt. 11:29<\/a><\/span>)\nof them, those great souls, majestic in the simplicity of their faith and in their living\ntestimony of the truth of the restored gospel, to those souls in name unknown, unremembered,\nunhonored in the pages of history, but lovingly revered round the hearthstones of their\nchildren and their children's children who pass down from generation to generation the story\nof their faith and their mighty works, and the righteousness of their lives and living, those\nsouls who worked and worked, and prayed and followed, and wrought so gloriously.\n<\/p><p>\nI would not take away one word of praise or gratitude, honor or reverence from the great men\nwho led these humble ones of ours. They were mighty men in brain and brawn, in courage\nand valor, in honesty and in love of truth, living near the Lord&mdash;Brothers Brigham and Heber\nand Wilford and Willard and Charles, the two Orsons and Parley, and John and George and\nErastus and Lorenzo and Daniel and Joseph and Jedediah, and a host of other giants, each and\nall richly blessed with the Lord's divine love and with that gift of the Holy Ghost that made\nthem leaders truly like unto Moses of old\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12403\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12403)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12403)\">D&amp;C 107:91<\/a><\/span>).\nI yield, we yield, to no one in our gratitude for\nthem and for their work of directing the conquest of the wilderness and of saving men's souls.\nTheir names shine lustrously on those pages of history which record only the doings of the\nmakers of epochs&mdash;those choice spirits, chosen before the foundation of the world, to be the\nleaders and builders of dispensations of God's dealings with men; and these leaders of ours to\nbe the builders of that dispensation which of old was named the Dispensation of the Fulness\nof Time. Unnumbered eternities will remember and honor them.\n<\/p><p>\nBut I should like now and here to say a few words about those who trod after where those\ngiants led, some in the same companies that the Brethren piloted, some in later companies\nfollowing that year and the years after, some in the fateful handcarts with their un-excelled\ndevotion, heroism, and faith, all trickling forward in a never-failing, tiny stream, till they\nfilled the valley they entered and then flowed out at the sides and ends, peopling this whole\nwilderness-waste which they fructified, making it to fulfil the ancient prophecy that the desert\nshould blossom as the rose (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25058\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25058)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25058)\">Isa. 35:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHEY OF THE LAST WAGON\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to say something about the last wagon in each of the long wagon trains that\ntoiled slowly over the plains, up mountain defiles, down steep, narrow canyons, and out into\nthe valley floor that was to be home&mdash;this last wagon: last, because the ox team that pulled it\nwas the smallest and leanest and weakest, and had the tenderest feet of any in the train; it was\nslow starting, and slow moving; last, because worn and creaking, it took more time to fix and\nto grease, for young Jimmy generally had trouble in getting the wagon jack\nunder the \"ex\"; last, because its wind-rent cover was old and patched and took hours to mend\nand tie up to keep out the storm; last, because the wife, heavy with child, must rest till the\nvery moment of starting; last, because sickly little Bill, the last born, poorly nourished, must\nbe washed and coaxed to eat the rough food, all they had; last, because with all his\ntasks&mdash;helping little Bill, cooking and cleaning up the breakfast,&mdash;Mother was not able to help\nmuch&mdash;Father took a little longer little longer to yoke his cattle and to gird himself for the\nday's labor; last, because his morning prayers took a few more minutes than the others\nspent&mdash;he had so many blessings to thank the Lord for and some special blessings to ask the\nLord to grant blessings of health and strength, especially for his wife, and for little Bill, and\nfor the rest, and then the blessings for himself that his own courage would not fail, but most\nof all for the blessing of faith, faith in God and in the Brethren who sometimes seemed so far\naway. For they were out in front where the air was clear and clean and where they had\nunbroken vision of the blue vault of heaven. The Brethren had really visioned the glory of the\nLord, who walked near them, put his thoughts into their minds; his spirit guided and directed\nthem, petitioned thereto by the thousands of Saints who were back in Winter Quarters, back\nin Iowa, back in the States, and beyond, even across the waters, for the faithful poured out\ntheir souls in fervent prayer to Almighty God that the Brethren should be inspired. The Saints\nbuoyed up the Brethren out in front with encouragement, with praise, and sometimes even\nwith adulation. Knowing the Brethren were prophets of God, the Saints gave them full\nconfidence, daily, almost hourly, expressed. The Brethren lived in a world of commendation\nfrom friends and the tried and true Saints. Rarely was their word or their act questioned by\nthe faithful Saints. This was as it should be and had to be to carry out the Lord's purposes.\n<\/p><p>\nBut back in the last wagon, not always could they see the Brethren way out in front, and the\nblue heaven was often shut out from their sight by heavy, dense clouds of the dust of the\nearth. Yet day after day, they of the last wagon pressed forward, worn and tired, footsore,\nsometimes almost disheartened, borne up by their faith that God loved them, that the restored\ngospel was true and that the Lord led and directed the Brethren out in front. Sometimes, they\nin the last wagon glimpsed, for an instant, when faith surged strongest, the glories of a\ncelestial world, but it seemed so far away, and the vision so quickly vanished, because want\nand weariness and heartache and sometimes discouragement were always pressing so near.\nWhen the vision faded, their hearts sank. But they prayed again and pushed on, with little\npraise, with not too much encouragement, and never with adulation. For there was nearly\nalways something wrong with the last wagon or with its team&mdash;the off ox was a little lame in\nthe right front shoulder; the hub of the left front wheel was often hot; the tire of the hind\nwheel on the same side was loose. So corrective counsel, sometimes strong reproof, was the\nrule, because the wagon must not delay the whole train. But yet in that last wagon there was\ndevotion and loyalty and integrity, and above and beyond everything else,\nfaith in the Brethren and in God's power and goodness. For had not the Lord said that \"not\neven a sparrow falleth unnoticed by the Father, and were they not of more value than\nsparrows?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34143\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34143)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34143)\">Matt. 10:29-31<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd then they had their testimony burning always like an eternal fire on a holy\naltar, that the restored gospel was true, and that Joseph was a prophet of God, and that\nBrigham was Joseph's chosen successor.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the train moved forward in the early morning sun and the oxen with a swinging pull\nthat almost broke the tongue got that last wagon on the move, the dust in the still morning air\nhung heavy over the road. Each wagon from the first stirred up its own cloud, till when the\nlast wagon swung into line, that dust was dense and suffocating. It covered the last wagon and\nall that was in it; it clung to clothes; it blackened faces; it filled eyes already sore, and ears.\nThe wife, soon to be a mother, could hardly catch her breath in the heavy, choking dust, for\neven in the pure air she breathed hard from her burden. Each jolt of the wagon, for those\nahead had made wagon ruts almost \"ex\" deep, wrung from her clenched lips a half-groan she\ndid her best to keep from the ears of the anxious, solicitous husband plodding slowly along,\nguiding and goading the poor dumb cattle, themselves weary from the long trek. So through\nthe long day of jolting and discomfort and sometimes pain, sometimes panting for breath, the\nmother, anxious only that the unborn babe should not be injured, rode, for she could not\nwalk; and the children walked, for the load was too heavy and big for them to ride; and the\nfather walked sturdily alongside and prayed.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen in the evening the last wagon creaked slowly into its place in the circle corral, and the\nBrethren came to inquire how the day had gone with the mother, then joy leaped in their\nhearts, for had not the Brethren remembered them? New hope was born, weariness fled, fresh\nwill to do was enkindled; gratitude to God was poured out for their knowledge of the truth,\nfor their testimony that God lived, that Jesus was the Christ, that Joseph was a prophet, that\nBrigham was his ordained successor, and that for the righteous a crown of glory awaited that\nshould be theirs during the eternities of the life to come. Then they would join in the songs\nand dancing in the camp, making the camp's gaiety their own, as much as Mother's condition\nwould permit.\n<\/p><p>\nThen the morning came when from out that last wagon floated the la-la of the newborn babe,\nand mother love made a shrine, and Father bowed in reverence before it. But the train must\nmove on. So out into the dust and dirt the last wagon moved again, swaying and jolting,\nwhile Mother eased as best she could each pain-giving jolt so no harm might be done her, that\nshe might be strong to feed the little one, bone of her bone, flesh of her flesh\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23522\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23522)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23522)\">Gen. 2:23<\/a><\/span>). Who will dare\nto say that angels did not cluster round and guard her and ease her rude bed, for she had\ngiven another choice spirit its mortal body that it might work out its God-given destiny?\n<\/p><p>\nMy mother was one of those babes so born in 1848, ninety-nine years ago.\n<\/p><p>\nAnother morning came, when courageous little Bill, who, with a hero's heart, had trudged\nthrough long days of hot sun and through miles of soggy mud in the rain, his little body\ndrenched, little Bill, weak and wan, must be crowded in to ride with Mother, for he was sick\nfrom a heavy cold. Months before, on that cold winter's night when they had fled Nauvoo for\ntheir lives to escape the fiendish wrath of a wild mob, Bill became dangerously ill with\npneumonia, which left him with weak lungs. This old illness now returned. He grew worse\nand worse. The elders came and prayed he might get well. But the Lord wanted little Bill\nwith him. So a few mornings later a weeping mother and a grief-stricken father and that last\nwagon swung into place in the line, leaving beside the road, under some scrub brush a little\nmound, unmarked save for heaped-up rocks to keep out the wolves, a mound that covered\nanother martyr to the cause of truth.\n<\/p><p>\nSo through dust and dirt, dirt and dust, during the long hours, the longer days&mdash;that grew into\nweeks and then into months, they crept along till, passing down through its portals, the valley\nwelcomed them to rest and home. The cattle dropped to their sides, wearied almost to death;\nnor moved they without goading, for they too sensed they had come to the journey's end.\n<\/p><p>\nThat evening was the last of the great trek, the mightiest trek that history records since\nIsrael's flight from Egypt, and as the sun sank below the mountain peaks of the west and the\neastern crags were bathed in an amethyst glow that was a living light, while the western\nmountainsides were clothed in shadows of the rich blue of the deep sea, they of the last\nwagon, and of the wagon before them, and of the one before that, and so to the very front\nwagon of the train, these all sank to their knees in the joy of their souls, thanking God that at\nlast they were in Zion. \"Zion, Zion, lovely Zion, beautiful Zion, Zion, City of our God.\" They\nknew there was a God, for only he could have brought them triumphant, militant, through all\nthe scorn, the ridicule, the slander, the tarrings and featherings, the whippings, the burnings,\nthe plunderings, the murderings, the ravishings of wives and daughters, that had been their lot,\nthe lot of their people since Joseph visioned the Father and the Son.\n<\/p><p>\nBut hundreds of these stalwart souls of undoubting faith and great prowess, were not yet at\ntheir journey's end.\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Brigham again called them to the colors of the kingdom of God, and sent them to\nsettle the valleys, near and remote, in these vast mountains of refuge. So again they yoked\ntheir oxen and hitched up their teams, and putting their all in the covered wagon, this time\nwillingly, unwhipped by the threat of mob cruelty and outrage, they wended their slow way to\nnew valleys, again trusting with implicit faith in the wisdom and divine guidance of their\nMoses. The very elements obeyed their faith, faith close kin to that which made the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24222\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24222)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24222)\">Heb. 11:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThese tens of thousands who so moved and so built were the warp and the woof of Brother\nBrigham's great commonwealth. Without them Brother Brigham had failed his mission. These\nwere the instruments&mdash;the shovelers, the plowers, and sowers and reapers, the machinists, the\narchitects, the masons, the woodworkers, the organ builders, the artisans, the mathematicians,\nthe men of letters, all gathered from the four corners of the earth, furnished by the Lord to\nBrother Brigham and the prophet leaders who came after, that he and they might direct the\nworking out of His purposes. These wrought as God inspired Brother Brigham and the other\nprophets to plan, all to the glory of God and the up-building of his kingdom.\n<\/p><p>\nUpright men they were, and fearless, unmindful of what men thought or said of them, if they\nwere in their line of duty. Calumny, slander, derision, scorn left them unmoved, if they were\ntreading the straight and narrow way. Uncaring they were of men's blame and censure, if the\nLord approved them. Unswayed they were by the praise of men, to wander from the path of\ntruth. Endowed by the spirit of discernment, they knew when kind words were mere courtesy,\nand when they betokened honest interest. They moved neither to the right nor to the left from\nthe path of truth to court the good favor of men.\n<\/p><p>\nCONTRIBUTIONS OF HUMBLE SOULS\n<\/p><p>\nSo for a full hundred years, urged by the spirit of gathering and led by a burning testimony of\nthe truth of the restored gospel, thousands upon tens of thousands of these humble souls, one\nfrom a city, two from a family (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26459\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26459)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26459)\">Jer. 3:14<\/a><\/span>),\nhave bidden farewell to friends and homes and loved ones,\nand with sundered heartstrings, companioned with privation and with sacrifice even to life\nitself, these multitudes have made their way to Zion, to join those who were privileged to\ncome earlier, that all might build up the kingdom of God on earth&mdash;all welded together by\ncommon hardship and suffering, never-ending work and deep privation, tragic woes and\nheart-eating griefs, abiding faith and exalting joy, firm testimony and living spiritual\nknowledge&mdash;a mighty people, missioned with the salvation, not only of the living, but of the\ndead also, saviors not worshipers of their ancestors, their hearts aglow with the divine fire of\nthe spirit of Elijah, who turns the hearts of the fathers to the children and of the children to\nthe fathers (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32709\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32709)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32709)\">Mal. 4:5-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd thousands upon thousands of these tens of thousands, from the first till now, all the elect\nof God (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12371\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12371)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12371)\">D&amp;C 84:34<\/a><\/span>),\nmeasured to their humble calling and to their destiny as fully as Brother Brigham and\nthe others measured to theirs, and God will so reward them. They were pioneers in word and\nthought and act and faith, even as were they of more exalted station. The building of this\nintermountain empire was not done in a corner\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7591\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7591)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7591)\">Acts 26:26<\/a><\/span>)\nby a select few but by this vast multitude\nflowing in from many nations, who came and labored and wrought, faithfully following their\ndivinely called leaders.\n<\/p><p>\nWE MUST RISE BY OUR OWN LABOR\n<\/p><p>\nIn living our lives let us never forget that the deeds of our fathers and mothers are theirs, not\nours; that their works cannot be counted to our glory; that we can claim no excellence and no\nplace, because of what they did, that we must rise by our own labor, and that labor failing we\nshall fail. We may claim no honor, no reward, no respect, nor special position or recognition,\nno credit because of what our fathers were or what they wrought. We stand upon our own\nfeet in our own shoes. There is no aristocracy of birth in this Church; it belongs equally to the\nhighest and the lowliest; for as Peter said to Cornelius, the Roman centurion, seeking him:\n<\/p><p>\n. . .

God keep their\nmemories ever fresh among us, their children, to help us meet our duties even as they met\ntheirs, that God's work may grow and prosper till the restored gospel of Jesus Christ rules all\nnations and all peoples, till peace, Christ's peace, shall fill the whole earth, till \"righteousness\nshall cover the earth even as the waters cover the mighty deep\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25051\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25051)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25051)\">Isa. 11:9<\/a><\/span>).
