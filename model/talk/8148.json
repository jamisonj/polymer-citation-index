At approximately 2:46 p.m., a 9.0-magnitude massive earthquake struck. I was not able to stand because of the intense shaking, and I held tightly to a stair rail. Lights on nearby ceilings began falling to the floor. All of Tokyo was in a panic.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">Fortunately, I was not injured, and four hours later, I was relieved to learn that my entire family was safe.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">On television there was a stream of terrifying, shocking footage. A massive tsunami surged into the Sendai mission area\u2014sweeping away everything in its path: cars, houses, factories, and fields. I was stunned by the tragic images, and I wept. And I fervently prayed that our Heavenly Father\u2019s protection and assistance would be upon all the people living in this region that I so dearly love.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">Later, it was confirmed that all the missionaries and Church members were safe. However, many members were affected, losing their family members, homes, and household possessions. Nearly 20,000 people perished, communities were destroyed, and many people were forced to leave their homes as a result of a nuclear power plant accident.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">Disasters such as this are wreaking havoc in many parts of the world today, causing much loss of life. We are warned that disasters, wars, and countless difficulties in the world will occur.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">When trials such as these suddenly come upon us, we may question, \u201cWhy do these things happen to me?\u201d or \u201cWhy do I have to suffer?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">For a long period after I converted to the gospel, I didn\u2019t have a clear answer to the question \u201cWhy am I given trials?\u201d I understood the part of the plan of salvation that says we will be tested. However, in reality, when it came to this question, I did not have a conviction that was powerful enough to adequately answer it. But there came a time in my life when I too experienced a major trial.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">When I was 30 years old, I was visiting the Nagoya mission as part of my work. After the meeting, the mission president kindly arranged for the elders to drive me to the airport. However, as we reached the intersection at the bottom of a long hill, a large truck came barreling down from behind us at great speed. It rammed into the rear of our car and propelled it forward more than 70 feet (20 m). The terrifying part of all of this was there was no driver. The rear of our car was compacted to half its original size. Fortunately, both the elders and I survived.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">However, on the following day, I began experiencing pain in my neck and shoulders and developed a severe headache. From that day, I couldn\u2019t sleep and I was forced to live each day with both physical and mental pain. I prayed to God to please heal my pain, but these symptoms lingered on for about 10 years.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">At this time, feelings of doubt also began creeping into my mind, and I wondered, \u201cWhy do I have to suffer this much pain?\u201d However, even though the kind of healing I sought was not granted, I strove\u00a0to be faithful in keeping God\u2019s commandments. I continued to pray that I would be able to resolve the questions I had about my trials.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">There came a time when I found myself struggling with a few additional personal issues, and I was agitated because I did not know how to cope with this new trial. I was praying for an answer. But I didn\u2019t receive an answer right away. So I went and talked with a trusted Church leader.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">As we were talking, with love in his voice, he said, \u201cBrother Aoyagi, isn\u2019t your purpose for being on this earth to experience this trial? Isn\u2019t it to accept all the trials of this life for what they are and then leave the rest up to the Lord? Don\u2019t you think that this problem will be resolved when we are resurrected?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">When I heard these words, I felt the Spirit of the Lord very strongly. I had heard this doctrine countless times, but the eyes of my understanding had never been opened to the extent they were at this time. I understood this was the answer that I had been seeking from the Lord in my prayers. I was able to clearly comprehend our Heavenly Father\u2019s plan of salvation and understand anew this important principle.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">In Abraham, the Lord God declared, \u201cAnd we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-12461_000_048\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131442\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131442)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131442)\">Abraham 3:25<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">The principle is that the God who created the heavens and the earth knows the grand design of this earth, that He has dominion over all things in the heavens and the earth, and that in order to bring to pass the plan of salvation, He provides us with many different experiences\u2014including some trials\u2014while we are on this earth.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">And the Lord said the following to Joseph Smith:<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">\u201cKnow thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.\u00a0\u2026<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p22\" class=\"\" id=\"p22\">\u201cTherefore, <span class=\"emphasis\">hold on thy way \u2026 ,<\/span> for God shall be with you forever and ever.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-12461_000_048\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131443\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131443)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131443)\">Doctrine and Covenants 122:7, 9<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/hold-on-thy-way.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">The trials of this earth\u2014including illness and death\u2014are a part of the plan of salvation and are inevitable experiences.
