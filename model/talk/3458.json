Our response, then, would be out of the fulness of our hearts\u2014with joy, with faith, and with a feeling of challenge and innovation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/follow-joyously.p5\" class=\"\">I am reminded of a visit I had with President Kimball.

The first of these major moves was made in April 1979, when President Ezra Taft Benson announced the establishment of priesthood councils at every level of Church government. Last October the Relief Society\u2019s role in priesthood councils was explained. We directed Relief Society leaders regarding their participation and involvement. From reports received, this instruction is now beginning to be implemented, and a better working relationship between priesthood and Relief Society leaders is resulting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/follow-joyously.p14\" class=\"\">The next action taken by Relief Society to carry out its responsibilities and contribute more effectively in the welfare program came last spring.

She makes nourishing soups, such as split pea, onion, minestrone, and consomm\u00e9, using marrow bones and soup meat. Then she serves the meat as a main course dish with a savory sauce or garnish. Colorful fresh vegetables are added to make a complete and satisfying meal. Occasionally she prepares chicken from which she makes delicious chicken dumplings, chicken salad, or chicken sandwiches. This homemaker uses necks, backs, and other less meaty parts that many discard to provide a base for the aromatic broth from which soups are made for the days ahead. This woman draws from a home garden of beautiful fruits, vegetables, and herbal seasonings to make the family meals to \u201cplease the eye and to gladden the heart; \u2026 for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17431\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17431)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17431)\">D&amp;C 59:18\u201319<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/follow-joyously.p39\" class=\"\">I sense in this homemaker a happy, creative spirit that makes provident living an enriched way of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/follow-joyously.p40\" class=\"\">She understands\u2014as we each should\u2014that life is made up of small daily acts.

Provident homes come not by decree or by broad brushstroke. Provident homes come from small acts performed well day after day. When we see in our minds the great vision, then we discipline ourselves by steady, small steps that make it happen.
