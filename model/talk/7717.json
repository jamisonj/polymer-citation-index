Beck spoke. It is entitled <span class=\"emphasis\">Fulfilling My Duty to God.<\/span> As I read and pondered what it expects young men to do and to become, I realized that it was describing what President Brigham Young promised to the priesthood holder who is diligent over a lifetime: \u201cAn individual who holds a share in the Priesthood, and continues faithful to his calling, who delights himself continually in doing the things God requires at his hands, and continues through life in the performance of every duty will secure to himself not only the privilege of receiving, but the knowledge [of] how to receive the things of God, that he may know the mind of God continually.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-09205_000_026\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Brigham Young<\/span> (1997), 128.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/act-in-all-diligence.p7\" class=\"\">Just a few weeks ago, I saw a new deacon start on that path of diligence. His father showed me a diagram his son had created that showed every row in their chapel, a number for each deacon who would be assigned to pass the sacrament, and their route through the chapel to serve the sacrament to the members. The father and I smiled to think that a boy, without being asked to do it, would make a plan to be sure he would succeed in his priesthood service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/act-in-all-diligence.p8\" class=\"\">I recognized in his diligence the pattern from the new <span class=\"emphasis\">Duty to God<\/span> booklet.

He had been a bishop twice. His first call as a bishop, years before I met him, had been when he was young. Now he was old, released for the second time as a bishop. His increasing physical limitations made any priesthood service very difficult.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/act-in-all-diligence.p11\" class=\"\">Yet he had a plan to act in diligence. He sat every Sunday he could get to church near the row nearest the door where most of the people would enter for the sacrament meeting. He got there early to be sure a seat was vacant. Each person arriving could see his look of love and welcome, just as they did when he sat on the stand as their bishop. His influence warmed and lifted us because we knew something of the price he paid to serve. His task as a bishop was finished; his priesthood service did not end.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/act-in-all-diligence.p12\" class=\"\">You have seen such examples of great priesthood servants.
