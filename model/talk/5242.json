The year was 1962, and a call was received from President David O. McKay to serve in the Mexican Mission. Shortly after receiving the call, I learned that I had bone cancer in my right arm and that the probability of my living many weeks was extremely low. A blessing was received from a wonderful father, wherein he blessed me with my life and that the mission call would be fulfilled, and that I would have a family and be able to serve the Lord all my days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/nobody-said-that-it-would-be-easy.p6\" class=\"\">The doctor congratulated me on being one who had great faith in the Savior but assured me that I didn\u2019t realize the seriousness of what I had. As some of you have noticed, I only have one arm as a result of that problem; but ten months after having my arm amputated, I entered the Mexican Mission, full of excitement and ready to work. You see, young men, I had several years earlier committed to the Lord that I would serve a full-time mission and that I would not let anything stop me from fulfilling that call. Well, brethren, the doctor passed away twenty years ago, always amazed to see me still breathing, and he actually became quite interested in the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/nobody-said-that-it-would-be-easy.p7\" class=\"\">Brethren, I want you to know that having one arm for nearly thirty years has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It hasn\u2019t been my greatest challenge, but it has been a great teacher to me, teaching me to be more patient and tolerant with others as I have had to learn to be more patient with myself. It has helped me to understand the necessity of our having challenges in life to help develop our character and stamina, helping us to become what the Lord ultimately wants us to become.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/nobody-said-that-it-would-be-easy.p8\" class=\"\">Our challenges may be physical, spiritual, economic, or emotional, but if we will treat them as opportunities and stepping-stones in our progress, rather than barriers and stumbling blocks, our lives and growth will be wonderful.

After two years, there were 500 members of the Church in five branches and an organized district. This was done by a handful of nineteen- and twenty-year-old faithful missionaries and two wonderful couples, who gave of themselves to see that others of Heavenly Father\u2019s children might know and understand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/nobody-said-that-it-would-be-easy.p50\" class=\"\">After the missionaries had been in the Huasteca for about three weeks, we received a phone call from one of them, and we could tell that he was slightly discouraged, not having yet received any mail, being in a hot area with high humidity, and learning about a culture that was new to all of us. After we had talked for a minute or two, I reminded him that we had talked about the fact that it wouldn\u2019t be easy. He said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right, President; that\u2019s right.

A couple of months later, while he was at BYU, he and some of his former companions called Sister Dickson and me at the mission home in Mexico City at 2:30 in the morning, waking us from a very sound sleep. After a short conversation, I mentioned the fact that it was wonderful to talk with them but that it seemed a little late at night to be calling.
