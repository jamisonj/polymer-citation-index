That experience occurred in the premortal life when you were informed that finally your time had come to leave the spirit world to dwell on earth with a mortal body. You knew you could learn through personal experience the lessons that would bring happiness on earth, lessons that would eventually lead you to exaltation and eternal life as a glorified, celestial being in the presence of your Holy Father and His Beloved Son. You understood that there would be challenges, for you would live in an environment of both righteous and evil influences. Yet surely you resolved no matter what the cost, no matter what the effort, suffering, and testing, you would return victorious. You had been reserved to come when the fulness of the gospel is on earth. You arrived when His Church and the priesthood authority to perform the sacred temple ordinances are in place. You anticipated being born into a home where parents would be expected to love, nurture, strengthen, and teach you truths. You knew that in time you would have the opportunity to form your own eternal family as husband or wife, father or mother. Oh, how you must have rejoiced with that prospect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/first-things-first.p5\" class=\"\">These words express the most fundamental purpose of your being on earth:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/first-things-first.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cWe will make an earth whereon these may dwell;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/first-things-first.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/first-things-first.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7129\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7129)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7129)\">Abr. 3:24\u201326<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/first-things-first.p9\" class=\"\">After Adam was placed on earth, God said, \u201cLet us make an help meet for the man, for it is not good that the man should be alone\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7132\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7132)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7132)\">Abr. 5:14<\/a><\/span>).

They had children who also formed families. \u201cAnd Adam and Eve, his wife, ceased not to call upon God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38848\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38848)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38848)\">Moses 5:16<\/a><\/span>). The pattern of families essential to Father\u2019s plan of happiness was established, and our need to continually \u201ccall upon God\u201d emphasized. You are in the midst of living that plan. Through the restored gospel we learn there is an <span class=\"emphasis\">ideal family.<\/span> It is a family composed of a righteous Melchizedek Priesthood bearer with a righteous wife sealed to him and children born in the covenant or sealed to them. With a mother in the home in an environment of love and service, the parents teach their children, through example and precept, the ways of the Lord and His truths. They fulfill their divinely appointed roles mentioned in the family proclamation. Their children mature by living teachings instilled from birth. They develop characteristics of obedience, integrity, love of God, and faith in His holy plan. In due course, each of those children seeks a companion with similar ideals and aspirations. They are sealed in the temple, bear children, and the eternal plan continues, with generation strengthening generation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/first-things-first.p10\" class=\"\">Throughout your life on earth, seek diligently to fulfill the fundamental purposes of this life <span class=\"emphasis\">through the ideal family.<\/span> While you may not have yet reached that ideal, do all you can through obedience and faith in the Lord to consistently draw as close to it as you are able. Let nothing dissuade you from that objective. If it requires fundamental changes in your personal life, make them. When you have the required age and maturity, obtain all of the ordinances of the temple you can receive. If for the present, that does not include sealing in the temple to a righteous companion, live for it. Pray for it. Exercise faith that you will obtain it. Never do anything that would make you unworthy of it. If you have lost the vision of eternal marriage, rekindle it. If your dream requires patience, give it. As brothers, we prayed and worked for 30 years before our mother and our nonmember father were sealed in the temple. Don\u2019t become overanxious. Do the best you can. We cannot say whether that blessing will be obtained on this side of the veil or beyond it, but the Lord will keep His promises. In His infinite wisdom, He will make possible all you qualify in worthiness to receive. Do not be discouraged. Living a pattern of life as close as possible to the ideal will provide much happiness, great satisfaction, and impressive growth while here on earth regardless of your current life circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/first-things-first.p11\" class=\"\">Satan and his hosts will do all in their power to keep you from obtaining the ordinances required for the ideal family. He will attempt to distract you from centering your mind and heart on raising a strong family by nurturing your children as the Lord requires.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/first-things-first.p12\" class=\"\">Are there so many fascinating, exciting things to do or so many challenges pressing down upon you that it is hard to keep focused on that which is essential? When things of the world crowd in, all too often the wrong things take highest priority. Then it is easy to forget the fundamental purpose of life. Satan has a powerful tool to use against good people. It is distraction. He would have good people fill life with \u201cgood things\u201d so there is no room for the essential ones. Have you unconsciously been caught in that trap?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/first-things-first.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cMen are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man.

Only to live a pleasurable life and to make choices to do the things you want to do? Or is there a more fundamental reason\u2014to be able to make the choices that will lead you to fully implement your purpose for being here on earth and to establish priorities in your life that will assure the development and happiness the Lord wants you to receive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/first-things-first.p15\" class=\"\">Recently I met an intelligent young man with great potential. He was undecided about a mission. He has decided not to attend a university now. In his free time he only does what he likes to do. He doesn\u2019t work because he doesn\u2019t have to, and it would take time from pleasure. He passed seminary classes without much thought of personally applying the knowledge gained. I noted: \u201cYou are making choices today that appear to give you what you want: an easy life, abundant enjoyment, and not much sacrifice. You can do that for a while, yet every decision you make narrows your future. You are eliminating possibilities and options. There will come a time, and it won\u2019t be too distant, where you are going to spend the rest of your life doing things you don\u2019t want to do, in places you don\u2019t want to be, because you have not prepared yourself. You are not taking advantage of your opportunities.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/first-things-first.p16\" class=\"\">I mentioned how everything I treasure today began to mature in the mission field. Missionary service is not something we do for ourselves, yet great growth and preparation for the future is gained from a mission. There they focus outside of themselves on other people. They draw close to the Lord and really learn His teachings. They find individuals interested in the message but not sure of its worth. Missionaries try with every capacity\u2014prayer, fasting, and testifying\u2014to help individuals embrace the truth. A mission teaches one to be led by the Spirit, to understand our purpose for being on earth and how to accomplish it. I gave him a blessing. As he left, I prayed earnestly that the Lord would help him choose the right priorities. Otherwise, he will fail in life\u2019s purpose.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/first-things-first.p17\" class=\"\">In stark contrast, consider the example of another young man. Through the years I have watched how his parents have taught him from infancy to unwaveringly live the commandments of God. By example and precept, they nurtured him, together with their other children, in truth. They encouraged the development of discipline and sacrifice to obtain worthy goals. This young man chose swimming to instill in his character those qualities. Early-morning practice sessions required discipline and sacrifice. Over time he excelled in that sport.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/first-things-first.p18\" class=\"\">Then came the challenges\u2014for example, a championship swim meet on Sunday. Would he participate? Would he rationalize an exception to his rule of not swimming on Sunday to help his team win the championship? No, he would not yield, even under intense peer pressure. He was called names, even physically abused. But he would not yield. The rejection of friends, the loneliness, and the pressure brought times of sadness and tears. But he would not yield. He was learning firsthand what each of us must come to know, the reality of Paul\u2019s counsel to Timothy, \u201cAll that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5073\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5073)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5073)\">2 Tim. 3:12<\/a><\/span>). Over the years this consistent pattern of righteous living\u2014woven from hundreds of correct decisions, some in the face of great challenge\u2014has developed a character of strength and capacity. Now, as a missionary, he is appreciated by his peers for his ability to work, his knowledge of truth, his unwavering devotion, and his determination to share the gospel. One who earlier was rejected by his peers now has become a respected leader of his peers. Is there a message for you in these examples?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/first-things-first.p19\" class=\"\">While wholesome pleasure results from much we do that is good, it is not our prime purpose for being on earth.
