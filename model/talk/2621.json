Finally that time did arrive, and I came under the influence of some very dedicated leaders. They taught me what it meant to say, \u201cOn my honor I will do my best.\u201d And I learned that the Scout motto, \u201cBe Prepared,\u201d meant that I should strive diligently on a continuous basis to try to so develop myself physically, mentally, socially, morally, and spiritually that I would be prepared for whatever came my way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p4\" class=\"\">Those were choice days, those Scouting days, and I had the opportunity to participate in many exciting activities. They were teamed up with some very choice spiritual experiences in my home and in Church, particularly in the Aaronic Priesthood, the Sunday School, and the MIA. As a result, the horizons of my understanding were pushed back and I gained a more complete understanding than I had had up to that point on the purpose and meaning of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p5\" class=\"\">I learned that this life is not the beginning, neither is it the end of our existence, for we lived before we came to this earth in a preexistent world as spiritual children of our Father in heaven. And we came to this earth to obtain mortal bodies and to prove ourselves by demonstrating that we would keep the commandments and be obedient, no matter how difficult the tests in life might be. Now with this broadening, my brothers and sisters, of the base of my understanding, I came to realize that the most important business of this life is to prepare for eternal life, which, as the Lord has said, is the greatest of all of God\u2019s gifts to his children.

Let me share some of his statements with respect thereto. Nephi said: \u201cThere shall be many which shall teach \u2026 false and vain and foolish doctrines \u2026 and their works shall be in the dark.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3947\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3947)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3947)\">2 Ne. 28:9<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p11\" class=\"\">He also said that in these latter days Satan would \u201crage in the hearts of \u2026 men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd others he will pacify and lull away into carnal security, \u2026 and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cOthers he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell \u2026 [and] no devil, \u2026 and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from which there is no deliverance.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3948\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3948)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3948)\">2 Ne. 28:20\u201322<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p14\" class=\"\">I should like to emphasize, my brothers and sisters, that those words of Nephi apply to some members of our Church today and not just to some individuals who are not members of our Church. May I suggest that all of us do some soul-searching on that matter and make whatever corrections are necessary to get back on course.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p15\" class=\"\">It has been said that when the time to perform arrives, the time to prepare has passed. Now, while that is true in many situations, it is not universally the case. Those of you who have taken part in athletic competition, particularly in track-and-field events, know that while an individual goes to great pains and puts in many hours of hard work trying to build a strong base from which he might be able to perform at his best, preparation actually continues during the competition and right during the performance time. So we need to keep that in mind, too. This is not just a once-over deal; it is something that can be added upon from time to time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p16\" class=\"\">Those of you who have participated in jumping or throwing events in track and field know that a competitor is not eliminated after one attempt. He gets three tries at a certain height, or three broad jumps and so on, before his competition has ended. And those who take part in distance racing go around the track a number of times before the race is ended. May I suggest that the foregoing also applies to our opportunities to prepare for eternity, provided we do not procrastinate our repentance until the end.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p17\" class=\"\">In life we can alter our course through repentance, get back on course, and proceed vigorously toward that great goal of eternal life. Let me emphasize that if we are to qualify for eternal life we must perform righteously in this life. We must strive diligently to make the most of our mortal lives and to be valiant in the service of the Master. Let me emphasize that the sooner we get started on making the most of our mortal life, the better it will be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p18\" class=\"\">This, of course, brings into focus the important roles and responsibilities that parents, teachers, and leaders have with respect to getting young people started out right, because it certainly is true that \u201cjust as the twig is bent, so is the tree inclined.\u201d (Pope, \u201cMoral Essays.\u201d) But this also points out the responsibility that each individual has to chart a course in life that is in keeping with the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p19\" class=\"\">No one can begin to serve the Lord too early. Alma, in counseling his son Helaman, said this: \u201cO, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9229\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9229)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9229)\">Alma 37:35<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p20\" class=\"\">Hans Christian Andersen, a great story writer, said this: \u201cTime is so fleeting that if we do not remember God in our youth, age may find us incapable of thinking of him.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p21\" class=\"\">Youth is the time to build a strong physical, mental, moral, and spiritual base, to prepare for missionary service and temple marriage, to establish challenging goals, and to experience the satisfaction that comes from worthy achievement.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p22\" class=\"\">Preparation is not just a personal matter. Every individual, of course, has the responsibility to put his or her own life in order, but we have responsibilities to others also: teachers do, leaders do, and certainly parents do. Parents have the responsibility to put their households in order and to prepare those family members so that every member can qualify for eternal life. Family preparedness in all of its aspects, spiritual and temporal, is of the utmost importance because the family is eternal, and exaltation in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom will actually be family exaltation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/a-time-to-prepare.p23\" class=\"\">Some individuals seem to feel that there is no need for haste in the observance of gospel principles and in keeping the commandments.
