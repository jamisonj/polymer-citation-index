My assignment with the Young Women presidency puts me in many happy situations. One month ago a training assignment took me to Guayaquil, Ecuador. I arrived at the hotel after dark. The next morning I opened my curtains, and there across the valley was a beautiful granite building standing majestically on the Santa Ana Hills. Its stunning beauty was evident, but it wasn\u2019t until I saw the angel Moroni on top that I, with tears in my eyes, realized that here was a temple, a symbol of the glorious blessings that will come to the members of the Church in that part of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/preparing-our-families-for-the-temple.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cTemples are unique among all buildings. \u2026 They are places of covenants and promises.

Hinckley<\/span> [1997], 632\u201333). Wherever we went, we found that temples are being built, temples that will lift the Saints of God and change the face of countries, whether in South America or throughout the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/preparing-our-families-for-the-temple.p6\" class=\"\">Has it only been one year since our beloved prophet announced the building of 32 more temples?

If this is true, then as parents and family members our greatest challenge is to prepare our families for the temple.

Packer, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Holy Temple<\/span> [booklet, 1982], 2). But in a family setting, there are many precious truths that, with sensitivity and common sense, will help prepare our children for the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/preparing-our-families-for-the-temple.p11\" class=\"\">Consider:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<ul class=\"bullet\"><li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">The sacred nature of the temple clothing.<\/span> In the temples all are dressed in white.

A young woman who wears knee-length skirts will not have to buy a new wardrobe after she receives her endowment in the temple.

Family home evening is the formal setting, but there are so many more places where we may talk about our spiritual feelings for the temple. One of my favorite times was when my children were in bed at night. Occasionally I would lie on their bed and tell them of spiritual things. There in the peace and the quiet, the sweet Spirit can bear testimony to their heart and soul that the things you are saying are true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/preparing-our-families-for-the-temple.p17\" class=\"\">We may assume that Joseph and Mary taught their family about the temple. As Elder Perry has discussed, when the Savior was a 12-year-old boy, His parents took Him to the Feast of the Passover in Jerusalem. When Jesus was left behind, He was not found in places or entertainments for a boy His age. His parents found Him in the temple. Perhaps when Mary tucked Him in bed at night, she shared her testimony of these sacred and precious truths.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/preparing-our-families-for-the-temple.p18\" class=\"\">My first memory of temples was when I was a little girl. I knew the temple must be a pretty wonderful place because my parents faithfully attended, and they always came home together in such a good mood. I understood the sacred nature of the temple clothing by the way my mother spoke about it with love and respect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/preparing-our-families-for-the-temple.p19\" class=\"\">President Howard W.

Listen to this promise by President Hinckley: \u201cIf there were more temple work done in the Church, there would be less \u2026 selfishness, less \u2026 contention, less \u2026 demeaning [of] others.

I even checked out a tape from the local library by a public speaker who admitted that his goal was to someday speak in the Mormon Tabernacle. I thought at the time, <span class=\"emphasis\">I\u2019ll never be speaking in the Tabernacle!<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Elder John A. Widtsoe has said, \u201cAt the most unexpected moments, in or out of the temple will come to [us], as a revelation, the solution of the problems that vex [our lives]. \u2026 It is a place where revelations may be expected\u201d (\u201cTemple Worship,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine,<\/span> Apr. 1921, 63\u201364).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">4.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">One of the biggest lessons I have learned is that Satan will try to keep us from going to the temple.<\/span> During a discussion with friends once, they shared with me that whenever they attend, they don\u2019t tell anybody they are going. They just jump into their cars and go, because if they don\u2019t something is sure to happen to keep them away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I remember reading of a warning given by the president of the Logan Temple that Satan and his followers will \u201cwhisper in the ears of the people persuading them not to go to the Temple\u201d (\u201cGenealogical Department,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Church News,<\/span> 12 Dec. 1936, 8). \u201cTemple work brings so much resistance because it is the source of so much spiritual power to the Latter-day Saints\u201d (Boyd K.

It took each girl a year to save enough money to go. These faithful young women rode a bus almost two days\u2019 journey through three country borders and spent two or three days at the temple before returning home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In another ward, young people have located the names of 10,000 ancestors as they have turned their hearts to their families.

As we visited, I asked if her husband was with her. With a look of tenderness in her eyes, she shared with me that he had died of a brain tumor three months ago. The temple is her anchor; the Spirit found in the temple gives her comfort and peace, and perhaps her husband was there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/preparing-our-families-for-the-temple.p31\" class=\"\">Each of us may ask ourselves, \u201cHow often should I attend the temple?\u201d Our leaders will never tell us how often we should attend, because it is different for every person. Many women of various ages who live close to a temple try to go once a week. When one of my friends worked full time, she spent one day a month in the temple, attending several sessions. These women are obedient, but they also understand the strength of priesthood power that comes into their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/preparing-our-families-for-the-temple.p32\" class=\"\">For young parents, attending the temple may be a once-a-month date.
