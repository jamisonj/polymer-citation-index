I hear some parents say, \u2018We\u2019re letting our son make up his own mind regarding a mission,\u2019 or \u2018We hope our son fills a mission because it would be such a growing experience for him.\u2019\u201d He continued: \u201cI have heard some young men say, \u2018I think I might serve a mission if I really want to go.\u2019\u201d President Kimball raised his voice, stood on tiptoe\u2014as he is prone to do when anxious to communicate with power a special thought\u2014and said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter whether Mother or Father thinks it might be nice for a son to serve a mission.

He left behind his wife, his seven children, the farm, and all that he had. Did he lose anything? President Benson tells how his mother would gather the family around the kitchen table and there, by the flickering light of an oil-fueled lamp, read the letters from her husband. Several times during the reading there would be a pause to wipe away the tears which flowed freely. The result? Each of the children later served a mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p11\" class=\"\">As we strive to respond to President Kimball\u2019s clarion call to missionary service, perhaps we should examine the Aaronic Priesthood pathway which provides the training, quickens the desire, and leads the lad who journeys along it not only to a missionary call but also to temple marriage and, at journey\u2019s end, even to exaltation in the celestial kingdom of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p12\" class=\"\">It is essential, even critical, that we study the Aaronic Priesthood pathway, since far too many boys falter, stumble, then fall without crossing the finish line into the quorums of the Melchizedek Priesthood. In fact, today, for the first time in the history of the Church, the prospective elders outnumber the holders of the Melchizedek Priesthood, thereby eroding the active priesthood base of the Church and curtailing the activity of loving wives and precious children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p13\" class=\"\">What can we as leaders do to reverse this trend? How can we assure that every boy becomes a finisher? The place to begin is at the headwaters of the Aaronic Priesthood stream. There is an ancient Chinese proverb which purports to correctly determine the sanity of an individual. A person is shown a stream of water flowing into a stagnant pond. He is given a bucket and asked to commence to drain the pond. If he first takes steps to effectively dam the inflow to the pond, he is adjudged sane. If, on the other hand, he ignores the inflow and tries to empty the pond bucket by bucket, he is designated insane.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p14\" class=\"\">The best and most effective manner whereby we can solve the challenge of the growth in numbers of prospective elders is to concentrate on the Aaronic Priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p15\" class=\"\">The bishop, by revelation, is the president of the Aaronic Priesthood and is president of the priests in his ward.

He cannot delegate these God-given responsibilities. However, he can place accountability with his counselors and name as quorum advisers men who can touch the lives of boys\u2014indeed, men who are models to follow. Were I a bishop tonight, I would turn to my second counselor and say: \u201cBrother Balmforth, you have the duty to look after the deacons in the ward. Yours is the task to ensure that every boy is worthy and is ordained a teacher when he reaches his fourteenth birthday.\u201d Then I would address my first counselor with the thought: \u201cBrother Hemingway, yours is the duty to make certain that every teacher is worthy and is ordained a priest when he reaches sixteen. As the bishop, I will assume the task to so labor with the young men who are priests that they are worthy and are ordained elders as they embark on their missions.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p16\" class=\"\">This, then, is our assignment: to save every boy, thereby assuring a worthy husband for each of our young women, strong Melchizedek Priesthood quorums, and a missionary force trained and capable of accomplishing what the Lord expects.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p17\" class=\"\">A wise first step is to guide each deacon to a spiritual awareness of the sacredness of his ordained calling. In my life this was accomplished when the bishopric asked that I take the sacrament to a shut-in who lived about a mile from the chapel. That special Sunday morning, as I knocked on the door of Brother Wright and heard his feeble reply, \u201cCome in,\u201d I entered not only his humble cottage but also a room filled with the Spirit of the Lord. I approached his bedside and carefully placed a piece of the bread to his lips. I then held the cup of water, that he might drink. As I departed, I saw him smile as he said, \u201cGod bless you, my boy.\u201d And God did bless me with an appreciation for the sacred emblems which continues even today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p18\" class=\"\">Is every ordained teacher given the assignment to home teach? What an opportunity to prepare for a mission. What a privilege to learn the discipline of duty. A boy will automatically turn from concern for self when he is assigned to \u201cwatch over\u201d others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p19\" class=\"\">And what of the priests? These young men have the opportunity to bless the sacrament, to continue their home teaching duties, and to participate in the sacred ordinance of baptism.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p20\" class=\"\">I remember as a deacon watching the priests as they would officiate at the sacrament table. One priest had a lovely voice and would read the sacrament prayers with clear diction\u2014as though he were competing in a speech contest. The older members of the ward would compliment him on his \u201cgolden voice.\u201d I think he became a bit proud. Another priest in the ward had a hearing impediment which caused his speech to be unnatural in its sound. We deacons would twitter at times when Jack would bless the emblems. How we dared do so is beyond me: Jack had hands like a bear and could have crushed any of us. On one occasion Barry with the beautiful voice and Jack with the awkward delivery were assigned together at the sacrament table. The hymn was sung; the two priests broke the bread. Barry knelt to pray, and we closed our eyes. But nothing happened. Soon we deacons opened our eyes to see what was causing the delay. I shall ever remember Barry frantically searching the table for the little white card on which were printed the sacrament prayers. It was nowhere to be found. What to do? Barry\u2019s face turned pink, then crimson, as the congregation began to look in his direction. Then Jack, with that bear-like hand, reached up and gently tugged Barry back to the bench. He, himself, then knelt on the little stool and began to pray: \u201cOh God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it. \u2026\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18089\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18089)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18089)\">D&amp;C 20:77<\/a><\/span>] He continued the prayer, and the bread was then passed. Jack also blessed the water, and it was passed. What respect we deacons gained that day for Jack who, though handicapped in speech, had memorized the sacred prayers. Barry, too, had a new appreciation for Jack. A lasting bond of friendship had been established.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p21\" class=\"\">Beyond the influence of the bishopric and the Aaronic Priesthood quorum advisers is the impact of the home. Help of parents, when enlisted wisely, can frequently make the difference between success and failure. Our recent surveys reveal that the influence of the home surpasses all other factors as a determinant of missionary service and temple marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p22\" class=\"\">Not to be overlooked are the strength and influence of devoted Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidencies. The revelations are crystal clear in their meaning: \u201cVerily I say unto you, the duty of a president over the office of a deacon is to preside over twelve deacons, to sit in council with them, and to teach them their duty, edifying one another, as it is given according to the covenants.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18183\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18183)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18183)\">D&amp;C 107:85<\/a><\/span>.) A similar charge is given to the president of the teachers quorum and to the bishop as president of the quorum of priests.

Stake presidents, do you ensure that your high councilors who serve on this most important committee visit the quorums of the Aaronic Priesthood on a continuing and regular basis? Do these brethren know the names of each Aaronic Priesthood boy in the stake? Generalities simply will not do. When we deal in generalities, we will never have a success; but as we deal in specifics, we will rarely have a failure.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p24\" class=\"\">I am reminded of the ward presided over by our own Joseph B. Wirthlin. Bishop Wirthlin had a quorum of forty-five priests. All forty-five became elders. All filled missions. The late Elder Alvin R. Dyer presided over a quorum of forty-eight priests. Forty-six of the total served full-time missions, and forty-seven married in the House of the Lord. It can indeed be done. Each boy must be saved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p25\" class=\"\">When I served as a bishop, I noted one Sunday morning that one of our priests was missing from the priesthood meeting. I left the quorum in the care of the adviser and visited Richard\u2019s home. His mother said he was working at the West Temple Garage. I drove to the garage in search of Richard and looked everywhere but could not find him. Suddenly, I had the inspiration to gaze down into the old-fashioned grease pit situated at the side of the station. From the darkness I could see two shining eyes. Then I heard Richard say: \u201cYou found me, Bishop! I\u2019ll come up.\u201d He never missed another priesthood meeting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p26\" class=\"\">The family moved, and Richard moved with them. About a year later Bishop Arthur Spencer of the Wells Stake called and said that Richard was responding to a mission call to Mexico and asked if I would accept the family\u2019s invitation to speak at his farewell testimonial. At the meeting, when Richard responded, he mentioned that the turning point in his determination to fill a mission came one Sunday morning\u2014not in the chapel, but as he gazed up from the depths of a dark grease pit and found his quorum president\u2019s outstretched hand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood-pathway.p27\" class=\"\">John Barrie, the Scottish poet, declared: \u201cGod gave us memories, that we might have June roses in the December of our lives.\u201d From my experience, some of the most fragrant and beautiful roses anywhere to be found bloom in profusion along the Aaronic Priesthood pathway.
