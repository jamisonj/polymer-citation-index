A person who can testify to the truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is speaking of things he or she knows to be true. With the Lord and his true witnesses there is truth that reaches beyond worldly understanding. Paul understood this when he said: \u201cNow we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/witnesses.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cWhich things also we speak, not in the words which man\u2019s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"910\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 910)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(910)\">1 Cor. 2:12\u201313<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/witnesses.p7\" class=\"\">I was just a young boy when I sat in a stake conference in the Tooele Utah Stake, listening carefully to the visitor. He was LeGrand Richards, and he preached the gospel in his warm and spiritual way. That positive experience has stayed with me. I don\u2019t remember what he said, but I do know how I felt as he spoke. I learned later that I felt that way because I was listening to a special witness of Jesus Christ. I knew he knew, and somehow my roots grew deeper that day as to truths of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/witnesses.p8\" class=\"\">Orson Pratt said: \u201cA person can not be a witness to that which he merely believes.

There were no personal administrations of Christ to the unbelieving. Only to certain ones did the Lord open their eyes so they knew who he really was.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/witnesses.p10\" class=\"\">With the calling of the Twelve by the Savior there was instituted the calling of the special witnesses of Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/witnesses.p11\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph, referring to the resurrection of the Lord, said, \u201cGod raised Him from the dead, and we (the apostles) are His witnesses [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"8431\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8431)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8431)\">Acts 5:32<\/a><\/span>], \u2026 and so is the Holy Ghost, whom God ha[s] given to [all those who] obey Him\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 2:19).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/witnesses.p12\" class=\"\">Every person who receives baptism into the Church and has received and felt the confirmation of the Spirit through the gift of the Holy Ghost stands as a witness \u201cof God at all times and in all things, and in all places\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40943\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40943)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40943)\">Mosiah 18:9<\/a><\/span>). When partaking of the sacrament, that person renews that witness to take the Savior\u2019s name, keep his commandments, and remember him. A person so moved by the Spirit not only knows these things himself, but the Spirit carries them into the hearts of others. This is the basis of the Church\u2019s great missionary effort. \u201cFor when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4626\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4626)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4626)\">2 Ne. 33:1<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/witnesses.p13\" class=\"\">The witness of the Holy Ghost is even more compelling than the witness of sight.
