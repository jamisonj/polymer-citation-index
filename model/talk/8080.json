There I met Donna Smith. About that time I read that two essential ingredients to a successful marriage are a cookie and a kiss. I thought that was a pretty good balance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-plan-of-happiness.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">I attended college in the morning and then went back to Brigham City to work in my father\u2019s auto-repair garage in the afternoon. Donna\u2019s last morning class was home economics. I stopped by her classroom before leaving. The door had a frosted glass window, but if I stood close to the glass, she could see my shadow outside. She would slip out with a cookie and a kiss. The rest is history. We were married in the Logan Utah Temple, and that began the great adventure of our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-plan-of-happiness.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">Over the years I have frequently taught an important principle: the end of all activity in the Church is to see that a man and a woman with their children are happy at home, sealed together for time and for all eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-plan-of-happiness.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">In the beginning:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-plan-of-happiness.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">\u201cThe Gods went down to organize man in their own image, in the image of the Gods to form they him, male and female to form they them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-plan-of-happiness.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">\u201cAnd the Gods said: We will bless them.

It is essential to the plan of redemption and is the source of human happiness. Through the righteous exercise of this power, we may come close to our Father in Heaven and experience a fulness of joy, even godhood. The power of procreation is not an incidental part of the plan; it is the plan of happiness; it is the key to happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-plan-of-happiness.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">The desire to mate in humankind is constant and very strong. Our happiness in mortal life, our joy and exaltation are dependent upon how we respond to these persistent, compelling physical desires. As the procreative power matures in early manhood and womanhood, very personal feelings occur, in a natural way, unlike any other physical experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-plan-of-happiness.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">Ideally, mating begins with romance. Though customs may vary, it flourishes with all the storybook feelings of excitement and anticipation, even sometimes rejection. There are moonlight and roses, love letters, love songs, poetry, the holding of hands, and other expressions of affection between a young man and a young woman. The world disappears around the couple, and they experience feelings of joy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-plan-of-happiness.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">And if you suppose that the full-blown rapture of young romantic love is the sum total of the possibilities which spring from the fountains of life, you have not yet lived to see the devotion and the comfort of longtime married love. Married couples are tried by temptation, misunderstandings, financial problems, family crises, and illness, and all the while love grows stronger. Mature love has a bliss not even imagined by newlyweds.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-plan-of-happiness.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">True love requires reserving until after marriage the sharing of that affection which unlocks those sacred powers in that fountain of life. It means avoiding situations where physical desire might take control. Pure love presupposes that only after a pledge of eternal fidelity, a legal and lawful ceremony, and ideally after the sealing ordinance in the temple are those procreative powers released in God\u2019s eye for the full expression of love. It is to be shared solely and\u00a0only\u00a0with that one who is your companion forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-plan-of-happiness.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">When entered into worthily, this process combines the most exquisite and exalted physical, emotional, and spiritual feelings associated with the word <span class=\"emphasis\">love.<\/span> That part of life has no equal, no counterpart, in all human experience.

Love is nourished by the coming of children, who spring from that fountain of life entrusted to couples in marriage. Conception takes place in a wedded embrace between husband and wife. A tiny body begins to form after a pattern of magnificent complexity. A child comes forth in the miracle of birth, created in the image of its earthly father and mother. Within its mortal body is a spirit able to feel and perceive spiritual things. Dormant in that mortal body of this child is the power to beget offspring in its own image.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-plan-of-happiness.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">\u201cThe spirit and the body are the soul of man\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130486\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130486)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130486)\">D&amp;C 88:15<\/a><\/span>), and there are spiritual and physical laws to obey if we are to be happy.

When it comes to my wife, the mother of our children, I am without words. The feeling is so deep and the gratitude so powerful that I am left almost without expression. The greatest reward we have received in this life, and the life to come, is our children and our grandchildren. Toward the end of our mortal days together, I am grateful for each moment I am with her side by side and for the promise the Lord has given that there will be no end.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-plan-of-happiness.p33\" class=\"\" id=\"p33\">I bear witness that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God. He stands at the head of the Church. Through His Atonement and the power of the priesthood, families which are begun in mortality can be together through the eternities. The Atonement, which can reclaim each one of us, bears no scars. That means that no matter what we have done or where we have been or how something happened, if we truly repent, He has promised that He would atone. And when He atoned, that settled that. There are so many of us who are thrashing around, as it were, with feelings of guilt, not knowing quite how to escape. You escape by accepting the Atonement of Christ, and all that was heartache can turn to beauty and love and eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-plan-of-happiness.p34\" class=\"\" id=\"p34\">I am so grateful for the blessings of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the power of procreation, for the power of redemption, for the Atonement\u2014the Atonement which can wash clean every stain no matter how difficult or how long or how many times repeated.

The Atonement is individual, and if you have something that is bothering you\u2014sometimes so long ago you can hardly remember it\u2014put the Atonement to work. It will clean it up, and you, as does He, will remember your sins no more.
