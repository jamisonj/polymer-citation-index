The organization of the Church of Christ, known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in this day and age, is part of that restoration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/ye-shall-not-fear.p4\" class=\"\">On this day we reaffirm our conviction and testimony of that which transpired in the organization of the Church of Christ in this dispensation 141 years ago today. Upon that occasion, unto those who were assembled, the Lord referred to that which had already been accomplished in the restoration of the gospel through his servant Joseph Smith. Here are his words:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/ye-shall-not-fear.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd gave unto him commandments which inspired him;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/ye-shall-not-fear.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd gave him power from on high, by the means which were before prepared, to translate the Book of Mormon;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/ye-shall-not-fear.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cWhich contains a record of a fallen people, and the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles and to the Jews also;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/ye-shall-not-fear.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cWhich was given by inspiration, and is confirmed to others by the ministering of angels, and is declared unto the world by them\u2014<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/ye-shall-not-fear.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cProving to the world that the holy scriptures are true, and that God does inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/ye-shall-not-fear.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cThereby showing that he is the same God yesterday, today, and forever.

When completed, it will produce a welding together of all former dispensations, with their keys, principals, and intelligence down from the time of Adam.

In pondering the question I have often thought of three things. The first is observed in these words of the Lord: \u201cBut of that day, and hour, no one knoweth; no, not the angels of God in heaven, but my Father only.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30800\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30800)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30800)\">JS\u2014M 1:40<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/ye-shall-not-fear.p13\" class=\"\">There are signs, however, which indicate the nearness of this great event. For instance, and secondly, living in the last dispensation; we must be aware of the fact that there will not be another. It follows that all that God has intended for the redemption and salvation of man upon the earth through the gospel plan will culminate in this dispensation. Actually, the Lord identifies this present day, in particular, as a time of preparation. Here is the instruction he gave by revelation in the early days of the Church:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/ye-shall-not-fear.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cPray unto the Lord, call upon his holy name, make known his wonderful works among the people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/ye-shall-not-fear.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cCall upon the Lord, that his kingdom may go forth upon the earth, that the inhabitants thereof may receive it, and be prepared for the days to come, in the which the Son of Man shall come down in heaven, clothed in the brightness of his glory, to meet the kingdom of God which is set up on the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/ye-shall-not-fear.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, may the kingdom of God go forth, that the kingdom of heaven may come, that thou, O God, mayest be glorified in heaven so on earth, that thine enemies may be subdued; for thine is the honor, power and glory, forever and ever.
