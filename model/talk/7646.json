With this and other calls that followed, they found themselves moving from city to city, continent to continent during those years that plead for stability. The Lord has now richly blessed them with wonderful companions and choice children of their own. I want to thank them for their goodness and for their sacrifices in my behalf. I am also grateful for my faithful parents\u2014my mother is here today\u2014and for all those who have done so much for me throughout my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/come-unto-him.p15\" class=\"\">I express my deep respect and love for my Brethren of the Seventy.

I have learned from their integrity and righteousness. In these many years, I have never observed any unbridled anger, any desire for private or material gain. Never have I seen any personal positioning for influence or power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/come-unto-him.p17\" class=\"\">Rather, I have seen their loyalty and care for their wives and children. I have experienced their love and sure witness of our Heavenly Father and His Son. I have watched them untiringly seek first to build up the kingdom of God. I have seen the power of God rest upon them and magnify and sustain them. I have witnessed the fulfillment of their prophetic voice. I have seen the sick raised and nations blessed through their authority and have stood with them in moments too sacred to recount. I testify that they are the Lord\u2019s anointed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/come-unto-him.p18\" class=\"\">I pray that my spirit might be like that of Elder Joseph\u00a0B.

With faith and repentance they have stepped into the waters of baptism and firmly planted their feet in the rich gospel soil.
