I quote from this article: \u201cBeing a go-to-church Mormon in Utah means living so close to fellow ward members that not much happens that the entire congregation doesn\u2019t know about in five minutes tops.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p6\" class=\"\">He continues: \u201cThis kind of cheek-to-jowl living can be intrusive. \u2026 It also happens to be one of our greatest strengths.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p7\" class=\"\">The author goes on to say: \u201cAt work on Tuesday, I caught the noon news broadcast on television. A van had been obliterated in a traffic crash. A young mother and two small children were being rushed to emergency rooms by helicopter and ambulance. \u2026 Hours later I learned that the van belonged to the young couple living across the street from me in Herriman, Eric and Jeana Quigley.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cNot only do I see the Quigleys in church, \u2026 we ate dinner with them at a neighborhood party the night before the crash. Our grandkids played with daughters Bianca and Miranda. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cFourteen-month-old Miranda suffered serious head injuries and died three days later at Primary Children\u2019s Hospital.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cHere\u2019s where all that nosiness \u2026 pays off. Although the accident occurred several miles from home, the dust literally had not settled before someone from the ward stopped and was pulling through the wreckage. The rest of the ward knew about it before the cops and paramedics showed up.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cWard members went to all three hospitals, contacted Eric at work, and organized into labor squads. People who didn\u2019t get in on the immediate-need level were frantic for some way to help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cIn 48 hours, the Quigley yard was mowed, home cleaned, laundry done, refrigerator stocked, relatives fed and a trust fund set up at a local bank. We would have given their dog a bath if they had one.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p13\" class=\"\">The author concludes with this insightful comment: \u201cThere is a positive side to the congregational microscope my ward lives under. \u2026 What happens to a few happens to all\u201d (Robert Kirby, \u201cWell-Being of Others Is Our Business,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Salt Lake Tribune,<\/span> July 30, 2005, p. C1).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p14\" class=\"\">The compassion and service rendered by caring ward members as a result of this tragic accident are not unique to this particular incident. The Book of Mormon prophet Alma explained to prospective followers of Christ: \u201cAs ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another\u2019s burdens, that they may be light; yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort,\u201d then, as Alma explained, they were prepared for baptism (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51325\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51325)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51325)\">Mosiah 18:8\u20139<\/a><\/span>). This scripture lays the foundation for ministering and caring in a most compassionate way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p15\" class=\"\">The ward is organized to minister to the needs of those who face even the most difficult and heartbreaking trials. The bishop, often considered the \u201cfather\u201d of the ward, is there to provide counsel and resources. But also close at hand are Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood leaders, the Relief Society presidency, home teachers, visiting teachers, and the ward members\u2014always the ward members. All are there to administer comfort and show compassion in times of need.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p16\" class=\"\">In my own immediate neighborhood we have had our share of heart-wrenching tragedies. In October 1998, 19-year-old Zac Newton, who lived only three houses east of us, was killed in a tragic automobile accident.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p17\" class=\"\">Less than two years later, in July, 19-year-old Andrea Richards, who lived directly across from the Newtons, was killed in an automobile accident.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p18\" class=\"\">One Saturday afternoon in July 2006, Travis Bastian, a 28-year-old returned missionary, and his 15-year-old sister, Desiree, who lived across the street and two houses north of us, were killed in a terrible automobile accident.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p19\" class=\"\">One month later, in August 2006, 32-year-old Eric Gold, who grew up in the house next door to us, suffered a premature death. And others in this neighborhood have also suffered heart-wrenching experiences privately endured and known only to themselves and God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p20\" class=\"\">With the loss of five young people, one might assume that this is an unusual number of trials for one small neighborhood. I choose to think the number only seems large because of a close, caring ward, whose members know when there is a pressing need. It is a ward with members who are following the admonition of Alma and the Savior\u2014members who care and love and bear one another\u2019s burdens, members who are willing to mourn with those that mourn, members who are willing to comfort those in need of comfort, members who endure together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p21\" class=\"\">In each of these instances we saw an outpouring of love, service, and compassion that was inspirational to all. Bishops arrived, home and visiting teachers went into action, and Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood quorums and Relief Societies organized to take care of both spiritual and temporal needs. Refrigerators were stocked, houses cleaned, lawns mowed, shrubs trimmed, fences painted, blessings given, and soft shoulders were available for crying on. Members were everywhere.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/enduring-together.p22\" class=\"\">In every one of these instances, the families who lost a loved one expressed increased faith, increased love for the Savior, increased gratitude for the Atonement, and heartfelt thankfulness for an organization that responds to the deepest emotional and spiritual needs of its members. These families now speak about how they got to know the Lord through their adversity. They relate many sweet experiences that grew out of their pain. They testify that blessings can emerge from heartbreak. They give praise to the Lord and would echo the words of Job, \u201cThe Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"51084\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51084)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51084)\">Job 1:21<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">From bearing one another\u2019s burdens as ward members, we have learned several lessons:<\/p>\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Lord\u2019s organization is fully adequate to <span class=\"emphasis\">know<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">care for<\/span> those with even the most dire emotional and spiritual needs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Adversity <span class=\"emphasis\">can<\/span> bring us closer to God, with a renewed and enlightened appreciation for prayer and the Atonement, which covers pain and suffering in all their manifestations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Members who suffer tragedy firsthand often experience an increased capacity for love, compassion, and understanding.
