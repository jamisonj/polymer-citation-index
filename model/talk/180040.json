No, certainly not. These things too are so frequently alluded to that we cannot have any dubiety upon our minds in regard to the design of the Lord. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n1062\"> I have no doubt a great many changes have taken place upon our globe since that great change wrought <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"316b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD18\/JoD18_0316.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;316b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/6825\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> upon it at the time of the creation. There certainly was a great change wrought upon it then, for we are told that when the Lord organized the earth it was enveloped in a great ocean of water, there being no dry land in sight.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52073\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52073)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52073)\">Gen. 1:6-8<\/a><\/span> But the Lord, by his power and word, or, in other words, by his immutable laws, caused that the waters should be gathered together into one place, and hence the dry land appeared.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52078\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52078)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52078)\">Gen. 1:9<\/a><\/span> I do not suppose that this change was effected in the twinkling of an eye; I believe the Lord has certain established laws by which he accomplishes his wonderful works pertaining to all his creations. How long this submerged earth had an existence before the Lord commanded the great deep, that enveloped the whole surface of the same, to be removed, is not for me to say; no one can tell how many years, or thousands of years, or how many millions of years, this earth may have existed in the form of partial or imperfect organizations before this great event happened, of which Moses gives an account. The periods mentioned in the history, as recorded in the 1st chapter of Genesis,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52034\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52034)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52034)\">Gen. 1:1-31<\/a><\/span> are represented as beginning with the evening and ending with the morning. Seven such periods are mentioned. How long these periods, called days, were, I cannot tell; it is very evident they were not governed by the rotation of the earth on its axis, because the sun did not give light during the first three days or periods. It was on the fourth day that the Lord caused the light of the sun to shine upon this little speck of creation.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52101\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52101)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52101)\">Gen. 1:14-19<\/a><\/span> But there were three days prior to that, when the sun did not shine upon the earth.

The ocean seems to have been gathered by itself, when the dry land appeared,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52079\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52079)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52079)\">Gen. 1:9<\/a><\/span> and whether or not there were any islands at that period of our globe&#x2019;s history, we are not informed. You might inquire&#x2014;What has occasioned two great continents and two great oceans intervening between them, and how are we to account for the appearance of islands and seas as they now exist? These are the results of other changes since the days of the organization of this earth, as proclaimed by Moses. The flood, no doubt, produced some changes on the surface of our globe, but still I do not believe, for a moment, that it could have produced the changes we now see. So far as the location of the different islands and continents is concerned, we descend to a period since the flood. In the days of Peleg, we are told, the earth was divided.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52982\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52982)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52982)\">Gen. 10:25<\/a><\/span> This is a very short historical notice of a very marvelous event. If we had the whole account of this occurrence precisely as it transpired, it would certainly be extremely wonderful. Supposing that the one great antediluvian continent, which must have existed prior to that time, were to be divided by several thousand miles of water, would not that be a most wonderful event? <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n1065\"> It may be enquired, what natural laws could have performed such an event? I do not pretend to say that any regular, uniform laws exist by which it was accomplished; but there are laws, perhaps, that finite man does not comprehend and fully understand, which might occasion the division of the earth.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52983\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52983)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52983)\">Gen. 10:25<\/a><\/span> The Lord <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"317b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD18\/JoD18_0317.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;317b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/6824\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> has under his control all the laws of nature, whether uniform or not.

What causes water to find its level? It is the power of God, and nothing else. We give it the name of gravitation; but the power of gravitation is nothing more nor less than the power God exercises upon the elements, producing uniform laws. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n1066\"> Has the Lord no other laws in operation but the law of gravity? Yes, he can cause the law of gravity to be in subjection to other laws. For instance, a certain man was cutting down wood with the Prophet Elisha when his axe fell into deep water, to all appearance lost; and the man was somewhat exercised about it, because the axe was borrowed.

One may ask, What would hold them there? They now occupy the common level surface as near the center of gravity as they can, and sustain the centrifugal force exercised by the rotation of the earth on its axis. If they should be rolled back, whence they came; if a great equatorial continent, in one continuous belt, encircled the globe, and the two polar regions were covered with oceans, what would hold them in their position? It might be done without infringing particularly on the laws of gravitation. How easy it would be for the Lord to compress the polar regions of our globe, and cause the equatorial regions to rise higher, so as to balance the polar waters, and retain them in the arctic and antarctic regions. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n1072\"> It may be objected, that should such a condition exist, even though we should admit the power of God in thus dividing the waters, and giving us an equatorial continent, yet this would not protect the inhabitants of the equator from the burning heat of the sun, and it would be utterly impossible for the inhabitants of the earth to inhabit the equatorial region, if this should be the case. How easy it would be for the Lord to alter the position of the earth&#x2019;s axis, giving it a greater inclination to the plane of the ecliptic, so that the two tropics should extend thirty-five or forty degrees north and south of the equator. What effect would this have? It would have the effect of giving greater heat to the poles, and also of giving less heat to the equator. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n1073\"> The earth will be shaped into the form best adapted to the occupation of a higher order of beings.

In some portions of the earth we suffer extremes of heat and cold. The Laplander has guarded against this in his snow house, while the people of the torrid regions have to guard against intense heat. And there is much suffering by the inhabitants of the earth, in their present state of mortality, from the extremes of heat and cold. But in relation to the great event I have named, I have no doubt but what every motion and arrangement that the Lord will cause to take place upon the surface of our globe, will have a tendency to prepare it for the habitation of beings of a higher order of intelligence than those who now occupy it. In testimony of this, we will refer you to some few passages of Scripture. The inhabitants of the heavens, who now reside in the presence of God the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ, do not always expect to reside there; they have anticipations as well as we. And they expect to receive another place or location than where they now reside.
